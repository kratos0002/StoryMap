# StoryMap - MVP Requirements

## Project Vision
To build a mobile-first, intuitive website that hosts short stories from around the world, making global narratives accessible, shareable, and enjoyable for modern readers on the go.

## Core Concept
- Short stories (max 5–10 mins read) drawn from oral traditions, folk tales, myths, and contemporary voices
- Geographically anchored — each story can be tagged to a specific place
- Readers can explore stories by location (interactive map), theme, or language

## MVP Features

### 1. Static List of Curated Stories (10-15 max)
- Each story will include:
  - Title
  - Author/Source
  - Country/Region of origin
  - Geographic coordinates for map placement
  - Estimated reading time
  - Theme tags (e.g., Mythical, Historical, Contemporary)
  - Mood indicators
  - Full story text with proper formatting
  - Brief cultural context or author notes

### 2. Interactive Map Interface
- Visual map with clickable pins for each story location
- Responsive design that works well on mobile devices
- Ability to zoom and pan the map
- Visual indicators for story pins (potentially color-coded by theme)
- Smooth transitions between map view and story reading mode

### 3. Mobile-Optimized Story Reading Experience
- Clean, distraction-free reading interface
- Adjustable text settings (font size, dark/light mode)
- Easy navigation back to map or story list
- Story metadata displayed in a non-intrusive manner
- Optimized for various mobile screen sizes

### 4. Explore & Filter Functionality
- Filter stories by:
  - Geographic region
  - Theme/category
  - Reading time
  - Language (if multilingual stories are included in MVP)
- Simple search functionality

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- React-based single-page application
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Content Management

- Easily extensible for future backend integration

### Deployment

- Deployed on Vercel for reliable hosting

## Design Goals
- Mobile-first, fast-loading interface
- Optimized for quick reading and curious browsing

- Visual design inspired by platforms like Vox Atlas, Atlas Obscura, and Scrollstack

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
