      simulate sounds, so afraid are they that their voices might escape.

“In the hotel, the same silence. It is a big hotel, where you dine
      solemnly with people of good position, who have nothing to say to each
      other. Their manners bespeak good breeding, and their faces reflect the
      conviction of a superiority of which it might be difficult for some to
      give actual proofs.

“At two o''clock I made my way up to the Casino, a little wooden hut
      perched on a hillock, which one reaches by a goat path. But the view from
      that height is admirable. Chatel-Guyon is situated in a very narrow
      valley, exactly between the plain and the mountain. I perceive, at the
      left, the first great billows of the mountains of Auvergne, covered with
      woods, and here and there big gray patches, hard masses of lava, for we
      are at the foot of the extinct volcanoes. At the right, through the narrow
      cut of the valley, I discover a plain, infinite as the sea, steeped in a
      bluish fog which lets one only dimly discern the villages, the towns, the
      yellow fields of ripe grain, and the green squares of meadowland shaded
      with apple trees. It is the Limagne, an immense level, always enveloped in
      a light veil of vapor.

“The night has come. And now, after having dined alone, I write
      these lines beside my open window. I hear, over there, in front of me, the
      little orchestra of the Casino, which plays airs just as a foolish bird
      might sing all alone in the desert.

“July 16th.—Nothing new. I have taken a bath and then a shower
      bath. I have swallowed three glasses of water, and I have walked along the
      paths in the park, a quarter of an hour between each glass, then half an
      hour after the last. I have begun my twenty-five days.

“July 17th.—Remarked two mysterious, pretty women who are
      taking their baths and their meals after every one else has finished.

“July 19th.—Saw the two pretty women again. They have style
      and a little indescribable air which I like very much.

“July 20th.—Long walk in a charming wooded valley, as far as
      the Hermitage of Sans-Souci. This country is delightful, although sad; but
      so calm; so sweet, so green. One meets along the mountain roads long
      wagons loaded with hay, drawn by two cows at a slow pace or held back by
      them in going down the slopes with a great effort of their heads, which
      are yoked together. A man with a big black hat on his head is driving them
      with a slender stick, tipping them on the side or on the forehead; and
      often with a simple gesture, an energetic and serious gesture, he suddenly
      halts them when the excessive load precipitates their journey down the too
      rugged descents.

“The air is good to inhale in these valleys. And, if it is very
      warm, the dust bears with it a light odor of vanilla and of the stable,
      for so many cows pass over these routes that they leave reminders
      everywhere. And this odor is a perfume, when it would be a stench if it
      came from other animals.

“July 21st.—Excursion to the valley of the Enval. It is a
      narrow gorge inclosed by superb rocks at the very foot of the mountain. A
      stream flows amid the heaped-up boulders.

“As I reached the bottom of this ravine I heard women''s voices, and
      I soon perceived the two mysterious ladies of my hotel, who were chatting,
      seated on a stone.

“The occasion appeared to me a good one, and I introduced myself
      without hesitation. My overtures were received without embarrassment. We
      walked back together to the hotel. And we talked about Paris. They knew,
      it seemed, many people whom I knew, too. Who can they be?

“July 22d.—Day passed almost entirely with the two unknown
      ladies. They are very pretty, by Jove!—one a brunette and the other
      a blonde. They say they are widows. H''m?

“July 23d.—Day spent at Royat. Royat is a little patch of
      hotels at the bottom of a valley, at the gate of Clermont-Ferrand. A great
      many people there. A large park full of life. Superb view of the
      Puyde-Dome, seen at the end of a perspective of valleys.

“My fair companions are very popular, which is flattering to me. The
      man who escorts a pretty woman always believes himself crowned with an
      aureole; with much more reason, the man who is accompanied by one on each
      side of him. Nothing is so pleasant as to dine in a fashionable restaurant
      with a female companion at whom everybody stares, and there is nothing
      better calculated to exalt a man in the estimation of his neighbors.

“To go to the Bois, in a trap drawn by a sorry nag, or to go out
      into the boulevard escorted by a plain woman, are the two most humiliating
      things that could happen to a sensitive heart that values the opinion of
      others. Of all luxuries, woman is the rarest and the most distinguished;
      she is the one that costs most and which we desire most; she is, therefore
      the one that we should seek by preference to exhibit to the jealous eyes
      of the world.

“To exhibit to the world a pretty woman leaning on your arm is to
      excite, all at once, every kind of jealousy. It is as much as to say:
      ''Look here! I am rich, since I possess this rare and costly object; I have
      taste, since I have known how to discover this pearl; perhaps, even, I am
      loved by her, unless I am deceived by her, which would still prove that
      others also consider her charming.

“In the first place, they assume she must be your wife, for how
      could it be supposed that you would have an unattractive sweetheart? A
      true woman may be ungraceful; but then, her ugliness implies a thousand
      disagreeable things for you. One supposes you must be a notary or a
      magistrate, as these two professions have a monopoly of grotesque and
      well-dowered spouses. Now, is this not distressing to a man? And then, it
      seems to proclaim to the public that you have the odious courage, and are
      even under a legal obligation, to caress that ridiculous face and that
      ill-shaped body, and that you will, without doubt, be shameless enough to
      make a mother of this by no means desirable being—which is the very
      height of the ridiculous.

“July 24th.—I never leave the side of the two unknown widows,
      whom I am beginning to know quite well. This country is delightful and our
      hotel is excellent. Good season. The treatment is doing me an immense
      amount of good.

“July 25th.—Drive in a landau to the lake of Tazenat. An
      exquisite and unexpected jaunt decided on at luncheon. We started
      immediately on rising from table. After a long journey through the
      mountains we suddenly perceived an admirable little lake, quite round,
      very blue, clear as glass, and situated at the bottom of an extinct
      crater. One side of this immense basin is barren, the other is wooded. In
      the midst of the trees is a small house where sleeps a good-natured,
      intellectual man, a sage who passes his days in this Virgilian region. He
      opens his dwelling for us. An idea comes into my head. I exclaim:

“If I were a poet, how I would describe this unforgettable vision of
      those lissome young forms in the transparency of the water! The high,
      sloping sides shut in the lake, motionless, gleaming and round, as a
      silver coin; the sun pours into it a flood of warm light; and along the
      rocks the fair forms move in the almost invisible water in which the
      swimmers seemed suspended. On the sand at the bottom of the lake one could
      see their shadows as they moved along.

“July 26th.—Some persons seem to look with shocked and
      disapproving eyes at my rapid intimacy with the two fair widows. There are
      some people, then, who imagine that life consists in being bored.
      Everything that appears to be amusing becomes immediately a breach of good
      breeding or morality. For them duty has inflexible and mortally tedious
      rules.

“I would draw their attention, with all respect, to the fact that
      duty is not the same for Mormons, Arabs Zulus, Turks, Englishmen, and
      Frenchmen, and that there are very virtuous people among all these
      nations.

“I will cite a single example. As regards women, duty begins in
      England at nine years of age; in France at fifteen. As for me, I take a
      little of each people''s notion of duty, and of the whole I make a result
      comparable to the morality of good King Solomon.

“July 27th.—Good news. I have lost 620 grams in weight.
      Excellent, this water of Chatel-Guyon! I am taking the widows to dine at
      Riom. A sad town whose anagram constitutes it an objectionable neighbor to
      healing springs: Riom, Mori.

“July 28th.—Hello, how''s this! My two widows have been visited
      by two gentlemen who came to look for them. Two widowers, without doubt.
      They are leaving this evening. They have written to me on fancy notepaper.

“July 31st.—Ditto. Ditto. This pretty country is full of
      polluted streams. I am drawing the notice of the municipality to the
      abominable sewer which poisons the road in front of the hotel. All the
      kitchen refuse of the establishment is thrown into it. This is a good way
      to breed cholera.

“August 2d.—Admirable walk to Chateauneuf, a place of sojourn
      for rheumatic patients, where everybody is lame. Nothing can be queerer
      than this population of cripples!

“August 7th.—Drove sixty-six kilometres in a carriage on the
      mountain. I will not mention the name of the country through respect for
      its women.

“This excursion had been pointed out to me as a beautiful one, and
      one that was rarely made. After four hours on the road, I arrived at a
      rather pretty village on the banks of a river in the midst of an admirable
      wood of walnut trees. I had not yet seen a forest of walnut trees of such
      dimensions in Auvergne. It constitutes, moreover, all the wealth of the
      district, for it is planted on the village common. This common was
      formerly only a hillside covered with brushwood. The authorities had tried
      in vain to get it cultivated. There was scarcely enough pasture on it to
      feed a few sheep.

“To-day it is a superb wood, thanks to the women, and it has a
      curious name: it is called the Sins of the Cure.

“Now I must say that the women of the mountain districts have the
      reputation of being light, lighter than in the plain. A bachelor who meets
      them owes them at least a kiss; and if he does not take more he is only a
      blockhead. If we consider this fairly, this way of looking at the matter
      is the only one that is logical and reasonable. As woman, whether she be
      of the town or the country, has her natural mission to please man, man
      should always show her that she pleases him. If he abstains from every
      sort of demonstration, this means that he considers her ugly; it is almost
      an insult to her. If I were a woman, I would not receive, a second time, a
      man who failed to show me respect at our first meeting, for I would
      consider that he had failed in appreciation of my beauty, my charm, and my
      feminine qualities.

“So the bachelors of the village X often proved to the women of the
      district that they found them to their taste, and, as the cure was unable
      to prevent these demonstrations, as gallant as they were natural, he
      resolved to utilize them for the benefit of the general prosperity. So he
      imposed as a penance on every woman who had gone wrong that she should
      plant a walnut tree on the common. And every night lanterns were seen
      moving about like will-o''-the-wisps on the hillock, for the erring ones
      scarcely like to perform their penance in broad daylight.

“In two years there was no longer any room on the lands belonging to
      the village, and to-day they calculate that there are more than three
      thousand trees around the belfry which rings out the services amid their
      foliage. These are the Sins of the Cure.

“Since we have been seeking for so many ways of rewooding France,
      the Administration of Forests might surely enter into some arrangement
      with the clergy to employ a method so simple as that employed by this
      humble cure.

“August 8th.—I am packing up my trunks and saying good-by to
      the charming little district so calm and silent, to the green mountain, to
      the quiet valleys, to the deserted Casino, from which you can see, almost
      veiled by its light, bluish mist, the immense plain of the Limagne.

Here the manuscript stopped. I will add nothing to it, my impressions of
      the country not having been exactly the same as those of my predecessor.
      For I did not find the two widows!

You say you cannot possibly understand it, and I believe you. You think I
      am losing my mind? Perhaps I am, but for other reasons than those you
      imagine, my dear friend.

I may add that I know very little of the girl who is going to become my
      wife to-morrow; I have only seen her four or five times. I know that there
      is nothing unpleasing about her, and that is enough for my purpose. She is
      small, fair, and stout; so, of course, the day after to-morrow I shall
      ardently wish for a tall, dark, thin woman.

She is not rich, and belongs to the middle classes. She is a girl such as
      you may find by the gross, well adapted for matrimony, without any
      apparent faults, and with no particularly striking qualities. People say
      of her:

“Mlle. Lajolle is a very nice girl,” and tomorrow they will
      say: “What a very nice woman Madame Raymon is.” She belongs,
      in a word, to that immense number of girls whom one is glad to have for
      one''s wife, till the moment comes when one discovers that one happens to
      prefer all other women to that particular woman whom one has married.

I hardly like to tell you the strange and seemingly improbable reason that
      urged me on to this senseless act; the fact, however, is that I am afraid
      of being alone.

I don''t know how to tell you or to make you understand me, but my state of
      mind is so wretched that you will pity me and despise me.

I do not want to be alone any longer at night. I want to feel that there
      is some one close to me, touching me, a being who can speak and say
      something, no matter what it be.

I wish to be able to awaken somebody by my side, so that I may be able to
      ask some sudden question, a stupid question even, if I feel inclined, so
      that I may hear a human voice, and feel that there is some waking soul
      close to me, some one whose reason is at work; so that when I hastily
      light the candle I may see some human face by my side—because—because
      —I am ashamed to confess it—because I am afraid of being
      alone.

I am not afraid of any danger; if a man were to come into the room, I
      should kill him without trembling. I am not afraid of ghosts, nor do I
      believe in the supernatural. I am not afraid of dead people, for I believe
      in the total annihilation of every being that disappears from the face of
      this earth.

Well—yes, well, it must be told: I am afraid of myself, afraid of
      that horrible sensation of incomprehensible fear.

You may laugh, if you like. It is terrible, and I cannot get over it. I am
      afraid of the walls, of the furniture, of the familiar objects; which are
      animated, as far as I am concerned, by a kind of animal life. Above all, I
      am afraid of my own dreadful thoughts, of my reason, which seems as if it
      were about to leave me, driven away by a mysterious and invisible agony.

At first I feel a vague uneasiness in my mind, which causes a cold shiver
      to run all over me. I look round, and of course nothing is to be seen, and
      I wish that there were something there, no matter what, as long as it were
      something tangible. I am frightened merely because I cannot understand my
      own terror.

If I speak, I am afraid of my own voice. If I walk, I am afraid of I know
      not what, behind the door, behind the curtains, in the cupboard, or under
      my bed, and yet all the time I know there is nothing anywhere, and I turn
      round suddenly because I am afraid of what is behind me, although there is
      nothing there, and I know it.

I become agitated. I feel that my fear increases, and so I shut myself up
      in my own room, get into bed, and hide under the clothes; and there,
      cowering down, rolled into a ball, I close my eyes in despair, and remain
      thus for an indefinite time, remembering that my candle is alight on the
      table by my bedside, and that I ought to put it out, and yet—I dare
      not do it.

Formerly I felt nothing of all that. I came home quite calm, and went up
      and down my apartment without anything disturbing my peace of mind. Had
      any one told me that I should be attacked by a malady—for I can call
      it nothing else—of most improbable fear, such a stupid and terrible
      malady as it is, I should have laughed outright. I was certainly never
      afraid of opening the door in the dark. I went to bed slowly, without
      locking it, and never got up in the middle of the night to make sure that
      everything was firmly closed.

It began last year in a very strange manner on a damp autumn evening. When
      my servant had left the room, after I had dined, I asked myself what I was
      going to do. I walked up and down my room for some time, feeling tired
      without any reason for it, unable to work, and even without energy to
      read. A fine rain was falling, and I felt unhappy, a prey to one of those
      fits of despondency, without any apparent cause, which make us feel
      inclined to cry, or to talk, no matter to whom, so as to shake off our
      depressing thoughts.

I felt that I was alone, and my rooms seemed to me to be more empty than
      they had ever been before. I was in the midst of infinite and overwhelming
      solitude. What was I to do? I sat down, but a kind of nervous impatience
      seemed to affect my legs, so I got up and began to walk about again. I
      was, perhaps, rather feverish, for my hands, which I had clasped behind
      me, as one often does when walking slowly, almost seemed to burn one
      another. Then suddenly a cold shiver ran down my back, and I thought the
      damp air might have penetrated into my rooms, so I lit the fire for the
      first time that year, and sat down again and looked at the flames. But
      soon I felt that I could not possibly remain quiet, and so I got up again
      and determined to go out, to pull myself together, and to find a friend to
      bear me company.

I could not find anyone, so I walked to the boulevard to try and meet some
      acquaintance or other there.

It was wretched everywhere, and the wet pavement glistened in the
      gaslight, while the oppressive warmth of the almost impalpable rain lay
      heavily over the streets and seemed to obscure the light of the lamps.

I glanced into several cafes, from the Madeleine as far as the Faubourg
      Poissoniere, and saw many unhappy-looking individuals sitting at the
      tables who did not seem even to have enough energy left to finish the
      refreshments they had ordered.

For a long time I wandered aimlessly up and down, and about midnight I
      started for home. I was very calm and very tired. My janitor opened the
      door at once, which was quite unusual for him, and I thought that another
      lodger had probably just come in.

When I go out I always double-lock the door of my room, and I found it
      merely closed, which surprised me; but I supposed that some letters had
      been brought up for me in the course of the evening.

I went in, and found my fire still burning so that it lighted up the room
      a little, and, while in the act of taking up a candle, I noticed somebody
      sitting in my armchair by the fire, warming his feet, with his back toward
      me.

I was not in the slightest degree frightened. I thought, very naturally,
      that some friend or other had come to see me. No doubt the porter, to whom
      I had said I was going out, had lent him his own key. In a moment I
      remembered all the circumstances of my return, how the street door had
      been opened immediately, and that my own door was only latched and not
      locked.

I could see nothing of my friend but his head, and he had evidently gone
      to sleep while waiting for me, so I went up to him to rouse him. I saw him
      quite distinctly; his right arm was hanging down and his legs were
      crossed; the position of his head, which was somewhat inclined to the left
      of the armchair, seemed to indicate that he was asleep. “Who can it
      be?” I asked myself. I could not see clearly, as the room was rather
      dark, so I put out my hand to touch him on the shoulder, and it came in
      contact with the back of the chair. There was nobody there; the seat was
      empty.

I fairly jumped with fright. For a moment I drew back as if confronted by
      some terrible danger; then I turned round again, impelled by an imperious
      standing upright, panting with fear, so upset that I could not collect my
      thoughts, and ready to faint.

But I am a cool man, and soon recovered myself. I thought: “It is a
      mere hallucination, that is all,” and I immediately began to reflect
      on this phenomenon. Thoughts fly quickly at such moments.

I had been suffering from an hallucination, that was an incontestable
      fact. My mind had been perfectly lucid and had acted regularly and
      logically, so there was nothing the matter with the brain. It was only my
      eyes that had been deceived; they had had a vision, one of those visions
      which lead simple folk to believe in miracles. It was a nervous seizure of
      the optical apparatus, nothing more; the eyes were rather congested,
      perhaps.

I lit my candle, and when I stooped down to the fire in doing so I noticed
      that I was trembling, and I raised myself up with a jump, as if somebody
      had touched me from behind.

I walked up and down a little, and hummed a tune or two. Then I
      double-locked the door and felt rather reassured; now, at any rate, nobody
      could come in.

I sat down again and thought over my adventure for a long time; then I
      went to bed and blew out my light.

For some minutes all went well; I lay quietly on my back, but presently an
      irresistible desire seized me to look round the room, and I turned over on
      my side.

My fire was nearly out, and the few glowing embers threw a faint light on
      the floor by the chair, where I fancied I saw the man sitting again.

I quickly struck a match, but I had been mistaken; there was nothing
      there. I got up, however, and hid the chair behind my bed, and tried to
      get to sleep, as the room was now dark; but I had not forgotten myself for
      more than five minutes, when in my dream I saw all the scene which I had
      previously witnessed as clearly as if it were reality. I woke up with a
      start, and having lit the candle, sat up in bed, without venturing even to
      try to go to sleep again.

Twice, however, sleep overcame me for a few moments in spite of myself,
      and twice I saw the same thing again, till I fancied I was going mad. When
      day broke, however, I thought that I was cured, and slept peacefully till
      noon.

It was all past and over. I had been feverish, had had the nightmare. I
      know not what. I had been ill, in fact, but yet thought I was a great
      fool.

I enjoyed myself thoroughly that evening. I dined at a restaurant and
      afterward went to the theatre, and then started for home. But as I got
      near the house I was once more seized by a strange feeling of uneasiness.
      I was afraid of seeing him again. I was not afraid of him, not afraid of
      his presence, in which I did not believe; but I was afraid of being
      deceived again. I was afraid of some fresh hallucination, afraid lest fear
      should take possession of me.

For more than an hour I wandered up and down the pavement; then, feeling
      that I was really too foolish, I returned home. I breathed so hard that I
      could hardly get upstairs, and remained standing outside my door for more
      than ten minutes; then suddenly I had a courageous impulse and my will
      asserted itself. I inserted my key into the lock, and went into the
      apartment with a candle in my hand. I kicked open my bedroom door, which
      was partly open, and cast a frightened glance toward the fireplace. There
      was nothing there. A-h! What a relief and what a delight! What a
      deliverance! I walked up and down briskly and boldly, but I was not
      altogether reassured, and kept turning round with a jump; the very shadows
      in the corners disquieted me.

I slept badly, and was constantly disturbed by imaginary noises, but did
      not see him; no, that was all over.

Since that time I have been afraid of being alone at night. I feel that
      the spectre is there, close to me, around me; but it has not appeared to
      me again.

And supposing it did, what would it matter, since I do not believe in it,
      and know that it is nothing?

However, it still worries me, because I am constantly thinking of it. His
      right arm hanging down and his head inclined to the left like a man who
      was asleep—I don''t want to think about it!

He haunts me; it is very stupid, but who and what is he? I know that he
      does not exist except in my cowardly imagination, in my fears, and in my
      agony. There—enough of that!

Yes, it is all very well for me to reason with myself, to stiffen my
      backbone, so to say; but I cannot remain at home because I know he is
      there. I know I shall not see him again; he will not show himself again;
      that is all over. But he is there, all the same, in my thoughts. He
      remains invisible, but that does not prevent his being there. He is behind
      the doors, in the closed cupboard, in the wardrobe, under the bed, in
      every dark corner. If I open the door or the cupboard, if I take the
      candle to look under the bed and throw a light on the dark places he is
      there no longer, but I feel that he is behind me. I turn round, certain
      that I shall not see him, that I shall never see him again; but for all
      that, he is behind me.

But if there were two of us in the place I feel certain that he would not
      be there any longer, for he is there just because I am alone, simply and
      solely because I am alone!

I had first seen it from Cancale, this fairy castle in the sea. I got an
      indistinct impression of it as of a gray shadow outlined against the misty
      sky. I saw it again from Avranches at sunset. The immense stretch of sand
      was red, the horizon was red, the whole boundless bay was red. The rocky
      castle rising out there in the distance like a weird, seignorial
      residence, like a dream palace, strange and beautiful-this alone remained
      black in the crimson light of the dying day.

The following morning at dawn I went toward it across the sands, my eyes
      fastened on this, gigantic jewel, as big as a mountain, cut like a cameo,
      and as dainty as lace. The nearer I approached the greater my admiration
      grew, for nothing in the world could be more wonderful or more perfect.

As surprised as if I had discovered the habitation of a god, I wandered
      through those halls supported by frail or massive columns, raising my eyes
      in wonder to those spires which looked like rockets starting for the sky,
      and to that marvellous assemblage of towers, of gargoyles, of slender and
      charming ornaments, a regular fireworks of stone, granite lace, a
      masterpiece of colossal and delicate architecture.

As I was looking up in ecstasy a Lower Normandy peasant came up to me and
      told me the story of the great quarrel between Saint Michael and the
      devil.

This saying is an eternal truth, and it would be very curious to write the
      history of the local divinity of every continent as well as the history of
      the patron saints in each one of our provinces. The negro has his
      ferocious man-eating idols; the polygamous Mahometan fills his paradise
      with women; the Greeks, like a practical people, deified all the passions.

Every village in France is under the influence of some protecting saint,
      modelled according to the characteristics of the inhabitants.

Saint Michael watches over Lower Normandy, Saint Michael, the radiant and
      victorious angel, the sword-carrier, the hero of Heaven, the victorious,
      the conqueror of Satan.

But this is how the Lower Normandy peasant, cunning, deceitful and tricky,
      understands and tells of the struggle between the great saint and the
      devil.

To escape from the malice of his neighbor, the devil, Saint Michael built
      himself, in the open ocean, this habitation worthy of an archangel; and
      only such a saint could build a residence of such magnificence.

But as he still feared the approaches of the wicked one, he surrounded his
      domains by quicksands, more treacherous even than the sea.

The devil lived in a humble cottage on the hill, but he owned all the salt
      marshes, the rich lands where grow the finest crops, the wooded valleys
      and all the fertile hills of the country, while the saint  ruled only
      over the sands. Therefore Satan was rich, whereas Saint Michael was as
      poor as a church mouse.

After a few years of fasting the saint grew tired of this state of affairs
      and began to think of some compromise with the devil, but the matter was
      by no means easy, as Satan kept a good hold on his crops.

He thought the thing over for about six months; then one morning he walked
      across to the shore. The demon was eating his soup in front of his door
      when he saw the saint. He immediately rushed toward him, kissed the hem of
      his sleeve, invited him in and offered him refreshments.

Saint Michael drank a bowl of milk and then began: “I have come here
      to propose to you a good bargain.”

The saint continued: “Listen first. Give me all your lands. I will
      take care of all the work, the ploughing, the sowing, the fertilizing,
      everything, and we will share the crops equally. How does that suit you?”

The devil, who was naturally lazy, accepted. He only demanded in addition
      a few of those delicious gray mullet which are caught around the solitary
      mount. Saint Michael promised the fish.

They grasped hands and spat on the ground to show that it was a bargain,
      and the saint continued: “See here, so that you will have nothing to
      complain of, choose that part of the crops which you prefer: the part that
      grows above ground or the part that stays in the ground.” Satan
      cried out: “I will take all that will be above ground.”

Six months later, all over the immense domain of the devil, one could see
      nothing but carrots, turnips, onions, salsify, all the plants whose juicy
      roots are good and savory and whose useless leaves are good for nothing
      but for feeding animals.

But the saint, who had developed quite a taste for agriculture, went back
      to see the devil and said:

“Really, I hadn''t thought of that at all; it was just an accident,
      no fault of mine. And to make things fair with you, this year I''ll let you
      take everything that is under the ground.”

The following spring all the evil spirit''s lands were covered with golden
      wheat, oats as big as beans, flax, magnificent colza, red clover, peas,
      cabbage, artichokes, everything that develops into grains or fruit in the
      sunlight.

Once more Satan received nothing, and this time he completely lost his
      temper. He took back his fields and remained deaf to all the fresh
      propositions of his neighbor.

A whole year rolled by. From the top of his lonely manor Saint Michael
      looked at the distant and fertile lands and watched the devil direct the
      work, take in his crops and thresh the wheat. And he grew angry,
      exasperated at his powerlessness.

As he was no longer able to deceive Satan, he decided to wreak vengeance
      on him, and he went out to invite him to dinner for the following Monday.

“You have been very unfortunate in your dealings with me,” he
      said; “I know it, but I don''t want any ill feeling between us, and I
      expect you to dine with me. I''ll give you some good things to eat.”

Satan, who was as greedy as he was lazy, accepted eagerly. On the day
      appointed he donned his finest clothes and set out for the castle.

Saint Michael sat him down to a magnificent meal. First there was a
      ''vol-au-vent'', full of cocks'' crests and kidneys, with meat-balls, then
      two big gray mullet with cream sauce, a turkey stuffed with chestnuts
      soaked in wine, some salt-marsh lamb as tender as cake, vegetables which
      melted in the mouth and nice hot pancake which was brought on smoking and
      spreading a delicious odor of butter.

They drank new, sweet, sparkling cider and heady red wine, and after each
      course they whetted their appetites with some old apple brandy.

The devil drank and ate to his heart''s content; in fact he took so much
      that he was very uncomfortable, and began to retch.

Then Saint Michael arose in anger and cried in a voice like thunder:
      “What! before me, rascal! You dare—before me—”

Satan, terrified, ran away, and the saint, seizing a stick, pursued him.
      They ran through the halls, turning round the pillars, running up the
      staircases, galloping along the cornices, jumping from gargoyle to
      gargoyle. The poor devil, who was woefully ill, was running about madly
      and trying hard to escape. At last he found himself at the top of the last
      terrace, right at the top, from which could be seen the immense bay, with
      its distant towns, sands and pastures. He could no longer escape, and the
      saint came up behind him and gave him a furious kick, which shot him
      through space like a cannonball.

He shot through the air like a javelin and fell heavily before the town of
      Mortain. His horns and claws stuck deep into the rock, which keeps through
      eternity the traces of this fall of Satan.

He stood up again, limping, crippled until the end of time, and as he
      looked at this fatal castle in the distance, standing out against the
      setting sun, he understood well that he would always be vanquished in this
      unequal struggle, and he went away limping, heading for distant countries,
      leaving to his enemy his fields, his hills, his valleys and his marshes.

Jacques de Randal, having dined at home alone, told his valet he might go
      out, and he sat down at his table to write some letters.

He ended every year in this manner, writing and dreaming. He reviewed the
      events of his life since last New Year''s Day, things that were now all
      over and dead; and, in proportion as the faces of his friends rose up
      before his eyes, he wrote them a few lines, a cordial New Year''s greeting
      on the first of January.

So he sat down, opened a drawer, took out of it a woman''s photograph,
      gazed at it a few moments, and kissed it. Then, having laid it beside a
      sheet of notepaper, he began:

For the last ten months he had had a sweetheart, not like the others, a
      woman with whom one engages in a passing intrigue, of the theatrical world
      or the demi-monde, but a woman whom he loved and won. He was no longer a
      young man, although he was still comparatively young for a man, and he
      looked on life seriously in a positive and practical spirit.

Accordingly, he drew up the balance sheet of his passion, as he drew up
      every year the balance sheet of friendships that were ended or freshly
      contracted, of circumstances and persons that had entered into his life.

His first ardor of love having grown calmer, he asked himself with the
      precision of a merchant making a calculation what was the state of his
      heart with regard to her, and he tried to form an idea of what it would be
      in the future.

He found there a great and deep affection; made up of tenderness,
      gratitude and the thousand subtleties which give birth to long and
      powerful attachments.

A ring at the bell made him start. He hesitated. Should he open the door?
      But he said to himself that one must always open the door on New Year''s
      night, to admit the unknown who is passing by and knocks, no matter who it
      may be.

So he took a wax candle, passed through the antechamber, drew back the
      bolts, turned the key, pulled the door back, and saw his sweetheart
      standing pale as a corpse, leaning against the wall.

She entered with the air of a woman who knew the house. As soon as she was
      in the drawing-room, she sank down on the sofa, and, covering her face
      with her hands, began to weep bitterly.

He knelt down at her feet, and tried to remove her hands from her eyes, so
      that he might look at them, and exclaimed:

“Irene, Irene, what is the matter with you? I implore you to tell me
      what is the matter with you?”

He was astonished, having never suspected that her husband could be
      brutal. He was a man of the world, of the better class, a clubman, a lover
      of horses, a theatergoer and an expert swordsman; he was known, talked
      about, appreciated everywhere, having very courteous manners, a very
      mediocre intellect, an absence of education and of the real culture needed
      in order to think like all well-bred people, and finally a respect for
      conventionalities.

He appeared to devote himself to his wife, as a man ought to do in the
      case of wealthy and well-bred people. He displayed enough of anxiety about
      her wishes, her health, her dresses, and, beyond that, left her perfectly
      free.

Randal, having become Irene''s friend, had a right to the affectionate
      hand-clasp which every husband endowed with good manners owes to his
      wife''s intimate acquaintance. Then, when Jacques, after having been for
      some time the friend, became the lover, his relations with the husband
      were more cordial, as is fitting.

Jacques had never dreamed that there were storms in this household, and he
      was bewildered at this unexpected revelation.

Thereupon she related a long story, the entire history of her life since
      the day of her marriage, the first disagreement arising out of a mere
      nothing, then becoming accentuated at every new difference of opinion
      between two dissimilar dispositions.

Then came quarrels, a complete separation, not apparent, but real; next,
      her husband showed himself aggressive, suspicious, violent. Now, he was
      jealous, jealous of Jacques, and that very day, after a scene, he had
      struck her.

“My dear love, you are going to commit a gross, an irreparable
      folly. If you want to leave your husband, put him in the wrong, so that
      your position as a woman of the world may be saved.”

“To go back home and to put up with your life there till the day
      when you can obtain either a separation or a divorce, with the honors of
      war.”

“No; it is wise and sensible. You have a high position, a reputation
      to protect, friends to preserve and relations to deal with. You must not
      lose all these through a mere caprice.”

Then, placing her two hands on her lover''s shoulders, and looking him
      straight in the face, she asked:

“Take care of you? In my own house? Here? Why, you are mad. It would
      mean losing you forever; losing you beyond hope of recall! You are mad!”

“Listen, Jacques. He has forbidden me to see you again, and I will
      not play this comedy of coming secretly to your house. You must either
      lose me or take me.”

“Look here! Reflect! If you remain here he''ll come to-morrow to take
      you away, seeing that he is your husband, seeing that he has right and law
      on his side.”

“I did not ask you to keep me in your own house, Jacques, but to
      take me anywhere you like. I thought you loved me enough to do that. I
      have made a mistake. Good-by!”

She turned round and went toward the door so quickly that he was only able
      to catch hold of her when she was outside the room:

He made her sit down by force, and once more falling on his knees at her
      feet, he now brought forward a number of arguments and counsels to make
      her understand the folly and terrible risk of her project. He omitted
      nothing which he deemed necessary to convince her, finding even in his
      very affection for her incentives to persuasion.

As she remained silent and cold as ice, he begged of her, implored of her
      to listen to him, to trust him, to follow his advice.

“Are you disposed to let me go away now? Take away your hands, so
      that I may rise to my feet.”

“Tell me only whether this resolution, this mad resolution of yours,
      which you will bitterly regret, is irrevocable?”

“Stay! I have done what I ought to do; I have said what I ought to
      say. I have no further responsibility on your behalf. My conscience is at
      peace. Tell me what you want me to do, and I will obey.”''

“Everything—everything that you thought about before changing
      your mind. Then I will see what I ought to do.”

“But I thought about nothing at all. I had to warn you that you were
      going to commit an act of folly. You persist; then I ask to share in this
      act of folly, and I even insist on it.”

“Listen, my dear love. It is not a question here of sacrifice or
      devotion. On the day when I realized that I loved you, I said to myself
      what every lover ought to say to himself in the same case: ''The man who
      loves a woman, who makes an effort to win her, who gets her, and who takes
      her, enters into a sacred contract with himself and with her. That is, of
      course, in dealing with a woman like you, not a woman with a fickle heart
      and easily impressed.''

“Marriage which has a great social value, a great legal value,
      possesses in my eyes only a very slight moral value, taking into account
      the conditions under which it generally takes place.

“Therefore, when a woman, united by this lawful bond, but having no
      attachment to her husband, whom she cannot love, a woman whose heart is
      free, meets a man whom she cares for, and gives herself to him, when a man
      who has no other tie, takes a woman in this way, I say that they pledge
      themselves toward each other by this mutual and free agreement much more
      than by the ''Yes'' uttered in the presence of the mayor.

“I say that, if they are both honorable persons, their union must be
      more intimate, more real, more wholesome, than if all the sacraments had
      consecrated it.

“This woman risks everything. And it is exactly because she knows
      it, because she gives everything, her heart, her body, her soul, her
      honor, her life, because she has foreseen all miseries, all dangers all
      catastrophes, because she dares to do a bold act, an intrepid act, because
      she is prepared, determined to brave everything—her husband, who
      might kill her, and society, which may cast her out. This is why she is
      worthy of respect in the midst of her conjugal infidelity; this is why her
      lover, in taking her, should also foresee everything, and prefer her to
      every one else whatever may happen. I have nothing more to say. I spoke in
      the beginning like a sensible man whose duty it was to warn you; and now I
      am only a man—a man who loves you—Command, and I obey.”

“It is not true, darling! There is nothing the matter! My husband
      does not suspect anything. But I wanted to see, I wanted to know, what you
      would do. I wished for a New Year''s gift—the gift of your heart—another
      gift besides the necklace you sent me. You have given it to me. Thanks!
      thanks! God be thanked for the happiness you have given me!”

We were searching for other names which would remind us of the youthful
      faces of our younger days. Once in a while we had met some of these old
      comrades, bearded, bald, married, fathers of several children, and the
      realization of these changes had given us an unpleasant shudder, reminding
      us how short life is, how everything passes away, how everything changes.
      My friend asked me:

“Oh! as for him, just listen to this. Four or five years ago I was
      in Limoges, on a tour of inspection, and I was waiting for dinner time. I
      was seated before the big cafe in the Place du Theatre, just bored to
      death. The tradespeople were coming by twos, threes or fours, to take
      their absinthe or vermouth, talking all the time of their own or other
      people''s business, laughing loudly, or lowering their voices in order to
      impart some important or delicate piece of news.

“I was saying to myself: ''What shall I do after dinner?'' And I
      thought of the long evening in this provincial town, of the slow, dreary
      walk through unknown streets, of the impression of deadly gloom which
      these provincial people produce on the lonely traveller, and of the whole
      oppressive atmosphere of the place.

“I was thinking of all these things as I watched the little jets of
      gas flare up, feeling my loneliness increase with the falling shadows.

“The ''my'' came out like the report of a cannon. I immediately
      understood that everything was his in life, and not another''s; that he had
      his nature, by Jove, his appetite, his trousers, his everything, his, more
      absolutely and more completely than anyone else''s. Then he looked round
      him with a satisfied air. His bitters were brought, and he ordered:

“I wondered: ''Which newspaper can his be?'' The title would certainly
      reveal to me his opinions, his theories, his principles, his hobbies, his
      weaknesses.

“The waiter brought the Temps. I was surprised. Why the Temps, a
      serious, sombre, doctrinaire, impartial sheet? I thought:

“He put on his gold-rimmed spectacles, leaned back before beginning
      to read, and once more glanced about him. He noticed me, and immediately
      began to stare at me in an annoying manner. I was even going to ask the
      reason for this attention, when he exclaimed from his seat:

“I recognized him. Yes, Robert Patience, my old college chum. It was
      he. I took his outstretched hand:

“''Heaps. I''m very rich. But come around to lunch, to-morrow noon, 17
      Rue du Coq-qui-Chante; you will see my place.''

“''Good, good! Do you remember our first escapade, in Bordeaux, after
      that dinner at Routie''s? What a spree!''

“I did, indeed, remember that spree; and the recollection of it
      cheered me up. This called to mind other pranks. He would say:

“''Yes-yes-yes-and do you remember the face of the geography teacher,
      M. Marin, the day we set off a firecracker in the globe, just as he was
      haranguing about the principal volcanoes of the earth?''

“''Ten years, my boy, and I have four children, remarkable
      youngsters; but you''ll see them and their mother.''

“He rose, took both my hands, shook them as though he were trying to
      wrench my arms from their sockets, and exclaimed:

“I spent the morning working in the office of the collector-general
      of the Department. The chief wished me to stay to luncheon, but I told him
      that I had an engagement with a friend. As he had to go out, he
      accompanied me.

“''Yes, it''s only five minutes'' walk from here. As I have nothing
      special to do, I will take you there.''

“We started out and soon found ourselves there. It was a wide,
      fine-looking street, on the outskirts of the town. I looked at the houses
      and I noticed No. 17. It was a large house with a garden behind it. The
      facade, decorated with frescoes, in the Italian style, appeared to me as
      being in bad taste. There were goddesses holding vases, others swathed in
      clouds. Two stone cupids supported the number of the house.

“The hall was decorated with paintings from the brush of some local
      artist. Pauls and Virginias were kissing each other under palm trees
      bathed in a pink light. A hideous Oriental lantern was ranging from the
      ceiling. Several doors were concealed by bright hangings.

“But what struck me especially was the odor. It was a sickening and
      perfumed odor, reminding one of rice powder and the mouldy smell of a
      cellar. An indefinable odor in a heavy atmosphere as oppressive as that of
      public baths. I followed the maid up a marble stairway, covered with a
      green, Oriental carpet, and was ushered into a sumptubus parlor.

“The room was richly furnished, but in the pretentious taste of a
      parvenu. Rather fine engravings of the last century represented women with
      powdered hair dressed high surprised by gentlemen in interesting
      positions. Another lady, lying in a large bed, was teasing with her foot a
      little dog, lost in the sheets. One drawing showed four feet, bodies
      concealed behind a curtain. The large room, surrounded by soft couches,
      was entirely impregnated with that enervating and insipid odor which I had
      already noticed. There seemed to be something suspicious about the walls,
      the hangings, the exaggerated luxury, everything.

“I approached the window to look into the garden. It was very big,
      shady, beautiful. A wide path wound round a grass plot in the midst of
      which was a fountain, entered a shrubbery and came out farther away. And,
      suddenly, yonder, in the distance, between two clumps of bushes, three
      women appeared. They were walking slowly, arm in arm, clad in long, white
      tea-gowns covered with lace. Two were blondes and the other was
      dark-haired. Almost immediately they disappeared again behind the trees. I
      stood there entranced, delighted with this short and charming apparition,
      which brought to my mind a whole world of poetry. They had scarcely
      allowed themselves to be seen, in just the proper light, in that frame of
      foliage, in the midst of that mysterious, delightful park. It seemed to me
      that I had suddenly seen before me the great ladies of the last century,
      who were depicted in the engravings on the wall. And I began to think of
      the happy, joyous, witty and amorous times when manners were so graceful
      and lips so approachable.

“He looked into my eyes with the sly look which one takes when
      divulging secrets of love, and, with a Napoleonic gesture, he showed me
      his sumptuous parlor, his park, the three women, who had reappeared in the
      back of it, then, in a triumphant voice, where the note of pride was
      prominent, he said:

“I really think you must be mad, my dear, to go for a country walk
      in such weather as this. You have had some very strange notions for the
      last two months. You drag me to the seaside in spite of myself, when you
      have never once had such a whim during all the forty-four years that we
      have been married. You chose Fecamp, which is a very dull town, without
      consulting me in the matter, and now you are seized with such a rage for
      walking, you who hardly ever stir out on foot, that you want to take a
      country walk on the hottest day of the year. Ask d''Apreval to go with you,
      as he is ready to gratify all your whims. As for me, I am going back to
      have a nap.”

“Very well, then, go and get a sunstroke,” Monsieur de Cadour
      said; and he went back to the Hotel des Bains to lie down for an hour or
      two.

As soon as they were alone, the old lady and her old companion set off,
      and she said to him in a low voice, squeezing his hand:

“You are mad,” he said in a whisper. “I assure you that
      you are mad. Think of the risk you are running. If that man—”

“Very well,” he said abruptly, “if our son guesses
      anything, if he has any suspicions, he will have you, he will have us both
      in his power. You have got on without seeing him for the last forty years.
      What is the matter with you to-day?”

They had been going up the long street that leads from the sea to the
      town, and now they turned to the right, to go to Etretat. The white road
      stretched in front of him, then under a blaze of brilliant sunshine, so
      they went on slowly in the burning heat. She had taken her old friend''s
      arm, and was looking straight in front of her, with a fixed and haunted
      gaze, and at last she said:

“My dear friend, do not let us begin that discussion again. I have a
      wife and children and you have a husband, so we both of us have much to
      fear from other people''s opinion.”

She did not reply; she was thinking of her long past youth and of many sad
      things that had occurred. How well she recalled all the details of their
      early friendship, his smiles, the way he used to linger, in order to watch
      her until she was indoors. What happy days they were, the only really
      delicious days she had ever enjoyed, and how quickly they were over!

Of that journey to the South, that long journey, her sufferings, her
      constant terror, that secluded life in the small, solitary house on the
      shores of the Mediterranean, at the bottom of a garden, which she did not
      venture to leave. How well she remembered those long days which she spent
      lying under an orange tree, looking up at the round, red fruit, amid the
      green leaves. How she used to long to go out, as far as the sea, whose
      fresh breezes came to her over the wall, and whose small waves she could
      hear lapping on the beach. She dreamed of its immense blue expanse
      sparkling under the sun, with the white sails of the small vessels, and a
      mountain on the horizon. But she did not dare to go outside the gate.
      Suppose anybody had recognized her!

And those days of waiting, those last days of misery and expectation! The
      impending suffering, and then that terrible night! What misery she had
      endured, and what a night it was! How she had groaned and screamed! She
      could still see the pale face of her lover, who kissed her hand every
      moment, and the clean-shaven face of the doctor and the nurse''s white cap.

And what she felt when she heard the child''s feeble cries, that wail, that
      first effort of a human''s voice!

And the next day! the next day! the only day of her life on which she had
      seen and kissed her son; for, from that time, she had never even caught a
      glimpse of him.

And what a long, void existence hers had been since then, with the thought
      of that child always, always floating before her. She had never seen her
      son, that little creature that had been part of herself, even once since
      then; they had taken him from her, carried him away, and had hidden him.
      All she knew was that he had been brought up by some peasants in Normandy,
      that he had become a peasant himself, had married well, and that his
      father, whose name he did not know, had settled a handsome sum of money on
      him.

How often during the last forty years had she wished to go and see him and
      to embrace him! She could not imagine to herself that he had grown! She
      always thought of that small human atom which she had held in her arms and
      pressed to her bosom for a day.

But he had always stopped her and kept her from going. She would be unable
      to restrain and to master herself; their son would guess it and take
      advantage of her, blackmail her; she would be lost.

“Is it possible? To have a son and not to know him; to be afraid of
      him and to reject him as if he were a disgrace! It is horrible.”

They went along the dusty road, overcome by the scorching sun, and
      continually ascending that interminable hill.

“One might take it for a punishment,” she continued; “I
      have never had another child, and I could no longer resist the longing to
      see him, which has possessed me for forty years. You men cannot understand
      that. You must remember that I shall not live much longer, and suppose I
      should never see him, never have seen him! . . . Is it possible? How could
      I wait so long? I have thought about him every day since, and what a
      terrible existence mine has been! I have never awakened, never, do you
      understand, without my first thoughts being of him, of my child. How is
      he? Oh, how guilty I feel toward him! Ought one to fear what the world may
      say in a case like this? I ought to have left everything to go after him,
      to bring him up and to show my love for him. I should certainly have been
      much happier, but I did not dare, I was a coward. How I have suffered! Oh,
      how those poor, abandoned children must hate their mothers!”

She stopped suddenly, for she was choked by her sobs. The whole valley was
      deserted and silent in the dazzling light and the overwhelming heat, and
      only the grasshoppers uttered their shrill, continuous chirp among the
      sparse yellow grass on both sides of the road.

She allowed herself to be led to the side of the ditch and sank down with
      her face in her hands. Her white hair, which hung in curls on both sides
      of her face, had become tangled. She wept, overcome by profound grief,
      while he stood facing her, uneasy and not knowing what to say, and he
      merely murmured: “Come, take courage.”

“I will,” she said, and wiping her eyes, she began to walk
      again with the uncertain step of an elderly woman.

A little farther on the road passed beneath a clump of trees, which hid a
      few houses, and they could distinguish the vibrating and regular blows of
      a blacksmith''s hammer on the anvil; and presently they saw a wagon
      standing on the right side of the road in front of a low cottage, and two
      men shoeing a horse under a shed.

“Take the road to the left, close to the inn, and then go straight
      on; it is the third house past Poret''s. There is a small spruce fir close
      to the gate; you cannot make a mistake.”

They turned to the left. She was walking very slowly now, her legs
      threatened to give way, and her heart was beating so violently that she
      felt as if she should suffocate, while at every step she murmured, as if
      in prayer:

“If you cannot manage to control your feelings, you will betray
      yourself at once. Do try and restrain yourself.”

They were going along one of those narrow country lanes between farmyards,
      that are concealed beneath a double row of beech trees at either side of
      the ditches, and suddenly they found themselves in front of a gate, beside
      which there was a young spruce fir.

She stopped suddenly and looked about her. The courtyard, which was
      planted with apple trees, was large and extended as far as the small
      thatched dwelling house. On the opposite side were the stable, the barn,
      the cow house and the poultry house, while the gig, the wagon and the
      manure cart were under a slated outhouse. Four calves were grazing under
      the shade of the trees and black hens were wandering all about the
      enclosure.

All was perfectly still; the house door was open, but nobody was to be
      seen, and so they went in, when immediately a large black dog came out of
      a barrel that was standing under a pear tree, and began to bark furiously.

Then a child appeared, a little girl of about ten, dressed in a chemise
      and a linen, petticoat, with dirty, bare legs and a timid and cunning
      look. She remained standing in the doorway, as if to prevent any one going
      in.

Then suddenly the lady, as if she feared that her companion might force
      her to return, said quickly:

As they turned away, they saw a peasant woman coming toward the house,
      carrying two tin pails, which appeared to be heavy and which glistened
      brightly in the sunlight.

She limped with her right leg, and in her brown knitted jacket, that was
      faded by the sun and washed out by the rain, she looked like a poor,
      wretched, dirty servant.

When she got close to the house, she looked at the strangers angrily and
      suspiciously, and then she went in, as if she had not seen them. She
      looked old and had a hard, yellow, wrinkled face, one of those wooden
      faces that country people so often have.

“I beg your pardon, madame, but we came in to know whether you could
      sell us two glasses of milk.”

“We are very thirsty,” he said, “and madame is very
      tired. Can we not get something to drink?”

“As you are here, I will give you some,” she said, going into
      the house, and almost immediately the child came out and brought two
      chairs, which she placed under an apple tree, and then the mother, in
      turn, brought out two bowls of foaming milk, which she gave to the
      visitors. She did not return to the house, however, but remained standing
      near them, as if to watch them and to find out for what purpose they had
      come there.

“Four francs and four francs fifty centimes,” she said, her
      eyes full of tears, while the farmer''s wife, who was looking at her
      askance, asked in much surprise:

“No—no—but she lost her watch as we came along, a very
      handsome watch, and that troubles her. If anybody should find it, please
      let us know.”

Mother Benedict did not reply, as she thought it a very equivocal sort of
      answer, but suddenly she exclaimed:

She was the only one who had seen him, as she was facing the gate.
      D''Apreval started and Madame de Cadour nearly fell as she turned round
      suddenly on her chair.

A man bent nearly double, and out of breath, stood there, ten-yards from
      them, dragging a cow at the end of a rope. Without taking any notice of
      the visitors, he said:

Her tears had dried quickly as she sat there startled, without a word and
      with the one thought in her mind, that this was her son, and D''Apreval,
      whom the same thought had struck very unpleasantly, said in an agitated
      voice:

“The blacksmith at the corner of the highroad,” he replied,
      and then they were all silent, with their eyes fixed on the door of the
      cow house, which formed a sort of black hole in the wall of the building.
      Nothing could be seen inside, but they heard a vague noise, movements and
      footsteps and the sound of hoofs, which were deadened by the straw on the
      floor, and soon the man reappeared in the door, wiping his forehead, and
      came toward the house with long, slow strides. He passed the strangers
      without seeming to notice them and said to his wife:

Then he went back into the house, while his wife went into the cellar and
      left the two Parisians alone.

“Let us go, let us go, Henri,” Madame de Cadour said, nearly
      distracted with grief, and so d''Apreval took her by the arm, helped her to
      rise, and sustaining her with all his strength, for he felt that she was
      nearly fainting, he led her out, after throwing five francs on one of the
      chairs.

“I did what I could. His farm is worth eighty thousand francs, and
      that is more than most of the sons of the middle classes have.”

They returned slowly, without speaking a word. She was still crying; the
      tears ran down her cheeks continually for a time, but by degrees they
      stopped, and they went back to Fecamp, where they found Monsieur de Cadour
      waiting dinner for them. As soon as he saw them, he began to laugh and
      exclaimed:

“So my wife has had a sunstroke, and I am very glad of it. I really
      think she has lost her head for some time past!”

They went there every evening about eleven o''clock, just as they would go
      to the club. Six or eight of them; always the same set, not fast men, but
      respectable tradesmen, and young men in government or some other employ,
      and they would drink their Chartreuse, and laugh with the girls, or else
      talk seriously with Madame Tellier, whom everybody respected, and then
      they would go home at twelve o''clock! The younger men would sometimes stay
      later.

It was a small, comfortable house painted yellow, at the corner of a
      street behind Saint Etienne''s Church, and from the windows one could see
      the docks full of ships being unloaded, the big salt marsh, and, rising
      beyond it, the Virgin''s Hill with its old gray chapel.

Madame Tellier, who came of a respectable family of peasant proprietors in
      the Department of the Eure, had taken up her profession, just as she would
      have become a milliner or dressmaker. The prejudice which is so violent
      and deeply rooted in large towns, does not exist in the country places in
      Normandy. The peasant says:

“It is a paying-business,” and he sends his daughter to keep
      an establishment of this character just as he would send her to keep a
      girls'' school.

She had inherited the house from an old uncle, to whom it had belonged.
      Monsieur and Madame Tellier, who had formerly been innkeepers near Yvetot,
      had immediately sold their house, as they thought that the business at
      Fecamp was more profitable, and they arrived one fine morning to assume
      the direction of the enterprise, which was declining on account of the
      absence of the proprietors. They were good people enough in their way, and
      soon made themselves liked by their staff and their neighbors.

Monsieur died of apoplexy two years later, for as the new place kept him
      in idleness and without any exercise, he had grown excessively stout, and
      his health had suffered. Since she had been a widow, all the frequenters
      of the establishment made much of her; but people said that, personally,
      she was quite virtuous, and even the girls in the house could not discover
      anything against her. She was tall, stout and affable, and her complexion,
      which had become pale in the dimness of her house, the shutters of which
      were scarcely ever opened, shone as if it had been varnished. She had a
      fringe of curly false hair, which gave her a juvenile look, that
      contrasted strongly with the ripeness of her figure. She was always
      smiling and cheerful, and was fond of a joke, but there was a shade of
      reserve about her, which her occupation had not quite made her lose.
      Coarse words always shocked her, and when any young fellow who had been
      badly brought up called her establishment a hard name, she was angry and
      disgusted.

In a word, she had a refined mind, and although she treated her women as
      friends, yet she very frequently used to say that “she and they were
      not made of the same stuff.”

Sometimes during the week she would hire a carriage and take some of her
      girls into the country, where they used to enjoy themselves on the grass
      by the side of the little river. They were like a lot of girls let out
      from school, and would run races and play childish games. They had a cold
      dinner on the grass, and drank cider, and went home at night with a
      delicious feeling of fatigue, and in the carriage they kissed Madame''
      Tellier as their kind mother, who was full of goodness and complaisance.

The house had two entrances. At the corner there was a sort of tap-room,
      which sailors and the lower orders frequented at night, and she had two
      girls whose special duty it was to wait on them with the assistance of
      Frederic, a short, light-haired, beardless fellow, as strong as a horse.
      They set the half bottles of wine and the jugs of beer on the shaky marble
      tables before the customers, and then urged the men to drink.

The three other girls—there were only five of them—formed a
      kind of aristocracy, and they remained with the company on the first
      floor, unless they were wanted downstairs and there was nobody on the
      first floor. The salon de Jupiter, where the tradesmen used to meet, was
      papered in blue, and embellished with a large drawing representing Leda
      and the swan. The room was reached by a winding staircase, through a
      narrow door opening on the street, and above this door a lantern inclosed
      in wire, such as one still sees in some towns, at the foot of the shrine
      of some saint, burned all night long.

The house, which was old and damp, smelled slightly of mildew. At times
      there was an odor of eau de Cologne in the passages, or sometimes from a
      half-open door downstairs the noisy mirth of the common men sitting and
      drinking rose to the first floor, much to the disgust of the gentlemen who
      were there. Madame Tellier, who was on friendly terms with her customers,
      did not leave the room, and took much interest in what was going on in the
      town, and they regularly told her all the news. Her serious conversation
      was a change from the ceaseless chatter of the three women; it was a rest
      from the obscene jokes of those stout individuals who every evening
      indulged in the commonplace debauchery of drinking a glass of liqueur in
      company with common women.

The names of the girls on the first floor were Fernande, Raphaele, and
      Rosa, the Jade. As the staff was limited, madame had endeavored that each
      member of it should be a pattern, an epitome of the feminine type, so that
      every customer might find as nearly as possible the realization of his
      ideal. Fernande represented the handsome blonde; she was very tall, rather
      fat, and lazy; a country girl, who could not get rid of her freckles, and
      whose short, light, almost colorless, tow-like hair, like combed-out hemp,
      barely covered her head.

Raphaele, who came from Marseilles, played the indispensable part of the
      handsome Jewess, and was thin, with high cheekbones, which were covered
      with rouge, and black hair covered with pomatum, which curled on her
      forehead. Her eyes would have been handsome, if the right one had not had
      a speck in it. Her Roman nose came down over a square jaw, where two false
      upper teeth contrasted strangely with the bad color of the rest.

Rosa was a little roll of fat, nearly all body, with very short legs, and
      from morning till night she sang songs, which were alternately risque or
      sentimental, in a harsh voice; told silly, interminable tales, and only
      stopped talking in order to eat, and left off eating in order to talk; she
      was never still, and was active as a squirrel, in spite of her embonpoint
      and her short legs; her laugh, which was a torrent of shrill cries,
      resounded here and there, ceaselessly, in a bedroom, in the loft, in the
      cafe, everywhere, and all about nothing.

The two women on the ground floor, Lodise, who was nicknamed La Cocotte,
      and Flora, whom they called Balancoise, because she limped a little, the
      former always dressed as the Goddess of Liberty, with a tri-colored sash,
      and the other as a Spanish woman, with a string of copper coins in her
      carroty hair, which jingled at every uneven step, looked like cooks
      dressed up for the carnival. They were like all other women of the lower
      orders, neither uglier nor better looking than they usually are.

A jealous peace, which was, however, very rarely disturbed, reigned among
      these five women, thanks to Madame Tellier''s conciliatory wisdom, and to
      her constant good humor, and the establishment, which was the only one of
      the kind in the little town, was very much frequented. Madame Tellier had
      succeeded in giving it such a respectable appearance, she was so amiable
      and obliging to everybody, her good heart was so well known, that she was
      treated with a certain amount of consideration. The regular customers
      spent money on her, and were delighted when she was especially friendly
      toward them, and when they met during the day, they would say: “Until
      this evening, you know where,” just as men say: “At the club,
      after dinner.” In a word, Madame Tellier''s house was somewhere to go
      to, and they very rarely missed their daily meetings there.

One evening toward the end of May, the first arrival, Monsieur Poulin, who
      was a timber merchant, and had been mayor, found the door shut. The
      lantern behind the grating was not alight; there was not a sound in the
      house; everything seemed dead. He knocked, gently at first, but then more
      loudly, but nobody answered the door. Then he went slowly up the street,
      and when he got to the market place he met Monsieur Duvert, the gunmaker,
      who was going to the same place, so they went back together, but did not
      meet with any better success. But suddenly they heard a loud noise, close
      to them, and on going round the house, they saw a number of English and
      French sailors, who were hammering at the closed shutters of the taproom
      with their fists.

The two tradesmen immediately made their escape, but a low “Pst!”
      stopped them; it was Monsieur Tournevau, the fish curer, who had
      recognized them, and was trying to attract their attention. They told him
      what had happened, and he was all the more annoyed, as he was a married
      man and father of a family, and only went on Saturdays. That was his
      regular evening, and now he should be deprived of this dissipation for the
      whole week.

The three men went as far as the quay together, and on the way they met
      young Monsieur Philippe, the banker''s son, who frequented the place
      regularly, and Monsieur Pinipesse, the collector, and they all returned to
      the Rue aux Juifs together, to make a last attempt. But the exasperated
      sailors were besieging the house, throwing stones at the shutters, and
      shouting, and the five first-floor customers went away as quickly as
      possible, and walked aimlessly about the streets.

Presently they met Monsieur Dupuis, the insurance agent, and then Monsieur
      Vasse, the Judge of the Tribunal of Commerce, and they took a long walk,
      going to the pier first of all, where they sat down in a row on the
      granite parapet and watched the rising tide, and when the promenaders had
      sat there for some time, Monsieur Tournevau said:

After going through the street alongside the hill, they returned over the
      wooden bridge which crosses the Retenue, passed close to the railway, and
      came out again on the market place, when, suddenly, a quarrel arose
      between Monsieur Pinipesse, the collector, and Monsieur Tournevau about an
      edible mushroom which one of them declared he had found in the
      neighborhood.

As they were out of temper already from having nothing to do, they would
      very probably have come to blows, if the others had not interfered.
      Monsieur Pinipesse went off furious, and soon another altercation arose
      between the ex-mayor, Monsieur Poulin, and Monsieur Dupuis, the insurance
      agent, on the subject of the tax collector''s salary and the profits which
      he might make. Insulting remarks were freely passing between them, when a
      torrent of formidable cries was heard, and the body of sailors, who were
      tired of waiting so long outside a closed house, came into the square.
      They were walking arm in arm, two and two, and formed a long procession,
      and were shouting furiously. The townsmen hid themselves in a doorway, and
      the yelling crew disappeared in the direction of the abbey. For a long
      time they still heard the noise, which diminished like a storm in the
      distance, and then silence was restored. Monsieur Poulin and Monsieur
      Dupuis, who were angry with each other, went in different directions,
      without wishing each other good-by.

The other four set off again, and instinctively went in the direction of
      Madame Tellier''s establishment, which was still closed, silent,
      impenetrable. A quiet, but obstinate drunken man was knocking at the door
      of the lower room, antd then stopped and called Frederic, in a low voice,
      but finding that he got no answer, he sat down on the doorstep, and waited
      the course of events.

The others were just going to retire, when the noisy band of sailors
      reappeared at the end of the street. The French sailors were shouting the
      “Marseillaise,” and the Englishmen “Rule Britannia.”
      There was a general lurching against the wall, and then the drunken
      fellows went on their way toward the quay, where a fight broke out between
      the two nations, in the course of which an Englishman had his arm broken
      and a Frenchman his nose split.

The drunken man who had waited outside the door, was crying by that time,
      as drunken men and children cry when they are vexed, and the others went
      away. By degrees, calm was restored in the noisy town; here and there, at
      moments, the distant sound of voices could be heard, and then died away in
      the distance.

One man only was still wandering about, Monsieur Tournevau, the fish
      curer, who was annoyed at having to wait until the following Saturday, and
      he hoped something would turn up, he did not know what; but he was
      exasperated at the police for thus allowing an establishment of such
      public utility, which they had under their control, to be closed.

He went back to it and examined the walls, trying to find out some reason,
      and on the shutter he saw a notice stuck up. He struck a wax match and
      read the following, in a large, uneven hand: “Closed on account of
      the Confirmation.”

Then he went away, as he saw it was useless to remain, and left the
      drunken man lying on the pavement fast asleep, outside that inhospitable
      door.

The next day, all the regular customers, one after the other, found some
      reason for going through the street, with a bundle of papers under their
      arm to keep them in countenance, and with a furtive glance they all read
      that mysterious notice:

Madame Tellier had a brother, who was a carpenter in their native place,
      Virville, in the Department of Eure. When she still kept the inn at
      Yvetot, she had stood godmother to that brother''s daughter, who had
      received the name of Constance—Constance Rivet; she herself being a
      Rivet on her father''s side. The carpenter, who knew that his sister was in
      a good position, did not ' WHERE id = '6b5a5bab-cb6d-4c60-9071-cb95b01bf8ca';
