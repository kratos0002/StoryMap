      you ask the woman what has become of her husband, she will stretch her
      arms out over the dark ocean which rumbles and roars along the coast. He
      remained, there one night, when he had had too much to drink; so did her
      oldest son. She has four more big, strong, fair-haired boys. Soon it will
      be their time.

“As I said, I was living in a little house near Pont-l''Abbe. I was
      there alone with my servant, an old sailor, and with a native family which
      took care of the grounds in my absence. It consisted of three persons, two
      sisters and a man, who had married one of them, and who attended to the
      garden.

“A short time before Christmas my gardener''s wife presented him with
      a boy. The husband asked me to stand as god-father. I could hardly deny
      the request, and so he borrowed ten francs from me for the cost of the
      christening, as he said.

“The second day of January was chosen as the date of the ceremony.
      For a week the earth had been covered by an enormous white carpet of snow,
      which made this flat, low country seem vast and limitless. The ocean
      appeared to be black in contrast with this white plain; one could see it
      rolling, raging and tossing its waves as though wishing to annihilate its
      pale neighbor, which appeared to be dead, it was so calm, quiet and cold.

“At nine o''clock the father, Kerandec, came to my door with his
      sister-in-law, the big Kermagan, and the nurse, who carried the infant
      wrapped up in a blanket. We started for the church. The weather was so
      cold that it seemed to dry up the skin and crack it open. I was thinking
      of the poor little creature who was being carried on ahead of us, and I
      said to myself that this Breton race must surely be of iron, if their
      children were able, as soon as they were born, to stand such an outing.

“Then the nurse sat down on one of the steps and began to undress
      the child. At first I thought there must have been some slight accident,
      but I saw that they were leaving the poor little fellow naked completely
      naked, in the icy air. Furious at such imprudence, I protested:

“The father and the aunt looked on undisturbed. It was the custom.
      If it were not adhered to misfortune was sure to attend the little one.

“I scolded, threatened and pleaded. I used force to try to cover the
      frail creature. All was in vain. The nurse ran away from me through the
      snow, and the body of the little one turned purple. I was about to leave
      these brutes when I saw the priest coming across the country, followed. by
      the sexton and a young boy. I ran towards him and gave vent to my
      indignation. He showed no surprise nor did he quicken his pace in the
      least. He answered:

“''What can you expect, sir? It''s the custom. They all do it, and
      it''s of no use trying to stop them.''

“He entered the vestry, while we remained outside on the church
      steps. I was suffering. But what about the poor little creature who was
      howling from the effects of the biting cold.

“At last the door opened. He went into the church. But the poor
      child had to remain naked throughout the ceremony. It was interminable.
      The priest stammered over the Latin words and mispronounced them horribly.
      He walked slowly and with a ponderous tread. His white surplice chilled my
      heart. It seemed as though, in the name of a pitiless and barbarous god,
      he had wrapped himself in another kind of snow in order to torture this
      little piece of humanity that suffered so from the cold.

“Finally the christening was finished according to the rites and I
      saw the nurse once more take the frozen, moaning child and wrap it up in
      the blanket.

“Turning to my gardener, I said: ''Hurry up and get home quickly so
      that you can warm that child.'' I gave him some advice so as to ward off,
      if not too late, a bad attack of pneumonia. He promised to follow my
      instructions and left with his sister-in-law and the nurse. I followed the
      priest into the vestry, and when I had signed he demanded five francs for
      expenses.

“As I had already given the father ten francs, I refused to pay
      twice. The priest threatened to destroy the paper and to annul the
      ceremony. I, in turn, threatened him with the district attorney. The
      dispute was long, and I finally paid five francs.

“As soon as I reached home I went down to Kerandec''s to find out
      whether everything was all right. Neither father, nor sister-in-law, nor
      nurse had yet returned. The mother, who had remained alone, was in bed,
      shivering with cold and starving, for she had had nothing to eat since the
      day before.

“''Where the deuce can they have gone?'' I asked. She answered without
      surprise or anger, ''They''re going to drink something to celebrate: It was
      the custom. Then I thought, of my ten francs which were to pay the church
      and would doubtless pay for the alcohol.

“I sent some broth to the mother and ordered a good fire to be built
      in the room. I was uneasy and furious and promised myself to drive out
      these brutes, wondering with terror what was going to happen to the poor
      infant.

“It was already six, and they had not yet returned. I told my
      servant to wait for them and I went to bed. I soon fell asleep and slept
      like a top. At daybreak I was awakened by my servant, who was bringing me
      my hot water.

“The man hesitated and then stammered: ''Oh! he came back, all right,
      after midnight, and so drunk that he couldn''t walk, and so were Kermagan
      and the nurse. I guess they must have slept in a ditch, for the little one
      died and they never even noticed it.''

“''Yes, sir. They brought it back to Mother Kerandec. When she saw it
      she began to cry, and now they are making her drink to console her.''

“''Yes, sir. I only found it out this morning. As Kerandec had no
      more brandy or money, he took some wood alcohol, which monsieur gave him
      for the lamp, and all four of them are now drinking that. The mother is
      feeling pretty sick now.''

“I had hastily put on some clothes, and seizing a stick, with the
      intention of applying it to the backs of these human beasts, I hastened
      towards the gardener''s house.

“The mother was raving drunk beside the blue body of her dead baby.
      Kerandec, the nurse, and the Kermagan woman were snoring on the floor. I
      had to take care of the mother, who died towards noon.”

The old doctor was silent. He took up the brandy-bottle and poured out
      another glass. He held it up to the lamp, and the light streaming through
      it imparted to the liquid the amber color of molten topaz. With one gulp
      he swallowed the treacherous drink.

“Will you come and open the hunting season with me at my farm at
      Marinville? I shall be delighted if you will, my dear boy. In the first
      place, I am all alone. It is rather a difficult ground to get at, and the
      place I live in is so primitive that I can invite only my most intimate
      friends.”

I accepted his invitation, and on Saturday we set off on the train going
      to Normandy. We alighted at a station called Almivare, and Baron Rene,
      pointing to a carryall drawn by a timid horse and driven by a big
      countryman with white hair, said:

We jumped into this swinging hencoop perched on two enormous wheels, and
      the young horse, after a violent swerve, started into a gallop, pitching
      us into the air like balls. Every fall backward on the wooden bench gave
      me the most dreadful pain.

Our two dogs behind us, in the empty part of the hencoop, were standing up
      and sniffing the air of the plains, where they scented game.

The baron gazed with a sad eye into the distance at the vast Norman
      landscape, undulating and melancholy, like an immense English park, where
      the farmyards, surrounded by two or four rows of trees and full of dwarfed
      apple trees which hid the houses, gave a vista as far as the eye could see
      of forest trees, copses and shrubbery such as landscape gardeners look for
      in laying out the boundaries of princely estates.

He was a pure Norman, tall and strong, with a slight paunch, and of the
      old race of adventurers who went to found kingdoms on the shores of every
      ocean. He was about fifty years of age, ten years less perhaps than the
      farmer who was driving us.

After two hours'' travelling over stony roads, across that green and
      monotonous plain, the vehicle entered one of those orchard farmyards and
      drew up before in old structure falling into decay, where an old
      maid-servant stood waiting beside a young fellow, who took charge of the
      horse.

We entered the farmhouse. The smoky kitchen was high and spacious. The
      copper utensils and the crockery shone in the reflection of the hearth. A
      cat lay asleep on a chair, a dog under the table. One perceived an odor of
      milk, apples, smoke, that indescribable smell peculiar to old farmhouses;
      the odor of the earth, of the walls, of furniture, the odor of spilled
      stale soup, of former wash-days and of former inhabitants, the smell of
      animals and of human beings combined, of things and of persons, the odor
      of time, and of things that have passed away.

I went out to have a look at the farmyard. It was very large, full of
      apple trees, dwarfed and crooked, and laden with fruit which fell on the
      grass around them. In this farmyard the Norman smell of apples was as
      strong as that of the bloom of orange trees on the shores of the south of
      France.

Four rows of beeches surrounded this inclosure. They were so tall that
      they seemed to touch the clouds at this hour of nightfall, and their
      summits, through which the night winds passed, swayed and sang a mournful,
      interminable song.

The baron was warming his feet at the fire, and was listening to the
      farmer''s talk about country matters. He talked about marriages, births and
      deaths, then about the fall in the price of grain and the latest news
      about cattle. The “Veularde” (as he called a cow that had been
      bought at the fair of Veules) had calved in the middle of June. The cider
      had not been first-class last year. Apricots were almost disappearing from
      the country.

Then we had dinner. It was a good rustic meal, simple and abundant, long
      and tranquil. And while we were dining I noticed the special kind of
      friendly familiarity which had struck me from the start between the baron
      and the peasant.

Outside, the beeches continued sighing in the night wind, and our two
      dogs, shut up in a shed, were whining and howling in an uncanny fashion.
      The fire was dying out in the big fireplace. The maid-servant had gone to
      bed. Maitre Lebrument said in his turn:

The baron extended his hand toward him and said: “Go, my friend,”
      in so cordial a tone that I said, as soon as the man had disappeared:

“Better than that, my dear fellow! It is a drama, an old drama,
      simple and very sad, that attaches him to me. Here is the story:

“You know that my father was colonel in a cavalry regiment. His
      orderly was this young fellow, now an old man, the son of a farmer. When
      my father retired from the army he took this former soldier, then about
      forty; as his servant. I was at that time about thirty. We were living in
      our old chateau of Valrenne, near Caudebec-en-Caux.

“At this period my mother''s chambermaid was one of the prettiest
      girls you could see, fair-haired, slender and sprightly in manner, a
      genuine soubrette of the old type that no longer exists. To-day these
      creatures spring up into hussies before their time. Paris, with the aid of
      the railways, attracts them, calls them, takes hold of them, as soon as
      they are budding into womanhood, these little sluts who in old times
      remained simple maid-servants. Every man passing by, as recruiting
      sergeants did formerly, looking for recruits, with conscripts, entices and
      ruins them —these foolish lassies—and we have now only the
      scum of the female sex for servant maids, all that is dull, nasty, common
      and ill-formed, too ugly, even for gallantry.

“Well, this girl was charming, and I often gave her a kiss in dark
      corners; nothing more, I swear to you! She was virtuous, besides; and I
      had some respect for my mother''s house, which is more than can be said of
      the blackguards of the present day.

“Now, it happened that my man-servant, the ex-soldier, the old
      farmer you have just seen, fell madly in love with this girl, perfectly
      daft. The first thing we noticed was that he forgot everything, he paid no
      attention to anything.

“He grew thin; he broke glasses and let plates fall when waiting on
      the table. We thought he must have been attacked by some nervous
      affection, and sent for the doctor, who thought he could detect symptoms
      of spinal disease. Then my father, full of anxiety about his faithful
      man-servant, decided to place him in a private hospital. When the poor
      fellow heard of my father''s intentions he made a clean breast of it.

“And my father began to laugh so immoderately that my mother called
      out through the wall of the next room:

“And when she came in he told her, with tears in his eyes from sheer
      laughter, that his idiot of a servant-man was lovesick.

“My mother said with the utmost gravity: ''We must try to arrange
      this matter the best way we can.''

“So Louise was sent for and questioned by my mother; and she said in
      reply that she knew all about Jean''s liking for her, that in fact Jean had
      spoken to her about it several times, but that she did not want him. She
      refused to say why.

“And two months elapsed during which my father and mother never
      ceased to urge this girl to marry Jean. As she declared she was not in
      love with any other man, she could not give any serious reason for her
      refusal. My father at last overcame her resistance by means of a big
      present of money, and started the pair of them on a farm—this very
      farm. I did not see them for three years, and then I learned that Louise
      had died of consumption. But my father and mother died, too, in their
      turn, and it was two years more before I found myself face to face with
      Jean.

“At last one autumn day about the end of October the idea came into
      my head to go hunting on this part of my estate, which my father had told
      me was full of game.

“So one evening, one wet evening, I arrived at this house. I was
      shocked to find my father''s old servant with perfectly white hair, though
      he was not more than forty-five or forty-six years of age. I made him dine
      with me, at the very table where we are now sitting. It was raining hard.
      We could hear the rain battering at the roof, the walls, and the windows,
      flowing in a perfect deluge into the farmyard; and my dog was howling in
      the shed where the other dogs are howling to-night.

“''It was—it was—I''d rather, all the same, tell you
      nothing about it—but I must—I must. Well, it''s this—it
      wasn''t consumption she died of at all. It was grief—well, that''s the
      long and short of it. As soon as she came to live here after we were
      married, she grew thin; she changed so that you wouldn''t know her, M''sieu
      le Baron. She was just as I was before I married her, but it was just the
      opposite, just the opposite.

“''I sent for the doctor. He said it was her liver that was affected—he
      said it was what he called a “hepatic” complaint—I don''t
      know these big words, M''sieu le Baron. Then I bought medicine for her,
      heaps on heaps of bottles that cost about three hundred francs. But she''d
      take none of them; she wouldn''t have them; she said: “It''s no use,
      my poor Jean; it wouldn''t do me any good.” I saw well that she had
      some hidden trouble; and then I found her one time crying, and I didn''t
      know what to do, no, I didn''t know what to do. I bought her caps, and
      dresses, and hair oil, and earrings. Nothing did her any good. And I saw
      that she was going to die. And so one night at the end of November, one
      snowy night, after she had been in bed the whole day, she told me to send
      for the cure. So I went for him. As soon as he came—''

“''Jean,'' she said, ''I am going to make a confession to you. I owe it
      to you, Jean. I have never been false to you, never! never, before or
      after you married me. M''sieu le Cure is there, and can tell you so; he
      knows my soul. Well, listen, Jean. If I am dying, it is because I was not
      able to console myself for leaving the chateau, because I was too fond of
      the young Baron Monsieur Rene, too fond of him, mind you, Jean, there was
      no harm in it! This is the thing that''s killing me. When I could see him
      no more I felt that I should die. If I could only have seen him, I might
      have lived, only seen him, nothing more. I wish you''d tell him some day,
      by and by, when I am no longer here. You will tell him, swear you, will,
      Jean—swear it—in the presence of M''sieu le Cure! It will
      console me to know that he will know it one day, that this was the cause
      of my death! Swear it!''

“''Well, I gave her my promise, M''sieu le Baron, and on the faith of
      an honest man I have kept my word.''

“Good God! my dear boy, you can''t form any idea of the emotion that
      filled me when I heard this poor devil, whose wife I had killed without
      suspecting it, telling me this story on that wet night in this very
      kitchen.

“He murmured: ''Well, that''s all, M''sieu le Baron. I could not help
      it, one way or the other—and now it''s all over!''

“He asked, ''Will you come and see her grave?'' I nodded assent, for I
      couldn''t speak. He rose, lighted a lantern, and we walked through the
      blinding rain by the light of the lantern.

“Suddenly he stopped before a marble slab and said: ''There it is,''
      and he flashed the lantern close to it so that I could read the
      inscription:

“We fell on our knees in the damp grass, he and I, with the lantern
      between us, and I saw the rain beating on the white marble slab. And I
      thought of the heart of her sleeping there in her grave. Ah! poor heart!
      poor heart! Since then I come here every year. And I don''t know why, but I
      feel as if I were guilty of some crime in the presence of this man who
      always looks as if he forgave me.”

The peasant and the doctor stood on opposite sides of the bed, beside the
      old, dying woman. She was calm and resigned and her mind quite clear as
      she looked at them and listened to their conversation. She was going to
      die, and she did not rebel at it, for her time was come, as she was
      ninety-two.

The July sun streamed in at the window and the open door and cast its hot
      flames on the uneven brown clay floor, which had been stamped down by four
      generations of clodhoppers. The smell of the fields came in also, driven
      by the sharp wind and parched by the noontide heat. The grass-hoppers
      chirped themselves hoarse, and filled the country with their shrill noise,
      which was like that of the wooden toys which are sold to children at fair
      time.

The doctor raised his voice and said: “Honore, you cannot leave your
      mother in this state; she may die at any moment.” And the peasant,
      in great distress, replied: “But I must get in my wheat, for it has
      been lying on the ground a long time, and the weather is just right for
      it; what do you say about it, mother?” And the dying old woman,
      still tormented by her Norman avariciousness, replied yes with her eyes
      and her forehead, and thus urged her son to get in his wheat, and to leave
      her to die alone.

But the doctor got angry, and, stamping his foot, he said: “You are
      no better than a brute, do you hear, and I will not allow you to do it, do
      you understand? And if you must get in your wheat today, go and fetch
      Rapet''s wife and make her look after your mother; I will have it, do you
      understand me? And if you do not obey me, I will let you die like a dog,
      when you are ill in your turn; do you hear?”

The peasant, a tall, thin fellow with slow movements, who was tormented by
      indecision, by his fear of the doctor and his fierce love of saving,
      hesitated, calculated, and stammered out: “How much does La Rapet
      charge for attending sick people?” “How should I know?”
      the doctor cried. “That depends upon how long she is needed. Settle
      it with her, by Heaven! But I want her to be here within an hour, do you
      hear?”

So the man decided. “I will go for her,” he replied; “don''t
      get angry, doctor.” And the latter left, calling out as he went:
      “Be careful, be very careful, you know, for I do not joke when I am
      angry!” As soon as they were alone the peasant turned to his mother
      and said in a resigned voice: “I will go and fetch La Rapet, as the
      man will have it. Don''t worry till I get back.”

La Rapet, old was an old washerwoman, watched the dead and the dying of
      the neighborhood, and then, as soon as she had sewn her customers into
      that linen cloth from which they would emerge no more, she went and took
      up her iron to smooth out the linen of the living. Wrinkled like a last
      year''s apple, spiteful, envious, avaricious with a phenomenal avarice,
      bent double, as if she had been broken in half across the loins by the
      constant motion of passing the iron over the linen, one might have said
      that she had a kind of abnormal and cynical love of a death struggle. She
      never spoke of anything but of the people she had seen die, of the various
      kinds of deaths at which she had been present, and she related with the
      greatest minuteness details which were always similar, just as a sportsman
      recounts his luck.

When Honore Bontemps entered her cottage, he found her preparing the
      starch for the collars of the women villagers, and he said: “Good-evening;
      I hope you are pretty well, Mother Rapet?”

She turned her head round to look at him, and said: “As usual, as
      usual, and you?” “Oh! as for me, I am as well as I could wish,
      but my mother is not well.” “Your mother?” “Yes,
      my mother!” “What is the matter with her?” “She is
      going to turn up her toes, that''s what''s the matter with her!”

The old woman took her hands out of the water and asked with sudden
      sympathy: “Is she as bad as all that?” “The doctor says
      she will not last till morning.” “Then she certainly is very
      bad!” Honore hesitated, for he wanted to make a few preparatory
      remarks before coming to his proposition; but as he could hit upon
      nothing, he made up his mind suddenly.

“How much will you ask to stay with her till the end? You know that
      I am not rich, and I can not even afford to keep a servant girl. It is
      just that which has brought my poor mother to this state—too much
      worry and fatigue! She did the work of ten, in spite of her ninety-two
      years. You don''t find any made of that stuff nowadays!”

La Rapet answered gravely: “There are two prices: Forty sous by day
      and three francs by night for the rich, and twenty sous by day and forty
      by night for the others. You shall pay me the twenty and forty.” But
      the, peasant reflected, for he knew his mother well. He knew how tenacious
      of life, how vigorous and unyielding she was, and she might last another
      week, in spite of the doctor''s opinion; and so he said resolutely: “No,
      I would rather you would fix a price for the whole time until the end. I
      will take my chance, one way or the other. The doctor says she will die
      very soon. If that happens, so much the better for you, and so much the
      worse for her, but if she holds out till to-morrow or longer, so much the
      better for her and so much the worse for you!”

The nurse looked at the man in astonishment, for she had never treated a
      death as a speculation, and she hesitated, tempted by the idea of the
      possible gain, but she suspected that he wanted to play her a trick.
      “I can say nothing until I have seen your mother,” she
      replied.

They did not speak on the road; she walked with short, hasty steps, while
      he strode on with his long legs, as if he were crossing a brook at every
      step.

The cows lying down in the fields, overcome by the heat, raised their
      heads heavily and lowed feebly at the two passers-by, as if to ask them
      for some green grass.

When they got near the house, Honore Bontemps murmured: “Suppose it
      is all over?” And his unconscious wish that it might be so showed
      itself in the sound of his voice.

But the old woman was not dead. She was lying on her back, on her wretched
      bed, her hands covered with a purple cotton counterpane, horribly thin,
      knotty hands, like the claws of strange animals, like crabs, half closed
      by rheumatism, fatigue and the work of nearly a century which she had
      accomplished.

La Rapet went up to the bed and looked at the dying woman, felt her pulse,
      tapped her on the chest, listened to her breathing, and asked her
      questions, so as to hear her speak; and then, having looked at her for
      some time, she went out of the room, followed by Honore. Her decided
      opinion was that the old woman would not last till night. He asked:
      “Well?” And the sick-nurse replied: “Well, she may last
      two days, perhaps three. You will have to give me six francs, everything
      included.”

“Six francs! six francs!” he shouted. “Are you out of
      your mind? I tell you she cannot last more than five or six hours!”
      And they disputed angrily for some time, but as the nurse said she must go
      home, as the time was going by, and as his wheat would not come to the
      farmyard of its own accord, he finally agreed to her terms.

“Very well, then, that is settled; six francs, including everything,
      until the corpse is taken out.”

And he went away, with long strides, to his wheat which was lying on the
      ground under the hot sun which ripens the grain, while the sick-nurse went
      in again to the house.

She had brought some work with her, for she worked without ceasing by the
      side of the dead and dying, sometimes for herself, sometimes for the
      family which employed her as seamstress and paid her rather more in that
      capacity. Suddenly, she asked: “Have you received the last
      sacraments, Mother Bontemps?”

“Good heavens, is it possible? I will go and fetch the cure”;
      and she rushed off to the parsonage so quickly that the urchins in the
      street thought some accident had happened, when they saw her running.

The priest came immediately in his surplice, preceded by a choir boy who
      rang a bell to announce the passage of the Host through the parched and
      quiet country. Some men who were working at a distance took off their
      large hats and remained motionless until the white vestment had
      disappeared behind some farm buildings; the women who were making up the
      sheaves stood up to make the sign of the cross; the frightened black hens
      ran away along the ditch until they reached a well-known hole, through
      which they suddenly disappeared, while a foal which was tied in a meadow
      took fright at the sight of the surplice and began to gallop round and
      round, kicking cut every now and then. The acolyte, in his red cassock,
      walked quickly, and the priest, with his head inclined toward one shoulder
      and his square biretta on his head, followed him, muttering some prayers;
      while last of all came La Rapet, bent almost double as if she wished to
      prostrate herself, as she walked with folded hands as they do in church.

Honore saw them pass in the distance, and he asked: “Where is our
      priest going?” His man, who was more intelligent, replied: “He
      is taking the sacrament to your mother, of course!”

Mother Bontemps confessed, received absolution and communion, and the
      priest took his departure, leaving the two women alone in the suffocating
      room, while La Rapet began to look at the dying woman, and to ask herself
      whether it could last much longer.

The day was on the wane, and gusts of cooler air began to blow, causing a
      view of Epinal, which was fastened to the wall by two pins, to flap up and
      down; the scanty window curtains, which had formerly been white, but were
      now yellow and covered with fly-specks, looked as if they were going to
      fly off, as if they were struggling to get away, like the old woman''s
      soul.

Lying motionless, with her eyes open, she seemed to await with
      indifference that death which was so near and which yet delayed its
      coming. Her short breathing whistled in her constricted throat. It would
      stop altogether soon, and there would be one woman less in the world; no
      one would regret her.

At nightfall Honore returned, and when he went up to the bed and saw that
      his mother was still alive, he asked: “How is she?” just as he
      had done formerly when she had been ailing, and then he sent La Rapet
      away, saying to her: “To-morrow morning at five o''clock, without
      fail.” And she replied: “To-morrow, at five o''clock.”

She came at daybreak, and found Honore eating his soup, which he had made
      himself before going to work, and the sick-nurse asked him: “Well,
      is your mother dead?” “She is rather better, on the contrary,”
      he replied, with a sly look out of the corner of his eyes. And he went
      out.

La Rapet, seized with anxiety, went up to the dying woman, who remained in
      the same state, lethargic and impassive, with her eyes open and her hands
      clutching the counterpane. The nurse perceived that this might go on thus
      for two days, four days, eight days, and her avaricious mind was seized
      with fear, while she was furious at the sly fellow who had tricked her,
      and at the woman who would not die.

Nevertheless, she began to work, and waited, looking intently at the
      wrinkled face of Mother Bontemps. When Honore returned to breakfast he
      seemed quite satisfied and even in a bantering humor. He was decidedly
      getting in his wheat under very favorable circumstances.

La Rapet was becoming exasperated; every minute now seemed to her so much
      time and money stolen from her. She felt a mad inclination to take this
      old woman, this, headstrong old fool, this obstinate old wretch, and to
      stop that short, rapid breath, which was robbing her of her time and
      money, by squeezing her throat a little. But then she reflected on the
      danger of doing so, and other thoughts came into her head; so she went up
      to the bed and said: “Have you ever seen the Devil?” Mother
      Bontemps murmured: “No.”

Then the sick-nurse began to talk and to tell her tales which were likely
      to terrify the weak mind of the dying woman. Some minutes before one dies
      the Devil appears, she said, to all who are in the death throes. He has a
      broom in his hand, a saucepan on his head, and he utters loud cries. When
      anybody sees him, all is over, and that person has only a few moments
      longer to live. She then enumerated all those to whom the Devil had
      appeared that year: Josephine Loisel, Eulalie Ratier, Sophie Padaknau,
      Seraphine Grospied.

Mother Bontemps, who had at last become disturbed in mind, moved about,
      wrung her hands, and tried to turn her head to look toward the end of the
      room. Suddenly La Rapet disappeared at the foot of the bed. She took a
      sheet out of the cupboard and wrapped herself up in it; she put the iron
      saucepan on her head, so that its three short bent feet rose up like
      horns, and she took a broom in her right hand and a tin pail in her left,
      which she threw up suddenly, so that it might fall to the ground noisily.

When it came down, it certainly made a terrible noise. Then, climbing upon
      a chair, the nurse lifted up the curtain which hung at the bottom of the
      bed, and showed herself, gesticulating and uttering shrill cries into the
      iron saucepan which covered her face, while she menaced the old peasant
      woman, who was nearly dead, with her broom.

Terrified, with an insane expression on her face, the dying woman made a
      superhuman effort to get up and escape; she even got her shoulders and
      chest out of bed; then she fell back with a deep sigh. All was over, and
      La Rapet calmly put everything back into its place; the broom into the
      corner by the cupboard the sheet inside it, the saucepan on the hearth,
      the pail on the floor, and the chair against the wall. Then, with
      professional movements, she closed the dead woman''s large eyes, put a
      plate on the bed and poured some holy water into it, placing in it the
      twig of boxwood that had been nailed to the chest of drawers, and kneeling
      down, she fervently repeated the prayers for the dead, which she knew by
      heart, as a matter of business.

And when Honore returned in the evening he found her praying, and he
      calculated immediately that she had made twenty sows out of him, for she
      had only spent three days and one night there, which made five francs
      altogether, instead of the six which he owed her.

Old Baron des Ravots had for forty years been the champion sportsman of
      his province. But a stroke of paralysis had kept him in his chair for the
      last five or six years. He could now only shoot pigeons from the window of
      his drawing-room or from the top of his high doorsteps.

He was a good-natured business man, who had much of the literary spirit of
      a former century. He worshipped anecdotes, those little risque anecdotes,
      and also true stories of events that happened in his neighborhood. As soon
      as a friend came to see him he asked:

On sunny days he had his large reclining chair, similar to a bed, wheeled
      to the hall door. A man servant behind him held his guns, loaded them and
      handed them to his master. Another valet, hidden in the bushes, let fly a
      pigeon from time to time at irregular intervals, so that the baron should
      be unprepared and be always on the watch.

And from morning till night he fired at the birds, much annoyed if he were
      taken by surprise and laughing till he cried when the animal fell straight
      to the earth or, turned over in some comical and unexpected manner. He
      would turn to the man who was loading the gun and say, almost choking with
      laughter:

In autumn, when the shooting season opened, he invited his friends as he
      had done formerly, and loved to hear them firing in the distance. He
      counted the shots and was pleased when they followed each other rapidly.
      And in the evening he made each guest give a faithful account of his day.
      They remained three hours at table telling about their sport.

They were strange and improbable adventures in which the romancing spirit
      of the sportsmen delighted. Some of them were memorable stories and were
      repeated regularly. The story of a rabbit that little Vicomte de Bourril
      had missed in his vestibule convulsed them with laughter each year anew.
      Every five minutes a fresh speaker would say:

“I heard ''birr! birr!'' and a magnificent covey rose at ten paces
      from me. I aimed. Pif! paf! and I saw a shower, a veritable shower of
      birds. There were seven of them!”

Whenever this queen of birds was in season the same ceremony took place at
      each dinner. As they worshipped this incomparable bird, each guest ate one
      every evening, but the heads were all left in the dish.

Then the baron, acting the part of a bishop, had a plate brought to him
      containing a little fat, and he carefully anointed the precious heads,
      holding them by the tip of their slender, needle-like beak. A lighted
      candle was placed beside him and everyone was silent in an anxiety of
      expectation.

Then he took one of the heads thus prepared, stuck a pin through it and
      stuck the pin on a cork, keeping the whole contrivance steady by means of
      little crossed sticks, and carefully placed this object on the neck of a
      bottle in the manner of a tourniquet.

The guest to whom the long beak pointed when the head stopped became the
      possessor of all the heads, a feast fit for a king, which made his
      neighbors look askance.

He took them one by one and toasted them over the candle. The grease
      sputtered, the roasting flesh smoked and the lucky winner ate the head,
      holding it by the beak and uttering exclamations of enjoyment.

When he had finished the last head he was obliged, at the baron''s orders,
      to tell an anecdote to compensate the disappointed ones.

I knew that tall young fellow, Rene de Bourneval. He was an agreeable man,
      though rather melancholy and seemed prejudiced against everything, was
      very skeptical, and he could with a word tear down social hypocrisy. He
      would often say:

“There are no honorable men, or, at least, they are only relatively
      so when compared with those lower than themselves.”

He had two brothers, whom he never saw, the Messieurs de Courcils. I
      always supposed they were by another father, on account of the difference
      in the name. I had frequently heard that the family had a strange history,
      but did not know the details. As I took a great liking to Rene we soon
      became intimate friends, and one evening, when I had been dining with him
      alone, I asked him, by chance: “Are you a son of the first or second
      marriage?” He grew rather pale, and then flushed, and did not speak
      for a few moments; he was visibly embarrassed. Then he smiled in the
      melancholy, gentle manner, which was peculiar to him, and said:

“My dear friend, if it will not weary you, I can give you some very
      strange particulars about my life. I know that you are a sensible man, so
      I do not fear that our friendship will suffer by my  revelations; and
      should it suffer, I should not care about having you for my friend any
      longer.

“My mother, Madame de Courcils, was a poor little, timid woman, whom
      her husband had married for the sake of her fortune, and her whole life
      was one of martyrdom. Of a loving, timid, sensitive disposition, she was
      constantly being ill-treated by the man who ought to have been my father,
      one of those boors called country gentlemen. A month after their marriage
      he was living a licentious life and carrying on liaisons with the wives
      and daughters of his tenants. This did not prevent him from having three
      children by his wife, that is, if you count me in. My mother said nothing,
      and lived in that noisy house like a little mouse. Set aside, unnoticed,
      nervous, she looked at people with her bright, uneasy, restless eyes, the
      eyes of some terrified creature which can never shake off its fear. And
      yet she was pretty, very pretty and fair, a pale blonde, as if her hair
      had lost its color through her constant fear.

“Among the friends of Monsieur de Courcils who constantly came to
      her chateau, there was an ex-cavalry officer, a widower, a man who was
      feared, who was at the same time tender and violent, capable of the most
      determined resolves, Monsieur de Bourneval, whose name I bear. He was a
      tall, thin man, with a heavy black mustache. I am very like him. He was a
      man who had read a great deal, and his ideas were not like those of most
      of his class. His great-grandmother had been a friend of J. J. Rousseau''s,
      and one might have said that he had inherited something of this ancestral
      connection. He knew the Contrat Social, and the Nouvelle Heloise by heart,
      and all those philosophical books which prepared in advance the overthrow
      of our old usages, prejudices, superannuated laws and imbecile morality.

“It seems that he loved my mother, and she loved him, but their
      liaison was carried on so secretly that no one guessed at its existence.
      The poor, neglected, unhappy woman must have clung to him in despair, and
      in her intimacy with him must have imbibed all his ways of thinking,
      theories of free thought, audacious ideas of independent love; but being
      so timid she never ventured to speak out, and it was all driven back,
      condensed, shut up in her heart.

“My two brothers were very hard towards her, like their father, and
      never gave her a caress, and, accustomed to seeing her count for nothing
      in the house, they treated her rather like a servant. I was the only one
      of her sons who really loved her and whom she loved.

“When she died I was seventeen, and I must add, in order that you
      may understand what follows, that a lawsuit between my father and mother
      had been decided in my mother''s favor, giving her the bulk of the
      property, and, thanks to the tricks of the law, and the intelligent
      devotion of a lawyer to her interests, the right to make her will in favor
      of whom she pleased.

“We were told that there was a will at the lawyer''s office and were
      invited to be present at the reading of it. I can remember it, as if it
      were yesterday. It was an imposing scene, dramatic, burlesque and
      surprising, occasioned by the posthumous revolt of that dead woman, by the
      cry for liberty, by the demands of that martyred one who had been crushed
      by our oppression during her lifetime and who, from her closed tomb,
      uttered a despairing appeal for independence.

“The man who believed he was my father, a stout, ruddy-faced man,
      who looked like a butcher, and my brothers, two great fellows of twenty
      and twenty-two, were waiting quietly in their chairs. Monsieur de
      Bourneval, who had been invited to be present, came in and stood behind
      me. He was very pale and bit his mustache, which was turning gray. No
      doubt he was prepared for what was going to happen. The lawyer
      double-locked the door and began to read the will, after having opened, in
      our presence, the envelope, sealed with red wax, of the contents of which
      he was ignorant.”

My friend stopped talking abruptly, and rising, took from his
      writing-table an old paper, unfolded it, kissed it and then continued:
      “This is the will of my beloved mother:

“Then Monsieur de Bourneval stepped forward and said in a loud,
      penetrating voice: ''I, Simon de Bourneval, solemnly declare that this
      writing contains nothing but the strict truth, and I am ready to prove it
      by letters which I possess.''

“On hearing that, Monsieur de Courcils went up to him, and I
      thought that they were going to attack each other. There they stood, both
      of them tall, one stout and the other thin, both trembling. My mother''s
      husband stammered out: ''You are a worthless wretch!'' And the other replied
      in a loud, dry voice: ''We will meet elsewhere, monsieur. I should have
      already slapped your ugly face and challenged you long since if I had not,
      before everything else, thought of the peace of mind during her lifetime
      of that poor woman whom you caused to suffer so greatly.''

“Then, turning to me, he said: ''You are my son; will you come with
      me? I have no right to take you away, but I shall assume it, if you are
      willing to come with me: I shook his hand without replying, and we went
      out together. I was certainly three parts mad.

“Two days later Monsieur de Bourneval killed Monsieur de Courcils in
      a duel. My brothers, to avoid a terrible scandal, held their tongues. I
      offered them and they accepted half the fortune which my mother had left
      me. I took my real father''s name, renouncing that which the law gave me,
      but which was not really mine. Monsieur de Bourneval died three years
      later and I am still inconsolable.”

“Well, I say that my mother''s will was one of the most beautiful,
      the most loyal, as well as one of the grandest acts that a woman could
      perform. Do you not think so?”

Ever since he entered France with the invading army Walter Schnaffs had
      considered himself the most unfortunate of men. He was large, had
      difficulty in walking, was short of breath and suffered frightfully with
      his feet, which were very flat and very fat. But he was a peaceful,
      benevolent man, not warlike or sanguinary, the father of four children
      whom he adored, and married to a little blonde whose little tendernesses,
      attentions and kisses he recalled with despair every evening. He liked to
      rise late and retire early, to eat good things in a leisurely manner and
      to drink beer in the saloon. He reflected, besides, that all that is sweet
      in existence vanishes with life, and he maintained in his heart a fearful
      hatred, instinctive as well as logical, for cannon, rifles, revolvers and
      swords, but especially for bayonets, feeling that he was unable to dodge
      this dangerous weapon rapidly enough to protect his big paunch.

And when night fell and he lay on the ground, wrapped in his cape beside
      his comrades who were snoring, he thought long and deeply about those he
      had left behind and of the dangers in his path. “If he were killed
      what would become of the little ones? Who would provide for them and bring
      them up?” Just at present they were not rich, although he had
      borrowed when he left so as to leave them some money. And Walter Schnaffs
      wept when he thought of all this.

At the beginning of a battle his legs became so weak that he would have
      fallen if he had not reflected that the entire army would pass over his
      body. The whistling of the bullets gave him gooseflesh.

His company was marching on Normandy, and one day he was sent to
      reconnoitre with a small detachment, simply to explore a portion of the
      territory and to return at once. All seemed quiet in the country; nothing
      indicated an armed resistance.

But as the Prussians were quietly descending into a little valley
      traversed by deep ravines a sharp fusillade made them halt suddenly,
      killing twenty of their men, and a company of sharpshooters, suddenly
      emerging from a little wood as large as your hand, darted forward with
      bayonets at the end of their rifles.

Walter Schnaffs remained motionless at first, so surprised and bewildered
      that he did not even think of making his escape. Then he was seized with a
      wild desire to run away, but he remembered at once that he ran like a
      tortoise compared with those thin Frenchmen, who came bounding along like
      a lot of goats. Perceiving a large ditch full of brushwood covered with
      dead leaves about six paces in front of him, he sprang into it with both
      feet together, without stopping to think of its depth, just as one jumps
      from a bridge into the river.

He fell like an arrow through a thick layer of vines and thorny brambles
      that tore his face and hands and landed heavily in a sitting posture on a
      bed of stones. Raising his eyes, he saw the sky through the hole he had
      made in falling through. This aperture might betray him, and he crawled
      along carefully on hands and knees at the bottom of this ditch beneath the
      covering of interlacing branches, going as fast as he could and getting
      away from the scene of the skirmish. Presently he stopped and sat down,
      crouched like a hare amid the tall dry grass.

He heard firing and cries and groans going on for some time. Then the
      noise of fighting grew fainter and ceased. All was quiet and silent.

Suddenly something stirred, beside him. He was frightfully startled. It
      was a little bird which had perched on a branch and was moving the dead
      leaves. For almost an hour Walter Schnaffs'' heart beat loud and rapidly.

Night fell, filling the ravine with its shadows. The soldier began to
      think. What was he to do? What was to become of him? Should he rejoin the
      army? But how? By what road? And he began over again the horrible life of
      anguish, of terror, of fatigue and suffering that he had led since the
      commencement of the war. No! He no longer had the courage! He would not
      have the energy necessary to endure long marches and to face the dangers
      to which one was exposed at every moment.

But what should he do? He could not stay in this ravine in concealment
      until the end of hostilities. No, indeed! If it were not for having to
      eat, this prospect would not have daunted him greatly. But he had to eat,
      to eat every day.

And here he was, alone, armed and in uniform, on the enemy''s territory,
      far from those who would protect him. A shiver ran over him.

All at once he thought: “If I were only a prisoner!” And his
      heart quivered with a longing, an intense desire to be taken prisoner by
      the French. A prisoner, he would be saved, fed, housed, sheltered from
      bullets and swords, without any apprehension whatever, in a good,
      well-kept prison. A prisoner! What a dream:

He rose, determined to put this plan into execution without a moment''s
      delay. But he stood motionless, suddenly a prey to disturbing reflections
      and fresh terrors.

Where would he make himself a prisoner and how? In What direction? And
      frightful pictures, pictures of death came into his mind.

Supposing he should meet some peasants. These peasants seeing a Prussian
      who had lost his way, an unprotected Prussian, would kill him as if he
      were a stray dog! They would murder him with their forks, their picks,
      their scythes and their shovels. They would make a stew of him, a pie,
      with the frenzy of exasperated, conquered enemies.

If he should meet the sharpshooters! These sharpshooters, madmen without
      law or discipline, would shoot him just for amusement to pass an hour; it
      would make them laugh to see his head. And he fancied he was already
      leaning against a wall in-front of four rifles whose little black
      apertures seemed to be gazing at him.

Supposing he should meet the French army itself. The vanguard would take
      him for a scout, for some bold and sly trooper who had set off alone to
      reconnoitre, and they would fire at him. And he could already hear, in
      imagination, the irregular shots of soldiers lying in the brush, while he
      himself, standing in the middle of the field, was sinking to the earth,
      riddled like a sieve with bullets which he felt piercing his flesh.

It was quite a dark, black and silent night. He no longer budged,
      trembling at all the slight and unfamiliar sounds that occur at night. The
      sound of a rabbit crouching at the edge of his burrow almost made him run.
      The cry of an owl caused him positive anguish, giving him a nervous shock
      that pained like a wound. He opened his big eyes as wide as possible to
      try and see through the darkness, and he imagined every moment that he
      heard someone walking close beside him.

After interminable hours in which he suffered the tortures of the damned,
      he noticed through his leafy cover that the sky was becoming bright. He at
      once felt an intense relief. His limbs stretched out, suddenly relaxed,
      his heart quieted down, his eyes closed; he fell asleep.

When he awoke the sun appeared to be almost at the meridian. It must be
      noon. No sound disturbed the gloomy silence. Walter Schnaffs noticed that
      he was exceedingly hungry.

He yawned, his mouth watering at the thought of sausage, the good sausage
      the soldiers have, and he felt a gnawing at his stomach.

He rose from the ground, walked a few steps, found that his legs were weak
      and sat down to reflect. For two or three hours he again considered the
      pros and cons, changing his mind every moment, baffled, unhappy, torn by
      the most conflicting motives.

Finally he had an idea that seemed logical and practical. It was to watch
      for a villager passing by alone, unarmed and with no dangerous tools of
      his trade, and to run to him and give himself up, making him understand
      that he was surrendering.

He took off his helmet, the point of which might betray him, and put his
      head out of his hiding place with the utmost caution.

No solitary pedestrian could be perceived on the horizon. Yonder, to the
      right, smoke rose from the chimney of a little village, smoke from kitchen
      fires! And yonder, to the left, he saw at the end of an avenue of trees a
      large turreted chateau. He waited till evening, suffering frightfully from
      hunger, seeing nothing but flights of crows, hearing nothing but the
      silent expostulation of his empty stomach.

He stretched himself out in his retreat and slept a feverish sleep,
      haunted by nightmares, the sleep of a starving man.

Dawn again broke above his head and he began to make his observations. But
      the landscape was deserted as on the previous day, and a new fear came
      into Walter Schnaffs'' mind—the fear of death by hunger! He pictured
      himself lying at full length on his back at the bottom of his hiding
      place, with his two eyes closed, and animals, little creatures of all
      kinds, approached and began to feed on his dead body, attacking it all
      over at once, gliding beneath his clothing to bite his cold flesh, and a
      big crow pecked out his eyes with its sharp beak.

He almost became crazy, thinking he was going to faint and would not be
      able to walk. And he was just preparing to rush off to the village,
      determined to dare anything, to brave everything, when he perceived three
      peasants walking to the fields with their forks across their shoulders,
      and he dived back into his hiding place.

But as soon as it grew dark he slowly emerged from the ditch and started
      off, stooping and fearful, with beating heart, towards the distant
      chateau, preferring to go there rather than to the village, which seemed
      to him as formidable as a den of tigers.

The lower windows were brilliantly lighted. One of them was open and from
      it escaped a strong odor of roast meat, an odor which suddenly penetrated
      to the olfactories and to the stomach of Walter Schnaffs, tickling his
      nerves, making him breathe quickly, attracting him irresistibly and
      inspiring his heart with the boldness of desperation.

Eight servants were at dinner around a large table. But suddenly one of
      the maids sat there, her mouth agape, her eyes fixed and letting fall her
      glass. They all followed the direction of her gaze.

There was a shriek, only one shriek made up of eight shrieks uttered in
      eight different keys, a terrific screaming of terror, then a tumultuous
      rising from their seats, a jostling, a scrimmage and a wild rush to the
      door at the farther end. Chairs fell over, the men knocked the women down
      and walked over them. In two seconds the room was empty, deserted, and the
      table, covered with eatables, stood in front of Walter Schnaffs, lost in
      amazement and still standing at the window.

After some moments of hesitation he climbed in at the window and
      approached the table. His fierce hunger caused him to tremble as if he
      were in a fever, but fear still held him back, numbed him. He listened.
      The entire house seemed to shudder. Doors closed, quick steps ran along
      the floor above. The uneasy Prussian listened eagerly to these confused
      sounds. Then he heard dull sounds, as though bodies were falling to the
      ground at the foot of the walls, human beings jumping from the first
      floor.

Walter Schnaffs sat down before a clean plate and began to eat. He took
      great mouthfuls, as if he feared he might be interrupted before he had
      swallowed enough. He shovelled the food into his mouth, open like a trap,
      with both hands, and chunks of food went into his stomach, swelling out
      his throat as it passed down. Now and then he stopped, almost ready to
      burst like a stopped-up pipe. Then he would take the cider jug and wash
      down his esophagus as one washes out a clogged rain pipe.

He emptied all the plates, all the dishes and all the bottles. Then,
      intoxicated with drink and food, besotted, red in the face, shaken by
      hiccoughs, his mind clouded and his speech thick, he unbuttoned his
      uniform in order to breathe or he could not have taken a step. His eyes
      closed, his mind became torpid; he leaned his heavy forehead on his folded
      arms on the table and gradually lost all consciousness of things and
      events.

The last quarter of the moon above the trees in the park shed a faint
      light on the landscape. It was the chill hour that precedes the dawn.

Numerous silent shadows glided among the trees and occasionally a blade of
      steel gleamed in the shadow as a ray of moonlight struck it.

The quiet chateau stood there in dark outline. Only two windows were still
      lighted up on the ground floor.

And in an instant the doors, shutters and window panes fell in beneath a
      wave of men who rushed in, breaking, destroying everything, and took the
      house by storm. In a moment fifty soldiers, armed to the teeth, bounded
      into the kitchen, where Walter Schnaffs was peacefully sleeping, and
      placing to his breast fifty loaded rifles, they overturned him, rolled him
      on the floor, seized him and tied his head and feet together.

He was raised from the floor, tied in a chair and examined with lively
      curiosity by his victors, who were blowing like whales. Several of them
      sat down, done up with excitement and fatigue.

“After a desperate encounter the Prussians were obliged to beat a
      retreat, carrying with them their dead and wounded, the number of whom is
      estimated at fifty men. Several were taken prisoners.”

“We will retire in good order,” replied the colonel, “to
      avoid having to return and make another attack with artillery and a larger
      force of men.”

The column drew up in line in the darkness beneath the walls of the
      chateau and filed out, a guard of six soldiers with revolvers in their
      hands surrounding Walter Schnaffs, who was firmly bound.

At daybreak they arrived at the district of La Roche-Oysel, whose national
      guard had accomplished this feat of arms.

The uneasy and excited inhabitants were expecting them. When they saw the
      prisoner''s helmet tremendous shouts arose. The women raised their arms
      in wonder, the old people wept. An old grandfather threw his crutch at the
      Prussian and struck the nose of one of their own defenders.

At length they reached the town hall. The prison was opened and Walter
      Schnaffs, freed from his bonds, cast into it. Two hundred armed men
      mounted guard outside the building.

Then, in spite of the indigestion that had been troubling him for some
      time, the Prussian, wild with joy, began to dance about, to dance
      frantically, throwing out his arms and legs and uttering wild shouts until
      he fell down exhausted beside the wall.

That was how the Chateau de Charnpignet was taken from the enemy after
      only six hours of occupation.

Colonel Ratier, a cloth merchant, who had led the assault at the head of a
      body of the national guard of La Roche-Oysel, was decorated with an order.

“A fearful accident has thrown our sea-faring population, which has
      suffered so much in the last two years, into the greatest consternation.
      The fishing smack commanded by Captain Javel, on entering the harbor was
      wrecked on the rocks of the harbor breakwater.

“In spite of the efforts of the life boat and the shooting of life
      lines from the shore four sailors and the cabin boy were lost.

If the poor man tossed about in the waves and dead, perhaps, beneath his
      wrecked boat, is the one I am thinking of, he took part, just eighteen
      years ago, in another tragedy, terrible and simple as are all these
      fearful tragedies of the sea.

The trawling smack is the ideal fishing boat. So solidly built that it
      fears no weather, with a round bottom, tossed about unceasingly on the
      waves like a cork, always on top, always thrashed by the harsh salt winds
      of the English Channel, it ploughs the sea unweariedly with bellying sail,
      dragging along at its side a huge trawling net, which scours the depths of
      the ocean, and detaches and gathers in all the animals asleep in the
      rocks, the flat fish glued to the sand, the heavy crabs with their curved
      claws, and the lobsters with their pointed mustaches.

When the breeze is fresh and the sea choppy, the boat starts in to trawl.
      The net is fastened all along a big log of wood clamped with iron and is
      let down by two ropes on pulleys at either end of the boat. And the boat,
      driven by the wind and the tide, draws along this apparatus which ransacks
      and plunders the depths of the sea.

Javel had on board his younger brother, four sailors and a cabin boy. He
      had set sail from Boulogne on a beautiful day to go trawling.

But presently a wind sprang up, and a hurricane obliged the smack to run
      to shore. She gained the English coast, but the high sea broke against the
      rocks and dashed on the beach, making it impossible to go into port,
      filling all the harbor entrances with foam and noise and danger.

The smack started off again, riding on the waves, tossed, shaken,
      dripping, buffeted by masses of water, but game in spite of everything;
      accustomed to this boisterous weather, which sometimes kept it roving
      between the two neighboring countries without its being able to make port
      in either.

At length the hurricane calmed down just as they were in the open, and
      although the sea was still high the captain gave orders to cast the net.

So it was lifted overboard, and two men in the bows and two in the stern
      began to unwind the ropes that held it. It suddenly touched bottom, but a
      big wave made the boat heel, and Javel, junior, who was in the bows
      directing the lowering of the net, staggered, and his arm was caught in
      the rope which the shock had slipped from the pulley for an instant. He
      made a desperate effort to raise the rope with the other hand, but the net
      was down and the taut rope did not give.

The man cried out in agony. They all ran to his aid. His brother left the
      rudder. They all seized the rope, trying to free the arm it was bruising.
      But in vain. “We must cut it,” said a sailor, and he took from
      his pocket a big knife, which, with two strokes, could save young Javel''s
      arm.

But if the rope were cut the trawling net would be lost, and this net was
      worth money, a great deal of money, fifteen hundred francs. And it
      belonged to Javel, senior, who was tenacious of his property.

“No, do not cut, wait, I will luff,” he cried, in great
      distress. And he ran to the helm and turned the rudder. But the boat
      scarcely obeyed it, being impeded by the net which kept it from going
      forward, and prevented also by the force of the tide and the wind.

Javel, junior, had sunk on his knees, his teeth clenched, his eyes
      haggard. He did not utter a word. His brother came back to him, in dread
      of the sailor''s knife.

They cast anchor, and then began to turn the capstan to loosen the
      moorings of the net. They loosened them at length and disengaged the
      imprisoned arm, in its bloody woolen sleeve.

Young Javel seemed like an idiot. They took off his jersey and saw a
      horrible sight, a mass of flesh from which the blood spurted as if from a
      pump. Then the young man looked at his arm and murmured: “Foutu”
      (done for).

Then, as the blood was making a pool on the deck of the boat, one of the
      sailors cried: “He will bleed to death, we must bind the vein.”

So they took a cord, a thick, brown, tarry cord, and twisting it around
      the arm above the wound, tightened it with all their might. The blood
      ceased to spurt by slow degrees, and, presently, stopped altogether.

Young Javel rose, his arm hanging at his side. He took hold of it with the
      other hand, raised it, turned it over, shook it. It was all mashed, the
      bones broken, the muscles alone holding it together. He looked at it
      sadly, reflectively. Then he sat down on a folded sail and his comrades
      advised him to keep wetting the arm constantly to prevent it from
      mortifying.

They placed a pail of water beside him, and every few minutes he dipped a
      glass into it and bathed the frightful wound, letting the clear water
      trickle on to it.

“You would be better in the cabin,” said his brother. He went
      down, but came up again in an hour, not caring to be alone. And, besides,
      he preferred the fresh air. He sat down again on his sail and began to
      bathe his arm.

They made a good haul. The broad fish with their white bellies lay beside
      him, quivering in the throes of death; he looked at them as he continued
      to bathe his crushed flesh.

As they were about to return to Boulogne the wind sprang up anew, and the
      little boat resumed its mad course, bounding and tumbling about, shaking
      up the poor wounded man.

Night came on. The sea ran high until dawn. As the sun rose the English
      coast was again visible, but, as the weather had abated a little, they
      turned back towards the French coast, tacking as they went.

Towards evening Javel, junior, called his comrades and showed them some
      black spots, all the horrible tokens of mortification in the portion of
      the arm below the broken bones.

They brought some salt water and poured it on the wound. The injured man
      became livid, ground his teeth and writhed a little, but did not exclaim.

Then he began to cut off his arm. He cut gently, carefully, severing all
      the tendons with this blade that was sharp as a razor. And, presently,
      there was only a stump left. He gave a deep sigh and said:

He seemed relieved and breathed loud. He then began again to pour water on
      the stump of arm that remained.

When the day broke, Javel, junior, took the severed portion of his arm and
      examined it for a long time. Gangrene had set in. His comrades also
      examined it and handed it from one to the other, feeling it, turning it
      over, and sniffing at it.

“It will putrefy, just the same,” said the older brother. Then
      an idea came to the injured man. In order to preserve the fish when the
      boat was long at sea, they packed it in salt, in barrels. He asked:

Then they emptied one of the barrels, which was full from the haul of the
      last few days; and right at the bottom of the barrel they laid the
      detached arm. They covered it with salt, and then put back the fish one by
      one.

The wind was still boisterous. They tacked within sight of Boulogne until
      the following morning at ten o''clock. Young Javel continued to bathe his
      wound. From time to time he rose and walked from one end to the other of
      the boat.

The doctor examined the wound and pronounced it to be in good condition.
      He dressed it properly and ordered the patient to rest. But Javel would
      not go to bed until he got back his severed arm, and he returned at once
      to the dock to look for the barrel which he had marked with a cross.

It was emptied before him and he seized the arm, which was well preserved
      in the pickle, had shrunk and was freshened. He wrapped it up in a towel
      he had brought for the purpose and took it home.

His wife and children looked for a long time at this fragment of their
      father, feeling the fingers, and removing the grains of salt that were
      under the nails. Then they sent for a carpenter to make a little coffin.

The next day the entire crew of the trawling smack followed the funeral of
      the detached arm. The two brothers, side by side, led the procession; the
      parish beadle carried the corpse under his arm.

Javel, junior, gave up the sea. He obtained a small position on the dock,
      and when he subsequently talked about his accident, he would say
      confidentially to his auditors:

“If my brother had been willing to cut away the net, I should still
      have my arm, that is sure. But he was thinking only of his property.”

Great misfortunes do not affect me very much, said John Bridelle, an old
      bachelor who passed for a sceptic. I have seen war at quite close
      quarters; I walked across corpses without any feeling of pity. The great
      brutal facts of nature, or of humanity, may call forth cries of horror or
      indignation, but do not cause us that tightening of the heart, that
      shudder that goes down your spine at sight of certain little heartrending
      episodes.

The greatest sorrow that anyone can experience is certainly the loss of a
      child, to a mother; and the loss of his mother, to a man. It is intense,
      terrible, it rends your heart and upsets your mind; but one is healed of
      these shocks, just as large bleeding wounds become healed. Certain
      meetings, certain things half perceived, or surmised, certain secret
      sorrows, certain tricks of fate which awake in us a whole world of painful
      thoughts, which suddenly unclose to us the mysterious door of moral
      suffering, complicated, incurable; all the deeper because they appear
      benign, all the more bitter because they are intangible, all the more
      tenacious because they appear almost factitious, leave in our souls a sort
      of trail of sadness, a taste of bitterness, a feeling of disenchantment,
      from which it takes a long time to free ourselves.

I have always present to my mind two or three things that others would
      surely not have noticed, but which penetrated my being like fine, sharp
      incurable stings.

You might not perhaps understand the emotion that I retained from these
      hasty impressions. I will tell you one of them. She was very old, but as
      lively as a young girl. It may be that my imagination alone is responsible
      for my emotion.

I am fifty. I was young then and studying law. I was rather sad, somewhat
      of a dreamer, full of a pessimistic philosophy and did not care much for
      noisy cafes, boisterous companions, or stupid girls. I rose early and one
      of my chief enjoyments was to walk alone about eight o''clock in the
      morning in the nursery garden of the Luxembourg.

You people never knew that nursery garden. It was like a forgotten garden
      of the last century, as pretty as the gentle smile of an old lady. Thick
      hedges divided the narrow regular paths,—peaceful paths between two
      walls of carefully trimmed foliage. The gardener''s great shears were
      pruning unceasingly these leafy partitions, and here and there one came
      across beds of flowers, lines of little trees looking like schoolboys out
      for a walk, companies of magnificent rose bushes, or regiments of fruit
      trees.

An entire corner of this charming spot was in habited by bees. Their straw
      hives skillfully arranged at distances on boards had their entrances—as
      large as the opening of a thimble—turned towards the sun, and all
      along the paths one encountered these humming and gilded flies, the true
      masters of this peaceful spot, the real promenaders of these quiet paths.

I came there almost every morning. I sat down on a bench and read.
      Sometimes I let my book fall on my knees, to dream, to listen to the life
      of Paris around me, and to enjoy the infinite repose of these
      old-fashioned hedges.

But I soon perceived that I was not the only one to frequent this spot as
      soon as the gates were opened, and I occasionally met face to face, at a
      turn in the path, a strange little old man.

He wore shoes with silver buckles, knee-breeches, a snuff-colored frock
      coat, a lace jabot, and an outlandish gray hat with wide brim and
      long-haired surface that might have come out of the ark.

He was thin, very thin, angular, grimacing and smiling. His bright eyes
      were restless beneath his eyelids which blinked continuously. He always
      carried in his hand a superb cane with a gold knob, which must have been
      for him some glorious souvenir.

This good man astonished me at first, then caused me the intensest
      interest. I watched him through the leafy walls, I followed him at a
      distance, stopping at a turn in the hedge so as not to be seen.

And one morning when he thought he was quite alone, he began to make the
      most remarkable motions. First he would give some little springs, then
      make a bow; then, with his slim legs, he would give a lively spring in the
      air, clapping his feet as he did so, and then turn round cleverly,
      skipping and frisking about in a comical manner, smiling as if he had an
      audience, twisting his poor little puppet-like body, bowing pathetic and
      ridiculous little greetings into the empty air. He was dancing.

He stopped suddenly, advanced as actors do on the stage, then bowed and
      retreated with gracious smiles, and kissing his hand as actors do, his
      trembling hand, to the two rows of trimmed bushes.

After that I never lost sight of him, and each morning he began anew his
      outlandish exercises.

I was wildly anxious to speak to him. I decided to risk it, and one day,
      after greeting him, I said:

A week later we were friends and I knew his history. He had been a dancing
      master at the opera, in the time of Louis XV. His beautiful cane was a
      present from the Comte de Clermont. And when we spoke about dancing he
      never stopping talking.

“I married La Castris, monsieur. I will introduce you to her if you
      wish it, but she does not get here till later. This garden, you see, is
      our delight and our life. It is all that remains of former days. It seems
      as though we could not exist if we did not have it. It is old and
      distingue, is it not? I seem to breathe an air here that has not changed
      since I was young. My wife and I pass all our afternoons here, but I come
      in the morning because I get up early.”

As soon as I had finished luncheon I returned to the Luxembourg, and
      presently perceived my friend offering his arm ceremoniously to a very old
      little lady dressed in black, to whom he introduced me. It was La Castris,
      the great dancer, beloved by princes, beloved by the king, beloved by all
      that century of gallantry that seems to have left behind it in the world
      an atmosphere of love.

We sat down on a bench. It was the month of May. An odor of flowers
      floated in the neat paths; a hot sun glided its rays between the branches
      and covered us with patches of light. The black dress of La Castris seemed
      to be saturated with sunlight.

“The minuet, monsieur, is the queen of dances, and the dance of
      queens, do you understand? Since there is no longer any royalty, there is
      no longer any minuet.”

And he began in a pompous manner a long dithyrambic eulogy which I could
      not understand. I wanted to have the steps, the movements, the positions,
      explained to me. He became confused, was amazed at his inability to make
      me understand, became nervous and worried.

“Elise, would you like—say—would you like, it would be
      very nice of you, would you like to show this gentleman what it was?”

She turned eyes uneasily in all directions, then rose without saying a
      word and took her position opposite him.

They advanced and retreated with childlike grimaces, smiling, swinging
      each other, bowing, skipping about like two automaton dolls moved by some
      old mechanical contrivance, somewhat damaged, but made by a clever workman
      according to the fashion of his time.

And I looked at them, my heart filled with extraordinary emotions, my soul
      touched with an indescribable melancholy. I seemed to see before me a
      pathetic and comical apparition, the out-of-date ghost of a former
      century.

They suddenly stopped. They had finished all the figures of the dance. For
      some seconds they stood opposite each other, smiling in an astonishing
      manner. Then they fell on each other''s necks sobbing.

I left for the provinces three days later. I never saw them again. When I
      returned to Paris, two years later, the nursery had been destroyed. What
      became of them, deprived of the dear garden of former days, with its
      mazes, its odor of the past, and the graceful windings of its hedges?

Are they dead? Are they wandering among modern streets like hopeless
      exiles? Are they dancing—grotesque spectres—a fantastic minuet
      in the moonlight, amid the cypresses of a cemetery, along the pathways
      bordered by graves?

Their memory haunts me, obsesses me, torments me, remains with me like a
      wound. Why? I do not know.

The two old friends were walking in the garden in bloom, where spring was
      bringing everything to life.

One was a senator, the other a member of the French Academy, both serious
      men, full of very logical but solemn arguments, men of note and
      reputation.

They talked first of politics, exchanging opinions; not on ideas, but on
      men, personalities in this regard taking the predominance over ability.
      Then they recalled some memories. Then they walked along in silence,
      enervated by the warmth of the air.

A large bed of wallflowers breathed out a delicate sweetness. A mass of
      flowers of all species and color flung their fragrance to the breeze,
      while a cytisus covered with yellow clusters scattered its fine pollen
      abroad, a golden cloud, with an odor of honey that bore its balmy seed
      across space, similar to the sachet-powders of perfumers.

The senator stopped, breathed in the cloud of floating pollen, looked at
      the fertile shrub, yellow as the sun, whose seed was floating in the air,
      and said:

“When one considers that these imperceptible fragrant atoms will
      create existences at a hundred leagues from here, will send a thrill
