UPDATE stories SET original_text = 'IN writing this ponderous tome, the author’s desire has been to describe
      the eminent characters and remarkable events of our annals in such a form
      and style that the YOUNG may make acquaintance with them of their own
      accord. For this purpose, while ostensibly relating the adventures of a
      chair, he has endeavored to keep a distinct and unbroken thread of
      authentic history. The chair is made to pass from one to another of those
      personages of whom he thought it most desirable for the young reader to
      have vivid and familiar ideas, and whose lives and actions would best
      enable him to give picturesque sketches of the times. On its sturdy oaken
      legs it trudges diligently from one scene to another, and seems always to
      thrust itself in the way, with most benign complacency, whenever an
      historical personage happens to be looking round for a seat.

There is certainly no method by which the shadowy outlines of departed men
      and women can be made to assume the hues of life more effectually than by
      connecting their images with the substantial and homely reality of a
      fireside chair. It causes us to feel at once that these characters of
      history had a private and familiar existence, and were not wholly
      contained within that cold array of outward action which we are compelled
      to receive as the adequate representation of their lives. If this
      impression can be given, much is accomplished.

Setting aside Grandfather and his auditors, and excepting the adventures
      of the chair, which form the machinery of the work, nothing in the ensuing
      pages can be termed fictitious. The author, it is true, has sometimes
      assumed the license of filling up the outline of history with details for
      which he has none but imaginative authority, but which, he hopes, do not
      violate nor give a false coloring to the truth. He believes that, in this
      respect, his narrative will not be found to convey ideas and impressions
      of which the reader may hereafter find it necessary to purge his mind.

The author’s great doubt is, whether he has succeeded in writing a book
      which will be readable by the class for whom he intends it. To make a
      lively and entertaining narrative for children, with such unmalleable
      material as is presented by the sombre, stern, and rigid characteristics
      of the Puritans and their descendants, is quite as difficult an attempt as
      to manufacture delicate playthings out of the granite, rocks on which New
      England is founded.

GRANDFATHER had been sitting in his old arm-chair all that pleasant
      afternoon, while the children were pursuing their various sports far off
      or near at hand, Sometimes you would have said, “Grandfather is asleep;”
       hut still, even when his eyes were closed, his thoughts were with the
      young people, playing among the flowers and shrubbery of the garden.

He heard the voice of Laurence, who had taken possession of a heap of
      decayed branches which the gardener had lopped from the fruit-trees, and
      was building a little hut for his cousin Clara and himself. He heard
      Clara’s gladsome voice, too, as she weeded and watered the flower-bed
      which had been given her for her own. He could have counted every footstep
      that Charley took, as he trundled his wheelbarrow along the gravel-walk.
      And though’ Grandfather was old and gray-haired, yet his heart leaped with
      joy whenever little Alice came fluttering, like a butterfly, into the
      room. Sire had made each of the children her playmate in turn, and now
      made Grandfather her playmate too, and thought him the merriest of them
      all.

At last the children grew weary of their sports, because a summer
      afternoon is like a long lifetime to the young. So they came into the room
      together, and clustered round Grandfather’s great chair. Little Alice, who
      was hardly five years old, took the privilege of the youngest, and climbed
      his knee. It was a pleasant thing to behold that fair and golden-haired
      child in the lap of the old man, and to think that, different as they
      were, the hearts of both could be gladdened with the same joys.

“Grandfather,” said little Alice, laying her head back upon his arm, “I am
      very tired now. You must tell me a story to make me go to sleep.”

“That is not what story-tellers like,” answered Grandfather, smiling.
      “They are better satisfied when they can keep their auditors awake.”

“But here are Laurence, and Charley, and I,” cried cousin Clara, who was
      twice as old as little Alice. “We will all three keep wide awake. And
      pray, Grandfather, tell us a story about this strange-looking old chair.”

Now, the chair in which Grandfather sat was made of oak, which had grown
      dark with age, but had been rubbed and polished till it shone as bright as
      mahogany. It was very large and heavy, and had a back that rose high above
      Grandfather’s white head. This back was curiously carved in open work, so
      as to represent flowers, and foliage, and other devices, which the
      children had often gazed at, but could never understand what they meant.
      On the very tip-top of the chair, over the head of Grandfather himself,
      was a likeness of a lion’s head, which had such a savage grin that you
      would almost expect to hear it growl and snarl.

The children had seen Grandfather sitting in this chair ever since they
      could remember anything. Perhaps the younger of them supposed that he and
      the chair had come into the world together, and that both had always been
      as old as they were now. At this time, however, it happened to be the
      fashion for ladies to adorn their drawing-rooms with the oldest and oddest
      chairs that could be found. It seemed to cousin Clara that, if these
      ladies could have seen Grandfather’s old chair, they would have thought it
      worth all the rest together. She wondered if it were not even older than
      Grandfather himself, and longed to know all about its history.

“Well, child,” said Grandfather, patting Clara’s cheek, “I can tell you a
      great many stories of my chair. Perhaps your cousin Laurence would like to
      hear them too. They would teach him something about the history and
      distinguished people of his country which he has never read in any of his
      schoolbooks.”

Cousin Laurence was a boy of twelve, a bright scholar, in whom an early
      thoughtfulness and sensibility began to show themselves. His young fancy
      kindled at the idea of knowing all the adventures of this venerable chair.
      He looked eagerly in Grandfather’s face; and even Charley, a bold, brisk,
      restless little fellow of nine, sat himself down on the carpet, and
      resolved to be quiet for at least ten minutes, should the story last so
      long.

Meantime, little Alice was already asleep; so Grandfather, being much
      pleased with such an attentive audience, began to talk about matters that
      happened long ago.

BUT before relating the adventures of the chairs found it necessary to
      speak of circumstances that caused the first settlement of New England.
      For it will soon be perceived that the story of this remarkable chair
      cannot be told without telling a great deal of the history of the country.

So Grandfather talked about the Puritans, {Foot Note: It is more precise
      to give the name of Pilgrims to those Englishmen who went to Holland and
      afterward to Plymouth. They were sometimes called Separatists because they
      separated themselves from the church of England, sometimes Brownists after
      the name of one of their eminent ministers. The Puritans formed a great
      political as well as religious party in England, and did not at first
      separate themselves from the church of England, though those who came to
      this country did so at once.} as those persons were called who thought it
      sinful to practise certain religious forms and ceremonies of the Church of
      England. These Puritans suffered so much persecuted in England that, in
      1607, many of them went over to Holland, and lived ten or twelve years at
      Amsterdam and Leyden. But they feared that, if they continued there much
      longer, they should cease to be England, and should adopt all the manners,
      and ideas, and feelings of the Dutch. For this and other reasons, in the
      year 1620 they embarked on board the ship Mayflower, and crossed the
      ocean, to the shores of Cape Cod. There they made a settlement, and called
      it Plymouth, which, though now a part of Massachusetts, was for a long
      time a colony by itself. And thus was formed the earliest settlement of
      the Puritans in America.

Meantime, those of the Puritans who remained in England continued to
      suffer grievous persecution on account of their religious opinions. They
      began to look around them for some spot where they might worship God, not
      as the king and bishops thought fit, but according to the dictates of
      their own consciences. When their brethren had gone from Holland to
      America, they bethought themselves that they likewise might find refuge
      from persecution there. Several gentlemen among them purchased a tract of
      country on the coast of Massachusetts Bay, and obtained a charter from
      King Charles, which authorized them to make laws for the settlers. In the
      year 1628 they sent over a few people, with John Endicott at their bead,
      to commence a plantation at Salem. {Foot Note: The Puritans had a liking
      for Biblical names for their children, and they sometimes gave names out
      of the Bible to places, Salem means Peace. The Indian name was Naumkeag.}
      Peter Palfrey, Roger Conant, and one or two more had built houses there in
      1626, and may be considered as the first settlers of that ancient town.
      Many other Puritans prepared to follow Endicott.

“And now we come to the chair, my dear children,” said Grandfather. “This
      chair is supposed to have been made of an oak-tree which grew in the park
      of the English Earl of Lincoln between two and three centuries ago. In its
      younger days it used, probably, to stand in the hall of the earl’s castle.
      Do not you see the coat of arms of the family of Lincoln carved in the
      open work of the back? But when his daughter, the Lady Arbella, was
      married to a certain Mr. Johnson, the earl gave her this valuable chair.”

“He was a gentleman of great wealth, who agreed with the Puritans in their
      religious opinions,” answered Grandfather. “And as his belief was the same
      as theirs, he resolved that he would live and die with them. Accordingly,
      in the month of April, 1630, he left his pleasant abode and all his
      comforts in England, and embarked, with Lady Arbella, on board of a ship
      bound for America.”

As Grandfather was frequently impeded by the questions and observations of
      his young auditors, we deem it advisable to omit all such prattle as is
      not essential to the story. We have taken some pains to find out exactly
      what Grandfather said, and here offer to our readers, as nearly as
      possible in his own words, the story of the Lady Arbella.

The ship in which Mr. Johnson and his lady embarked, taking Grandfather’s
      chair along with them, was called the Arbella, in honor of the lady
      herself. A fleet of ten or twelve vessels, with many hundred passengers,
      left England about the same time; for a multitude of people, who were
      discontented with the king’s government and oppressed by the bishops, were
      flocking over to the New World. One of the vessels in the fleet was that
      same Mayflower which had carried the Puritan Pilgrims to Plymouth. And
      now, my children, I would have you fancy yourselves in the cabin of the
      good ship Arbella; because, if you could behold the passengers aboard that
      vessel, you would feel what a blessing and honor it was for New England to
      have such settlers. They were the best men and women of their day.

Among the passengers was John Winthrop, who had sold the estate of his
      forefathers, and was going to prepare a new home for his wife and children
      in the wilderness. He had the king’s charter in his keeping, and was
      appointed the first governor of Massachusetts. Imagine him a person of
      grave and benevolent aspect, dressed in a black velvet suit, with a broad
      ruff around his neck, and a peaked beard upon his chin. {Foot Note: There
      is a statue representing John Winthrop in Scollay Square in Boston. He
      holds the charter in his hand, and a Bible is under his arm.} There was
      likewise a minister of the gospel whom the English bishops had forbidden
      to preach, but who knew that he should have liberty both to preach and
      pray in the forests of America. He wore a black cloak, called a Geneva
      cloak, and had a black velvet cap, fitting close to his head, as was the
      fashion of almost all the Puritan clergymen. In their company came Sir
      Richard Saltonstall, who had been one of the five first projectors of the
      new colony. He soon returned to his native country. But his descendants
      still remain in New England; and the good old family name is as much
      respected in our days as it was in those of Sir Richard.

Not only these, but several other men of wealth and pious ministers were
      in the cabin of the Arbella. One had banished himself forever from the old
      hall where his ancestors had lived for hundreds of years. Another had left
      his quiet parsonage, in a country town of England. Others had come from
      the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge, where they had gained great fame
      for their learning. And here they all were, tossing upon the uncertain and
      dangerous sea, and bound for a home that was more dangerous than even the
      sea itself. In the cabin, likewise, sat the Lady Arbella in her chair,
      with a gentle and sweet expression on her face, but looking too pale and
      feeble to endure the hardships of the wilderness.

Every morning and evening the Lady Arbella gave up her great chair to one
      of the ministers, who took his place in it and read passages from the
      Bible to his companions. And thus, with prayers, and pious conversation,
      and frequent singing of hymns, which the breezes caught from their lips
      and scattered far over the desolate waves, they prosecuted their voyage,
      and sailed into the harbor of Salem in the month of June.

At that period there were but six or eight dwellings in the town; and
      these were miserable hovels, with roofs of straw and wooden chimneys. The
      passengers in the fleet either built huts with bark and branches of trees,
      or erected tents of cloth till they could provide themselves with better
      shelter. Many of them went to form a settlement at Charlestown. It was
      thought fit that the Lady Arbella should tarry in Salem for a time; she
      was probably received as a guest into the family of John Endicott. He was
      the chief person in the plantation, and had the only comfortable house
      which the new-comers had beheld since they left England. So now, children,
      you must imagine Grandfather’s chair in the midst of a new scene.

Suppose it a hot summer’s day, and the lattice-windows of a chamber in Mr.
      Endicott’s house thrown wide open. The Lady Arbella, looking paler than
      she did on shipboard, is sitting in her chair, and thinking mournfully of
      far-off England. She rises and goes to the window. There, amid patches Of
      garden ground and cornfield, she sees the few wretched hovels of the
      settlers, with the still ruder wigwams and cloth tents of the passengers
      who had arrived in the same fleet with herself. Far and near stretches the
      dismal forest of pine-trees, which throw their black shadows over the
      whole land, and likewise over the heart of this poor lady.

All the inhabitants of the little village are busy. One is clearing a spot
      on the verge of the forest for his homestead; another is hewing the trunk
      of a fallen pine-tree, in order to build himself a dwelling; a third is
      hoeing in his field of Indian corn. Here comes a huntsman out of the
      woods, dragging a bear which he has shot, and shouting to the neighbors to
      lend him a hand. There goes a man to the sea-shore, with a spade and a
      bucket, to dig a mess of clams, which were a principal article of food
      with the first settlers. Scattered here and there are two or three dusky
      figures, clad in mantles of fur, with ornaments of bone hanging from their
      ears, and the feathers of wild birds in their coal-black hair. They have
      belts of shellwork slung across their shoulders, and are armed with bows
      and arrows, and flint-headed spears. These are an Indian sagamore and his
      attendants, who have come to gaze at the labors of the white men. And now
      rises a cry that a pack of wolves have seized a young calf in the pasture;
      and every man snatches up his gun or pike and runs in chase of the
      marauding beasts.

Poor Lady Arbella watches all these sights, and feels that this New World
      is fit only for rough and hardy people. None should be here but those who
      can struggle with wild beasts and wild men, and can toil in the heat or
      cold, and can keep their hearts firm against all difficulties and dangers.
      But she is not of these. Her gentle and timid spirit sinks within her;
      and, turning away from the window, she sits down in the great chair and
      wonders whereabouts in the wilderness her friends will dig her grave.

Mr. Johnson had gone, with Governor Winthrop and most of the other
      passengers, to Boston, where he intended to build a house for Lady Arbella
      and himself. Boston was then covered with wild woods, and had fewer
      inhabitants, even, than Salem. During her husband’s absence, poor Lady
      Arbella felt herself growing ill, and was hardly able to stir from the
      great chair. Whenever John Endicott noticed her despondency he doubtless
      addressed her with words of comfort. “Cheer up, my good lady!” he would
      say.

“In a little time you will love this rude life of the wilderness as I do.”
       But Endicott’s heart was as bold and resolute as iron, and he could not
      understand why a woman’s heart should not be of iron too.

Still, however, he spoke kindly to the lady, and then hastened forth to
      till his cornfield and set out fruit-trees, or to bargain with the Indians
      for furs, or perchance to oversee the building of a fort. Also, being a
      magistrate, he had often to punish some idler or evil doer, by ordering
      him to be set in the stocks or scourged at the whipping-post. Often, too,
      as was the custom of the times, he and Mr. Higginson, the minister of
      Salem, held long religious talks together. Thus John Endicott was a man of
      multifarious business, and had no time to look back regretfully to his
      native land. He felt himself fit for the New World and for the work that
      he had to do, and set himself resolutely to accomplish it.

What a contrast, my dear children, between this bold, rough, active man,
      and the gentle Lady Arbella, who was fading away, like a pale English
      flower, in the shadow of the forest! And now the great chair was often
      empty, because Lady Arbella grew too weak to arise from bed.

Meantime, her husband had pitched upon a spot for their new home. He
      returned from Boston to Salem, travelling through the woods on foot, and
      leaning on his pilgrim’s staff. His heart yearned within him; for he was
      eager to tell his wife of the new home which he had chosen. But when he
      beheld her pale and hollow cheek, and found how her strength was wasted,
      he must have known that her appointed home was in a better land. Happy for
      him then—happy both for him and her—if they remembered that
      there was a path to heaven, as well from this heathen wilderness as from
      the Christian land whence they had come. And so, in one short month from
      her arrival, the gentle Lady Arbella faded away and died. They dug a grave
      for her in the new soil, where the roots of the pine-trees impeded their
      spades; and when her bones had rested there nearly two hundred years, and
      a city had sprung up around them, a church of stone was built upon the
      spot.

Charley, almost at the commencement of the foregoing narrative, had
      galloped away, with a prodigious clatter, upon Grandfather’s stick, and
      was not yet returned. So large a boy should have been ashamed to ride upon
      a stick. But Laurence and Clara had listened attentively, and were
      affected by this true story of the gentle lady who had come so far to die
      so soon. Grandfather had supposed that little Alice was asleep; but
      towards the close of the story, happening to look down upon her, he saw
      that her blue eyes were wide open, and fixed earnestly upon his face. The
      tears had gathered in them, like dew upon a delicate flower; but when
      Grandfather ceased to speak, the sunshine of her smile broke forth again.

“Oh, the lady must have been so glad to get to heaven!” exclaimed little
      Alice. “Grandfather, what became of Mr. Johnson?” asked Clara.

“His heart appears to have been quite broken,” answered Grandfather; “for
      he died at Boston within a month after the death of his wife. He was
      buried in the very same tract of ground where he had intended to build a
      dwelling for Lady Arbella and himself. Where their house would have stood,
      there was his grave.”

“The people loved and respected Mr. Johnson so much,” continued
      Grandfather, “that it was the last request of many of them, when they
      died, that they might be buried as near as possible to this good man’s
      grave. And so the field became the first burial ground in Boston. When you
      pass through Tremont Street, along by King’s Chapel, you see a
      burial-ground, containing many old grave-stones and monuments. That was
      Mr. Johnson’s field.”

“How sad is the thought,” observed Clara, “that one of the first things
      which the settlers had to do, when they came to the New World, was to set
      apart a burial-ground!”

“Perhaps,” said Laurence, “if they had found no need of burial-grounds
      here, they would have been glad, after a few years, to go back to
      England.”

Grandfather looked at Laurence, to discover whether he knew how profound
      and true a thing he had said.

NOT long after Grandfather had told the story of his great chair, there
      chanced to be a rainy day. Our friend Charley, after disturbing the
      household with beat of drum and riotous shouts, races up and down the
      staircase, overturning of chairs, and much other uproar, began to feel the
      quiet and confinement within doors intolerable. But as the rain came down
      in a flood, the little fellow was hopelessly a prisoner, and now stood
      with sullen aspect at a window, wondering whether the sun itself were not
      extinguished by so much moisture in the sky.

Charley had already exhausted the less eager activity of the other
      children; and they had betaken themselves to occupations that did not
      admit of his companionship. Laurence sat in a recess near the book-ease,
      reading, not for the first time, the Midsummer Night’s Dream. Clara was
      making a rosary of beads for a little figure of a Sister of Charity, who
      was to attend the Bunker Hill fair and lend her aid in erecting the
      Monument. Little Alice sat on Grandfather’s footstool, with a picture-book
      in her hand; and, for every picture, the child was telling Grandfather a
      story. She did not read from the book (for little Alice had not much skill
      in reading), but told the story out of her own heart and mind.

Charley was too big a boy, of course, to care anything about little
      Alice’s stories, although Grandfather appeared to listen with a good deal
      of interest. Often in a young child’s ideas and fancies, there, is
      something which it requires the thought of a lifetime to comprehend. But
      Charley was of opinion that, if a story must be told, it had better be
      told by Grandfather than little Alice.

Now, Grandfather remembered that Charley had galloped away upon a stick in
      the midst of the narrative of poor Lady Arbella, and I know not whether he
      would have thought it worth while to tell another story merely to gratify
      such an inattentive auditor as Charley. But Laurence laid down his book
      and seconded the request. Clara drew her chair nearer to Grandfather; and
      little Alice immediately closed her picture-book and looked up into his
      face. Grandfather had not the heart to disappoint them.

He mentioned several persons who had a share in the settlement of our
      country, and who would be well worthy of remembrance, if we could find
      room to tell about them all. Among the rest, Grandfather spoke of the
      famous Hugh Peters, a minister of the gospel, who did much good to the
      inhabitants of Salem. Mr. Peters afterwards went back to England, and was
      chaplain to Oliver Cromwell; but Grandfather did not tell the children
      what became of this upright and zealous man at last. In fact, his auditors
      were growing impatient to hear more about the history of the chair.

“After the death of Mr. Johnson,” said he, “Grandfather’s chair came into
      the possession of Roger Williams. He was a clergyman, who arrived at
      Salem, and settled there in 1631. Doubtless the good man has spent many a
      studious hour in this old chair, either penning a sermon or reading some
      abstruse book of theology, till midnight came upon him unawares. At that
      period, as there were few lamps or candles to be had, people used to read
      or work by the light of pitch-pine torches. These supplied the place of
      the ‘midnight oil’ to the learned men of New England.”

Grandfather went on to talk about Roger Williams, and told the children
      several particulars, which we have not room to repeat.

“ROGER WILLIAMS,” said Grandfather, “did not keep possession of the chair
      a great while. His opinions of civil and religious matters differed, in
      many respects, from those of the rulers and clergymen of Massachusetts.
      Now, the wise men of those days believed that the country could not be
      safe unless all the inhabitants thought and felt alike.”

“Possibly there are some who believe it,” said Grandfather; “but they have
      not so much power to act upon their belief as the magistrates and
      ministers had in the days of Roger Williams. They had the power to deprive
      this good man of his home, and to send him out from the midst of them in
      search of a new place of rest. He was banished in 1634, and went first to
      Plymouth colony; but as the people there held the same opinions as those
      of Massachusetts, he was not suffered to remain among them. However, the
      wilderness was wide enough; so Roger Williams took his staff and travelled
      into the forest and made treaties with the Indians, and began a plantation
      which he called Providence.”

“Yes, Charley,” replied Grandfather; “but when Roger Williams travelled
      thither, over hills and valleys, and through the tangled woods, and across
      swamps and streams, it was a journey of several days. Well, his little
      plantation has now grown to be a populous city; and the inhabitants have a
      great veneration for Roger Williams. His name is familiar in the mouths of
      all, because they see it on their bank-bills. How it would have perplexed
      this good clergyman if he had been told that he should give his name to
      the ROGER WILLIAMS BANK!”

“When he was driven from Massachusetts,” said Lawrence, “and began his
      journey into the woods, he must have felt as if he were burying himself
      forever from the sight and knowledge of men. Yet the whole country has now
      heard of him, and will remember him forever.”

“Yes,” answered Grandfather; “it often happens that the outcasts of one
      generation are those who are reverenced as the wisest and best of men by
      the next. The securest fame is that which comes after a man’s death. But
      let us return to our story. When Roger Williams was banished, he appears
      to have given the chair to Mrs. Anne Hutchinson. At all events, it was in
      her possession in 1687. She was a very sharp-witted and well-instructed
      lady, and was so conscious of her own wisdom and abilities that she
      thought it a pity that the world should not have the benefit of them. She
      therefore used to hold lectures in Boston once or twice a week, at which
      most of the women attended. Mrs. Hutchinson presided at these meetings,
      sitting with great state and dignity in Grandfather’s chair.”

“Grandfather, was it positively this very chair?” demanded Clara, laying
      her hand upon its carved elbow.

“Why not, my dear Clara?” said Grandfather. “Well, Mrs. Hutchinson’s
      lectures soon caused a great disturbance; for the ministers of Boston did
      not think it safe and proper that a woman should publicly instruct the
      people in religious doctrines. Moreover, she made the matter worse by
      declaring that the Rev. Mr. Cotton was the only sincerely pious and holy
      clergyman in New England. Now, the clergy of those days had quite as much
      share in the government of the country, though indirectly, as the
      magistrates themselves; so you may imagine what a host of powerful enemies
      were raised up against Mrs. Hutchinson. A synod was convened; that is to
      say, an assemblage of all the ministers in Massachusetts. They declared
      that there were eighty-two erroneous opinions on religious subjects
      diffused among the people, and that Mrs. Hutchinson’s opinions were of the
      number.”

“If they had eighty-two wrong opinions,” observed Charley, “I don’t see
      how they could have any right ones.”

“Mrs. Hutchinson had many zealous friends and converts,” continued
      Grandfather. “She was favored by young Henry Vane, who had come over from
      England a year or two before, and had since been chosen governor of the
      colony, at the age of twenty-four. But Winthrop and most of the other
      leading men, as well as the ministers, felt an abhorrence of her
      doctrines. Thus two opposite parties were formed; and so fierce were the
      dissensions that it was feared the consequence would be civil war and
      bloodshed. But Winthrop and the ministers being the most powerful, they
      disarmed and imprisoned Mrs. Hutchinson’s adherents. She, like Roger
      Williams, was banished.”

“Dear Grandfather, did they drive the poor woman into the woods?”
       exclaimed little Alice, who contrived to feel a human interest even in
      these discords of polemic divinity.

“They did, my darling,” replied Grandfather; “and the end of her life was
      so sad you must not hear it. At her departure, it appears, from the best
      authorities, that she gave the great Chair to her friend Henry Vane. He
      was a young man of wonderful talents and great learning, who had imbibed
      the religious opinions of the Puritans, and left England with the
      intention of spending his life in Massachusetts. The people chose him
      governor; but the controversy about Mrs. Hutchinson, and other troubles,
      caused him to leave country in 1637. You may read the subsequent events of
      his life in the History of England.”

“Yes, Grandfather,” cried Laurence; “and we may read them better in Mr.
      Upham’s biography of Vane. And what a beautiful death he died, long
      afterwards! beautiful, though it was on a scaffold.”

“Many of the most beautiful deaths have been there,” said Grandfather.
      “The enemies of a great and good man can in no other way make him so
      glorious as by giving him the crown of martyrdom.”

In order that the children might fully understand the all-important
      history of the chair, Grandfather now thought fit to speak of the progress
      that was made in settling several colonies. The settlement of Plymouth, in
      1620, has already been mentioned. In 1635 Mr. Hooker and Mr. Stone, two
      ministers, went on foot from Massachusetts to Connecticut, through the
      pathless woods, taking their whole congregation along with them. They
      founded the town of Hartford. In 1638 Mr. Davenport, a very celebrated
      minister, went, with other people, and began a plantation at New Haven. In
      the same year, some persons who had been persecuted in Massachusetts went
      to the Isle of Rhodes, since called Rhode Island, and settled there. About
      this time, also, many settlers had gone to Maine, and were living without
      any regular government. There were likewise settlers near Piscataqua
      River, in the region which is now called New Hampshire.

Thus, at various points along the coast of New England, there were
      communities of Englishmen. Though these communities were independent of
      one another, yet they had a common dependence upon England; and, at so
      vast a distance from their native home, the inhabitants must all have felt
      like brethren. They were fitted to become one united People at a future
      period. Perhaps their feelings of brotherhood were the stronger because
      different nations had formed settlements to the north and to the south. In
      Canada and Nova Scotia were colonies of French. On the banks of the Hudson
      River was a colony of Dutch, who had taken possession of that region many
      years before, and called it New Netherlands.

Grandfather, for aught I know, might have gone on to speak of Maryland and
      Virginia; for the good old gentleman really seemed to suppose that the
      whole surface of the United States was not too broad a foundation to place
      the four legs of his chair upon. But, happening to glance at Charley, he
      perceived that this naughty boy was growing impatient and meditating
      another ride upon a stick. So here, for the present, Grandfather suspended
      the history of his chair.

The children had now learned to look upon the chair with an interest which
      was almost the same as if it were a conscious being, and could remember
      the many famous people whom it had held within its arms.

Even Charley, lawless as he was, seemed to feel that this venerable chair
      must not be clambered upon nor overturned, although he had no scruple in
      taking such liberties With every other chair in the house. Clara treated
      it with still greater reverence, often taking occasion to smooth its
      cushion, and to brush the dust from the carved flowers and grotesque
      figures of its oaken back and arms. Laurence would sometimes sit a whole
      hour, especially at twilight, gazing at the chair, and, by the spell of
      his imaginations, summoning up its ancient occupants to appear in it
      again.

Little Alice evidently employed herself in a similar way; for once when
      Grandfather had gone abroad, the child was heard talking with the gentle
      Lady Arbella, as if she were still sitting in the chair. So sweet a child
      as little Alice may fitly talk with angels, such as the Lady Arbella had
      long since become.

Grandfather was soon importuned for more stories about the chair. He had
      no difficulty in relating them; for it really seemed as if every person
      noted in our early history had, on some occasion or other, found repose
      within its comfortable arms. If Grandfather took pride in anything, it was
      in being the possessor of such an honorable and historic elbow-chair.

“I know not precisely who next got possession of the chair after Governor
      Vane went back to England,” said Grandfather. “But there is reason to
      believe that President Dunster sat in it, when he held the first
      Commencement at Harvard College. You have often heard, children, how
      careful our forefathers were to give their young people a good education.
      They had scarcely cut down trees enough to make room for their own
      dwellings before they began to think of establishing a college. Their
      principal object was, to rear up pious and learned ministers; and hence
      old writers call Harvard College a school of the prophets.”

“It is a long while since I took my degree, Charley. You must ask some of
      the recent graduates,” answered Grandfather. “As I was telling you,
      President Dunster sat in Grandfather’s chair in 1642, when he conferred
      the degree of bachelor of arts on nine young men. They were the first in
      America who had received that honor. And now, my dear auditors, I must
      confess that there are contradictory statements and some uncertainty about
      the adventures of the chair for a period of almost ten years. Some say
      that it was occupied by your own ancestor, William Hawthorne, first
      speaker of the House of Representatives. I have nearly satisfied myself,
      however, that, during most of this questionable period, it was literally
      the chair of state. It gives me much pleasure to imagine that several
      successive governors of Massachusetts sat in it at the council board.”

“But, Grandfather,” interposed Charley, who was a matter-of-fact little
      person, “what reason have you, to imagine so?”

“With Charley’s permission, I will,” replied Grandfather, smiling. “Let us
      consider it settled, therefore, that Winthrop, Bellingham, Dudley, and
      Endicott, each of them, when chosen governor, took his seat in our great
      chair on election day. In this chair, likewise, did those excellent
      governors preside while holding consultations with the chief councillors
      of the province, who were styled assistants. The governor sat in this
      chair, too, whenever messages were brought to him from the chamber of
      representatives.”

And here Grandfather took occasion to talk rather tediously about the
      nature and forms of government that established themselves, almost
      spontaneously, in Massachusetts and the other New England colonies.
      Democracies were the natural growth of the New World. As to Massachusetts,
      it was at first intended that the colony should be governed by a council
      in London. But in a little while the people had the whole power in their
      own hands, and chose annually the governor, the councillors, and the
      representatives. The people of Old England had never enjoyed anything like
      the liberties and privileges which the settlers of New England now
      possessed. And they did not adopt these modes of government after long
      study, but in simplicity, as if there were no other way for people to be
      ruled.

“But, Laurence,” continued Grandfather, “when you want instruction on
      these points, you must seek it in Mr. Bancroft’s History. I am merely
      telling the history of a chair. To proceed. The period during which the
      governors sat in our chair was not very full of striking incidents. The
      province was now established on a secure foundation; but it did not
      increase so rapidly as at first, because the Puritans were no longer
      driven from England by persecution. However, there was still a quiet and
      natural growth. The Legislature incorporated towns, and made new purchases
      of lands from the Indians. A very memorable event took place in 1643. The
      colonies of Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven formed a
      union, for the purpose of assisting each other in difficulties, for mutual
      defence against their enemies. They called themselves the United Colonies
      of New England.”

“No,” replied Grandfather; “the different colonies did not compose one
      nation together; it was merely a confederacy among the governments: It
      somewhat resembled the league of the Amphictyons, which you remember in
      Grecian history. But to return to our chair. In 1644 it was highly
      honored; for Governor Endicott sat in it when he gave audience to an
      ambassador from the French governor of Acadia, or Nova Scotia. A treaty of
      peace between Massachusetts and the French colony was then signed.”

“Did England allow Massachusetts to make war and peace with foreign
      countries?” asked Laurence.

“Massachusetts and the whole of New England was then almost independent of
      the mother country,” said Grandfather. “There was now a civil war in
      England; and the king, as you may well suppose, had his hands full at
      home, and could pay but little attention to these remote colonies. When
      the Parliament got the power into their hands, they likewise had enough to
      do in keeping down the Cavaliers. Thus New England, like a young and hardy
      lad whose father and mother neglect it, was left to take care of itself.
      In 1649 King Charles was beheaded. Oliver Cromwell then became Protector
      of England; and as he was a Puritan himself, and had risen by the valor of
      the English Puritans, he showed himself a loving and indulgent father to
      the Puritan colonies in America.”

Grandfather might have continued to talk in this dull manner nobody knows
      how long; but suspecting that Charley would find the subject rather dry,
      he looked sidewise at that vivacious little fellow, and saw him give an
      involuntary yawn. Whereupon Grandfather proceeded with the history of the
      chair, and related a very entertaining incident, which will be found in
      the next chapter.

“ACCORDING to the most authentic records, my dear children,” said
      Grandfather, “the chair, about this time, had the misfortune to break its
      leg. It was probably on account of this accident that it ceased to be the
      seat of the governors of Massachusetts; for, assuredly, it would have been
      ominous of evil to the commonwealth if the chair of state had tottered
      upon three legs. Being therefore sold at auction,—alas I what a
      vicissitude for a chair that had figured in such high company!—our
      venerable friend was knocked down to a certain Captain John Hull. This old
      gentleman, on carefully examining the maimed chair, discovered that its
      broken leg might be clamped with iron and made as serviceable as ever.”

“Here is the very leg that was broken!” exclaimed Charley, throwing
      himself down on the floor to look at it. “And here are the iron clamps.
      How well it was mended!”

When they had all sufficiently examined the broken leg, Grandfather told
      them a story about Captain John Hull and the Pine-tree Shillings.

The Captain John Hull aforesaid was the mint-master of Massachusetts, and
      coined all the money that was made there. This was a new line of business,
      for, in the earlier days of the colony, the current coinage consisted of
      gold and silver money of England, Portugal, and Spain. These coins being
      scarce, the people were often forced to barter their commodities instead
      of selling them.

For instance, if a man wanted to buy a coat, he perhaps exchanged a
      bear-skin for it. If he wished for a barrel of molasses, he might purchase
      it with a pile of pine boards. Musket-bullets were used instead of
      farthings. The Indians had a sort of money, called wampum, which was made
      of clam-shells; and this strange sort of specie was likewise taken in
      payment of debts by the English settlers. Bank-bills had never been heard
      of. There was not money enough of any kind, in many parts of the country,
      to pay the salaries of the ministers; so that they sometimes had to take
      quintals of fish, bushels of corn, or cords of wood, instead of silver or
      gold.

As the people grew more numerous, and their trade one with another
      increased, the want of current money was still more sensibly felt. To
      supply the demand, the General Court passed a law for establishing a
      coinage of shillings, sixpences, and threepences. Captain John Hull was
      appointed to manufacture this money, and was to have about one shilling
      out of every twenty to pay him for the trouble of making them.

Hereupon all the old silver in the colony was handed over to Captain John
      Hull. The battered silver cans and tankards, I suppose, and silver
      buckles, and broken spoons, and silver buttons of worn-out coats, and
      silver hilts of swords that had figured at court,—all such curious
      old articles were doubtless thrown into the melting-pot together. But by
      far the greater part of the silver consisted of bullion from the mines of
      South America, which the English buccaneers—who were little better
      than pirates—had taken from the Spaniards and brought to
      Massachusetts.

All this old and new silver being melted down and coined, the result was
      an immense amount of splendid shillings, sixpences, and threepences. Each
      had the date, 1652, on the one side, and the figure of a pine-tree on the
      other. Hence they were called pine-tree shillings. And for every twenty
      shillings that he coined, you will remember, Captain John Hull was
      entitled to put one shilling into his own pocket.

The magistrates soon began to suspect that the mint master would have the
      best of the bargain. They offered him a large sum of money if he would but
      give up that twentieth shilling which he was continually dropping into his
      own pocket. But Captain Hull declared himself perfectly satisfied with the
      shilling. And well he might be; for so diligently did he labor, that, in a
      few years, his pockets, his money-bags, and his strong box were
      overflowing with pine-tree shillings. This was probably the case when he
      came into possession of Grandfather’s chair; and, as he had worked so hard
      at the mint, it was certainly proper that he should have a comfortable
      chair to rest him self in.

When the mint-master had grown very rich, a young man, Samuel Sewall by
      name, came a-courting to his only daughter. His daughter—whose name
      I do not know, but we will call her Betsey—was a fine, hearty
      damsel, by no means so slender as some young ladies of our own days. On
      the contrary, having always fed heartily on pumpkin-pies, doughnuts,
      Indian puddings, and other Puritan dainties, she was as round and plump as
      a pudding herself. With this round, rosy Miss Betsey did Samuel Sewall
      fall in love. As he was a young man of good character, industrious in his
      business, and a member of the church, the mint-master very readily gave
      his consent.

“Yes, you may take her,” said he, in his rough way, “and you’ll find her a
      heavy burden enough!”

On the wedding day, we may suppose that honest John Hull dressed himself
      in a plum-colored coat, all the buttons of which were made of pine-tree
      shillings. The buttons of his waistcoat were sixpences; and the knees of
      his small-clothes were buttoned with silver threepences. Thus attired, he
      sat with great dignity in Grandfather’s chair; and, being a portly old
      gentleman, he completely filled it from elbow to elbow. On the opposite
      side of the room, between her bride-maids, sat Miss Betsey. She was
      blushing with all her might, and looked like a full-blown peony, or a
      great red apple.

There, too, was the bridegroom, dressed in a fine purple coat and
      gold-lace waistcoat, with as much other finery as the Puritan laws and
      customs would allow him to put on. His hair was cropped close to his head,
      because Governor Endicott had forbidden any man to wear it below the ears.
      But he was a very personable young man; and so thought the bridemaids and
      Miss Betsey herself.

The mint-master also was pleased with his new Son-in-law; especially as he
      had courted Miss Betsey out of pure love, and had said nothing at all
      about her portion. So, when the marriage ceremony was over, Captain Hull
      whispered a word to two of his men-servants, who immediately went out, and
      soon returned, lugging in a large pair of scales. They were such a pair as
      wholesale merchants use for weighing bulky commodities; and quite a bulky
      commodity was now to be weighed in them.

Miss Betsey—or Mrs. Sewall, as we must now call her—did as she
      was bid, like a dutiful child, without any question of the why and
      wherefore. But what her father could mean, unless to make her husband pay
      for her by the pound (in which case she would have been a dear bargain),
      she had not the least idea.

The box to which the mint-master pointed was a huge, square, iron-bound,
      oaken chest; it was big enough, my children, for all four of you to play
      at hide-and-seek in. The servants tugged with might and main, but could
      not lift this enormous receptacle, and were finally obliged to drag it
      across the floor. Captain Hull then took a key from his girdle, unlocked
      the chest, and lifted its ponderous lid. Behold! it was full to the brim
      of bright pine-tree shillings, fresh from the mint; and Samuel Sewall
      began to think that his father-in-law had got possession of all the money
      in the Massachusetts treasury. But it was only the mint-master’s honest
      share of the coinage.

Then the servants, at Captain Hull’s command, heaped double handfuls of
      shillings into one side of the scales, while Betsey remained in the other.
      Jingle, jingle, went the shillings, as handful after handful was thrown
      in, till, plump and ponderous as she was, they fairly weighed the young
      lady from the floor.

“There, son Sewall!” cried the honest mint-master, resuming his seat in
      Grandfather’s chair, “take these shillings for my daughter’s portion. Use
      her kindly, and thank Heaven for her. It is not every wife that’s worth
      her weight in silver!”

The children laughed heartily at this legend, and would hardly be
      convinced but that Grandfather had made it out of his own head. He assured
      them faithfully, however, that he had found it in the pages of a grave
      historian, and had merely tried to tell it in a somewhat funnier style. As
      for Samuel Sewall, he afterwards became chief justice of Massachusetts.

“Well, Grandfather,” remarked Clara, “if wedding portions nowadays were
      paid as Miss Betsey’s was, young ladies would not pride themselves upon an
      airy figure, as many of them do.”

WHEN his little audience next assembled round the chair, Grandfather gave
      them a doleful history of the Quaker persecution, which began in 1656, and
      raged for about three years in Massachusetts.

He told them how, in the first place, twelve of the converts of George
      Fox, the first Quaker in the world, had come over from England. They
      seemed to be impelled by an earnest love for the souls of men, and a pure
      desire to make known what they considered a revelation from Heaven. But
      the rulers looked upon them as plotting the downfall of all government and
      religion. They were banished from the colony. In a little while, however,
      not only the first twelve had returned, but a multitude of other Quakers
      had come to rebuke the rulers and to preach against the priests and
      steeple-houses.

Grandfather described the hatred and scorn with which these enthusiasts
      were received. They were thrown into dungeons; they were beaten with many
      stripes, women as well as men; they were driven forth into the wilderness,
      and left to the tender mercies of tender mercies of wild beasts and
      Indians. The children were amazed hear that the more the Quakers were
      scourged, and imprisoned, and banished, the more did the sect increase,
      both by the influx of strangers and by converts from among the Puritans,
      But Grandfather told them that God had put something into the soul of man,
      which always turned the cruelties of the persecutor to naught.

He went on to relate that, in 1659, two Quakers, named William Robinson
      and Marmaduke Stephenson, were hanged at Boston. A woman had been
      sentenced to die with them, but was reprieved on condition of her leaving
      the colony. Her name was Mary Dyer. In the year 1660 she returned to
      Boston, although she knew death awaited her there; and, if Grandfather had
      been correctly informed, an incident had then taken place which connects
      her with our story. This Mary Dyer had entered the mint-master’s dwelling,
      clothed in sackcloth and ashes, and seated herself in our great chair with
      a sort of dignity and state. Then she proceeded to deliver what she called
      a message from Heaven, but in the midst of it they dragged her to prison.

“Grandfather,” cried Charley, clinching his fist, “I would have fought for
      that poor Quaker woman!”

“Ah, but if a sword had been drawn for her,” said Laurence, “it would have
      taken away all the beauty of her death.”

It seemed as if hardly any of the preceding stories had thrown such an
      interest around Grandfather’s chair as did the fact that the poor,
      persecuted, wandering Quaker woman had rested in it for a moment. The
      children were so much excited that Grandfather found it necessary to bring
      his account of the persecution to a close.

“In 1660, the same year in which Mary Dyer was executed,” said he,
      “Charles II. was restored to the throne of his fathers. This king had many
      vices; but he would not permit blood to be shed, under pretence of
      religion, in any part of his dominions. The Quakers in England told him
      what had been done to their brethren in Massachusetts; and he sent orders
      to Governor Endicott to forbear all such proceedings in future. And so
      ended the Quaker persecution,—one of the most mournful passages in
      the history of our forefathers.”

Grandfather then told his auditors, that, shortly after the above
      incident, the great chair had been given by the mint-master to the Rev.
      Mr. John Eliot. He was the first minister of Roxbury. But besides
      attending to the pastoral duties there, he learned the language of the red
      men, and often went into the woods to preach to them. So earnestly did he
      labor for their conversion that he has always been called the apostle to
      the Indians. The mention of this holy man suggested to Grandfather the
      propriety of giving a brief sketch of the history of the Indians, so far
      as they were connected with the English colonists.

A short period before the arrival of the first Pilgrims at Plymouth there
      had been a very grievous plague among the red men; and the sages and
      ministers of that day were inclined to the opinion that Providence had
      sent this mortality in order to make room for the settlement of the
      English. But I know not why we should suppose that an Indian’s life is
      less precious, in the eye of Heaven, than that of a white man. Be that as
      it may, death had certainly been very busy with the savage tribes.

In many places the English found the wigwams deserted and the cornfields
      growing to waste, with none to harvest the grain. There were heaps of
      earth also, which, being dug open, proved to be Indian graves, containing
      bows and flint-headed spears and arrows; for the Indians buried the dead
      warrior’s weapons along with him. In some spots there were skulls and
      other human bones lying unburied. In 1633, and the year afterwards, the
      small-pox broke out among the Massachusetts Indians, multitudes of whom
      died by this terrible disease of the Old World. These misfortunes made
      them far less powerful than they had formerly been.

For nearly half a century after the arrival of the English the red men
      showed themselves generally inclined to peace and amity. They often made
      submission when they might have made successful war. The Plymouth
      settlers, led by the famous Captain Miles Standish, slew some of them, in
      1623, without any very evident necessity for so doing. In 1636, and the
      following year, there was the most dreadful war that had yet occurred
      between the Indians and the English. The Connecticut settlers, assisted by
      a celebrated Indian chief named Uncas, bore the brunt of this war, with
      but little aid from Massachusetts. Many hundreds of the hostile Indians
      were slain or burned in their wigwams. Sassacus, their sachem, fled to
      another tribe, after his own people were defeated; but he was murdered by
      them, and his head was sent to his English enemies.

From that period down to the time of King Philip’s War, which will be
      mentioned hereafter, there was not much trouble with the Indians. But the
      colonists were always on their guard, and kept their weapons ready for the
      conflict.

“I have sometimes doubted,” said Grandfather, when he had told these
      things to the Children,—“I have sometimes doubted whether there was
      more than a single man among our forefathers who realized that an Indian
      possesses a mind, and a heart, and an immortal soul. That single man was
      John Eliot. All the rest of the early settlers seemed to think that the
      Indians were an inferior race of beings, whom the Creator had merely
      allowed to keep possession of this beautiful country till the white men
      should be in want of it.”

“Did the pious men of those days never try to make Christian of them?”
       asked Laurence. “Sometimes, it is true,” answered Grandfather, “the
      magistrates and ministers would talk about civilizing and converting the
      red people. But, at the bottom of their hearts, they would have had almost
      as much expectation of civilizing the wild bear of the woods and making
      him fit for paradise. They felt no faith in the success of any such
      attempts, because they had no love for the poor Indians. Now, Eliot was
      full of love for them; and therefore so full of faith and hope that he
      spent the labor of a lifetime in their behalf.”

“Ah, Charley, there spoke the very spirit of our forefathers.” replied
      Grandfather. “But Mr. Eliot a better spirit. He looked upon them as his
      brethren. He persuaded as many of them as he could to leave off their idle
      and wandering habits, and to build houses and cultivate the earth, as the
      English did. He established schools among them and taught many of the
      Indians how to read. He taught them, likewise, how to pray. Hence they
      were called ‘praying Indians.’ Finally, having spent the best years of his
      life for their good, Mr. Eliot resolved to spend the remainder in doing
      them a yet greater benefit.”

“He sat down in his study,” continued Grandfather, “and began a
      translation of the Bible into the Indian tongue. It was while he was
      engaged in this pious work that the mint-master gave him our great chair.
      His toil needed it and deserved it.”

“O Grandfather, tell us all about that Indian Bible!” exclaimed Laurence.
      “I have seen it in the library of the Athenaeum; and the tears came into
      my eyes to think that there were no Indians left to read it.”

As Grandfather was a great admirer of the apostle Eliot, he was glad to
      comply with the earnest request which Laurence had made at the close of
      the last chapter. So he proceeded to describe how good Mr. Eliot labored,
      while he was at work upon the Indian Bible.

My dear children, what a task would you think it, even with a long
      lifetime before you, were you bidden to copy every chapter, and verse, and
      word, in yonder family Bible! Would not this be a heavy toil? But if the
      task were, not to write off the English Bible, but to learn a language
      utterly unlike all other tongues, a language which hitherto had never been
      learned, except by the Indians themselves, from their mothers’ lips,—a
      language never written, and the strange words of which seemed
      inexpressible by letters,—if the task were, first to learn this new
      variety of speech, and then to translate the Bible into it, and to do it
      so carefully that not one idea throughout the holy book should be changed,—what
      would induce you to undertake this toil? Yet this was what the apostle
      Eliot did.

It was a mighty work for a man, now growing old, to take upon himself. And
      what earthly reward could he expect from it? None; no reward on earth. But
      he believed that the red men were the descendants of those lost tribes of
      Israel of whom history has been able to tell us nothing for thousands of
      years. He hoped that God had sent the English across the ocean, Gentiles
      as they were, to enlighten this benighted portion of his once chosen race.
      And when he should be summoned hence, he trusted to meet blessed spirits
      in another world, whose bliss would have been earned by his patient toil
      in translating the word of God. This hope and trust were far dearer to him
      than anything that earth could offer.

Sometimes, while thus at work, he was visited by learned men, who desired
      to know what literary undertaking Mr. Eliot had in hand. They, like
      himself, had been bred in the studious cloisters of a university, and were
      supposed to possess all the erudition which mankind has hoarded up from
      age to age. Greek and Latin were as familiar to them as the bab-ble of
      their childhood. Hebrew was like their mother tongue. They had grown gray
      in study; their eyes were bleared with poring over print and manuscript by
      the light of the midnight lamp.

And yet, how much had they left unlearned! Mr. Eliot would put into their
      hands some of the pages which he had been writing; and behold! the
      gray-headed men stammered over the long, strange words, like a little
      child in his first attempts to read. Then would the apostle call to him an
      Indian boy, one of his scholars, and show him the manuscript which had so
      puzzled the learned Englishmen.

“Read this, my child,” would he say; “these are some brethren of mine, who
      would fain hear the sound of thy native tongue.”

Then would the Indian boy cast his eyes over the mysterious page, and read
      it so skilfully that it sounded like wild music. It seemed as if the
      forest leaves were singing in the ears of his auditors, and as the roar of
      distant streams were poured through the young Indian’s voice. Such were
      the sounds amid which the language of the red man had been formed; and
      they were still heard to echo in it.

The lesson being over, Mr. Eliot would give the Indian boy an apple or a
      cake, and bid him leap forth into the open air which his free nature
      loved. The Apostle was kind to children, and even shared in their sports
      sometimes. And when his visitors had bidden him farewell, the good man
      turned patiently to his toil again.

No other Englishman had ever understood the Indian character so well, nor
      possessed so great an influence over the New England tribes, as the
      apostle did. His advice and assistance must often have been valuable to
      his countrymen in their transactions with the Indians. Occasionally,
      perhaps, the governor and some of the councillors came to visit Mr. Eliot.
      Perchance they were seeking some method to circumvent the forest people.
      They inquired, it may be, how they could obtain possession of such and
      such a tract of their rich land. Or they talked of making the Indians
      their servants; as if God had destined them for perpetual bondage to the
      more powerful white man.

Perhaps, too, some warlike captain, dressed in his buff coat, with a
      corselet beneath it, accompanied the governor and councillors. Laying his
      hand upon his sword hilt, he would declare that the only method of dealing
      with the red men was to meet them with the sword drawn and the musket
      presented.

“Treat these sons of the forest as men and brethren,” he would say; “and
      let us endeavor to make them Christians. Their forefathers were of that
      chosen race whom God delivered from Egyptian bondage. Perchance he has
      destined us to deliver the children from the more cruel bondage of
      ignorance and idolatry. Chiefly for this end, it may be, we were directed
      across the ocean.”

When these other visitors were gone, Mr. Eliot bent himself again over the
      half-written page. He dared hardly relax a moment from his toil. He felt
      that, in the book which he was translating, there was a deep human as well
      as heavenly wisdom, which would of itself suffice to civilize and refine
      the savage tribes. Let the Bible be diffused among them, and all earthly
      good would follow. But how slight a consideration was this, when he
      reflected that the eternal welfare of a whole race of men depended upon
      his accomplishment of the task which he had set himself! What if his hands
      should be palsied? What if his mind should lose its vigor? What if death
      should come upon him ere the work were done? Then must the red man wander
      in the dark wilderness of heathenism forever.

Impelled by such thoughts as these, he sat writing in the great chair when
      the pleasant summer breeze came in through his open casement; and also
      when the fire of forest logs sent up its blaze and smoke, through the
      broad stone chimney, into the wintry air. Before the earliest bird sang in
      the morning the apostle’s lamp was kindled; and, at midnight, his weary
      head was not yet upon its pillow. And at length, leaning back in the great
      chair, he could say to himself, with a holy triumph, “The work is
      finished!”

It was finished. Here was a Bible for the Indians. Those long-lost
      descendants of the ten tribes of Israel would now learn the history of
      their forefathers. That grace which the ancient Israelites had forfeited
      was offered anew to their children.

There is no impiety in believing that, when his long life was over, the
      apostle of the Indians was welcomed to the celestial abodes by the
      prophets of ancient days and by those earliest apostles and evangelists
      who had drawn their inspiration from the immediate presence of the
      Saviour. They first had preached truth and salvation to the world. And
      Eliot, separated from them by many centuries, yet full of the same spirit,
      has borne the like message to the New World of the west. Since the first
      days of Christianity, there has been no man more worthy to be numbered in
      the brotherhood of the apostles than Eliot.

“My heart is not satisfied to think,” observed Laurence, “that Mr. Eliot’s
      labors have done no good except to a few Indians of his own time.
      Doubtless he would not have regretted his toil, if it were the means of
      saving but a single soul. But it is a grievous thing to me that he should
      have toiled so hard to translate the Bible, and now the language and the
      people are gone! The Indian Bible itself is almost the only relic of
      both.”

“Laurence,” said his Grandfather, “if ever you should doubt that man is
      capable of disinterested zeal for his brother’s good, then remember how
      the apostle Eliot toiled. And if you should feel your own self-interest
      pressing upon your heart too closely, then think of Eliot’s Indian Bible.
      It is good for the world that such a man has lived and left this emblem of
      his life.”

The tears gushed into the eyes of Laurence, and he acknowledged that Eliot
      had not toiled in vain. Little Alice put up her arms to Grandfather, and
      drew down his white head beside her own golden locks.

And, doubtless, good Mr. Eliot would gladly receive the kiss of so sweet a
      child as little Alice, and would think it a portion of his reward in
      heaven.

Grandfather now observed that Dr. Francis had written a very beautiful
      Life of Eliot, which he advised Laurence to peruse. He then spoke of King
      Philip’s War, which began in 1675, and terminated with the death of King
      Philip, in the following year. Philip was a proud, fierce Indian, whom Mr.
      Eliot had vainly endeavored to convert to the Christian faith.

“It must have been a great anguish to the apostle,” continued Grandfather,
      “to hear of mutual slaughter and outrage between his own countrymen and
      those for whom he felt the affection of a father. A few of the praying
      Indians joined the followers of King Philip. A greater number fought on
      the side of the English. In the course of the war the little community of
      red people whom Mr. Eliot had begun to civilize was scattered, and
      probably never was restored to a flourishing condition. But his zeal did
      not grow cold; and only about five years before his death he took great
      pains in preparing a new edition of the Indian Bible.”

“I do wish, Grandfather,” cried Charley, “you would tell us all about the
      battles in King Philip’s War.”

“No, Charley,” replied Grandfather, “I have no time to spare in talking
      about battles. You must be content with knowing that it was the bloodiest
      war that the Indians had ever waged against the white men; and that, at
      its close, the English set King Philip’s head upon a pole.”

“Their most noted captain was Benjamin Church, a very famous warrior,”
       said Grandfather. “But I assure you, Charley, that neither Captain Church,
      nor any of the officers and soldiers who fought in King Philip’s War, did
      anything a thousandth part so glorious as Mr. Eliot did when he translated
      the Bible for the Indians.”

The children were now accustomed to assemble round Grandfather’s chair at
      all their unoccupied moments; and often it was a striking picture to
      behold the white-headed old sire, with this flowery wreath of young people
      around him. When he talked to them, it was the past speaking to the
      present, or rather to the future,—for the children were of a
      generation which had not become actual. Their part in life, thus far, was
      only to be happy and to draw knowledge from a thousand sources. As yet, it
      was not their time to do.

Sometimes, as Grandfather gazed at their fair, unworldly countenances, a
      mist of tears bedimmed his spectacles. He almost regretted that it was
      necessary for them to know anything of the past or to provide aught for
      the future. He could have wished that they might be always the happy,
      youthful creatures who had hitherto sported around his chair, without
      inquiring whether it had a history. It grieved him to think that his
      little Alice, who was a flower bud fresh from paradise, must open her
      leaves to the rough breezes of the world, or ever open them in any clime.
      So sweet a child she was, that it seemed fit her infancy should be
      immortal.

But such repinings were merely flitting shadows across the old man’s
      heart. He had faith enough to believe, and wisdom enough to know, that the
      bloom of the flower would be even holier and happier than its bud. Even
      within himself, though Grandfather was now at that period of life when the
      veil of mortality is apt to hang heavily over the soul, still, in his
      inmost being he was conscious of something that he would not have
      exchanged for the best happiness of childhood. It was a bliss to which
      every sort of earthly experience—all that he had enjoyed, or
      suffered or seen, or heard, or acted, with the broodings of his soul upon
      the whole—had contributed somewhat. In the same manner must a bliss,
      of which now they could have no conception, grow up within these children,
      and form a part of their sustenance for immortality.

So Grandfather, with renewed cheerfulness, continued his history of the
      chair, trusting that a profounder wisdom than his own would extract, from
      these flowers and weeds of Time, a fragrance that might last beyond all
      time.

At this period of the story Grandfather threw a glance backward as far as
      the year 1660. He spoke of the ill-concealed reluctance with which the
      Puritans in America had acknowledged the sway of Charles II. on his
      restoration to his father’s throne. When death had stricken Oliver
      Cromwell, that mighty protector had no sincerer mourners than in New
      England. The new king had been more than a year upon the throne before his
      accession was proclaimed in Boston, although the neglect to perform the
      ceremony might have subjected the rulers to the charge of treason.

During the reign of Charles II., however, the American colonies had but
      little reason to complain of harsh or tyrannical treatment. But when
      Charles died, in 1685, and was succeeded by his brother James, the
      patriarchs of New England began to tremble. King James was known to be of
      an arbitrary temper. It was feared by the Puritans that he would assume
      despotic power. Our forefathers felt that they had no security either for
      their religion or their liberties.

The result proved that they had reason for their apprehensions. King James
      caused the charters of all the American colonies to be taken away. The old
      charter of Massachusetts, which the people regarded as a holy thing and as
      the foundation of all their liberties, was declared void. The colonists
      were now no longer freemen; they were entirely dependent on the king’s
      pleasure. At first, in 1685, King James appointed Joseph Dudley, a native
      of Massachusetts, to be president of New England. But soon afterwards, Sir
      Edmund Andros, an officer of the English army, arrived, with a commission
      to be governor-general of New England and New York.

The king had given such powers to Sir Edmund Andros that there was now no
      liberty, nor scarcely any law, in the colonies over which he ruled. The
      inhabitants were not allowed to choose representatives, and consequently
      had no voice whatever in the government, nor control over the measures
      that were adopted. The councillors with whom the governor consulted on
      matters of state were appointed by himself. This sort of government was no
      better than an absolute despotism.

“The people suffered much wrong while Sir Edmund Andros ruled over them,”
       continued Grandfather; “and they were apprehensive of much more. He had
      brought some soldiers with him from England, who took possession of the
      old fortress on Castle Island and of the fortification on Fort Hill.
      Sometimes it was rumored that a general massacre of the inhabitants was to
      be perpetrated by these soldiers. There were reports, too, that all the
      ministers were to be slain or imprisoned.”

“Because they were the leaders of the people, Charley,” said Grandfather.
      “A minister was a more formidable man than a general, in those days. Well,
      while these things were going on in America, King James had so misgoverned
      the people of England that they sent over to Holland for the Prince of
      Orange. He had married the king’s daughter, and was therefore considered
      to have a claim to the crown. On his arrival in England, the Prince of
      Orange was proclaimed king, by the name of William III. Poor old King
      James made his escape to France.”

Grandfather told how, at the first intelligence of the landing of the
      Prince of Orange in England, the people of Massachusetts rose in their
      strength and overthrew the government of Sir Edmund Andros. He, with
      Joseph Dudley, Edmund Randolph, and his other principal adherents, was
      thrown into prison. Old Simon Bradstreet, who had been governor when King
      James took away the charter, was called by the people to govern them
      again.

“Governor Bradstreet was a venerable old man, nearly ninety years of age,”
       said Grandfather. “He came over with the first settlers, and had been the
      intimate companion of all those excellent and famous men who laid the
      foundation of our country. They were all gone before him to the grave, and
      Bradstreet was the last of the Puritans.”

Grandfather paused a moment and smiled, as if he had something very
      interesting to tell his auditors. He then proceeded:—

“And now, Laurence,—now, Clara,—now, Charley,—now, my
      dear little Alice,—what chair do you think had been placed in the
      council chamber, for old Governor Bradstreet to take his seat in? Would
      you believe that it was this very chair in which Grandfather now sits, and
      of which he is telling you the history?”

“I am glad to hear it, with all my heart!” cried Charley, after a shout of
      delight. “I thought Grandfather had quite forgotten the chair.”

“It was a solemn and affecting sight,” said Grandfather, “when this
      venerable patriarch, with his white beard flowing down upon his breast,
      took his seat in his chair of state. Within his remembrance, and even
      since his mature age, the site where now stood the populous town had been
      a wild and forest-covered peninsula. The province, now so fertile and
      spotted with thriving villages, had been a desert wilderness. He was
      surrounded by a shouting multitude, most of whom had been born in the
      country which he had helped to found. They were of one generation, and he
      of another. As the old man looked upon them, and beheld new faces
      everywhere, he must have felt that it was now time for him to go whither
      his brethren had gone before him.”

“All of them,” replied Grandfather. “Winthrop had been dead forty years.
      Endicott died, a very old man, in 1665. Sir Henry Vane was beheaded, in
      London, at the beginning of the reign of Charles II. And Haynes, Dudley,
      Bellingham, and Leverett, who had all been governors of Massachusetts,
      were now likewise in their graves. Old Simon Bradstreet was the sole
      representative of that departed brotherhood. There was no other public man
      remaining to connect the ancient system of government and manners with the
      new system which was about to take its place. The era of the Puritans was
      now completed.”

“I am sorry for it!” observed Laurence; “for though they were so stern,
      yet it seems to me that there was something warm and real ' WHERE id = 'affcd6f7-8336-4784-9dfe-4231bc1e20f6';
