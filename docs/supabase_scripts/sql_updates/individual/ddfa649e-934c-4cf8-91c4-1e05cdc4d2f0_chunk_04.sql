aware of his great worth, he had spent his childhood. It was almost
with regret that he confessed to himself that the Countess L. for the
first time since they parted had not been his sole thought throughout
the day. He saw that in the new mode of life awaiting him, work and
continual activity might revive his soul, exhausted by passion,
indolence, and secret sorrow. The idea of being the great man''s
assistant, and with him influencing the fate of a mighty people, awoke
in him for the first time the noble feeling of ambition. In this humour
he lay down upon the camp bed prepared for him,—and then the usual
dreams carried him back to distant Paris, to the arms of his dear
countess.

Next morning, according to his promise, Peter woke Ibrahim and greeted
him as lieutenant-captain of the Preobrajensky regiment, in which he
himself was captain. The courtiers flocked round Ibrahim, each one in
his own way trying to welcome the new favourite.

The haughty Prince Menshikoff gave him a friendly grasp of the hand.
Sheremetieff inquired[Pg 231] after his own Parisian friend, and Golovin asked
him to dinner. Others followed his example, so that Ibrahim received
invitations for at least a whole month.

His life was now passed in regular but active occupation; consequently
he was not dull. Prom day to day he became more attached to the Tsar,
and grew better able to appreciate his lofty character. The thoughts
of a great man are a most interesting study. Ibrahim saw Peter in the
Senate debating with Buturlin and Dolgoruki, discussing important
questions in the Admiralty, fostering the Russian navy,—in his
leisure, with Theophan, Gavril, Bujinski, and Kopievitch, examining
translations from foreign publications, or visiting a factory, an
artizan''s workshop, or the study of some learned man. Russia became
to Ibrahim one vast workshop, where machinery alone moved, where each
workman under ordered rules is occupied with his own task.

He felt that he too must work at his own bench, and tried to regret
as little as possible the amusements of his Parisian life. But if
was hander to forget a dearer memory. Often he thought of Countess
L., her just indignation, her tears, and grief. At times a terrible
thought oppressed him: the distractions of society: new ties: another
favourite. He shuddered; jealousy began to rage in his African blood,
and burning[Pg 232] tears were ready to flow down his swarthy face.

One morning he was sitting in his study amid official documents, when
he heard himself loudly greeted in French. Turning quickly round he was
embraced with joyous exclamations by young Korsakoff, whom he had left
in Paris in the whirl of the great world.

"I have only just arrived," said Korsakoff "and came straight to you.
All our Parisian friends desire to be remembered to you, and regret
your absence. The Countess L. requested me to invite you without fail,
and here is her letter for you."

Ibrahim seized it eagerly, and was looking at the familiar writing on
the envelope, scarcely believing his own eyes.

"How glad I am," added Korsakoff, "that you have not been bored to
death in this barbarous Petersburg. How do they manage here? What do
they do? Who is your tailor? Have they started an opera?"

"I see," he said, "you are preoccupied, and don''t want me just now.
Another time we will have a good talk; I am off to present my respects[Pg 233]
to his Majesty." With these words he turned on his heel, and hurried
out of the room.

Left alone Ibrahim quickly opened the letter. The countess complained
tenderly, reproached him with falseness and inconstancy.

"You used to say," she wrote, "that my happiness was more to you than
all the world. Ibrahim, if this were true, could you have left me in
the state to which the sudden news of your departure brought me. You
were afraid I might detain you. Be assured that, in spite of my love,
I should have known how to sacrifice it for your good and to what you
deem your duty."

The countess ended with passionate assurances of love, begging him to
write, if only occasionally, and even if there were no hope that they
would ever meet again.

Ibrahim read and re-read this letter twenty times, rapturously kissing
those precious lines. Burning with impatience for news about the
countess, he set out for the Admiralty, hoping to find his friend still
there, when the door opened, and Korsakoff re-entered. He had seen the
Tsar, and he seemed as usual perfectly self-satisfied.

"Between ourselves," he said to Ibrahim, "the Tsar is a most
extraordinary man. Fancy! I found him in a sort of linen vest on the
mast of a new ship, whither I had to scramble with my dispatches.[Pg 234] I
stood on a rope ladder, and had not room enough to make a proper bow.
I lost my presence of mind for the first time in all my life. However,
the Tsar, when he had read my papers, looked at me from head to foot.
Ho doubt he was agreeably impressed by my good taste and splendid
attire. At any rate he smiled, and invited me to the assembly today.
But I am a perfect stranger in Petersburg. For my six years'' absence I
have quite forgotten the local customs. Please be my mentor; call for
me on your way, and introduce me."

"The countess? At first she was naturally most unhappy at your
departure; then, of course by degrees, she grew reconciled, and took
to herself another lover—who do you think? The lanky Marquis R. Why
do you open those African eyes of yours? Does this appear to you so
strange? Don''t you know that enduring grief is not in human nature,
particularly in a woman. Meditate duly upon that while I go and rest
after my journey, and don''t forget to call for me on your way."

What terrible thoughts crowded Ibrahim''s soul? Jealousy? Rage?
Despair?—Ho!—but a deep, crushing sorrow.

He murmured to himself. I foresaw it, it was bound to happen. Then he
opened the countess''s letter, read it over again, hung his head, and
wept bitterly. Long did he weep. Those tears relieved him. He looked
at his watch and found that it was time to start. Gladly would he have
stayed away, but the party was an affair of duty, and the Tsar was
strict in exacting the attendance of those attached to him.

He dressed and started to fetch Korsakoff. Korsakoff was sitting in his
dressing gown, reading a French book.

"Excuse me," the other replied, "it''s already half-past five, we shall
be late; make haste and dress, and let us go."

Korsakoff hurriedly rang the bell with all his might; the servants
hurried in, and he began hastily to dress. His French valet handed him
slippers with red heels, light blue velvet breeches, a pink kaftan
embroidered with spangles. In the antechamber his wig was hurriedly
powdered and brought in; Korsakoff pushed into it his closely cropped
head, asked for his sword and gloves, turned ten times before the
glass, and announced to Ibrahim that he was ready. The footmen handed
them their bearskin overcoats, and they drove off to the Winter Palace.

Who was the belle of St. Petersburg. Which man was considered the
best dancer? and which dance was the most fashionable? Ibrahim very
reluctantly gratified his curiosity. Meanwhile they reached the
palace. A number of long sledges, old carriages, and gilded coaches
stood on the lawn. Near the steps were crowded coachmen in livery and
moustaches, outriders glittering with tinsel, with feathers and maces,
hussars, pages and awkward footmen carrying their masters'' furcoats
and muffs, a following indispensable according to the notions of the
gentry of that period. At sight of Ibrahim a general murmur ran. "The
negro, the negro, the Tzar''s negro!" He hurriedly led Korsakoff through
this motley crowd. The Court footman opened wide the doors; and they
entered a large room. Korsakoff was dumb with astonishment. In this big
hall, lighted up with tallow candles dimly burning amidst clouds of
tobacco smoke, sat magnates with blue ribbons across their shoulders,
ambassadors, foreign merchants, officers of the guards in their green
uniform, shipbuilders in jackets and striped trousers, all moving to
and fro in crowds to the unceasing sound of sacred music. The ladies
sat near to the walls;—the young attired in all the splendour of
fashion. Gold and silver shone upon their gowns; from the midst of wide
crinolines their slender figures rose like flower stalks. Diamonds
glittered in their[Pg 237] ears, in their long curls, and round their neck.
They turned gaily to the right and left awaiting the gentlemen and the
dancing.

Elderly ladies tried cunningly to combine the new style of dress with
the vanished past; caps were modelled on the small sable hat of the
Tsaritsa Natalia Kirilovna, and gowns and mantles somehow recalled the
sarafan and dushegreika (short jacket without sleeves). They seemed
to share rather with wonder than enjoyment in these new imported
amusements, and glanced angrily at the wives and daughters of the Dutch
skippers, who in cotton skirts and red jackets knitted their stockings
and sat laughing and talking quite at ease amongst themselves. Seeing
the fresh arrivals, a servant approached with beer and tumblers on a
tray. Korsakoff in bewilderment whispered to Ibrahim.

"Que diable est ce que tout cela?" Ibrahim could not repress a smile.
The empress and the grand duchess, radiant in their own beauty and
their attire, walked through the rows of guests, talking affably to
them. The emperor was in another room, Korsakoff, wishing to show
himself to him, with difficulty pushed his way through the ever-moving
crowd. Sitting in that room were mostly foreigners solemnly smoking
their clay pipes and drinking from their earthen jugs. On the tables
were bottles of beer and[Pg 238] wine, leather pouches with tobacco, tumblers
of punch, and a few draught-boards. At one of these was Peter playing
draughts with a broad-shouldered English skipper. They solemnly saluted
one another with gulps of tobacco smoke, and the Tsar was so engrossed
by an unexpected move of his opponent that he did not notice Korsakoff,
in spite of the latter''s contortions. At that moment a stout gentleman
with a large bouquet on his breast rushed in, announced in a loud voice
that dancing had begun, and instantly retired. He was followed by a
large number of the guests, including Korsakoff among the rest.

The unexpected sight surprised him. Along the whole length of the
hall, to the sound of the most doleful music, the ladies and gentlemen
stood in two rows face to face. The gentlemen bowed low; the ladies
curtsied lower still, first to their vis-Ã -vis, then to the right,
then to the left; again to their vis-Ã -vis, then to the right, and
so on. Korsakoff, gazing at this fantastic pastime, opened his eyes
and bit his lips. The curtsying and bowing went on for about half an
hour. At last they ended, and the stout gentleman with the bouquet
announced that the dances of ceremony were ended, and ordered the band
to play a minuet. Korsakoff was delighted, and made ready to show
off. Among the young ladies was one whom he particularly admired. She
was about sixteen,[Pg 239] dressed richly but with taste, and sat next an
elderly gentleman of dignified and stern appearance. Korsakoff rushed
up to her and begged the honour of a dance. The young beauty was
disconcerted, and seemed to be at a loss what to say. The man sitting
next her frowned more than before. Korsakoff awaited her reply, when
the gentleman with the bouquet approached, led him to the middle of the
hall, and said pompously:

"Dear sip, you have done wrong. In the first place, you approached this
young person without first rendering her the three requisite salutes,
and secondly, you took upon yourself the right of choosing her, whereas
in the minuet that privilege is hers and not the gentleman''s. For this
you must undergo severe punishment, that is you must drain the goblet
of the Great Eagle."

Korsakoff from hour to hour grew more astonished. In a moment the
guests surrounded him, loudly demanding instant compliance with the
law. Peter, hearing the laughter and loud talk, came from the next
room, being very fond of witnessing such punishments. The crowd divided
before him and he stepped into the centre, where stood the accused with
the master of the ceremonies before him holding an enormous cup full
of malmsey wine. He was earnestly persuading the culprit to submit
willingly to the law.

"Aha!" said Peter, seeing Korsakoff, "you[Pg 240] are caught, brother. Drink,
monsieur, and no wry faces."

There was nothing for it. The poor dandy, without stopping, drained the
goblet and returned it to the master of the ceremonies.

"Hark, Korsakoff," said Peter, "your breeches are of velvet, the like
even I don''t wear, who am much richer than you. That is extravagance,
take care I do not quarrel with you."

After this rebuke Korsakoff wished to leave the circle, but staggered
and nearly fell, to the great delight of the emperor and the merry
company. This incident not only did not mar the harmony nor interest of
the principal entertainment, but on the contrary enlivened it.

The gentlemen began to scrape and bow, and the ladies to curtsy and
knock their little heels together with great diligence, no longer
keeping time to the music. Korsakoff could not share in the general
merriment. By her father Gavril Afanassievitch Rjevski''s orders, the
lady whom Korsakoff had chosen approached Ibrahim, and, dropping her
eyes, timidly held out her hand to him. Ibrahim danced the minuet with
her and led her back to her seat, then went in search of Korsakoff,
led him out of the hall, placed him in the carriage, and drove him
home. At the beginning of the journey Korsakoff mumbled, "Curses upon
the soiree and the goblet of the Great Eagle," but[Pg 241] he soon fell into
a deep sleep. He knew not how he got home, undressed, and was put to
bed, and he awoke next day with a headache, and a dim remembrance of
the scraping, curtseying, and tobacco smoke, the gentleman with the
enormous bouquet, and the mighty goblet of the Great Eagle.

(Verse from "Ruslan and Ludmila.")

"Our forefathers were leisurely souls,
Right leisurely did they dine,
And they ladled slow from their silver bowls
The foaming beer and wine."

I must introduce you, gracious reader, to Gavril Afanassievitch
Rjevski. He came of an ancient noble race, owned vast estates, was
hospitable, loved falconry, had an enormous retinue, and was, in a
word, a good old Russian gentleman. In his own words he could not bear
anything foreign, and in his home he tried to maintain the customs of
the good old days he loved so well. His daughter was seventeen. In
childhood she had lost her mother, and she had been brought up in the
old-fashioned way, amid a crowd of governesses, nurses, companions, and
children from the servants'' hall. She could embroider in gold and was[Pg 242]
illiterate. Her father, in spite of his dislike to all things foreign,
could not oppose her wish to learn German dances from a captive Swedish
officer living in their house. This worthy dancing master was about
fifty; his right foot had been shot through at the battle of Narva,
and therefore it was not very active at minuets and courantes; but
the left was very dexterous and agile in the more difficult steps.
His young pupil did credit to his teaching. Natalia Gavrilovna was
celebrated at these soirees for her dancing, which was partly the cause
of Korsakoff''s proceedings. He came next morning to apologise to Gavril
Afanassievitch. But the young dandy''s manner and fine dress displeased
the proud barin who nicknamed him the French monkey.

It was a holiday. Gavril Afanassievitch expected a number of friends
and relations. In the ancient hall a long table was being laid. The
guests were arriving with their wives and daughters, who had at last
been released from their domestic prison by the order and by the
example of the Tsar. Natalia Gavrilovna handed round a silver tray
laden with golden cups, and each guest, as he drained one, regretted
that the kiss which accompanied it on such occasions in olden times was
out of fashion.

They sat down to table. In the place of honour next the host sat his
father-in-law, Prince[Pg 243] Boris Alexeievitch Lykoff, a boyar in his
seventieth year. The other guests were placed in order of descent, and
thus recalling the happy times of precedence by office, sat down, men
on one side, women on the other. At the end of the table, the companion
in the old-fashioned dress, a dwarf,—a thirty-year-old infant,
affected and wrinkled,—and the captive dancing master in a shabby dark
blue uniform, took their accustomed seats. The table, covered with a
great number of dishes, was surrounded by numerous and busy servants,
distinguishable among whom was the butler, with severe mien, big
stomach, and pompous immobility. The first few moments of dinner were
devoted entirely to the dishes of our time-honoured Russian cookery.
The rattle of plates and the activity of spoons produced a general
taciturnity.

At last the host, perceiving that the time had come for entertaining
the guests with agreeable conversation, turned and asked:

Several attendants were about to rush off in different directions,
when an old woman, painted white and pink, decorated with flowers and
tinsel, in a silk damask gown with a low neck, entered, singing and
dancing. Her advent occasioned general delight.

"Dressing, gossip, to receive the dear guests, on the Lord''s festival,
by order of the Tsar, by command of the master, to the derision of the
world in the German style."

At these words there was a loud burst of laughter, and the jester took
her place behind the host''s chair.

"And folly talks foolishly, and sometimes tells the truth in her
folly," said Tatiana Afanassievna, eldest sister of the host, and much
respected by him. "Naturally the present style of dress must seem
ridiculous to everybody. When you, my friends, have shaved your beards
and put on a short coat, it is of course no use talking of women''s
rags; but really it is a pity the sarafan, the maiden''s ribbons, and
the povoinik [a head-dress] should be discarded. It is really sad and
comic to see the beauties of to-day, their hair frizzed like flax,
greased and covered with French powder, the waist laced in so tight
that it seems on the point of snapping—their bodies encased in hoops,
so that they have to go sideways through a carriage door.[Pg 245] They stoop;
they can neither stand, sit, nor breathe—real martyrs, my poor dears."

"Dear mother Tatiana Afanassievna!" said Kirila Petrovitch, formerly a
voievod at Riasan, where he acquired 3,000 serfs and a young wife,
neither by strictly honourable means. "But my wife may dress as she
likes as long as she does not order new gowns every month and throw
away the previous ones, while still quite perfectly new. Formerly the
granddaughter included in her dowry the grandmother''s sarafan; but
now you see the mistress in a gown to-day and to-morrow it is on the
maid. What is to be done? Nothing but ruin confronts the Russian noble.
Very sad!" he said, with a sigh, looking at his Maria Ilienitchna, who
seemed to like neither his praise of olden times nor his disparagement
of the latest fashions. The rest of the ladies shared her displeasure,
but they said nothing, for modesty was in those days still deemed
essential in young women.

"And who is to blame?" asked Gravril Afanassievitch, frothing a mug of
kissli shtchi (sort of lemonade). "Is it not our own fault? The young
women play the fool and we encourage them."

"What can we do? We cannot help ourselves," replied Kirila Petrovitch.
"A man would gladly shut his wife up in the house, but she is summoned
with beating of drums to[Pg 246] attend the assemblies. The husband follows
the whip, but the wife runs after dress. Oh, those assemblies! The Lord
has sent them upon us to punish us for our sins."

Maria Ilienitchna sat on needles; her tongue itched. At last she could
bear it no longer, and turning to her husband inquired with a little
acid smile what he found to object to in the assemblies.

"This is what I find to object to," replied the irritated husband.
Since they began, husbands cannot manage their wives; wives have
forgotten the teaching of the apostles—that a wife shall reverence her
husband. They trouble themselves not about their domestic affairs, but
about new apparel. They consider not how to please the husband, but
how to attract the officers. And is it becoming, madam, for a Russian
lady—wife or maid—to hobnob with German tobacconists and with their
workmen? Who ever heard of dancing till night and talking with young
men? If they were relatives, all well and good—but with strangers and
with men they do not know."

"I would say a word, but there is a wolf near," said Gavril
Afanassievitch, with a frown. "I confess these assemblies are not to my
taste; at any moment you may jostle against a drunken man, or perhaps
be made drunk yourself to amuse others. Then there is the danger
that some blackguard may be up to mischief with[Pg 247] your daughter; the
modern young men are so spoilt, it is disgraceful. Take for instance
the son of the late Evgraff Sergueievitch Korsakoff; who at the last
assembly made such a fuss about Natasha, that he brought the blood into
my cheeks. Next day he coolly drives up to my gate. I was wondering
whether it could be Prince Alexander Danilovitch. No such luck. Ivan
Evgrafovitch! He would not stop at the gate and take the trouble to
walk up to the door, it is not likely! Korsakoff rushed in, bowing
and scraping, and chattered at such a rate, the Lord preserve us! The
fool Ekimovna mimics him most comically; by-the-bye, fool, give us the
foreign monkey."

Foolish Ekimovna seized the cover off a dish, tucked it under her arm
like a hat, and began wriggling, scraping with her feet, and bowing
in all directions, saying monsieur, mademoiselle, assemblÃ©e,
pardon. General and prolonged laughter again showed the delight of
the guests.

"Exactly like Korsakoff," said old Prince Lykoff, wiping away his tears
of laughter when the noise had gradually subsided. "It must be owned,
however, he is not the first nor the last who has come from foreign
parts to holy Russia a buffoon. What do our children learn abroad? To
scrape their feet, to chatter the Lord knows what lingo, not to respect
their elders, and to dangle after other men''s wives. Of all the young
people[Pg 248] who have been educated abroad (the Lord forgive me) the Tzar''s
negro most resembles a man."

"Oh, prince!" said Tatiana Afanassievna. I have—I have seen him close.
What a frightful muzzle he has. I was quite frightened of him."

"Certainly," added Gavril Afanassievitch. "He is a steady, decent man,
not a brother of the whirlwind. Who is it that has just driven through
the gate into the courtyard? Surely it is never that foreign monkey
again? What are you animals doing?" he exclaimed, turning towards the
servants. "Run and keep him out, and never let him in again."

"Old beard, are you dreaming?" foolish Ekimovna interrupted. "Are you
blind? It is the royal sledge. The Tsar has come."

Gavril Afanassievitch rose hurriedly from the table. Everybody rushed
to the windows; and positively saw the emperor ascending the steps
leaning on the arm of his orderly. There was a great commotion. The
host rushed to meet Peter; the servants flew hither and thither as if
mad; the guests were alarmed, and some wondered how they might escape.
Suddenly the thunder voice of Peter resounded in the hall. All was
silence as the Tsar entered, accompanied by his host, in a flutter of
joy.

All made obeisance. The Tsar''s sharp eyes sought in this crowd
the host''s young daughter. He beckoned to her. Natalia Gavrilovna
approached rather boldly, but blushed not only to her ears but to her
shoulders.

"You grow prettier every hour," said the Tsar, and according to his
custom kissed her on the head. Then turning to the guests he exclaimed:

"Why, I have interrupted you! You were dining? I beg you will sit down
again, and to me, Gavril Afanassievitch, give some aniseed vodka."

The host rushed at the stately butler, snatched from him a tray,
and himself filling a small golden goblet, handed it to the Tsar.
Peter drank it, ate a piece of bread, and again invited the guests
to continue their dinner. All resumed their seats but the dwarf and
the companion, who did not dare to remain at the table honoured by
the presence of the monarch. Peter sat down beside the host and asked
for some shtchee (a cabbage soup). The Tsar''s orderly handed him a
wooden spoon inlaid with ivory, a knife and fork with green bone
handles—Peter never used any others but his own. The dinner table
conversation, which a moment before had been boisterously merry,
ended by being forced and scanty. The host from respect and delight
ate nothing; the guests, too, became ceremonious and listened with[Pg 250]
reverence to the Tsar as he discussed in German the campaign of 1701
with the captive Swede.

The fool, Ekimovna, several times interrogated by the monarch, replied
with a sort of cold timidity, which, by-the-bye, did not in the least
prove her natural folly.

"Gavril Afanassievitch!" he said, addressing the host. "I want a word
with you alone." Taking his arm, he led him into the drawing-room and
locked the door. The guests remaining in the dining-room whispered
about the unexpected visit, and fearing to intrude, dispersed speedily
without expressing to their host the usual after-dinner thanks. His
father-in-law, daughter, and sister accompanied each in silence to the
door, and remained alone in the dining-room awaiting his Majesty''s
departure.

Half an hour later the door opened and Peter came out. With a solemn
bow to the treble salute from Prince Lykoff, Tatiana Afanassievna, and
Natasha, he passed out into the lobby. The host[Pg 251] handed him his long
red overcoat, conducted him to the sledge, and on the door steps again
thanked him for the honour he had done him.

Returning to the dining-room, Gavril Afanassievitch seemed much
troubled; angrily bade the servants clear the table, sent Natasha to
her apartments, and informed his sister and father-in-law that he must
talk with them. He led them into the bedroom, where he usually took his
after-dinner nap. The old Prince lay down upon the oak bed; Tatiana
Afanassievna sat down upon the ancient damask easy chair, and drew the
footstool towards her; Gavril Afanassievitch locked all the doors and
sat down at Prince Lykoffs feet. In a low voice he began:

"Has he commanded you to a voievod?" asked his father-in-law. It is
time he did so long ago. Or he has proposed a mission to you? Why not?
Not always clerks. Important people are sometimes sent to foreign
monarchs.

"No," replied his son-in-law, scowling. "I am a man of the old pattern;
our services are not required in the present day, though perhaps an
Orthodox Russian nobleman is superior to modern[Pg 252] upstarts, pancake
hawkers, and Mussulmen. But that is a different matter."

"The maiden is ready for marriage, the bridegroom must be in keeping
with the proposer. God grant them love and discretion; of honour there
is plenty."

"Dear brother," replied the old lady, "how can we guess? There are many
gentlemen at court. Any one of them would be delighted to marry your
Natasha. Is it Dolgoruki?"

"God be with him, he is rich and stupid. Who then? Is it Eletsky, Lvof?
It cannot be Ragusinski? Well, I cannot imagine. Then whom does the
Tzar wish Natasha to marry?"

The old lady exclaimed and threw up her arms. Prince Lykoff raised
his head from the pillows, and in astonishment repeated: "The negro
Ibrahim?"

"Dear brother!" said the old lady in a voice full of tears. "Do not
destroy your darling daughter, do not deliver Natashinka into the claws
of the black devil."

"But how then?" replied Gavril Afanassievitch, "refuse the Tzar, who in
return promises us his protection to me and all our house."

"What!" exclaimed the old Prince, who was wide awake now. "Natasha, my
granddaughter, to be married to a bought negro?"

"He''s of good birth," said Gavril Afanassievitch, "he is the son of a
negro Sultan. He was not taken prisoner by the Mussulmen but sold at
Constantinople. Our ambassador bought him and presented him to Peter.
The negro''s eldest brother came to Russia with a handsome ransom
and——"

"Gavril Afanassievitch," added the old lady, "tell us rather how you
replied to the Tzar''s proposal."

At that moment a noise was heard behind the door. Gavril Afanassievitch
went to open it, but something obstructed; he gave a hard push,
the door opened, and he beheld Natasha unconscious lying on the
blood-smeared floor.

Her heart misgave her when the Tzar was closeted with her father. A
sort of presentiment whispered to her that the matter concerned her;
and when Gavril Afanassievitch bade her to retire, while he conferred
with her aunt and grandfather, she could not resist feminine curiosity,
crawled quietly through the back rooms to the bedroom door, and missed
no word of their terrible conversation. When she heard her father''s
last sentence, the poor girl fainted, and falling, struck her head
against the metal-bound chest which held her dowry.

The servants rushed in, lifted Natasha, carried her to her own suite
of apartments, and laid her upon her bed. After a little she came to
and opened her eyes, but recognised neither father nor aunt. Fever
set in; in her delirium she spoke of marriage and the Tzar''s negro,
and suddenly cried in a plaintive and piercing voice: "Valerian, dear
Valerian, my life, save me: There they are, there they are."

Tatiana Afanassievna glanced anxiously at her brother, who turned
white, bit his lip, and left the room in silence. He returned to the
old Prince,[Pg 255] who, unable to mount the stairs, had remained below.

"Who is this Valerian?" inquired the anxious old man. "Can it be the
orphan son of the musketeer whom you brought up in your house?"

"The same, to my sorrow!" replied Gavril Afanassievitch. "His father
saved my life during the insurrection, and the devil induced me to take
home the accursed young wolf. Two years ago, at his own request, he
was drafted into the army. Natasha cried at parting with him, while he
stood as if turned to stone. I thought it suspicious, and spoke to my
sister about it. But Natasha has never mentioned him since; and nothing
has been heard of him. I hoped she had forgotten him, but it seems not.
I have decided; she shall marry the negro."

Prince Lykoff did not contradict him; it would have been useless. He
returned home. Tatiana Afanassievna remained by Natasha''s bedside.
Gavril Afanassievitch, after sending for the doctor, locked himself in
his own room, and in his house all was still and sad. This unexpected
proposal of marriage surprised Ibrahim, at any rate, quite as much as
it surprised Gavril Afanassievitch. It happened thus.

"Listen, Ibrahim; you are a lonely man, without birth or clan, a
stranger to everybody but myself. If I were to die to-day what would
become of you to-morrow, my poor negro? You must get settled while
there is yet time, find support in new ties, connect yourself with the
Russian nobility."

"Sire, I am contented with you; the protection and favour of your
Majesty. God grant I may not survive my Tsar and benefactor. I desire
nothing[Pg 257] more, and even if I had any views of matrimony, would the
young girl or her relations consent? My personal appearance——"

"Your personal appearance? What nonsense! How, are you not a fine
fellow? A young girl must obey her parent''s wishes; but we will see
what old Gavril Rjevski will say when I go myself as your matchmaker."

"Marry," thought the African; "and why not? Surely I am not destined to
pass my life alone, and never know the greatest happiness and the most
sacred duties of manhood, simply because I was born in the torrid zone?
I cannot hope to be loved; what a childish thought! Is it possible to
believe in love? Can it exist in the frivolous heart of woman? The Tsar
is right; I must assure my own future. Marriage with young Rjevski will
unite me to the haughty Russian nobility, and I shall cease to be a
stranger in my new country. From my wife I shall not require love; I
shall content myself with her fidelity and friendship."

Ibrahim wished to work according to his custom, but his imagination was
too excited. He left the papers, and went out to stroll along the banks
of the Neva. Suddenly he heard Peter''s voice, looked round, and saw
the Tsar, who had dismissed his[Pg 258] sledge and was following "him with a
lively countenance.

"It is all settled, my friend," said Peter, taking him by the arm; "I
have betrothed you. Tomorrow, call upon your father-in-law, but be
careful to honour the pride of the boyar; leave your sledge at the
gates, and go across the yard on foot, talk to him of his honours and
distinction, and he will be delighted with you. And now," he added,
shaking his cudgel, "take me to the rogue Danileitch, with whom I must
have an interview about his latest pranks."

Ibrahim thanked Peter most sincerely for his fatherly care, accompanied
him as far as the magnificent mansion of Prince Menshikoff, and
returned home.

Gently burnt the hanging lamp before the glass case, wherein glittered
the gold and silver frames of the ancestral icons. The flickering
light lit faintly the curtained bed, and the table strewn with labelled
phials. Near the fireplace sat a servant at her spinning wheel, and
only the light sound of her distaff broke the silence.

"Who is there?" asked a weak voice. The maid rose instantly, approached
the bed, and quietly raised the curtain.

Natasha was silent; she tried to collect her scattered thoughts.
Something had happened to her, what it was she could not remember. The
maid stood before her, awaiting her orders. At that moment a muffled
sound was heard below.

"The masters have finished dinner," answered the attendant; "they are
rising from table. Tatiana Afanassievna will be here directly."

Natasha seemed pleased, she waved her feeble hand. The maid dropped the
curtain and resumed her seat at the spinning wheel.

A few minutes after, a head, covered with a broad white cap with dark
ribbons, peeped through the door and asked in a low voice:

"The young lady is conscious," said the maid, cautiously moving up
an easy chair. With tears in her eyes the old lady kissed the pale
languid face of her niece, and sat down beside her. Immediately after
her came the German doctor in a black caftan and learned wig. He
counted Natalia''s pulse, and told them first in Latin, then in Russian,
that the crisis was over. He asked for paper and ink, wrote a new
prescription, and departed. The old lady rose, kissed Natalia again,
and at once went down with the good news to Gavril Afanassievitch.

In the drawing-room in full uniform, with sword and hat in hand, sat
the royal negro, talking respectfully with Gavril Afanassievitch.
Korsakoff, stretched full length upon a downy couch, reclined,
listening to their conversation while he teased the greyhound. Tired of
this occupation, he approached a mirror, the usual refuge of the idle,
and in it saw Tatiana Afanassievna behind the door making unperceived
signs to her brother.

"I am astonished at your patience," said Korsakoff to Ibrahim. "A whole
hour have you been listening to ravings about the ancient descent
of the Lykoffs and the Rjevskis, and have even added your own moral
observations. In your place j''aurais plantÃ© la the old liar and
all his race, including Natalia Gavrilovna, who is only affected and
shamming illness, une petite santÃ©. Tell me truly, is it possible
that you are in love with that little mijaurÃ©e?"

"No," replied Ibrahim, "I am of course marrying, not from love, but
from consideration, and that only if she has no actual dislike for me."
"Listen, Ibrahim," said Korsakoff, "for once take my advice; really I
am wiser than I look. Give up this silly idea—don''t marry. It seems
to me that your chosen bride has no particular liking for you. Don''t
many things happen in this world? For instance: of course I am not bad
looking, but it has happened to me to deceive husbands who were really
not a whit my inferior. Yourself too.... you remember our Parisian
friend Count L.? A woman''s fidelity cannot be counted on. Happy is
he who can bear the change with equanimity. But you! with "your
passionate, brooding, and suspicious nature, with your flat nose, thick
lips, is it with these that you propose to rush into all the dangers of
matrimony?"

"Thank you for your friendly advice," said[Pg 262] Ibrahim, coldly; "you know
the proverb: ''it is not your duty to rock other folk''s children.''"

"Take care, Ibrahim," replied Korsakoff, smiling, "that it does not
fall to your lot to illustrate that proverb literally later on."

"But just consider," replied her obstinate brother. "For a fortnight
now he has been calling as her accepted bridegroom, and hitherto has
not seen his bride. He might think at last that her illness is simply
an invention, and that we are seeking only to gain time in order to get
rid of him. Besides, what will the Tsar say? He has already sent three
times to ask after Natasha. Do as you please, but I do not intend to
fall out with him."

"My God!" exclaimed Tatiana Afanassievna; "how will she bear it? At any
rate, let me prepare her for this."

"Thank God!" he said to Ibrahim; "the crisis is over. Natalia is much
better. I do not like to leave our dear guest, Mr. Korsakoff, here
alone> or I would take you upstairs to get a glimpse of your bride."

Korsakoff congratulated Gavril Afanassievitch,[Pg 263] begged them not to put
themselves out on his account, assured them that he was obliged to go,
and rushed into the lobby, whither be refused to allow his host to
follow him.

Meanwhile, Tatiana Afanassievna hastened to prepare the invalid for the
arrival of her terrible visitor. Entering the apartments, she sat down
breathless by the bedside and took Natalia by the hand. But before she
had time to say a word, the door opened.

The old lady felt faint, Gavril Afanassievitch drew back the curtain,
looked coldly at the patient, and inquired how she was. The sick girl
tried to smile but could not. Her father''s stern gaze startled her, and
fear overcame her. She fancied some one stood at the head of her bed.
With an effort she raised her head and instantly recognised the Tsar''s
negro. At that moment she remembered all, and all the horror of the
future presented itself before her. But exhausted nature could receive
no further perceptible shock. Natasha dropped her head back on the
pillow and closed her eyes, her heart within her gave sickly throbs.
Tatiana Afanassievna signed to her brother that the patient wanted to
go to sleep, and everybody left the apartments quietly. The maid alone
remained and resumed her seat.

The unhappy beauty opened her eyes, and seeing[Pg 264] no one by her bedside,
called the maid and sent her for the dwarf. But at that moment an old,
round creature, like a ball, rolled up to her bed. Tie Swallow (so
the dwarf was nicknamed) had rushed as fast as her short legs would
carry her up the stairs after Gavril Afanassievitch and Ibrahim, and
hid behind the door. Natasha saw her and sent the maid away. The dwarf
sat down on a stool by the bedside Never had so small a body contained
so active a soul. She interfered in everything, knew everything, and
exerted herself about everything. With cunning penetration she knew how
to gain the affection of her masters, and the envy of all the household
over which she wielded autocratic sway. Gavril Afanassievitch listened
to her tales, complaints, and petty requests. Tatiana Afanassievna
asked her opinion every moment and took her advice, while Natasha''s
affection for her was unbounded. She confided to her all the thoughts,
all the impulses of her sixteen-year-old heart.

"Do you know, Swallow," she said, "my father is going to marry me to
the negro." The dwarf sighed deeply, and her wrinkled face became more
wrinkled.

"No, miss, the negro during your illness managed to bewitch everybody.
Master is mad about him, the prince dreams of him alone, and Tatiana
Afanassievna says it is a pity he is a negro, otherwise we could not
wish for a better bridegroom."

"Don''t grieve, dear beauty," said the dwarf, kissing her feeble
hand. "If you must marry the negro, at any rate you will be your own
mistress. Now it is not as it was in olden times; husbands no longer
imprison their wives; the negro is said to be rich, the house will be
like a full cup—you''ll live merrily."

"That is just it, miss," she said mysteriously, lowering her voice; "if
you thought less of the sharpshooter''s orphan you would not rave of him
in your delirium, and your father would not be angry."

"That is the misfortune," replied the dwarf. "Now, if you ask him not
to marry you to the[Pg 266] negro, he will think Valerian is the cause. There
is nothing to be done, you had better submit, and what is to be will
be."

Natasha made no reply. The notion that the secret of her heart was
known to her father had a powerful effect upon her mind. One hope only
was left to her—that she might die before the completion of this
hateful marriage. This idea comforted her. With a weak and sad heart
she resigned herself to her fate.

In Gavril Afanassievitch''s house opening from the hall on the right was
a a narrow room with one window. In it stood a simple bed covered with
a blanket. Before the bed stood a small table of pine wood, on which a
tallow candle burnt, and a book of music lay open. On the wall hung an
old blue uniform and its contemporary, a three-cornered hat; above it
nailed to the wall with three nails hung a picture representing Charles
XII. on horseback. The notes of a flute sounded through this humble
abode. The captive dancing-master, its solitary occupant, in a skull
cap and cotton[Pg 267] dressing-gown, was enlivening the dulness of a winter''s
evening practising some strange Swedish, marches. After devoting two
whole hours to this exercise the Swede took his flute to pieces, packed
it in a box, and began to undress.

A noisy band of gypsies are wandering through. Bessarabia. To-day they
will pitch their ragged tents on the banks of the river. Sweet as
freedom is their nights rest, peaceful their slumber.

Between the cart wheels, half screened by rugs, burns a fire around
which the family is preparing supper. In the open fields graze the
horses, and behind the tents a tame bears lies free. In the heart of
the desert all is movement with the preparations for the morning''s
march, with the songs of the women, the cries of the children, and the
sound of the itinerant anvil. But soon upon the wandering band falls
the silence of sleep, and the stillness of the desert is broken only by
the barking of the dogs and the neighing of the horses.

The fires are everywhere extinguished, all is calm; the moon shines
solitary in the sky, shedding its light over the silent camp.

In one of the tents is an old man who does not sleep, but remains
seated by the embers, warming[Pg 269] himself by their last glow. He gazes
into the distant steppes, which are now wrapped in the mists of night.
His youthful daughter has wandered into the distant plains. She is
accustomed to her wild freedom; she will return. But night wears on,
and the moon in the distant clouds is about to set. Zemphira tarries,
and the old man''s supper is getting cold. But here she comes, and,
following on her footsteps, a youth, a stranger to the old gypsy.

"Father," says the maiden, "I bring a guest; I found him beyond the
tombs in the steppes, and I have invited him to the camp for the night.
He wishes to become a gypsy like us. He is a fugitive from the law. But
I will be his companion. He is ready to follow wherever I lead."

The Old Gypsy: "I am glad. Stay in the shelter of our camp till
morning, or longer it thou wilt. I am-ready to share with thee both
bread and roof. Be one of us. Make trial of our life; of our wandering,
poverty, and freedom. To-morrow, at daybreak, in one van, we will go
together. Choose thy trade: forge iron, or sing songs, leading the bear
from village to village."

Zemphira: "He is mine; who shall take him from me? But it is late....
the young moon has set, the fields are hidden in darkness, and sleep
overpowers me."

"Wake, Zemphira, the sun is rising; awake, my guest. ''Tis time, tis
time! Leave, my children, the couch of slothfulness."

Noisily the clustering crowd expands; the tents are struck; the vans
are ready to start. All is movement, and the horde advances over the
desert.

Asses with paniers full of sportive children lead the way; husbands,
brothers, wives, daughters, young and old, follow in their wake. What
shouting and confusion! Gypsy songs are mingled with the growling
of the bear, impatiently gnawing at his chain. What a motley of
bright-coloured rags! The naked children! The aged men! Dogs bark and
howl, the bagpipes drone, the carts creak. All is so poor, so wild,
so disorderly, but full of the life and movement ever absent from our
dead, slothful, idle life, monotonous as the songs of slaves.

The youth gazes disheartened over the desert plain. The secret cause of
his sadness he admits not even to himself. By his side is the dark-eyed
Zemphira. Now he is a free inhabitant of the world, and radiant above
him shines the sun in midday glory. Why, then, does the youth''s heart
tremble—what secret sorrow preys upon him?

God''s little bird knows neither care nor labour,[Pg 271] Why should it strive
to build a lasting nest? The night is long, but a branch suffices for
its sleeping place. When the sun comes in his glory, birdie hears the
voice of God, flutters his plumage, and sings his song. After spring,
Nature''s fairest time, comes hot summer. Late autumn follows, bringing
mist and cold. Poor men and women are sad and dismal. To distant lands,
to warmer climes beyond the blue sea, flies birdie to the spring. Like
a little careless bird is the wandering exile. For him there is no
abiding nest, no home! Every road is his; at each stopping-place is his
night''s lodging. Waking at dawn, he leaves his day at God''s disposal,
and the toil of life disturbs not his calm, indolent heart. At times,
glory''s enchantment, like a distant star, attracts his gaze; or sudden
visions of luxury and pleasure float before him. Sometimes above his
solitary head growls the thunder, and beneath the thunder, as beneath a
peaceful sky, he sleeps serene. And thus he lives, ignoring the power
of blind treacherous Fate. But once, oh God! how passion played with
his obedient soul! How it raged in his tormented breast! Is it long,
and for how long, that it has left him calm? It will rage again; let
him but wait!

Aleko: "Regret? If thou knewest, if thou could''st imagine the
confinement of our stifling towns! There people crowded behind walls
never breathe the cool breeze of the morning, nor the breath of
spring-scented meadows. They are ashamed to love, and chase away the
thought. They traffic with liberty, bow their heads to idols, and beg
for money and chains. What have I left? The excitement of treason, the
prejudged sentence, the mob''s mad persecution or splendid infamy."

Zemphira: "But there thou hadst magnificent palaces, many coloured
carpets, entertainments, and loud revels; and the maiden''s dresses are
so rich!"

Aleko: "What is there to please in our noisy towns? The genuine
love, no veritable joy. The maidens. How much dost thou surpass them,
without their rich apparel, their pearls, or their necklaces! Be true,
my gentle friend! My sole wish is to share with thee love, leisure, and
this self-sought exile."

The Old Gypsy: "Thou lovest us, though born amongst the rich.. But
freedom is not always agreeable to those used to luxury. We have a
legend:—

"Once a king banished a man from the South to live amongst us—I once
knew but have forgotten[Pg 273] his difficult name—though old in years he was
youthful, passionate, and simple-hearted. He had a wondrous gift of
song, with a voice like running waters. Everyone liked him. He dwelt
on the banks of the Danube, harming no one, but pleasing many with his
stories. He was helpless, weak, and timid as a child. Strangers brought
him game and fish caught in nets. When the rapid river froze and
winter storms raged high, they clad the saintly old man in soft warm
furs. But he could never be inured to the hardships of a poor man''s
life. He wandered about pale and thin, declaring that an offended God
was chastening him for some crime. He waited, hoping for deliverance,
and full of sad regret. The wretched man wandered on the banks of the
Danube shedding bitter tears, as he remembered his distant home, and,
dying, he desired that his unhappy bones should be carried to the
South. Even in death the stranger to these parts could find no rest."

Aleko: "Such is thy children''s fate, O Borne, O world-famed Empire!
Singer of love, singer of the gods, say what is glory? The echo from
the tomb, the voice of praise continued from generation to generation,
or a tale told by a gypsy in his smoky tent?"

Two years passed. The peaceful gypsy band[Pg 274] still wanders, finding
everywhere rest and hospitality. Scorning the fetters of civilisation,
Aleko is free, like them; without regret or care he leads a wandering
life. He is unchanged, unchanged the gypsy band. Forgetful of his past,
he has grown used to a gypsy life. He loves sleeping under their tents,
the delight of perpetual idleness, and their poor but sonorous tongue.
The bear, a deserter from his native haunts, is now a shaggy guest
within his tent. In the villages along the deserted route that passes
in front of some Moldavian dwelling, the bear dances clumsily before
a timid crowd and growls and gnaws his tiresome chain. Leaning on his
staff the old man lazily strikes the tambourine; Aleko, singing, leads
the bear; Zemphira makes the round of the villagers, collecting their
voluntary gifts; when night sets in all three prepare the corn they
have not reaped, the old man sleeps, and all is still.... The tent is
quiet and dark.

In the spring the old man is warming his numbed blood; at a cradle his
daughter sings of love. Aleko listens, and turns pale.

Zemphira: "Old husband, cruel husband, cut me, burn me, I am firm,
and fear neither knife nor fire. I hate thee, despise thee; I love
another, and loving him will die."

Zemphira: "Dislike them? And what do I care! I am singing for myself.
Cut me, burn me, I will not complain. Old husband, cruel husband, thou
shalt not discover him. He is fresher than the spring, warmer than
the summer-day. How young and bold he is! How much he loves me! How I
caressed him in the stillness of the night! How we laughed together at
thy white hair."

Zemphira: "Be angry if thou wilt.... the song is about thee." (She
retires singing, "Old husband, &c.")

The Old Gypsy: "Yes, I remember; that song was made in my time, and
has long been sung for folk''s amusement. Marioula used; as we wandered
over the Kagula Steppes, to sing it in the winter nights. The memory of
past years grows fainter hourly, but that song impressed me deeply."
. . . . . . . . . . . All is still. It is night, and the moon casts a
sheen over the blue of the southern sky. Zemphira has awakened the old
man.

The Old Gypsy: "Do not disturb him, keep[Pg 276] quiet. I have heard a
Russian saying that at this time, at midnight, the house spirit often
oppresses a sleeper''s breathing, and before dawn quits him again. Stay
with me."

Zemphira: "I care no longer for his love; I am weary, my heart wants
freedom. I have already—But hush! dost thou hear? He repeats another
name."

Zemphira: "Dost thou not hear? The hoarse groan, the savage grinding
of his teeth! How terrible! I will rouse him."

Zemphira: "He has turned, and raised himself; he calls me, he is
awake. I will go to him. Good night, and sleep."

Zemphira: "With my father. Some spirit has oppressed thee. In sleep
thy soul has suffered tortures. Thou didst frighten me; grinding thy
teeth and calling out to me."

The Old Gypsy: "Young madman. Why dost thou sigh so often? We here
are free. The sky is clean, the women famous for their beauty. Weep
not. Grief will destroy thee."

The Old Gypsy: "Be comforted, friend. She is but a child. Thy sadness
is unreasonable. Thou lovest anxiously and earnestly, but a woman''s
heart loves playfully. Behold, through the distant vault the full moon
wanders free, throwing her light equally over all the world. First
she peeps into one cloud, lights it brilliantly, and then glides to
another, making to each a rapid visit. Who shall point out to her one
spot in the heavens and say, ''There shalt thou stay''? Who to the young
girl''s heart shall say, ''Love only once and change not''? Be pacified."

Aleko: "How she loved me! How tenderly she leant upon me in the
silent desert when we were together in the hours of night! Full of
child-like gaiety, how often, with her pleasant prattle or intoxicating
caress, has she in an instant chased away my gloom! And now, Zemphira
is false! My Zemphira is cold!"

The Old Gypsy: "Listen, and I will tell thee a[Pg 278] story about myself.
Long, long ago, before the Danube was threatened by the Muscovite (thou
seest, Aleko, I speak of an ancient sorrow), at a time when we feared
the Sultan who, through Boodjak Pasha, ruled the country from the lofty
towers of Ackerman. I was young then, and my bosom throbbed with the
passion of youth. My curly locks were not streaked with white. Among
the young beauties there was one.... To whom I turned as to the sun,
till at last I called her mine. Alas! like a falling star, my youth
swiftly sped. Still briefer was our love. Marioula loved me but one
year."

"One day, by the waters of Kagula, we encountered a strange band of
gypsies, who pitched their tents near ours at the foot of the hill.
Two nights we passed together. On the third, they left, and Marioula
forsook her little daughter and followed them. I slept peacefully.
Day broke, and I awoke; my companion was not there. I searched, I
called—no trace remained. Zemphira cried, I wept too! From that moment
I became indifferent to all womankind. Never since has my gaze sought
amongst them a new companion. My dreary hours I have spent alone."

Aleko: "What! Didst thou not instantly pursue the ingrate and her
paramour, to plunge thy dagger in their false hearts?"

The Old Gypsy: "Why should I? Youth is[Pg 279] freer than the birds. Who can
restrain love? Everyone has his turn of happiness. Once fled, it will
never return."

Aleko: "No, I am different. Without a struggle never would I yield
my rights. At least, I would enjoy revenge. Ah, no! Even if I were to
find my enemy lying asleep over the abyss of the sea, I declare that
even then my foot should not spare him, but should unflinchingly kick
the helpless villain into the depths of the ocean, and mock his sudden
terrible awakening with a savage laugh of exultation. Long would his
fall resound a sweet and merry echo in my ears." . . . . . . . A Young
Gypsy: "One kiss, just one more embrace."

Aleko sleeps, and in his mind dim visions play. With a cry he wakes in
the dark, and, stretching out his jealous arm, clutches with a startled
hand the cold bed. His companion is far away..... Trembling he sits up
and listens.... All is quiet! Fear comes upon him. He shivers, then
grows hot. Rising from his bed, he leaves the tent, and, terribly
pale, wanders round the vans. All is silent, the fields are still,
and it is dark. The moon has risen in a mist, and the twinkling stars
are scarcely seen. But on the dewy grass slight footprints can be
discovered, leading to the tombs. With hurried tread he follows on the
path made by the ill-omened footmarks.

In the distance, on the road side, a tomb shines white before him.
Carried along by his hesitating feet, full of dread presentiment,
his lips quivering, his knees trembling ... he proceeds ... when
suddenly ... can it be a dream? Suddenly he perceives two shadows close
together, and hears two voices whispering over the desecrated grave.

The First Voice: "''Tis time."
The Second Voice: "Wait."
The First Voice: "''Tis time, my love."
The Second Voice: "No, no! We will wait till morning."
[Pg 281]The First Voice: "''Tis late already."
The Second Voice "How timidly thou lovest! One moment more."
The First Voice: "Thou wilt destroy me!"
The Second Voice: "One moment!"
The First Voice: "If my husband wakes and I am not——"

Zemphira: "Aleko, thou wouldst kill him! Look, thou art covered with
blood! Oh, what hast thou done?"

Zemphira: "I die, loving him." . . . . . . . From the east the
light of day is shining. Beyond the hill Aleko, besmeared with blood,
sits on the grave-stone, knife in hand. Two corpses lie before him.
The murderer''s face is terrible. An excited crowd of timid gypsies
surrounds him. A grave is being dug. A procession of sorrowing women
approaches, and each in turn kisses the eyes of the dead. The old
father sits apart, staring at his dead daughter in dumb despair. The
corpses are then raised, and into the cold bosom of the earth the young
couple are lowered. From a distance Aleko looks on. When they are
buried, and the last handful of earth thrown over them, without a word
he slowly rolls from off the stone on to the grass. Then the old man
approaches him, and says:

"Leave us, proud man. We area wild people and have no laws. We neither
torture nor execute. We exact neither tears nor blood, but with a
murderer we cannot live. Thou art not born to our wild life. Thou
wouldst have freedom for thyself alone. The sight of thee would be
intolerable to us; we are a timid, gentle folk. Thou art fierce and
bold. Depart, then; forgive us, and peace be with thee!"

He ended, and with great clamour all the wandering band arose, and at
once quitted the ill-fated camp and quickly vanished into the distant
desert tract. But one van, covered with old rugs, remained in the fatal
plain standing alone.

So, at the coming of winter and its morning mists, a flock of belated
cranes rise from a field loudly shrieking and flying to the distant
South, while one sad bird, struck by a fatal shot, with wounded
drooping wing, remains behind. Evening came. By the melancholy van no
fire was lighted; and no one slept beneath its covering of rugs that
night.' WHERE id = 'ddfa649e-934c-4cf8-91c4-1e05cdc4d2f0';
