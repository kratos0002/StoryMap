UPDATE stories SET original_text = original_text || 'of them, Roger de Salnis, said to his companion, Bernard
      Grandin:

The older man in turn looked through his opera glasses at a tall lady in a
      box opposite. She appeared to be still very young, and her striking beauty
      seemed to attract all eyes in every corner of the house. Her pale
      complexion, of an ivory tint, gave her the appearance of a statue, while a
      small diamond coronet glistened on her black hair like a streak of light.

When he had looked at her for some time, Bernard Grandin replied with a
      jocular accent of sincere conviction: “You may well call her
      beautiful!”

“Wait a moment. I can tell you exactly, for I have known her since
      she was a child and I saw her make her debut into society when she was
      quite a girl. She is—she is—thirty—thirty-six.”

“And what is more, they are all seven alive, as she is a very good
      mother. I occasionally go to the house, which is a very quiet and pleasant
      one, where one may see the phenomenon of the family in the midst of
      society.”

“Yes and no. Very likely there has been a little drama between them,
      one of those little domestic dramas which one suspects, never finds out
      exactly, but guesses at pretty closely.”

“I do not know anything about it. Mascaret leads a very fast life
      now, after being a model husband. As long as he remained a good spouse he
      had a shocking temper, was crabbed and easily took offence, but since he
      has been leading his present wild life he has become quite different, But
      one might surmise that he has some trouble, a worm gnawing somewhere, for
      he has aged very much.”

Thereupon the two friends talked philosophically for some minutes about
      the secret, unknowable troubles which differences of character or perhaps
      physical antipathies, which were not perceived at first, give rise to in
      families, and then Roger de Salnis, who was still looking at Madame de
      Mascaret through his opera glasses, said: “It is almost incredible
      that that woman can have had seven children!”

“Yes, in eleven years; after which, when she was thirty, she refused
      to have any more, in order to take her place in society, which she seems
      likely to do for many years.”

“Why? Ah! my dear fellow, just consider! Eleven years in a condition
      of motherhood for such a woman! What a hell! All her youth, all her
      beauty, every hope of success, every poetical ideal of a brilliant life
      sacrificed to that abominable law of reproduction which turns the normal
      woman into a mere machine for bringing children into the world.”

“Yes, but I say that Nature is our enemy, that we must always fight
      against Nature, for she is continually bringing us back to an animal
      state. You may be sure that God has not put anything on this earth that is
      clean, pretty, elegant or accessory to our ideal; the human brain has done
      it. It is man who has introduced a little grace, beauty, unknown charm and
      mystery into creation by singing about it, interpreting it, by admiring it
      as a poet, idealizing it as an artist and by explaining it through
      science, doubtless making mistakes, but finding ingenious reasons, hidden
      grace and beauty, unknown charm and mystery in the various phenomena of
      Nature. God created only coarse beings, full of the germs of disease, who,
      after a few years of bestial enjoyment, grow old and infirm, with all the
      ugliness and all the want of power of human decrepitude. He seems to have
      made them only in order that they may reproduce their species in an
      ignoble manner and then die like ephemeral insects. I said reproduce their
      species in an ignoble manner and I adhere to that expression. What is
      there as a matter of fact more ignoble and more repugnant than that act of
      reproduction of living beings, against which all delicate minds always
      have revolted and always will revolt? Since all the organs which have been
      invented by this economical and malicious Creator serve two purposes, why
      did He not choose another method of performing that sacred mission, which
      is the noblest and the most exalted of all human functions? The mouth,
      which nourishes the body by means of material food, also diffuses abroad
      speech and thought. Our flesh renews itself of its own accord, while we
      are thinking about it. The olfactory organs, through which the vital air
      reaches the lungs, communicate all the perfumes of the world to the brain:
      the smell of flowers, of woods, of trees, of the sea. The ear, which
      enables us to communicate with our fellow men, has also allowed us to
      invent music, to create dreams, happiness, infinite and even physical
      pleasure by means of sound! But one might say that the cynical and cunning
      Creator wished to prohibit man from ever ennobling and idealizing his
      intercourse with women. Nevertheless man has found love, which is not a
      bad reply to that sly Deity, and he has adorned it with so much poetry
      that woman often forgets the sensual part of it. Those among us who are
      unable to deceive themselves have invented vice and refined debauchery,
      which is another way of laughing at God and paying homage, immodest
      homage, to beauty.

“Look at that woman! Is it not abominable to think that such a
      jewel, such a pearl, born to be beautiful, admired, feted and adored, has
      spent eleven years of her life in providing heirs for the Comte de
      Mascaret?”

Bernard Grandin replied with a laugh: “There is a great deal of
      truth in all that, but very few people would understand you.”

Salnis became more and more animated. “Do you know how I picture God
      myself?” he said. “As an enormous, creative organ beyond our
      ken, who scatters millions of worlds into space, just as one single fish
      would deposit its spawn in the sea. He creates because it is His function
      as God to do so, but He does not know what He is doing and is stupidly
      prolific in His work and is ignorant of the combinations of all kinds
      which are produced by His scattered germs. The human mind is a lucky
      little local, passing accident which was totally unforeseen, and condemned
      to disappear with this earth and to recommence perhaps here or elsewhere
      the same or different with fresh combinations of eternally new beginnings.
      We owe it to this little lapse of intelligence on His part that we are
      very uncomfortable in this world which was not made for us, which had not
      been prepared to receive us, to lodge and feed us or to satisfy reflecting
      beings, and we owe it to Him also that we have to struggle without ceasing
      against what are still called the designs of Providence, when we are
      really refined and civilized beings.”

Grandin, who was listening to him attentively as he had long known the
      surprising outbursts of his imagination, asked him: “Then you
      believe that human thought is the spontaneous product of blind divine
      generation?”

“Naturally! A fortuitous function of the nerve centres of our brain,
      like the unforeseen chemical action due to new mixtures and similar also
      to a charge of electricity, caused by friction or the unexpected proximity
      of some substance, similar to all phenomena caused by the infinite and
      fruitful fermentation of living matter.

“But, my dear fellow, the truth of this must be evident to any one
      who looks about him. If the human mind, ordained by an omniscient Creator,
      had been intended to be what it has become, exacting, inquiring, agitated,
      tormented—so different from mere animal thought and resignation—would
      the world which was created to receive the beings which we now are have
      been this unpleasant little park for small game, this salad patch, this
      wooded, rocky and spherical kitchen garden where your improvident
      Providence had destined us to live naked, in caves or under trees,
      nourished on the flesh of slaughtered animals, our brethren, or on raw
      vegetables nourished by the sun and the rain?

“But it is sufficient to reflect for a moment, in order to
      understand that this world was not made for such creatures as we are.
      Thought, which is developed by a miracle in the nerves of the cells in our
      brain, powerless, ignorant and confused as it is, and as it will always
      remain, makes all of us who are intellectual beings eternal and wretched
      exiles on earth.

“Look at this earth, as God has given it to those who inhabit it. Is
      it not visibly and solely made, planted and covered with forests for the
      sake of animals? What is there for us? Nothing. And for them, everything,
      and they have nothing to do but to eat or go hunting and eat each other,
      according to their instincts, for God never foresaw gentleness and
      peaceable manners; He only foresaw the death of creatures which were bent
      on destroying and devouring each other. Are not the quail, the pigeon and
      the partridge the natural prey of the hawk? the sheep, the stag and the ox
      that of the great flesh-eating animals, rather than meat to be fattened
      and served up to us with truffles, which have been unearthed by pigs for
      our special benefit?

“As to ourselves, the more civilized, intellectual and refined we
      are, the more we ought to conquer and subdue that animal instinct, which
      represents the will of God in us. And so, in order to mitigate our lot as
      brutes, we have discovered and made everything, beginning with houses,
      then exquisite food, sauces, sweetmeats, pastry, drink, stuffs, clothes,
      ornaments, beds, mattresses, carriages, railways and innumerable machines,
      besides arts and sciences, writing and poetry. Every ideal comes from us
      as do all the amenities of life, in order to make our existence as simple
      reproducers, for which divine Providence solely intended us, less
      monotonous and less hard.

“Look at this theatre. Is there not here a human world created by
      us, unforeseen and unknown to eternal fate, intelligible to our minds
      alone, a sensual and intellectual distraction, which has been invented
      solely by and for that discontented and restless little animal, man?

“Look at that woman, Madame de Mascaret. God intended her to live in
      a cave, naked or wrapped up in the skins of wild animals. But is she not
      better as she is? But, speaking of her, does any one know why and how her
      brute of a husband, having such a companion by his side, and especially
      after having been boorish enough to make her a mother seven times, has
      suddenly left her, to run after bad women?”

Grandin replied: “Oh! my dear fellow, this is probably the only
      reason. He found that raising a family was becoming too expensive, and
      from reasons of domestic economy he has arrived at the same principles
      which you lay down as a philosopher.”

Just then the curtain rose for the third act, and they turned round, took
      off their hats and sat down.

The Comte and Comtesse Mascaret were sitting side by side in the carriage
      which was taking them home from the Opera, without speaking but suddenly
      the husband said to his wife: “Gabrielle!”

“Think that I can no longer see my children or feel them round me,
      without having my heart burdened with this doubt. Tell me which of them it
      is, and I swear that I will forgive you and treat it like the others.”

“Do you not see that I can no longer endure this life, this thought
      which is wearing me out, or this question which I am constantly asking
      myself, this question which tortures me each time I look at them? It is
      driving me mad.”

“Terribly. Should I, without that, have accepted the horror of
      living by your side, and the still greater horror of feeling and knowing
      that there is one among them whom I cannot recognize and who prevents me
      from loving the others?”

“Yes, for do I not tell you every day that it is intolerable torture
      to me? Should I have remained in that house, near you and them, if I did
      not love them? Oh! You have behaved abominably toward me. All the
      affection of my heart I have bestowed upon my children, and that you know.
      I am for them a father of the olden time, as I was for you a husband of
      one of the families of old, for by instinct I have remained a natural man,
      a man of former days. Yes, I will confess it, you have made me terribly
      jealous, because you are a woman of another race, of another soul, with
      other requirements. Oh! I shall never forget the things you said to me,
      but from that day I troubled myself no more about you. I did not kill you,
      because then I should have had no means on earth of ever discovering which
      of our—of your children is not mine. I have waited, but I have
      suffered more than you would believe, for I can no longer venture to love
      them, except, perhaps, the two eldest; I no longer venture to look at
      them, to call them to me, to kiss them; I cannot take them on my knee
      without asking myself, ''Can it be this one?'' I have been correct in my
      behavior toward you for six years, and even kind and complaisant. Tell me
      the truth, and I swear that I will do nothing unkind.”

He thought, in spite of the darkness of the carriage, that he could
      perceive that she was moved, and feeling certain that she was going to
      speak at last, he said: “I beg you, I beseech you to tell me”
      he said.

“I have been more guilty than you think perhaps,” she replied,
      “but I could no longer endure that life of continual motherhood, and
      I had only one means of driving you from me. I lied before God and I lied,
      with my hand raised to my children''s head, for I never have wronged you.”

He seized her arm in the darkness, and squeezing it as he had done on that
      terrible day of their drive in the Bois de Boulogne, he stammered:

But, wild with grief, he said with a groan: “I shall have fresh
      doubts that will never end! When did you lie, the last time or now? How am
      I to believe you at present? How can one believe a woman after that? I
      shall never again know what I am to think. I would rather you had said to
      me, ''It is Jacques or it is Jeanne.''”

The carriage drove into the courtyard of the house and when it had drawn
      up in front of the steps the count alighted first, as usual, and offered
      his wife his arm to mount the stairs. As soon as they reached the first
      floor he said: “May I speak to you for a few moments longer?”
      And she replied, “I am quite willing.”

They went into a small drawing-room and a footman, in some surprise,
      lighted the wax candles. As soon as he had left the room and they were
      alone the count continued: “How am I to know the truth? I have
      begged you a thousand times to speak, but you have remained dumb,
      impenetrable, inflexible, inexorable, and now to-day you tell me that you
      have been lying. For six years you have actually allowed me to believe
      such a thing! No, you are lying now, I do not know why, but out of pity
      for me, perhaps?”

She replied in a sincere and convincing manner: “If I had not done
      so, I should have had four more children in the last six years!”

“Oh!” she replied, “I do not feel that I am the mother
      of children who never have been born; it is enough for me to be the mother
      of those that I have and to love them with all my heart. I am a woman of
      the civilized world, monsieur—we all are—and we are no longer,
      and we refuse to be, mere females to restock the earth.”

He looked her full in the face, and how beautiful she was, with her gray
      eyes, like the cold sky. In her dark hair sparkled the diamond coronet,
      like a radiance. He suddenly felt, felt by a kind of intuition, that this
      grand creature was not merely a being destined to perpetuate the race, but
      the strange and mysterious product of all our complicated desires which
      have been accumulating in us for centuries but which have been turned
      aside from their primitive and divine object and have wandered after a
      mystic, imperfectly perceived and intangible beauty. There are some women
      like that, who blossom only for our dreams, adorned with every poetical
      attribute of civilization, with that ideal luxury, coquetry and esthetic
      charm which surround woman, a living statue that brightens our life.

Her husband remained standing before her, stupefied at his tardy and
      obscure discovery, confusedly hitting on the cause of his former jealousy
      and understanding it all very imperfectly, and at last he said: “I
      believe you, for I feel at this moment that you are not lying, and before
      I really thought that you were.”

Then he went out, still looking at her, and surprised that she was still
      so beautiful and feeling a strange emotion arising in him.

He was a clerk in the Bureau of Public Education and lived at Batignolles.
      He took the omnibus to Paris every morning and always sat opposite a girl,
      with whom he fell in love.

She was employed in a shop and went in at the same time every day. She was
      a little brunette, one of those girls whose eyes are so dark that they
      look like black spots, on a complexion like ivory. He always saw her
      coming at the corner of the same street, and she generally had to run to
      catch the heavy vehicle, and sprang upon the steps before the horses had
      quite stopped. Then she got inside, out of breath, and, sitting down,
      looked round her.

The first time that he saw her, Francois Tessier liked the face. One
      sometimes meets a woman whom one longs to clasp in one''s arms without even
      knowing her. That girl seemed to respond to some chord in his being, to
      that sort of ideal of love which one cherishes in the depths of the heart,
      without knowing it.

He looked at her intently, not meaning to be rude, and she became
      embarrassed and blushed. He noticed it, and tried to turn away his eyes;
      but he involuntarily fixed them upon her again every moment, although he
      tried to look in another direction; and, in a few days, they seemed to
      know each other without having spoken. He gave up his place to her when
      the omnibus was full, and got outside, though he was very sorry to do it.
      By this time she had got so far as to greet him with a little smile; and,
      although she always dropped her eyes under his looks, which she felt were
      too ardent, yet she did not appear offended at being looked at in such a
      manner.

They ended by speaking. A kind of rapid friendship had become established
      between them, a daily freemasonry of half an hour, and that was certainly
      one of the most charming half hours in his life to him. He thought of her
      all the rest of the day, saw her image continually during the long office
      hours. He was haunted and bewitched by that floating and yet tenacious
      recollection which the form of a beloved woman leaves in us, and it seemed
      to him that if he could win that little person it would be maddening
      happiness to him, almost above human realization.

Every morning she now shook hands with him, and he preserved the sense of
      that touch and the recollection of the gentle pressure of her little
      fingers until the next day, and he almost fancied that he preserved the
      imprint on his palm. He anxiously waited for this short omnibus ride,
      while Sundays seemed to him heartbreaking days. However, there was no
      doubt that she loved him, for one Saturday, in spring, she promised to go
      and lunch with him at Maisons-Laffitte the next day.

She was at the railway station first, which surprised him, but she said:
      “Before going, I want to speak to you. We have twenty minutes, and
      that is more than I shall take for what I have to say.”

She trembled as she hung on his arm, and looked down, her cheeks pale, as
      she continued: “I do not want you to be deceived in me, and I shall
      not go there with you, unless you promise, unless you swear—not to
      do—not to do anything—that is at all improper.”

She had suddenly become as red as a poppy, and said no more. He did not
      know what to reply, for he was happy and disappointed at the same time. He
      should love her less, certainly, if he knew that her conduct was light,
      but then it would be so charming, so delicious to have a little
      flirtation.

As he did not say anything, she began to speak again in an agitated voice
      and with tears in her eyes. “If you do not promise to respect me
      altogether, I shall return home.” And so he squeezed her arm
      tenderly and replied: “I promise, you shall only do what you like.”
      She appeared relieved in mind, and asked, with a smile: “Do you
      really mean it?” And he looked into her eyes and replied: “I
      swear it” “Now you may take the tickets,” she said.

During the journey they could hardly speak, as the carriage was full, and
      when they reached Maisons-Laffite they went toward the Seine. The sun,
      which shone full on the river, on the leaves and the grass, seemed to be
      reflected in their hearts, and they went, hand in hand, along the bank,
      looking at the shoals of little fish swimming near the bank, and they
      walked on, brimming over with happiness, as if they were walking on air.

“Certainly not; it is quite natural.” “No, no; it is not
      natural for me —because I do not wish to commit a fault, and yet
      this is how girls fall. But if you only knew how wretched it is, every day
      the same thing, every day in the month and every month in the year. I live
      quite alone with mamma, and as she has had a great deal of trouble, she is
      not very cheerful. I do the best I can, and try to laugh in spite of
      everything, but I do not always succeed. But, all the same, it was wrong
      in me to come, though you, at any rate, will not be sorry.”

By way of an answer, he kissed her ardently on the ear that was nearest
      him, but she moved from him with an abrupt movement, and, getting suddenly
      angry, exclaimed: “Oh! Monsieur Francois, after what you swore to
      me!” And they went back to Maisons-Laffitte.

They had lunch at the Petit-Havre, a low house, buried under four enormous
      poplar trees, by the side of the river. The air, the heat, the weak white
      wine and the sensation of being so close together made them silent; their
      faces were flushed and they had a feeling of oppression; but, after the
      coffee, they regained their high spirits, and, having crossed the Seine,
      started off along the bank, toward the village of La Frette. Suddenly he
      asked: “What-is your name?”

The girl picked daisies and made them into a great bunch, while he sang
      vigorously, as unrestrained as a colt that has been turned into a meadow.
      On their left a vine-covered slope followed the river. Francois stopped
      motionless with astonishment: “Oh, look there!” he said.

The vines had come to an end, and the whole slope was covered with lilac
      bushes in flower. It was a purple wood! A kind of great carpet of flowers
      stretched over the earth, reaching as far as the village, more than two
      miles off. She also stood, surprised and delighted, and murmured: “Oh!
      how pretty!” And, crossing a meadow, they ran toward that curious
      low hill, which, every year, furnishes all the lilac that is drawn through
      Paris on the carts of the flower venders.

There was a narrow path beneath the trees, so they took it, and when they
      came to a small clearing, sat down.

Swarms of flies were buzzing around them and making a continuous, gentle
      sound, and the sun, the bright sun of a perfectly still day, shone over
      the bright slopes and from that forest of blossoms a powerful fragrance
      was borne toward them, a breath of perfume, the breath of the flowers.

A church clock struck in the distance, and they embraced gently, then,
      without the knowledge of anything but that kiss, lay down on the grass.
      But she soon came to herself with the feeling of a great misfortune, and
      began to cry and sob with grief, with her face buried in her hands.

He tried to console her, but she wanted to start to return and to go home
      immediately; and she kept saying, as she walked along quickly: “Good
      heavens! good heavens!”

He said to her: “Louise! Louise! Please let us stop here.” But
      now her cheeks were red and her eyes hollow, and, as soon as they got to
      the railway station in Paris, she left him without even saying good-by.
      III

When he met her in the omnibus, next day, she appeared to him to be
      changed and thinner, and she said to him: “I want to speak to you;
      we will get down at the Boulevard.”

“We must bid each other good-by; I cannot meet you again.”
      “But why?” he asked. “Because I cannot; I have been
      culpable, and I will not be so again.”

Then he implored her, tortured by his love, but she replied firmly:
      “No, I cannot, I cannot.” He, however, only grew all the more
      excited and promised to marry her, but she said again: “No,”
      and left him.

For a week he did not see her. He could not manage to meet her, and, as he
      did not know her address, he thought that he had lost her altogether. On
      the ninth day, however, there was a ring at his bell, and when he opened
      the door, she was there. She threw herself into his arms and did not
      resist any longer, and for three months they were close friends. He was
      beginning to grow tired of her, when she whispered something to him, and
      then he had one idea and wish: to break with her at any price. As,
      however, he could not do that, not knowing how to begin, or what to say,
      full of anxiety through fear of the consequences of his rash indiscretion,
      he took a decisive step: one night he changed his lodgings and
      disappeared.

The blow was so heavy that she did not look, for the man who had abandoned
      her, but threw herself at her mother''s knees and confessed her misfortune,
      and, some months after, gave birth to a boy. IV

Years passed, and Francois Tessier grew old, without there having been any
      alteration in his life. He led the dull, monotonous life of an office
      clerk, without hope and without expectation. Every day he got up at the
      same time, went through the same streets, went through the same door, past
      the same porter, went into the same office, sat in the same chair, and did
      the same work. He was alone in the world, alone during the day in the
      midst of his different colleagues, and alone at night in his bachelor''s
      lodgings, and he laid by a hundred francs a month against old age.

Every Sunday he went to the Champs-Elysees, to watch the elegant people,
      the carriages and the pretty women, and the next day he used to say to one
      of his colleagues: “The return of the carriages from the Bois du
      Boulogne was very brilliant yesterday.” One fine Sunday morning,
      however, he went into the Parc Monceau, where the mothers and nurses,
      sitting on the sides of the walks, watched the children playing, and
      suddenly Francois Tessier started. A woman passed by, holding two children
      by the hand, a little boy of about ten and a little girl of four. It was
      she!

He walked another hundred yards anti then fell into a chair, choking with
      emotion. She had not recognized him, and so he came back, wishing to see
      her again. She was sitting down now, and the boy was standing by her side
      very quietly, while the little girl was making sand castles. It was she,
      it was certainly she, but she had the reserved appearance of a lady, was
      dressed simply, and looked self-possessed and dignified. He looked at her
      from a distance, for he did not venture to go near; but the little boy
      raised his head, and Francois Tessier felt himself tremble. It was his own
      son, there could be no doubt of that. And, as he looked at him, he thought
      he could recognize himself as he appeared in an old photograph taken years
      ago. He remained hidden behind a tree, waiting for her to go that he might
      follow her.

He did not sleep that night. The idea of the child especially tormented
      him. His son! Oh, if he could only have known, have been sure! But what
      could he have done? However, he went to the house where she lived and
      asked about her. He was told that a neighbor, an honorable man of strict
      morals, had been touched by her distress and had married her; he knew the
      fault she had committed and had married her, and had even recognized the
      child, his, Francois Tessier''s child, as his own.

He returned to the Parc Monceau every Sunday, for then he always saw her,
      and each time he was seized with a mad, an irresistible longing to take
      his son into his arms, to cover him with kisses and to steal him, to carry
      him off.

He suffered horribly in his wretched isolation as an old bachelor, with
      nobody to care for him, and he also suffered atrocious mental torture,
      torn by paternal tenderness springing from remorse, longing and jealousy
      and from that need of loving one''s own children which nature has implanted
      in all. At last he determined to make a despairing attempt, and, going up
      to her, as she entered the park, he said, standing in the middle of the
      path, pale and with trembling lips: “You do not recognize me.”
      She raised her eyes, looked at him, uttered an exclamation of horror, of
      terror, and, taking the two children by the hand, she rushed away,
      dragging them after her, while he went home and wept inconsolably.

Months passed without his seeing her again, but he suffered, day and
      night, for he was a prey to his paternal love. He would gladly have died,
      if he could only have kissed his son; he would have committed murder,
      performed any task, braved any danger, ventured anything. He wrote to her,
      but she did not reply, and, after writing her some twenty letters, he saw
      that there was no hope of altering her determination, and then he formed
      the desperate resolution of writing to her husband, being quite prepared
      to receive a bullet from a revolver, if need be. His letter only consisted
      of a few lines, as follows:

“Monsieur: You must have a perfect horror of my name, but I am so
      wretched, so overcome by misery that my only hope is in you, and,
      therefore, I venture to request you to grant me an interview of only five
      minutes.

As he went up the staircase, Francois Tessier''s heart beat so violently
      that he had to stop several times. There was a dull and violent thumping
      noise in his breast, as of some animal galloping; and he could breathe
      only with difficulty, and had to hold on to the banisters, in order not to
      fall.

He rang the bell on the third floor, and when a maid servant had opened
      the door, he asked: “Does Monsieur Flamel live here?” “Yes,
      monsieur. Kindly come in.”

He was shown into the drawing-room; he was alone, and waited, feeling
      bewildered, as in the midst of a catastrophe, until a door opened, and a
      man came in. He was tall, serious and rather stout, and wore a black frock
      coat, and pointed to a chair with his hand. Francois Tessier sat down, and
      then said, with choking breath: “Monsieur—monsieur—I do
      not know whether you know my name—whether you know——”

Monsieur Flamel interrupted him. “You need not tell it me, monsieur,
      I know it. My wife has spoken to me about you.” He spoke in the
      dignified tone of voice of a good man who wishes to be severe, and with
      the commonplace stateliness of an honorable man, and Francois Tessier
      continued:

“Well, monsieur, I want to say this: I am dying of grief, of
      remorse, of shame, and I would like once, only once to kiss the child.”

Monsieur Flamel got up and rang the bell, and when the servant came in, he
      said: “Will you bring Louis here?” When she had gone out, they
      remained face to face, without speaking, as they had nothing more to say
      to one another, and waited. Then, suddenly, a little boy of ten rushed
      into the room and ran up to the man whom he believed to be his father, but
      he stopped when he saw the stranger, and Monsieur Flamel kissed him and
      said: “Now, go and kiss that gentleman, my dear.” And the
      child went up to the stranger and looked at him.

Francois Tessier had risen. He let his hat fall, and was ready to fall
      himself as he looked at his son, while Monsieur Flamel had turned away,
      from a feeling of delicacy, and was looking out of the window.

The child waited in surprise; but he picked up the hat and gave it to the
      stranger. Then Francois, taking the child up in his arms, began to kiss
      him wildly all over his face; on his eyes, his cheeks, his mouth, his
      hair; and the youngster, frightened at the shower of kisses, tried to
      avoid them, turned away his head, and pushed away the man''s face with his
      little hands. But suddenly Francois Tessier put him down and cried:
      “Good-by! good-by!” And he rushed out of the room as if he had
      been a thief.

Some people are Freethinkers from sheer stupidity. My Uncle Sosthenes was
      one of these. Some people are often religious for the same reason. The
      very sight of a priest threw my uncle into a violent rage. He would shake
      his fist and make grimaces at him, and would then touch a piece of iron
      when the priest''s back was turned, forgetting that the latter action
      showed a belief after all, the belief in the evil eye. Now, when beliefs
      are unreasonable, one should have all or none at all. I myself am a
      Freethinker; I revolt at all dogmas, but feel no anger toward places of
      worship, be they Catholic, Apostolic, Roman, Protestant, Greek, Russian,
      Buddhist, Jewish, or Mohammedan.

My uncle was a Freemason, and I used to declare that they are stupider
      than old women devotees. That is my opinion, and I maintain it; if we must
      have any religion at all, the old one is good enough for me.

What is their object? Mutual help to be obtained by tickling the palms of
      each other''s hands. I see no harm in it, for they put into practice the
      Christian precept: “Do unto others as ye would they should do unto
      you.” The only difference consists in the tickling, but it does not
      seem worth while to make such a fuss about lending a poor devil half a
      crown.

“We are raising up a religion against a religion; Free Thought will
      kill clericalism. Freemasonry is the stronghold, of those who are
      demolishing all deities.”

“Very well, my dear uncle,” I would reply—in my heart I
      felt inclined to say, “You old idiot! it is just that which I am
      blaming you for. Instead of destroying, you are organizing competition; it
      is only a case of lowering prices. And then, if you admitted only
      Freethinkers among you, I could understand it, but you admit anybody. You
      have a number of Catholics among you, even the leaders of the party. Pius
      IX is said to have been one of you before he became pope. If you call a
      society with such an organization a bulwark against clericalism, I think
      it is an extremely weak one.”

“My dear boy,” my uncle would reply, with a wink, “we
      are most to be dreaded in politics; slowly and surely we are everywhere
      undermining the monarchical spirit.”

Then I broke out: “Yes, you are very clever! If you tell me that
      Freemasonry is an election machine, I will grant it. I will never deny
      that it is used as a machine to control candidates of all shades; if you
      say that it is only used to hoodwink people, to drill them to go to the
      polls as soldiers are sent under fire, I agree with you; if you declare
      that it is indispensable to all political ambitions because it changes all
      its members into electoral agents, I should say to you: ''That is as clear
      as the sun.'' But when you tell me that it serves to undermine the
      monarchical spirit, I can only laugh in your face.

“Just consider that gigantic and secret democratic association which
      had Prince Napoleon for its grand master under the Empire; which has the
      Crown Prince for its grand master in Germany, the Czar''s brother in
      Russia, and to which the Prince of Wales and King Humbert, and nearly all
      the crowned heads of the globe belong.”

“You are quite right,” my uncle said; “but all these
      persons are serving our projects without guessing it.”

On meeting they shook hands in a manner that was irresistibly funny; one
      could see that they were going through a series of secret, mysterious
      signs.

Then my uncle would take his friend into a corner to tell him something
      important, and at dinner they had a peculiar way of looking at each other,
      and of drinking to each other, in a manner as if to say: “We know
      all about it, don''t we?”

And to think that there are millions on the face of the globe who are
      amused at such monkey tricks! I would sooner be a Jesuit.

Now, in our town there really was an old Jesuit who was my uncle''s
      detestation. Every time he met him, or if he only saw him at a distance,
      he used to say: “Get away, you toad.” And then, taking my arm,
      he would whisper to me:

It was close on Holy Week, and my uncle made up his mind to give a dinner
      on Good Friday, a real dinner, with his favorite chitterlings and black
      puddings. I resisted as much as I could, and said:

“I shall eat meat on that day, but at home, quite by myself. Your
      manifestation, as you call it, is an idiotic idea. Why should you
      manifest? What does it matter to you if people do not eat any meat?”

But my uncle would not be persuaded. He asked three of his friends to dine
      with him at one of the best restaurants in the town, and as he was going
      to pay the bill I had certainly, after all, no scruples about manifesting.

At four o''clock we took a conspicuous place in the most frequented
      restaurant in the town, and my uncle ordered dinner in a loud voice for
      six o''clock.

We sat down punctually, and at ten o''clock we had not yet finished. Five
      of us had drunk eighteen bottles of choice, still wine and four of
      champagne. Then my uncle proposed what he was in the habit of calling
      “the archbishop''s circuit.” Each man put six small glasses in
      front of him, each of them filled with a different liqueur, and they had
      all to be emptied at one gulp, one after another, while one of the waiters
      counted twenty. It was very stupid, but my uncle thought it was very
      suitable to the occasion.

At eleven o''clock he was as drunk as a fly. So we had to take him home in
      a cab and put him to bed, and one could easily foresee that his
      anti-clerical demonstration would end in a terrible fit of indigestion.

As I was going back to my lodgings, being rather drunk myself, with a
      cheerful drunkenness, a Machiavellian idea struck me which satisfied all
      my sceptical instincts.

I arranged my necktie, put on a look of great distress, and went and, rang
      loudly at the old Jesuit''s door. As he was deaf he made me wait a longish
      while, but at length appeared at his window in a cotton nightcap and asked
      what I wanted.

“Make haste, reverend sir, and open the door; a poor, despairing,
      sick man is in need of your spiritual ministrations.”

The good, kind man put on his trousers as quickly as he could, and came
      down without his cassock. I told him in a breathless voice that my uncle,
      the Freethinker, had been taken suddenly ill, and fearing it was going to
      be something serious, he had been seized with a sudden dread of death, and
      wished to see the priest and talk to him; to have his advice and comfort,
      to make his peace with the Church, and to confess, so as to be able to
      cross the dreaded threshold at peace with himself; and I added in a
      mocking tone:

“Wait a moment, my son; I will come with you.” But I replied:
      “Pardon me, reverend father, if I do not go with you; but my
      convictions will not allow me to do so. I even refused to come and fetch
      you, so I beg you not to say that you have seen me, but to declare that
      you had a presentiment—a sort of revelation of his illness.”

The priest consented and went off quickly; knocked at my uncle''s door, and
      was soon let in; and I saw the black cassock disappear within that
      stronghold of Free Thought.

I hid under a neighboring gateway to wait results. Had he been well, my
      uncle would have half-murdered the Jesuit, but I knew that he would
      scarcely be able to move an arm, and I asked myself gleefully what sort of
      a scene would take place between these antagonists, what disputes, what
      arguments, what a hubbub, and what would be the issue of the situation,
      which my uncle''s indignation would render still more tragic?

Meanwhile it was getting very cold, and I noticed that the Jesuit stayed a
      long time, and I thought: “They are having an argument, I suppose.”

One, two, three hours passed, and still the reverend father did not come
      out. What had happened? Had my uncle died in a fit when he saw him, or had
      he killed the cassocked gentleman? Perhaps they had mutually devoured each
      other? This last supposition appeared very unlikely, for I fancied that my
      uncle was quite incapable of swallowing a grain more nourishment at that
      moment.

I was very uneasy, and, not venturing to go into the house myself, went to
      one of my friends who lived opposite. I woke him up, explained matters to
      him, much to his amusement and astonishment, and took possession of his
      window.

At nine o''clock he relieved me, and I got a little sleep. At two o''clock
      I, in my turn, replaced him. We were utterly astonished.

At six o''clock the Jesuit left, with a very happy and satisfied look on
      his face, and we saw him go away with a quiet step.

Then, timid and ashamed, I went and knocked at the door of my uncle''s
      house; and when the servant opened it I did not dare to ask her any
      questions, but went upstairs without saying a word.

My uncle was lying, pale and exhausted, with weary, sorrowful eyes and
      heavy arms, on his bed. A little religious picture was fastened to one of
      the bed curtains with a pin.

“I don''t know; it was most surprising. But what is stranger still is
      that the Jesuit priest who has just left—you know, that excellent
      man whom I have made such fun of—had a divine revelation of my
      state, and came to see me.”

I was seized with an almost uncontrollable desire to laugh, and with
      difficulty said: “Oh, really!”

“Yes, he came. He heard a voice telling him to get up and come to
      me, because I was going to die. I was a revelation.”

I pretended to sneeze, so as not to burst out laughing; I felt inclined to
      roll on the ground with amusement.

“And you received him, uncle? You, a Freethinker, a Freemason? You
      did not have him thrown out of doors?”

“Listen a moment, it is so astonishing—so astonishing and
      providential! He also spoke to me about my father; it seems he knew him
      formerly.”

“I know that, but I was very ill, and he looked after me most
      devotedly all night long. He was perfect; no doubt he saved my life; those
      men all know a little of medicine.”

“Oh! he looked after you all night? But you said just now that he
      had only been gone a very short time.”

“That is quite true; I kept him to breakfast after all his kindness.
      He had it at a table by my bedside while I drank a cup of tea.”

“Don''t joke, Gaston; such things are out of place at times. He has
      shown me more devotion than many a relation would have done, and I expect
      to have his convictions respected.”

This rather upset me, but I answered, nevertheless: “Very well,
      uncle; and what did you do after breakfast?”

“We played a game of bezique, and then he repeated his breviary
      while I read a little book which he happened to have in his pocket, and
      which was not by any means badly written.”

“Yes, and no, or, rather—no. It is the history of their
      missions in Central Africa, and is rather a book of travels and
      adventures. What these men have done is very grand.”

I began to feel that matters were going badly, so I got up. “Well,
      good-by, uncle,” I said, “I see you are going to give up
      Freemasonry for religion; you are a renegade.”

My joke turned out very badly for me! My uncle became thoroughly
      converted, and if that had been all I should not have cared so much.
      Clerical or Freemason, to me it is all the same; six of one and half a
      dozen of the other; but the worst of it is that he has just made his will—yes,
      made his will—and he has disinherited me in favor of that rascally
      Jesuit!

“Come with me,” said my friend Boisrene, “you will see
      some very interesting bric-a-brac and works of art there.”

He conducted me to the first floor of an elegant house in one of the big
      streets of Paris. We were welcomed by a very pleasing man, with excellent
      manners, who led us from room to room, showing us rare things, the price
      of which he mentioned carelessly. Large sums, ten, twenty, thirty, fifty
      thousand francs, dropped from his lips with such grace and ease that one
      could not doubt that this gentleman-merchant had millions shut up in his
      safe.

I had known him by reputation for a long time. Very bright, clever,
      intelligent, he acted as intermediary in all sorts of transactions. He
      kept in touch with all the richest art amateurs in Paris, and even of
      Europe and America, knowing their tastes and preferences; he apprised them
      by letter, or by wire if they lived in a distant city, as soon as he knew
      of some work of art which might suit them.

Men of the best society had had recourse to him in times of difficulty,
      either to find money for gambling, or to pay off a debt, or to sell a
      picture, a family jewel, or a tapestry.

Boisrene seemed very intimate with this strange merchant. They must have
      worked together in many a deal. I observed the man with great interest.

He was tall, thin, bald, and very elegant. His soft, insinuating voice had
      a peculiar, tempting charm which seemed to give the objects a special
      value. When he held anything in his hands, he turned it round and round,
      looking at it with such skill, refinement, and sympathy that the object
      seemed immediately to be beautiful and transformed by his look and touch.
      And its value increased in one''s estimation, after the object had passed
      from the showcase into his hands.

“And your Crucifix,” said Boisrene, “that beautiful
      Renaissance Crucifix which you showed me last year?”

“It has been sold, and in a very peculiar manner. There is a real
      Parisian story for you! Would you like to hear it?”

“Certainly. Mme. Samoris is a woman of the world who has a daughter,
      without anyone having known her husband. At any rate, she is received in a
      certain tolerant, or blind society. She goes to church and devoutly
      partakes of Communion, so that everyone may know it, and she never
      compromises herself. She expects her daughter to marry well. Is that
      correct?”

“Yes, but I will complete your information. She is a woman who makes
      herself respected by her admirers in spite of everything. That is a rare
      quality, for in this manner she can get what she wishes from a man. The
      man whom she has chosen without his suspecting it courts her for a long
      time, longs for her timidly, wins her with astonishment and possesses her
      with consideration. He does not notice that he is paying, she is so
      tactful; and she maintains her relations on such a footing of reserve and
      dignity that he would slap the first man who dared doubt her in the least.
      And all this in the best of faith.

“Several times I have been able to render little services to this
      woman. She has no secrets from me.

“Toward the beginning of January she came to me in order to borrow
      thirty thousand francs. Naturally, I did not lend them to her; but, as I
      wished to oblige her, I told her to explain her situation to me
      completely, so that I might see whether there was not something I could do
      for her.

“She told me her troubles in such cautious language that she could
      not have spoken more delicately of her child''s first communion. I finally
      managed to understand that times were hard, and that she was penniless.

“The commercial crisis, political unrest, rumors of war, had made
      money scarce even in the hands of her clients. And then, of course, she
      was very particular.

“She would associate only with a man in the best of society, who
      could strengthen her reputation as well as help her financially. A
      reveller, no matter how rich, would have compromised her forever, and
      would have made the marriage of her daughter quite doubtful.

“She had to maintain her household expenses and continue to
      entertain, in order not to lose the opportunity of finding, among her
      numerous visitors, the discreet and distinguished friend for whom she was
      waiting, and whom she would choose.

“I showed her that my thirty thousand francs would have but little
      likelihood of returning to me; for, after spending them all, she would
      have to find at least sixty thousand more, in a lump, to pay me back.

“She seemed very disheartened when she heard this. I did not know
      just what to do, when an idea, a really fine idea, struck me.

“I had just bought this Renaissance Crucifix which I showed you, an
      admirable piece of workmanship, one of the finest of its land that I have
      ever seen.

“''My dear friend,'' I said to her, ''I am going to send you that piece
      of ivory. You will invent some ingenious, touching, poetic story, anything
      that you wish, to explain your desire for parting with it. It is, of
      course, a family heirloom left you by your father.

“''I myself will send you amateurs, or will bring them to you. The
      rest concerns you. Before they come I will drop you a line about their
      position, both social and financial. This Crucifix is worth fifty thousand
      francs; but I will let it go for thirty thousand. The difference will
      belong to you.''

“She considered the matter seriously for several minutes, and then
      answered: ''Yes, it is, perhaps, a good idea. I thank you very-much.''

“For three months I sent her my best clients, from a business point
      of view. But I heard nothing more from her.

“One day I received a visit from a foreigner who spoke very little
      French. I decided to introduce him personally to the baroness, in order to
      see how she was getting along.

“A footman in black livery received us and ushered us into a quiet
      little parlor, furnished with taste, where we waited for several minutes.
      She appeared, charming as usual, extended her hand to me and invited us to
      be seated; and when I had explained the reason of my visit, she rang.

“''See if Mlle. Isabelle can let us go into her oratory.'' The young
      girl herself brought the answer. She was about fifteen years of age,
      modest and good to look upon in the sweet freshness of her youth. She
      wished to conduct us herself to her chapel.

“It was a kind of religious boudoir where a silver lamp was burning
      before the Crucifix, my Crucifix, on a background of black velvet. The
      setting was charming and very clever. The child crossed herself and then
      said:

“I took the object, examined it and declared it to be remarkable.
      The foreigner also examined it, but he seemed much more interested in the
      two women than in the crucifix.

“A delicate odor of incense, flowers and perfume pervaded the whole
      house. One felt at home there. This really was a comfortable home, where
      one would have liked to linger.

“When we had returned to the parlor I delicately broached the
      subject of the price. Mme. Samoris, lowering her eyes, asked fifty
      thousand francs.

“Then she added: ''If you wish to see it again, monsieur, I very
      seldom go out before three o''clock; and I can be found at home every day.''

“In the street the stranger asked me for some details about the
      baroness, whom he had found charming. But I did not hear anything more
      from either of them.

“One morning, hardly two weeks ago, she came here at about lunch
      time, and, placing a roll of bills in my hand, said: ''My dear, you are an
      angel! Here are fifty thousand francs; I am buying your crucifix, and I am
      paying twenty thousand francs more for it than the price agreed upon, on
      condition that you always—always send your clients to me—for
      it is still for sale.''”

A party of men were chatting in the smoking room after dinner. We were
      talking of unexpected legacies, strange inheritances. Then M. le Brument,
      who was sometimes called “the illustrious judge” and at other
      times “the illustrious lawyer,” went and stood with his back
      to the fire.

“I have,” said he, “to search for an heir who
      disappeared under peculiarly distressing circumstances. It is one of those
      simple and terrible dramas of ordinary life, a thing which possibly
      happens every day, and which is nevertheless one of the most dreadful
      things I know. Here are the facts:

“''Monsieur, I want to intrust to you the most delicate, the most
      difficult, and the most wearisome mission that can be conceived. Be good
      enough to notice my will, which is there on the table. A sum of five
      thousand francs is left to you as a fee if you do not succeed, and of a
      hundred thousand francs if you do succeed. I want you to find my son after
      my death.''

“She asked me to assist her to sit up in bed, in order that she
      might talk with greater ease, for her voice, broken and gasping, was
      whistling in her throat.

“It was a very wealthy establishment. The luxurious apartment, of an
      elegant simplicity, was upholstered with materials as thick as walls, with
      a soft inviting surface.

“''You are the first to hear my horrible story. I will try to have
      strength enough to finish it. You must know all, in order that you, whom I
      know to be a kind-hearted man as well as a man of the world, may have a
      sincere desire to aid me with all your power.

“''Before my marriage, I loved a young man, whose suit was rejected
      by my family because he was not rich enough. Not long afterward, I married
      a man of great wealth. I married him through ignorance, through obedience,
      through indifference, as young girls do marry.

“''He whom I had loved had married, in his turn. When he saw that I
      was a widow, he was crushed by grief at knowing he was not free. He came
      to see me; he wept and sobbed so bitterly, that it was enough to break my
      heart. He came to see me at first as a friend. Perhaps I ought not to have
      received him. What could I do? I was alone, so sad, so solitary, so
      hopeless! And I loved him still. What sufferings we women have sometimes
      to endure!

“''I had only him in the world, my parents being dead. He came
      frequently; he spent whole evenings with me. I should not have let him
      come so often, seeing that he was married. But I had not enough will-power
      to prevent him from coming.

“''How can I tell it?—he became my lover. How did this come
      about? Can I explain it? Can any one explain such things? Do you think it
      could be otherwise when two human beings are drawn to each other by the
      irresistible force of mutual affection? Do you believe, monsieur, that it
      is always in our power to resist, that we can keep up the struggle
      forever, and refuse to yield to the prayers, the supplications, the tears,
      the frenzied words, the appeals on bended knees, the transports of
      passion, with which we are pursued by the man we adore, whom we want to
      gratify even in his slightest wishes, whom we desire to crown with every
      possible happiness, and whom, if we are to be guided by a worldly code of
      honor, we must drive to despair? What strength would it not require? What
      a renunciation of happiness? what self-denial? and even what virtuous
      selfishness?

“''In short, monsieur, I was his mistress; and I was happy. I became—and
      this was my greatest weakness and my greatest piece of cowardice-I became
      his wife''s friend.

“''We brought up my son together; we made a man of him, a thorough
      man, intelligent, full of sense and resolution, of large and generous
      ideas. The boy reached the age of seventeen.

“''He, the young man, was fond of my—my lover, almost as fond
      of him as I was myself, for he had been equally cherished and cared for by
      both of us. He used to call him his ''dear friend,'' and respected him
      immensely, having never received from him anything but wise counsels and
      an example of integrity, honor, and probity. He looked upon him as an old
      loyal and devoted comrade of his mother, as a sort of moral father,
      guardian, protector—how am I to describe it?

“''Perhaps the reason why he never asked any questions was that he
      had been accustomed from his earliest years to see this man in my house,
      at my side, and at his side, always concerned about us both.

“''One evening the three of us were to dine together—this was
      my chief amusement—and I waited for the two men, asking myself which
      of them would be the first to arrive. The door opened; it was my old
      friend. I went toward him, with outstretched arms; and he pressed my lips
      in a long, delicious kiss.

“''All of a sudden, a slight sound, a faint rustling, that mysterious
      sensation which indicates the presence of another person, made us start
      and turn round abruptly. Jean, my son, stood there, livid, staring at us.

“''There was a moment of atrocious confusion. I drew back, holding
      out my hand toward my son as if in supplication; but I could not see him.
      He had gone.

“''We remained facing each other—my lover and I—crushed,
      unable to utter a word. I sank into an armchair, and I felt a desire, a
      vague, powerful desire, to flee, to go out into the night, and to
      disappear forever. Then convulsive sobs rose in my throat, and I wept,
      shaken with spasms, my heart breaking, all my nerves writhing with the
      horrible sensation of an irreparable misfortune, and with that dreadful
      sense of shame which, in such moments as this, fills a mother''s heart.

“''He looked at me in a terrified manner, not venturing to approach,
      to speak to me, or to touch me, for fear of the boy''s return. At last he
      said:

“''I am going to follow him-to talk to him—to explain matters
      to him. In short, I must see him and let him know——”

“''I waited—waited in a distracted frame of mind, trembling at
      the least sound, starting with fear and with some unutterably strange and
      intolerable emotion at every slight crackling of the fire in the grate.

“''I waited an hour, two hours, feeling my heart swell with a dread I
      had never before experienced, such anguish that I would not wish the
      greatest criminal to endure ten minutes of such misery. Where was my son?
      What was he doing?

“''About midnight, a messenger brought me a note from my lover. I
      still know its contents by heart:

“''Has your son returned? I did not find him. I am down here. I do
      not want to go up at this hour.”

“''I felt as if I were going mad. I longed to run wildly about, to
      roll on the ground. And yet I did not even stir, but kept waiting hour
      after hour. What was going to happen? I tried to imagine, to guess. But I
      could form no conception, in spite of my efforts, in spite of the tortures
      of my soul!

“''And now I feared that they might meet. What would they do in that
      case? What would my son do? My mind was torn with fearful doubts, with
      terrible suppositions.

“''You can understand my feelings, can you not, monsieur? “''My
      chambermaid, who knew nothing, who understood nothing, came into the room
      every moment, believing, naturally, that I had lost my reason. I sent her
      away with a word or a movement of the hand. She went for the doctor, who
      found me in the throes of a nervous attack.

“''Then, becoming suddenly exasperated and even indignant—for
      women are subject to such outbursts of unaccountable and unreasoning anger—I
      said:

“''I have never seen one or the other of them since, monsieur, and
      thus I have lived for the last twenty years.

“''Can you imagine what all this meant to me? Can you understand this
      monstrous punishment, this slow, perpetual laceration of a mother''s heart,
      this abominable, endless waiting? Endless, did I say? No; it is about to
      end, for I am dying. I am dying without ever again seeing either of them—either
      one or the other!

“''He—the man I loved—has written to me every day for the
      last twenty years; and I—I have never consented to see him, even for
      one second; for I had a strange feeling that, if he were to come back
      here, my son would make his appearance at the same moment. Oh! my son! my
      son! Is he dead? Is he living? Where is he hiding? Over there, perhaps,
      beyond the great ocean, in some country so far away that even its very
      name is unknown to me! Does he ever think of me? Ah! if he only knew! How
      cruel one''s children are! Did he understand to what frightful suffering he
      condemned me, into what depths of despair, into what tortures, he cast me
      while I was still in the prime of life, leaving me to suffer until this
      moment, when I am about to die—me, his mother, who loved him with
      all the intensity of a mother''s love? Oh! isn''t it cruel, cruel?

“''My child, my dear, dear child, be less harsh toward poor women!
      Life is already brutal and savage enough in its dealings with them. My
      dear son, think of what the existence of your poor mother has been ever
      since the day you left her. My dear child, forgive her, and love her, now
      that she is dead, for she has had to endure the most frightful penance
      ever inflicted on a woman.”

“She gasped for breath, trembling, as if she had addressed the last
      words to her son and as if he stood by her bedside.

“And I left the house, monsieurs, crying like a fool, so bitterly,
      indeed, that my coachman turned round to stare at me.

“I have not found the son—that son—well, say what you
      like about him, but I call him that criminal son!”

All were crowding around M. Bermutier, the judge, who was giving his
      opinion about the Saint-Cloud mystery. For a month this in explicable
      crime had been the talk of Paris. Nobody could make head or tail of it.

M. Bermutier, standing with his back to the fireplace, was talking, citing
      the evidence, discussing the various theories, but arriving at no
      conclusion.

Some women had risen, in order to get nearer to him, and were standing
      with their eyes fastened on the clean-shaven face of the judge, who was
      saying such weighty things. They, were shaking and trembling, moved by
      fear and curiosity, and by the eager and insatiable desire for the
      horrible, which haunts the soul of every woman. One of them, paler than
      the others, said during a pause:

“True, madame, it is likely that the actual facts will never be
      discovered. As for the word ''supernatural'' which you have just used, it
      has nothing to do with the matter. We are in the presence of a very
      cleverly conceived and executed crime, so well enshrouded in mystery that
      we cannot disentangle it from the involved circumstances which surround
      it. But once I had to take charge of an affair in which the uncanny seemed
      to play a part. In fact, the case became so confused that it had to be
      given up.”

“Do not think, however, that I, for one minute, ascribed anything in
      the case to supernatural influences. I believe only in normal causes. But
      if, instead of using the word ''supernatural'' to express what we do not
      understand, we were simply to make use of the word ''inexplicable,'' it
      would be much better. At any rate, in the affair of which I am about to
      tell you, it is especially the surrounding, preliminary circumstances
      which impressed me. Here are the facts:

“I was, at that time, a judge at Ajaccio, a little white city on the
      edge of a bay which is surrounded by high mountains.

“The majority of the cases which came up before me concerned
      vendettas. There are some that are superb, dramatic, ferocious, heroic. We
      find there the most beautiful causes for revenge of which one could dream,
      enmities hundreds of years old, quieted for a time but never extinguished;
      abominable stratagems, murders becoming massacres and almost deeds of
      glory. For two years I heard of nothing but the price of blood, of this
      terrible Corsican prejudice which compels revenge for insults meted out to
      the offending person and all his descendants and relatives. I had seen old
      men, children, cousins murdered; my head was full of these stories.

“One day I learned that an Englishman had just hired a little villa
      at the end of the bay for several years. He had brought with him a French
      servant, whom he had engaged on the way at Marseilles.

“Soon this peculiar person, living alone, only going out to hunt and
      fish, aroused a widespread interest. He never spoke to any one, never went
      to the town, and every morning he would practice for an hour or so with
      his revolver and rifle.

“Legends were built up around him. It was said that he was some high
      personage, fleeing from his fatherland for political reasons; then it was
      affirmed that he was in hiding after having committed some abominable
      crime. Some particularly horrible circumstances were even mentioned.

“In my judicial position I thought it necessary to get some
      information about this man, but it was impossible to learn anything. He
      called himself Sir John Rowell.

“I therefore had to be satisfied with watching him as closely as I
      could, but I could see nothing suspicious about his actions.

“However, as rumors about him were growing and becoming more
      widespread, I decided to try to see this stranger myself, and I began to
      hunt regularly in the neighborhood of his grounds.

“For a long time I watched without finding an opportunity. At last
      it came to me in the shape of a partridge which I shot and killed right in
      front of the Englishman. My dog fetched it for me, but, taking the bird, I
      went at once to Sir John Rowell and, begging his pardon, asked him to
      accept it.

“He was a big man, with red hair and beard, very tall, very broad, a
      kind of calm and polite Hercules. He had nothing of the so-called British
      stiffness, and in a broad English accent he thanked me warmly for my
      attention. At the end of a month we had had five or six conversations.

“One night, at last, as I was passing before his door, I saw him in
      the garden, seated astride a chair, smoking his pipe. I bowed and he
      invited me to come in and have a glass of beer. I needed no urging.

“He received me with the most punctilious English courtesy, sang the
      praises of France and of Corsica, and declared that he was quite in love
      with this country.

“Then, with great caution and under the guise of a vivid interest, I
      asked him a few questions about his life and his plans. He answered
      without embarrassment, telling me that he had travelled a great deal in
      Africa, in the Indies, in America. He added, laughing:

“Then I turned the conversation on hunting, and he gave me the most
      curious details on hunting the hippopotamus, the tiger, the elephant and
      even the gorilla.

“Then he began to talk about weapons, and he invited me to come in
      and see different makes of guns.

“His parlor was draped in black, black silk embroidered in gold. Big
      yellow flowers, as brilliant as fire, were worked on the dark material.

“But in the middle of the widest panel a strange thing attracted my
      attention. A black object stood out against a square of red velvet. I went
      up to it; it was a hand, a human hand. Not the clean white hand of a
      skeleton, but a dried black hand, with yellow nails, the muscles exposed
      and traces of old blood on the bones, which were cut off as clean as
      though it had been chopped off with an axe, near the middle of the
      forearm.

“Around the wrist, an enormous iron chain, riveted and soldered to
      this unclean member, fastened it to the wall by a ring, strong enough to
      hold an elephant in leash.

“''That is my best enemy. It comes from America, too. The bones were
      severed by a sword and the skin cut off with a sharp stone and dried in
      the sun for a week.''

“I touched these human remains, which must have belonged to a giant.
      The uncommonly long fingers were attached by enormous tendons which still
      had pieces of skin hanging to them in places. This hand was terrible to
      see; it made one think of some savage vengeance.

“But his face remained inscrutable, calm and friendly. I turned to
      other subjects, and admired his rifles.

“However, I noticed that he kept three loaded revolvers in the room,
      as though constantly in fear of some attack.

“I paid him several calls. Then I did not go any more. People had
      become used to his presence; everybody had lost interest in him.

“A whole year rolled by. One morning, toward the end of November, my
      servant awoke me and announced that Sir John Rowell had been murdered
      during the night.

“Half an hour later I entered the Englishman''s house, together with
      the police commissioner and the captain of the gendarmes. The servant,
      bewildered and in despair, was crying before the door. At first I
      suspected this man, but he was innocent.

“On entering Sir John''s parlor, I noticed the body, stretched out on
      its back, in the middle of the room.

“His vest was torn, the sleeve of his jacket had been pulled off,
      everything pointed to, a violent struggle.

“The Englishman had been strangled! His face was black, swollen and
      frightful, and seemed to express a terrible fear. He held something
      between his teeth, and his neck, pierced by five or six holes which looked
      as though they had been made by some iron instrument, was covered with
      blood.

“A physician joined us. He examined the finger marks on the neck for
      a long time and then made this strange announcement:

“A cold chill seemed to run down my back, and I looked over to where
      I had formerly seen the terrible hand. It was no longer there. The chain
      was hanging down, broken.

“I bent over the dead man and, in his contracted mouth, I found one
      of the fingers of this vanished hand, cut—or rather sawed off by the
      teeth down to the second knuckle.

“Then the investigation began. Nothing could be discovered. No door,
      window or piece of furniture had been forced. The two watch dogs had not
      been aroused from their sleep.

“For a month his master had seemed excited. He had received many
      letters, which he would immediately burn.

“Often, in a fit of passion which approached madness, he had taken a
      switch and struck wildly at this dried hand riveted to the wall, and which
      had disappeared, no one knows how, at the very hour of the crime.

“He would go to bed very late and carefully lock himself in. He
      always kept weapons within reach. Often at night he would talk loudly, as
      though he were quarrelling with some one.

“That night, somehow, he had made no noise, and it was only on going
      to open the windows that the servant had found Sir John murdered. He
      suspected no one.

“I communicated what I knew of the dead man to the judges and public
      officials. Throughout the whole island a minute investigation was carried
      on. Nothing could be found out.

“One night, about three months after the crime, I had a terrible
      nightmare. I seemed to see the horrible hand running over my curtains and
      walls like an immense scorpion or spider. Three times I awoke, three times
      I went to sleep again; three times I saw the hideous object galloping
      round my room and moving its fingers like legs.

“The following day the hand was brought me, found in the cemetery,
      on the grave of Sir John Rowell, who had been buried there because we had
      been unable to find his family. The first finger was missing.

“But that is neither a climax nor an explanation! We will be unable
      to sleep unless you give us your opinion of what had occurred.”

“Oh! Ladies, I shall certainly spoil your terrible dreams. I simply
      believe that the legitimate owner of the hand was not dead, that he came
      to get it with his remaining one. But I don''t know how. It was a kind of
      vendetta.”

The walls of the cell were bare and white washed. A narrow grated window,
      placed so high that one could not reach it, lighted this sinister little
      room. The mad inmate, seated on a straw chair, looked at us with a fixed,
      vacant and haunted expression. He was very thin, with hollow cheeks and
      hair almost white, which one guessed might have turned gray in a few
      months. His clothes appeared to be too large for his shrunken limbs, his
      sunken chest and empty paunch. One felt that this man''s mind was
      destroyed, eaten by his thoughts, by one thought, just as a fruit is eaten
      by a worm. His craze, his idea was there in his brain, insistent,
      harassing, destructive. It wasted his frame little by little. It—the
      invisible, impalpable, intangible, immaterial idea—was mining his
      health, drinking his blood, snuffing out his life.

What a mystery was this man, being killed by an ideal! He aroused sorrow,
      fear and pity, this madman. What strange, tremendous and deadly thoughts
      dwelt within this forehead which they creased with deep wrinkles which
      were never still?

“He has terrible attacks of rage,” said the doctor to me.
      “His is one of the most peculiar cases I have ever seen. He has
      seizures of erotic and macaberesque madness. He is a sort of necrophile.
      He has kept a journal in which he sets forth his disease with the utmost
      clearness. In it you can, as it were, put your finger on it. If it would
      interest you, you may go over this document.”

I followed the doctor into his office, where he handed me this wretched
      man''s diary, saying: “Read it and tell me what you think of it.”
      I read as follows:

“Until the age of thirty-two I lived peacefully, without knowing
      love. Life appeared very simple, very pleasant and very easy. I was rich.
      I enjoyed so many things that I had no passion for anything in particular.
      It was good to be alive! I awoke happy every morning and did those things
      that pleased me during the day and went to bed at night contented, in the
      expectation of a peaceful tomorrow and a future without anxiety.

“I had had a few flirtations without my heart being touched by any
      true passion or wounded by any of the sensations of true love. It is good
      to live like that. It is better to love, but it is terrible. And yet those
      who love in the ordinary way must experience ardent happiness, though less
      than mine possibly, for love came to me in a remarkable manner.

“As I was wealthy, I bought all kinds of old furniture and old
      curiosities, and I often thought of the unknown hands that had touched
      these objects, of the eyes that had admired them, of the hearts that had
      loved them; for one does love things! I sometimes remained hours and hours
      looking at a little watch of the last century. It was so tiny, so pretty
      with its enamel and gold chasing. And it kept time as on the day when a
      woman first bought it, enraptured at owning this dainty trinket. It had
      not ceased to vibrate, to live its mechanical life, and it had kept up its
      regular tick-tock since the last century. Who had first worn it on her
      bosom amid the warmth of her clothing, the heart of the watch beating
      beside the heart of the woman? What hand had held it in its warm fingers,
      had turned it over and then wiped the enamelled shepherds on the case to
      remove the slight moisture from her fingers? What eyes had watched the
      hands on its ornamental face for the expected, the beloved, the sacred
      hour?

“How I wished I had known her, seen her, the woman who had selected
      this exquisite and rare object! She is dead! I am possessed with a longing
      for women of former days. I love, from afar, all those who have loved. The
      story of those dead and gone loves fills my heart with regrets. Oh, the
      beauty, the smiles, the youthful caresses, the hopes! Should not all that
      be eternal?

“How I have wept whole nights-thinking of those poor women of former
      days, so beautiful, so loving, so sweet, whose arms were extended in an
      embrace, and who now are dead! A kiss is immortal! It goes from lips to
      lips, from century to century, from age to age. Men receive them, give
      them and die.

“The past attracts me, the present terrifies me because the future
      means death. I regret all that has gone by. I mourn all who have lived; I
      should like to check time, to stop the clock. But time goes, it goes, it
      passes, it takes from me each second a little of myself for the
      annihilation of to-morrow. And I shall never live again.

“But I am not to be pitied. I found her, the one I was waiting for,
      and through her I enjoyed inestimable pleasure.

“I was sauntering in Paris on a bright, sunny morning, with a happy
