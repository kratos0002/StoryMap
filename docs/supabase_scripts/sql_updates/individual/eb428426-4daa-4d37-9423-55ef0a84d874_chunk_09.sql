UPDATE stories SET original_text = original_text || 'sh doctrine. I did not believe that I had brought myself to the
Lord, for that was too manifestly false; but yet I held, that I might
have resisted finally. And further, I knew nothing about the choice of
God''s people, and did not believe that the child of God, when once made
so; was safe for ever. In my fleshly mind I had repeatedly said, If once
I could prove that I am a child of God for ever, I might go back into
the world for a year or two, and then return to the Lord, and at last be
saved. But now I was brought to examine these precious truths by the
word of God. Being made willing to have no glory of my own in the
conversion of sinners, but to consider myself merely as an instrument;
and being made willing to receive what the Scriptures said; I went to
the Word, reading the New Testament from the beginning, with a
particular reference to these truths. To my great astonishment I found
that the passages which speak decidedly for election and persevering
grace were about four times as many as those which speak apparently
against these truths; and even those few, shortly after, when I had
examined and understood them, served to confirm me in the above
doctrines. As to the effect which my belief in these doctrines had on
me, I am constrained to state, for God''s glory, that though I am still
exceedingly weak, and by no means so dead to the lusts of the flesh, and
the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, as I might and as I ought
to be, yet, by the grace of God, I have walked more closely with Him
since that period. My life has not been so variable, and I may say that
I have lived much more for God than before. And for this have I been
strengthened by the Lord, in a great measure, through the
instrumentality of these truths. For in the time of temptation, I have
been repeatedly led to say: Should I thus sin? I should only bring
misery into my soul for a time, and dishonour God; for, being a son of
God for ever, I should have to be brought back again, though it might be
in the way of severe chastisement. Thus, I say, the electing love of God
in Christ (when I have been able to realize it) has often been, the
means of producing holiness, instead of leading me into sin. It is
only the notional apprehension of such truths, the want of having them
in the heart, whilst they are in the head, which is dangerous.

3. Another truth, into which, in a measure, I was led, respected the
Lord''s coming. My views concerning this point, up to that time, had been
completely vague and unscriptural. I had believed what others told me,
without trying it by the Word. I thought that things were getting better
and better, and that soon the whole world would be converted. But now I
found in the Word that we have not the least Scriptural warrant to look
for the conversion of the world before the return of our Lord. I found
in the Scriptures that that which will usher in the glory of the church,
and uninterrupted joy to the saints, is the return of the Lord Jesus,
and that, till then, things will be more or less in confusion. I found
in the Word, that the return of Jesus, and not death, was the hope of
the apostolic Christians; and that it became me, therefore, to look for
His appearing. And this truth entered so into my heart that, though I
went into Devonshire exceedingly weak, scarcely expecting that I should
return again to London, yet I was immediately, on seeing this truth,
brought off from looking for death, and was made to look for the return
of the Lord. Having seen this truth, the Lord also graciously enabled me
to apply it, in some measure at least, to my own heart, and to put the
solemn question to myself—What may I do for the Lord, before He
returns, as He may soon come?

4. In addition to these truths, it pleased the Lord to lead me to see a
higher standard of devotedness than I had seen before. He led me, in a
measure, to see what is my true glory in this world, even to be
despised, and to be poor and mean with Christ. I saw then, in a measure,
though I have seen it more fully since, that it ill becomes the servant
to seek to be rich, and great, and honoured in that world where his Lord
was poor, and mean, and despised.

IT became a point of solemn consideration with me, whether I could
remain connected with the Society in the usual way. My chief objections
were these: 1. If I were sent out by the Society, it was more than
probable, yea, almost needful, if I were to leave England, that I should
labour on the Continent, as I was unfit to be sent to eastern countries
on account of my health, which would probably have suffered, both on
account of the climate, and of my having to learn other languages. Now,
if I did go to the Continent, it was evident that without ordination I
could not have any extensive field of usefulness, as unordained
ministers are generally prevented from labouring freely there; but I
could not conscientiously submit to be ordained by unconverted men,
professing to have power to set me apart for the ministry, or to
communicate something to me for this work which they do not possess
themselves. Besides this, I had other objections to being connected with
any state church or national religious establishment, which arose from
the increased light which I had obtained through the reception of this
truth, that the word of God is our only standard, and the Holy Spirit
our only teacher. For as I now began to compare what I knew of the
establishment in England and those on the Continent with this only true
standard, the word of God, I found that all establishments, even because
they are establishments, i.e., the world and the church mixed up
together, not only contain in them the principles which necessarily must
lead to departure from the word of God; but also, as long as they remain
establishments, entirely preclude the acting throughout according to the
Holy Scriptures.—Then again, if I were to stay in England, the Society
would not allow me to preach in any place indiscriminately, where the
Lord might open a door for me; and to the ordination of English bishops
I had still greater objections than to the ordination of a Prussian
Consistory.

2. I further had a conscientious objection against being led and
directed by men in my missionary labours. As a servant of Christ, it
appeared to me I ought to be guided by the Spirit, and not by men, as to
time and place; and this I would say, with all deference to others, who
may be much more taught and much more spiritually minded than myself. A
servant of Christ has but one Master.

3. I had love for the Jews, and I had been enabled to give proofs of it;
yet I could not conscientiously say, as the committee would expect from
me, that I would spend the greater part of my time only among them. For
the scriptural plan seemed to me that, in coming to a place, I should
seek out the Jews, and commence my labour particularly among them; but
that, if they rejected the gospel, I should go to the nominal
Christians.—The more I weighed these points, the more it appeared to me
that I should be acting hypocritically, were I to suffer them to remain
in my mind, without making them known to the committee.

1. WE consider every believer bound, in one way or other, to help the
cause of Christ, and we have scriptural warrant for expecting the Lord''s
blessing upon our work of faith and labour of love: and although,
according to Matt. xiii. 24-43, 2 Tim. iii. 1-13, and many other
passages, the world will not be converted before the coming of our Lord
Jesus, still, while He tarries, all scriptural means ought to be
employed for the ingathering of the elect of God.

2. The Lord helping us, we do not mean to seek the patronage of the
world; i.e., we never intend to ask unconverted persons of rank or
wealth to countenance this Institution, because this, we consider, would
be dishonourable to the Lord. In the name of our God we set up our
banners, Psa. xx. 5; He alone shall be our Patron, and if He helps us we
shall prosper, and if He is not on our side, we shall not succeed.

3. We do not mean to ask unbelievers for money (2 Cor. vi. 14—18);
though we do not feel ourselves warranted to refuse their contributions,
if they, of their own accord should offer them. (Acts xxviii. 2-10.) 4.
We reject altogether the help of unbelievers in managing or carrying on
the affairs of the Institution. (2 Cor. vi. 14-18.)

5. We intend never to enlarge the field of labour by contracting debts
(Rom. xiii. 8), and afterwards appealing to the Church of God for help,
because this we consider to be opposed both to the letter and the spirit
of the New Testament; but in secret prayer, God helping us, we shall
carry the wants of the Institution to the Lord, and act according to the
means that God shall give.

6. We do not mean to reckon the success of the Institution by the amount
of money given, or the number of Bibles distributed, etc., but by the
Lord''s blessing upon the work (Zech. iv. 6); and we expect this, in the
proportion in which He shall help us to wait upon Him in prayer.

7. While we would avoid aiming after needless singularity, we desire to
go on simply according to Scripture, without compromising the truth; at
the same time thankfully receiving any instruction which experienced
believers, after prayer, upon scriptural ground, may have to give us
concerning the Institution.

1. To assist day-schools, Sunday-schools, and adult-schools, in which
instruction is given upon scriptural principles, and, as far as the
Lord may give the means, and supply us with suitable teachers, and in
other respects make our path plain, to establish schools of this kind.

a. By day-schools upon scriptural principles, we understand day-schools
in which the teachers are godly persons,—in which the way of salvation
is scripturally pointed out,—and in which no instruction is given
opposed to the principles of the gospel.

b. Sunday-schools, in which all the teachers are believers, and in which
the Holy Scriptures alone are the foundation of instruction, are such
only as the Institution assists with the supply of Bibles, Testaments,
etc.; for we consider it unscriptural that any persons who do not
profess to know the Lord themselves should be allowed to give religious
instruction.

c. The Institution does not assist any adult-schools with the supply of
Bibles, Testaments, spelling-books, etc., except the teachers are
believers.

We sell Bibles and Testaments to poor persons at a reduced price. But
while we, in general, think it better that the Scriptures should be
sold, and not given altogether gratis, still, in cases of extreme
poverty, we think it right to give, without payment, a cheap edition.

We desire to assist those missionaries whose proceedings appear to be
most according to the Scriptures.

It is proposed to give such a portion of the amount of the donations to
each of the fore-mentioned objects as the Lord may direct; but if none
of the objects should claim a more particular assistance, to lay out an
equal portion upon each; yet so that if any donor desires to give for
one of the objects exclusively the money shall be appropriated
accordingly.

I HAD constantly cases brought before me which proved that one of the
especial things which the children of God needed in our day was to have
their faith strengthened. For instance: I might visit a brother who
worked fourteen or even sixteen hours a day at his trade, the necessary
result of which was that not only his body suffered, but his soul was
lean, and he had no enjoyment in the things of God. Under such
circumstances I might point out to him that he ought to work less, in
order that his bodily health might not suffer, and that he might gather
strength for his inner man by reading the word of God, by meditation
over it, and by prayer. The reply, however, I generally found to be
something like this: "But if I work less, I do not earn enough for the
support of my family. Even now, whilst I work so much, I have scarcely
enough. The wages are so low, that I must work hard in order to obtain
what I need." There was no trust in God. No real belief in the truth of
that word: "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness: and
all these things shall be added unto you." I might reply something like
this: "My dear brother, it is not your work which supports your family,
but the Lord; and He who has fed you and your family when you could not
work at all, on account of illness, would surely provide for you and
yours if, for the sake of obtaining food for your inner man, you were to
work only for so many hours a day as would allow you proper time for
retirement. And is it not the case now, that you begin the work of the
day after having had only a few hurried moments for prayer; and when you
leave off your work in the evening, and mean then to read a little of
the word of God, are you not too much worn out in body and mind to enjoy
it, and do you not often fall asleep whilst reading the Scriptures, or
whilst on your knees in prayer?" The brother would allow it was so; he
would allow that my advice was good; but still I read in his
countenance, even if he should not have actually said so, "How should I
get on if I were to carry out your advice?" I longed, therefore, to
have something to point the brother to, as a visible proof that our God
and Father is the same faithful God as ever He was; as willing as ever
to PROVE Himself to be the LIVING GOD, in our day as formerly, to all
who put their trust in Him.—Again, sometimes I found children of God
tried in mind by the prospect of old age, when they might be unable to
work any longer, and therefore were harassed by the fear of having to go
into the poor-house. If in such a case I pointed out to them how their
Heavenly Father has always helped those who put their trust in Him, they
might not, perhaps, always say that times have changed; but yet it was
evident enough that God was not looked upon by them as the LIVING God.
My spirit was ofttimes bowed down by this, and I longed to set something
before the children of God whereby they might see that He does not
forsake, even in our day, those who rely upon Him.—Another class of
persons were brethren in business, who suffered in their souls, and
brought guilt on their consciences, by carrying on their business almost
in the same way as unconverted persons do. The competition in trade, the
bad times, the over-peopled country, were given as reasons why, if the
business were carried on simply according to the word of God it could
not be expected to do well. Such a brother, perhaps, would express the
wish that he might be differently situated; but very rarely did I see
that there was a stand made for God, that there was the holy
determination to trust in the living God, and to depend on Him, in order
that a good conscience might be maintained. To this class likewise I
desired to show, by a visible proof, that God is unchangeably the
same.—Then there was another class of persons, individuals who were in
professions in which they could not continue with a good conscience, or
persons who were in an unscriptural position with reference to spiritual
things; but both classes feared, on account of the consequences, to give
up the profession in which they could not abide with God, or to leave
their position, lest they should be thrown out of employment. My spirit
longed to be instrumental in strengthening their faith by giving them
not only instances from the word of God of His willingness and ability
to help all those who rely upon Him, but to show them by proofs that
He is the same in our day. I well knew that the word of God ought to be
enough, and it was, by grace, enough to me; but still, I considered
that I ought to lend a helping hand to my brethren, if by any means, by
this visible proof to the unchangeable faithfulness of the Lord I might
strengthen their hands in God; for I remembered what a great blessing my
own soul had received through the Lord''s dealings with His servant, A.
H. Francke, who, in dependence upon the living God alone, established an
immense orphan house, which I had seen many times with my own eyes. I,
therefore, judged myself bound to be the servant of the Church of God,
in the particular point on which I had obtained mercy: namely, in being
able to take God by His word and to rely upon it. All these exercises
of my soul, which resulted from the fact that so many believers, with
whom I became acquainted, were harassed and distressed in mind, or
brought guilt on their consciences, on account of not trusting in the
Lord, were used by God to awaken in my heart the desire of setting
before the church at large, and before the world, a proof that He has
not in the least changed; and this seemed to me best done by the
establishing of an orphan house. It needed to be something which could
be seen, even by the natural eye. Now if I, a poor man, simply by prayer
and faith, obtained, without asking any individual, the means for
establishing and carrying on an orphan house, there would be something
which, with the Lord''s blessing, might be instrumental in strengthening
the faith of the children of God, besides being a testimony to the
consciences of the unconverted of the reality of the things of God.
This, then, was the primary reason for establishing the orphan house. I
certainly did from my heart desire to be used by God to benefit the
bodies of poor children bereaved of both parents, and seek, in other
respects, with the help of God, to do them good for this life;—I also
particularly longed to be used by God in getting the dear orphans
trained up in the fear of God;—but still, the first and primary object
of the work was (and still is) that God might be magnified by the fact
that the orphans under my care are provided with all they need only by
prayer and faith, without any one being asked by me or my fellow
labourers, whereby it may be seen that God is FAITHFUL STILL, and HEARS
PRAYER STILL.

The three chief reasons for establishing an orphan house are: 1. That
God may be glorified, should He be pleased to furnish me with the means,
in its being seen that it is not a vain thing to trust in Him; and that
thus the faith of His children may be strengthened. 2. The spiritual
welfare of fatherless and motherless children. 3. Their temporal
welfare.

That to which my mind has been particularly directed is to establish an
orphan house in which destitute fatherless and motherless children may
be provided with food and raiment, and scriptural education. Concerning
this intended orphan house I would say:

1. It is intended to be in connection with the Scriptural Knowledge
Institution for Home and Abroad, in so far as it respects the reports,
accounts, superintendence, and the principles on which it is conducted,
so that, in one sense, it may be considered as a new object of the
Institution, yet with this difference, that only those funds shall be
applied to the orphan house which are expressly given for it. If,
therefore, any believer should prefer to support either those objects
which have been hitherto assisted by the funds of this Institution, or
the intended orphan house, it need only be mentioned, in order that the
money may be applied accordingly.

2. It will only be established if the Lord should provide both the means
for it and suitable persons to conduct it.

As to the means, I would make the following remarks: The reason for
proposing to enlarge the field is not because we have of late
particularly abounded in means; for we have been rather straitened. The
many gracious answers, however, which the Lord had given us concerning
this Institution led brother C——r and me to give ourselves to prayer,
asking Him to supply us with the means to carry on the work, as we
consider it unscriptural to contract debts. During five days, we prayed
several times, both unitedly and separately. After that time, the Lord
began to answer our prayers, so that, within a few days, about 501. was
given to us. I would further say that the very gracious and tender
dealings of God with me, in having supplied, in answer to prayer, for
the last five years, my own temporal wants without any certain income,
so that money, provisions, and clothes have been sent to me at times
when I was greatly straitened, and that not only in small but large
quantities; and not merely from individuals living in the same place
with me, but at a considerable distance; and that not merely from
intimate friends, but from individuals whom I have never seen: all this,
I say, has often led me to think, even as long as four years ago, that
the Lord had not given me this simple reliance on Him merely for myself,
but also for others. Often, when I saw poor neglected children running
about the streets at Teignmouth, I said to myself: "May it not be the
will of God that I should establish schools for these children, asking
Him to give me the means?" However, it remained only a thought in my
mind for two or three years. About two years and six months since I was
particularly stirred up afresh to do something for destitute children,
by seeing so many of them begging in the streets of Bristol, and coming
to our door. It was not, then, left undone on account of want of trust
in the Lord, but through an abundance of other things calling for all
the time and strength of my brother Craik and myself; for the Lord had
both given faith, and had also shown by the following instance, in
addition to very many others, both what He can and what He will do. One
morning, whilst sitting in my room, I thought about the distress of
certain brethren, and said thus to myself: "Oh, that it might please the
Lord to give me the means to help these poor brethren!" About an hour
afterwards I had £60 sent as a present for myself from a brother
whom up to this day I have never seen, and who was then, and is still,
residing several thousand miles from this. Should not such an
experience, together with promises like that one in John xiv. 13, 14,
encourage us to ask with all boldness, for ourselves and others, both
temporal and spiritual blessings? The Lord, for I cannot but think it
was He, again and again brought the thought about these poor children to
my mind, till at last it ended in the establishment of "The Scriptural
Knowledge Institution, for Home and Abroad"; since the establishment of
which, I have had it in a similar way brought to my mind, first about
fourteen months ago, and repeatedly since, but especially during these
last weeks, to establish an orphan house. My frequent prayer of late has
been, that if it be of God, He would let it come to pass; if not, that
He would take from me all thoughts about it. The latter has not been the
case, but I have been led more and more to think that the matter may be
of Him. Now, if so, He can influence His people in any part of the
world (for I do not look to Bristol, nor even to England, but to the
living God, whose is the gold and the silver), to intrust me and brother
C——r, whom the Lord has made willing to help me in this work with the
means. Till we have them, we can do nothing in the way of renting a
house, furnishing it, etc. Yet, when once as much as is needed for this
has been sent us, as also proper persons to engage in the work, we do
not think it needful to wait till we have the orphan house endowed, or a
number of yearly subscribers for it; but we trust to be enabled by the
Lord, who has taught us to ask for our daily bread, to look to Him for
the supply of the daily wants of those children whom He may be pleased
to put under our care. Any donations will be received at my house.
Should any believers have tables, chairs, bedsteads, bedding,
earthenware, or any kind of household furniture to spare, for the
furnishing of the house; or remnants, or pieces of calico, linen,
flannel, cloth, or any materials useful for wearing apparel; or clothes
already worn, they will be thankfully received.

Respecting the persons who are needed for carrying on the work, a matter
of no less importance than the procuring of funds, I would observe that
we look for them to God Himself, as well as for the funds; and that all
who may be engaged as masters, matrons, and assistants, according to the
smallness or largeness of the Institution, must be known to us as true
believers; and moreover, as far as we may be able to judge, must
likewise be qualified for the work.

3. At present nothing can be said as to the time when the operations are
likely to commence; nor whether the Institution will embrace children of
both sexes, or be restricted either to boys or girls exclusively; nor of
what age they will be received, and how long they may continue in it;
for though we have thought about these things, yet we would rather be
guided in these particulars by the amount of the means which the Lord
may put into our hands, and by the number of the individuals whom He may
provide for conducting the Institution. Should the Lord condescend to
use us as instruments, a short printed statement will be issued as soon
as something more definite can be said.

4. It has appeared well to us to receive only such destitute children as
have been bereaved of both parents.

5. The children are intended, if girls, to be brought up for service; if
boys, for a trade; and therefore they will be employed, according to
their ability and bodily strength, in useful occupations, and thus help
to maintain themselves; besides this, they are intended to receive a
plain education; but the chief and the special end of the Institution
will be to seek, with God''s blessing, to bring them to the knowledge of
Jesus Christ by instructing them in the Scriptures.

When, of late, the thoughts of establishing an orphan house, in
dependence upon the Lord, revived in my mind, during the first two weeks
I only prayed that if it were of the Lord He would bring it about; but
if not, that He graciously would be pleased to take all thoughts about
it out of my mind. My uncertainty about knowing the Lord''s mind did not
arise from questioning whether it would be pleasing in His sight that
there should be an abode and scriptural education provided for destitute
fatherless and motherless children; but whether it were His will that
I should be the instrument of setting such an object on foot, as my
hands were already more than filled. My comfort, however, was, that, if
it were His will, He would provide not merely the means, but also
suitable individuals to take care of the children, so that my part of
the work would take only such a portion of my time as, considering the
importance of the matter, I might give, notwithstanding my many other
engagements. The whole of those two weeks I never asked the Lord for
money or for persons to engage in the work. On December 5th, however,
the subject of my prayer all at once became different. I was reading
Psalm lxxxi., and was particularly struck, more than at any time before,
with verse 10: "Open thy mouth wide and I will fill it." I thought a
few moments about these words, and then was led to apply them to the
case of the orphan house. It struck me that I had never asked the Lord
for anything concerning it, except to know His will respecting its being
established or not; and I then fell on my knees, and opened my mouth
wide, asking him for much. I asked in submission to His will, and
without fixing a time when He should answer my petition. I prayed that
He would give me a house, i.e., either as a loan, or that some one might
be led to pay the rent for one, or that one might be given permanently
for this object; further, I asked Him for £1000; and likewise for
suitable individuals to take care of the children. Besides this, I have
been since led to ask the Lord to put into the hearts of His people to
send me articles of furniture for the house, and some clothes for the
children. When I was asking the petition I was fully aware what I was
doing, i.e., that I was asking for something which I had no natural
prospect of obtaining from the brethren whom I know, but which was not
too much for the Lord to grant.

1. That I set about the work for the glory of God, i.e., that there
might be a visible proof, by God supplying, in answer to prayer only,
the necessities of the orphans, that He is the living God, and most
willing, even in our day, to answer prayer: and that, therefore, He
would be pleased to send supplies.

2. That God is the "Father of the fatherless," and that He, therefore,
as their Father, would be pleased to provide. (Psalm lxviii. 5.)

3. That I have received the children in the name of Jesus, and that,
therefore, He, in these children, has been received, and is fed, and is
clothed; and that, therefore, He would be pleased to consider this.
(Mark ix. 36, 37.)

4. That the faith of many of the children of God has been strengthened
by this work hitherto, and that, if God were to withhold the means for
the future, those who are weak in faith would be staggered; whilst, by a
continuance of means, their faith might still further be strengthened.

5. That many enemies would laugh, were the Lord to withhold supplies,
and say, did we not foretell that this enthusiasm would come to nothing?

6. That many of the children of God, who are uninstructed, or in a
carnal state, would feel themselves justified to continue their alliance
with the world in the work of God, and to go on as heretofore, in their
unscriptural proceedings respecting similar institutions, so far as the
obtaining of means is concerned, if He were not to help me.

7. That the Lord would remember that I am His child, and that He would
graciously pity me, and remember that I cannot provide for these
children, and that therefore He would not allow this burden to lie upon
me long without sending help.

8. That He would remember likewise my fellow labourers in the work, who
trust in Him, but who would be tried were He to withhold supplies.

9. That He would remember that I should have to dismiss the children
from under our scriptural instruction to their former companions.

10. That He would show that those were mistaken who said that, at the
first, supplies might be expected, while the thing was new, but not
afterwards.

11. That I should not know were He to withhold means, what construction
I should put upon all the many most remarkable answers to prayer which
He has given me heretofore in connection with this work, and which most
fully have shown to me that it is of God.

MR. BENJAMIN PERRY gives an account of the circumstances under which the
land was purchased, prior to the erection of the orphan houses on Ashley
Down, as he heard it from Mr. Müller''s own mouth, showing how directly
the Lord worked on the mind of the owner. Mr. Müller had been making
inquiries respecting the purchase of land much nearer Bristol, the
prices asked being not less than £1000 per acre, when he heard
that the land upon which the Orphan Houses Nos. 1 and 2 stand was for
sale, the price being £200 per acre. He therefore called at the
house of the owner, and was informed that he was not at home, but that
he could be seen at his place of business in the city. Mr. Müller went
there, and was informed that he had left a few minutes before, and that
he would find him at home. Most men would have gone off to the owner''s
house at once; but Mr. Müller stopped and reflected, "Peradventure the
Lord, having allowed me to miss the owner twice in so short a time, has
a purpose that I should not see him to-day; and lest I should be going
before the Lord in the matter, I will wait till the morning." And
accordingly he waited and went the next morning, when he found the owner
at home; and on being ushered into his sitting-room, he said: "Ah, Mr.
Müller, I know what you have come to see me about. You want to buy my
land on Ashley Down. I had a dream last night, and I saw you come in to
purchase the land, for which I have been asking £200 per acre; but
the Lord told me not to charge you more than £120 per acre, and
therefore if you are willing to buy at that price the matter is
settled." And within ten minutes the contract was signed. "Thus," Mr.
Müller pointed out, "by being careful to follow the Lord, instead of
going before His leading, I was permitted to purchase the land
for £80 per acre less than I should have paid if I had gone to the
owner the evening before."

MR. PERRY writes: At one meeting at Huntly, by special request Mr.
Müller gave illustrations of God''s faithfulness in answer to prayer,
connected with the orphan work, of which the following are examples:

a. He stated that at various times, not only at the beginning of the
work, but also in later years, God had seen fit to try his faith to the
utmost, but only to prove to him the more definitely that He would never
be other than his faithful covenant-keeping God. In illustration he
referred to a time when, the children having had their last meal for the
day, there was nothing left in money or kind for their breakfast the
following morning. Mr. Müller went home, but nothing came in, and he
retired for the night, committing the need to God to provide. Early the
next morning he went for a walk, and while praying for the needed help
he took a turn into a road which he was quite unconscious of, and after
walking a short distance a friend met him, and said how glad he was to
meet him, and asked him to accept £5 for the orphans. He thanked
him, and without saying a word to the donor about the time of need, he
went at once to the orphan houses, praising God for this direct answer
to prayer.

b. On another occasion, when there were no funds in hand to provide
breakfast for the orphans, a gentleman called before the time for
breakfast and left a donation that supplied all their present needs.
When that year''s report was issued, this proof of God''s faithfulness in
sending help just when needed was recorded, and a short time after the
donor called and made himself known, saying that as his donation had
been given at such a special time of need he felt he must state the
circumstances under which he had given the money, which were as follows:
He had occasion to go to his office in Bristol early that morning before
breakfast, and on the way the thought occurred to him: "I will go to Mr.
Müller''s orphan house and give them a donation," and accordingly turned
and walked about a quarter of a mile toward the orphanage, when he
stopped, saying to himself, "How foolish of me to be neglecting the
business I came out to attend to! I can give money to the orphans
another time," and he turned round and walked back towards his office,
but soon felt that he must return. He said to himself: "The orphans
may be needing the money now. I may be leaving them in want when God
had sent me to help them;" and so strong was this impression that he
again turned round and walked back till he reached the orphanages, and
thus handed in the money which provided them with breakfast. Mr. Mullets
comment on this was: "Just like my gracious heavenly Father!" and then
he urged his hearers to trust and prove what a faithful covenant-keeping
God He is to those who put their trust in Him.

MR. PERRY furnishes also the following reminiscences: As George Müller
was engaged in free, homely conversation with his friends on a Sunday
afternoon within about three weeks of his departure to be with the Lord,
he referred to two visits he had made during the previous week to two
old and beloved friends. He had fully appreciated that, though they were
about ten years younger than himself, his power to walk, and specially
his power to continue his service for his Lord, was far greater than
theirs. So that he playfully said, with a bright smile: "I came away
from both these beloved brethren feeling that I was quite young by
comparison as to strength, though so much older," and then at once
followed an ascription of praise to God for His goodness to him: "Oh,
how very kind and good my heavenly Father has been to me! I have no
aches or pains, no rheumatism, and now in my ninety-third year I can do
a day''s work at the orphan houses with as much ease and comfort to
myself as ever."

One sentence aptly sets forth a striking feature in his Christian
character, viz.: George Müller, nothing. In himself worse than nothing.

And as such he lived; for all those who knew and loved this beloved and
honoured servant of Christ best would testify that his habitual attitude
towards the Lord was to treat Him as an ever-present, almighty, loving
Friend, whose love was far greater to him than he could ever return, and
who delighted in having his entire confidence about everything, and was
not only ready at hand to listen to his prayers and praises about great
and important matters, but nothing was too small to speak to Him about.
So real was this that it was almost impossible to be enjoying the
privilege of private, confidential intercourse with him without being
conscious that at least to him the Lord was really present, One to whom
he turned for counsel, in prayer, or in praise, as freely as most men
would speak to a third person present; and again and again most marked
answers to prayer have been received in response to petitions thus
unitedly presented to the Lord altogether apart from his own special
work.

WHEN brother Craik and I began to labour in Bristol, and consequently
some believers united with us in fellowship, assembling together at
Bethesda, we began meeting together on the basis of the written Word
only, without having any church rules whatever. From the commencement it
was understood that, as the Lord should help us, we would try everything
by the word of God, and introduce and hold fast that only which could be
proved by Scripture. When we came to this determination on Aug. 13,
1832, it was indeed in weakness, but it was in uprightness of heart.—On
account of this it was that, as we ourselves were not fully settled as
to whether those only who had been baptized after they had believed, or
whether all who believed in the Lord Jesus, irrespective of baptism,
should be received into fellowship, nothing was determined about this
point. We felt free to break bread and be in communion with those who
were not baptized, and therefore could with a good conscience labour at
Gideon, where the greater part of the saints, at least at first, were
unbaptized; but, at the same time, we had a secret wish that none but
believers who were baptized might be united with us at Bethesda. Our
reason for this was that we had witnessed in Devonshire much painful
disunion, resulting as we thought, from baptized and unbaptized
believers being in fellowship. Without, then, making it a rule, that
Bethesda Church was to be one of close communion, we nevertheless took
care that those who applied for fellowship should be instructed about
baptism. For many months there occurred no difficulty as none applied
for communion but such as had either been already baptized, or wished to
be, or who became convinced of the scriptural character of believers''
baptism, after we had conversed with them; afterwards, however, three
sisters applied for fellowship, none of whom had been baptized; nor were
their views altered after we had conversed with them. As, nevertheless,
brother Craik and I considered them true believers, and we ourselves
were not fully convinced what was the mind of the Lord in such a case,
we thought it right that these sisters should be received; yet so that
it might be unanimously, as all our church acts then were done; but we
knew by that time that there were several in fellowship with us who
could not conscientiously receive unbaptized believers. We mentioned,
therefore, the names of the three sisters to the church, stating that
they did not see believers'' baptism to be scriptural, and that, if any
brother saw, on that account, a reason why they should not be received,
he should let us know. The result was that several objected, and two or
three meetings were held, at which we heard the objections of the
brethren, and sought for ourselves to obtain acquaintance with the mind
of God on the point. Whilst several days thus passed away before the
matter was decided, one of those three sisters came and thanked us that
we had not received her, before being baptized, for she now saw that it
was only shame and the fear of man which had kept her back, and that the
Lord had now made her willing to be baptized. By this circumstance those
brethren who considered it scriptural that all ought to be baptized
before being received into fellowship, were confirmed in their views;
and as to brother Craik and me, it made us, at least, still more
question whether those brethren might not be right; and we felt,
therefore, that in such a state of mind we could not oppose them. The
one sister, therefore, who wished to be baptized was received into
fellowship, but the two others not. Our consciences were the less
affected by this because all, though not baptized, might take the Lord''s
supper with us at Bethesda, though not be received into full fellowship;
and because at Gideon, where there were baptized and unbaptized
believers, they might even be received into full fellowship; for we had
not then clearly seen that there is no scriptural distinction between
being in fellowship with individuals and breaking bread with them. Thus
matters stood for many months, i.e., believers were received to the
breaking of bread even at Bethesda, though not baptized, but they were
not received to all the privileges of fellowship.—In August of 1836 I
had a conversation with brother K. C. on, the subject of receiving the
unbaptized into communion, a subject about which, for years, my mind had
been more or less exercised. This brother put the matter thus before me:
either unbaptized believers come under the class of persons who walk
disorderly, and, in that case, we ought to withdraw from them (2 Thess.
iii. 6); or they do not walk disorderly. If a believer be walking
disorderly, we are not merely to withdraw from him at the Lord''s table,
but our behaviour towards him ought to be decidedly different from what
it would be were he not walking disorderly, on all occasions when we
may have intercourse with him, or come in any way into contact with him.
Now this is evidently not the case in the conduct of baptized believers
towards their unbaptized fellow believers. The Spirit does not suffer it
to be so, but He witnesses that their not having been baptized does not
necessarily imply that they are walking disorderly; and hence there may
be the most precious communion between baptized and unbaptized
believers. The Spirit does not suffer us to refuse fellowship with them
in prayer, in reading or searching the Scriptures, in social and
intimate intercourse, and in the Lord''s work; and yet this ought to be
the case, were they walking disorderly.—This passage, 2 Thess. iii. 6,
to which brother E. C. referred, was the means of showing me the mind of
the Lord on the subject, which is, that we ought to receive all whom
Christ has received (Rom. xv. 7), irrespective of the measure of grace
or knowledge which they have attained unto.—Some time after this
conversation, in May, 1837, an opportunity occurred, when we (for
brother Craik had seen the same truth) were called upon to put into
practice the light which the Lord had been pleased to give us. A sister,
who neither had been baptized, nor considered herself under any
obligation to be baptized, applied for fellowship. We conversed with her
on this as on other subjects and proposed her for fellowship, though our
conversation had not convinced her that she ought to be baptized. This
led the church again to the consideration of the point. We gave our
reasons, from Scripture, for considering it right to receive this
unbaptized sister to all the privileges of the children of God; but a
considerable number, one-third perhaps, expressed conscientious
difficulty in receiving her. The example of the Apostles, in baptizing
the first believers upon a profession of faith, was especially urged,
which indeed would be an unsurmountable difficulty had not the truth
been mingled with error for so long a time, so that it does not prove
wilful disobedience if any one in our day should refuse to be baptized
after believing. The Lord, however, gave us much help in pointing out
the truth to the brethren, so that the number of those who considered
that only baptized believers should be in communion decreased almost
daily. At last, only fourteen brethren and sisters out of above 180
thought it right, this August 28, 1837, to separate from us, after we
had had much intercourse with them. [I am glad to be able to add that,
even of these fourteen, the greater part afterwards saw their error, and
came back again to us, and that the receiving of all who love our Lord
Jesus into full communion, irrespective of baptism, has never been the
source of disunion among us, though more than fifty-seven years have
passed away since.]

(1) How does it appear to be the mind of God that, in every church,
there should be recognized Elders?

From these passages we learn that some are set by the Lord Himself in
the office of rulers and teachers, and that this office (in spite of the
fallen state of the church) should be in being, even down to the close
of the present dispensation. Accordingly, we find from Acts xiv. 23, xx.
17; Tit. i. 5; and 1 Pet. v. 1, that soon after the saints had been
converted, and had associated together in a church character, Elders
were appointed to take the rule over them and to fulfil the office of
under-shepherds.

This must not be understood as implying that, when believers are
associated in church fellowship, they ought to elect Elders according to
their own will, whether the Lord may have qualified persons or not; but
rather that such should wait upon God, that He Himself would be pleased
to raise up such as may be qualified for teaching and ruling in His
church.

(3) How may this appointment be made known to the individuals called to
the office, and to those amongst whom they may be called to labour?

Ans. By the secret call of the Spirit, 1 Tim. iii. 1, confirmed by the
possession of the requisite qualifications, 1 Tim. iii. 2-7; Tit. i.
6-9, and by the Lord''s blessing resting upon their labours, 1 Cor. ix.
2.

In 1 Cor. ix. 2, Paul condescends to the weakness of some, who were in
danger of being led away by those factious persons who questioned his
authority. As an Apostle—appointed by the express word of the Lord—he
needed not such outward confirmation. But if he used his success as an
argument in confirmation of his call, how much more may ordinary
servants of the Lord Jesus employ such an argument, seeing that the way
in which they are called for the work is such as to require some outward
confirmation!

II.—Ought matters of discipline to be finally settled by the Elders
in private, or in the presence of the church, and as the act of the
whole body?

Ans. (1) Such matters are to be finally settled in the presence of the
church. This appears from Matt. xviii. 17; 1 Cor. v. 4, 5; 2 Cor. ii.
6-8; 1 Tim. v. 20.

(2) Such matters are to be finally settled as the act of the whole
body, Matt. xviii. 17, 18. In this passage the act of exclusion is
spoken of as the act of the whole body. 1 Cor. v. 4, 5, v. 12, 13. In
this passage Paul gives the direction, respecting the exercise of
discipline, in such a way to render the whole body responsible: verse 7,
"Purge out the old leaven that ye may be a new lump"; and verse 13,
"Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person." From 2
Cor. ii. 6-8 we learn that the act of exclusion was not the act of the
Elders only, but of the church: "Sufficient to such a man is this
punishment [rather, public censure] which was inflicted of many." From
verse 8 we learn that the act of restoration was to be a public act of
the brethren: "Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm [rather,
ratify by a public act] your love towards him."

As to the reception of brethren into fellowship, this is an act of
simple obedience to the Lord, both on the part of the elders and the
whole church. We are bound and privileged to receive all those who make
a credible profession of faith in Christ, according to that Scripture,
"Receive ye one another, as Christ also received us, to the glory of
God." (Rom. xv. 7.)

III.—When should church acts (such as acts of reception, restoration,
exclusion, etc.) be attended to?

Ans. It cannot be expressly proved from Scripture whether such acts
were attended to at the meeting for the breaking of bread, or at any
other meeting; therefore this is a point on which, if different churches
differ, mutual forbearance ought to be exercised. The way in which such
matters have hitherto been managed amongst us has been by the church
coming together on a week-evening. Before we came to Bristol we had been
accustomed to this mode, and, finding nothing in Scripture against it,
we continued the practice. But, after prayer and more careful
consideration of this point, it has appeared well to us that such acts
should be attended to on the Lord''s days, when the saints meet together
for the breaking of bread. We have been induced to make this alteration
by the following reasons:

(1) This latter mode prevents matters from being delayed. There not
being a sufficiency of matter for a meeting on purpose every week, it
has sometimes happened that what would better have been stated to the
church at once has been kept back from the body for some weeks. Now, it
is important that what concerns the whole church should be made known as
soon as possible to those who are in fellowship, that they may act
accordingly. Delay, moreover, seems inconsistent with the
pilgrim-character of the people of God.

(2) More believers can be present on the Lord''s days than can attend on
week-evenings. The importance of this reason will appear from
considering how everything which concerns the church should be known to
as many as possible. For how can the saints pray for those who may
have to be excluded,—how can they sympathize in cases of peculiar
trial,—and how can they rejoice and give thanks on account of those who
may be received or restored, unless they are made acquainted with the
facts connected with such cases?

(3) A testimony is thus given that all who break bread are church
members. By attending to church acts in the meeting for breaking of
bread, we show that we make no difference between receiving into
fellowship at the Lord''s Supper, and into church membership, but that
the individual who is admitted to the Lord''s table is therewith also
received to all the privileges, trials, and responsibilities of church
membership.

(4) There is a peculiar propriety in acts of reception, restoration, and
exclusion being attended to when the saints meet together for the
breaking of bread, as, in that ordinance especially, we show forth our
fellowship with each other.

Reply. Such an objection would apply to any case in which increased
light led to any improvement, and is, therefore, not to be regarded. It
would be an evil thing if there were any change respecting the
foundation truths of the Gospel; but the point in question is only a
matter of church order.

(2) More time may thus be required than it would be well to give to such
a purpose on the Lord''s day.

Reply. As, according to this plan, church business will be attended to
every Lord''s day, it is more than probable that the meetings will be
thereby prolonged for a few minutes only; but, should circumstance
require it, a special meeting may still be appointed during the week,
for all who break bread with us. This, however, would only be needful,
provided the matters to be brought before the brethren were to require
more time than could be given to them at the breaking of bread.*

* The practice, later on, gave place to a week-night meeting, on
Tuesday, for transaction of such "church acts."—A. T. P.

N.B. (1) Should any persons be present who do not break bread with us,
they may be requested to withdraw whenever such points require to be
stated as it would not be well to speak of in the presence of
unbelievers.

(2) As there are two places in which the saints meet for the breaking of
bread, the matters connected with church acts must be brought out at
each place.

Ans. Although we have no express command respecting the frequency of
its observance, yet the example of the apostles and of the first
disciples would lead us to observe this ordinance every Lord''s day.
(Acts xx. 7.)

(2) What ought to be the character of the meeting at which the saints
are assembled for the breaking of bread?

Ans. As in this ordinance we show forth our common participation in
all the benefits of our Lord''s death, and our union to Him and to each
other (1 Cor. x. 16, 17), opportunity ought to be given for the exercise
of the gifts of teaching or exhortation, and communion in prayer and
praise. (Rom. xii. 4-8; Eph. iv. 11-16.) The manifestation of our common
participation in each other''s gifts cannot be fully given at such
meetings, if the whole meeting is, necessarily, conducted by one
individual. This mode of meeting does not, however, take off from those
who have the gifts of teaching or exhortation the responsibility of
edifying the church as opportunity may be offered.

(3) Is it desirable that the bread should be broken at the Lord''s
Supper by one of the elders, or should each individual of the body break
it for himself?

Ans. Neither way can be so decidedly proved from Scripture that we are
warranted in objecting to the other as positively unscriptural, yet—

(1) The letter of Scripture seems rather in favour of its being done by
each brother and sister (1 Cor. x. 16, 17): "The bread which we
break."

(2) Its being done by each of the disciples is more fitted to express
that we all, by our sins, have broken the body of our Lord.

(3) By attending to the ordinance in this way, we manifest our freedom
from the common error that the Lord''s Supper must be administered by
some particular individual, possessed of what is called a ministerial
character, instead of being an act of social worship and obedience.

FEW who have not carefully read the Narrative of Mr. Müller and the
subsequent Reports issued year by year, have any idea of the large
amount of wisdom which there finds expression. We give here a few
examples of the sagacious and spiritual counsels and utterances with
which these pages abound.

I find it a difficult thing, whilst caring for the body, not to neglect
the soul. It seems to me much easier to go on altogether regardless of
the body, in the service of the Lord, than to take care of the body, in
the time of sickness, and not to neglect the soul, especially in an
affliction like my present one, when the head allows but little reading
or thinking.—What a blessed prospect to be delivered from this wretched
evil nature!

My own experience has been, almost invariably, that if I have not the
needful sleep, my spiritual enjoyment and strength is greatly affected
by it. I judge it of great moment that the believer, in travelling,
should seek as much as possible to refrain from travelling by night, or
from travelling in such a way as that he is deprived of the needful
night''s rest; for if he does not, he will be unable with renewed bodily
and mental strength to give himself to prayer and meditation, and the
reading of the Holy Scriptures, and he will surely feel the pernicious
effects of this all the day long. There may occur cases when travelling
by night cannot be avoided; but, if it can, though we should seem to
lose time by it, and though it should cost more money, I would most
affectionately and solemnly recommend the refraining from
night-travelling; for, in addition to our drawing beyond measure upon
our bodily strength, we must be losers spiritually. The next thing I
would advise with reference to travelling is, with all one''s might to
seek morning by morning, before setting out, to take time for meditation
and prayer, and reading the word of God; for although we are always
exposed to temptation, yet we are so especially in travelling.
Travelling is one of the devil''s especial opportunities for tempting us.
Think of that, dear fellow believers. Seek always to ascertain carefully
the mind of God, before you begin anything; but do so in particular
before you go on a journey, so that you may be quite sure that it is the
will of God that you should undertake that journey, lest you should
needlessly expose yourself to one of the special opportunities of the
devil to ensnare you. So far from envying those who have a carriage and
horses at their command, or an abundance of means, so that they are not
hindered from travelling for want of means, let us who are not thus
situated rather thank God that in this particular we are not exposed
to the temptation of needing to be less careful in ascertaining the will
of God before we set out on a journey.

As far as my experience goes, it appears to me that believers generally
have expected far too little of present fruit upon their labours among
children. There has been a hoping that the Lord some day or other would
own the instruction which they give to children, and would answer at
some time or other, though after many years only, the prayers which they
offer up on their behalf. Now, while such passages as Proverbs xxii. 6,
Ecclesiastes xi. 1, Galatians vi. 9, 1 Cor. xv. 58, give unto us
assurance not merely respecting everything which we do for the Lord, in
general, but also respecting bringing up children in the fear of the
Lord, in particular, that our labour is not in vain in the Lord; yet we
have to guard against abusing such passages, by thinking it a matter of
little moment whether we see present fruit or not; but, on the
contrary, we should give the Lord no rest till we see present fruit, and
therefore, in persevering, yet submissive, prayer, we should make known
our requests unto God. I add, as an encouragement to believers who
labour among children, that during the last two years seventeen other
young persons or children, from the age of eleven and a half to
seventeen, have been received into fellowship among us, and that I am
looking out now for many more to be converted, and that not merely of
the orphans, but of the Sunday-school and day-school children.

The power for good or evil that resides in a little child is great
beyond all human calculation. A child rightly trained may be a
world-wide blessing, with an influence reaching onward to eternal years.
But a neglected or misdirected directed child may live to blight and
blast mankind, and leave influences of evil which shall roll on in
increasing volume till they plunge into the gulf of eternal perdition.

"A remarkable instance was related by Dr. Harris, of New York, at a
recent meeting of the State Charities Aid Association. In a small
village in a county on the upper Hudson, some seventy years ago, a young
girl named ''Margaret'' was sent adrift on the casual charity of the
inhabitants. She became the mother of a long race of criminals and
paupers, and her progeny has cursed the county ever since. The county
records show two hundred of her descendants who have been criminals.
In one single generation of her unhappy line there were twenty children;
of these, three died in infancy, and seventeen survived to maturity. Of
the seventeen, nine served in the State prison for high crimes an
aggregate term of fifty years, while the others were frequent inmates of
jails and penitentiaries and almshouses. Of the nine hundred
descendants, through six generations, from this unhappy girl who was
left on the village streets and abandoned in her childhood, a great
number have been idiots, imbeciles, drunkards, lunatics, paupers, and
prostitutes: but two hundred of the more vigorous are on record as
criminals. This neglected little child has thus cost the county
authorities, in the effects she has transmitted, hundreds of thousands
of dollars, in the expense and care of criminals and paupers, besides
the untold damage she has inflicted on property and public morals."

Seek to cherish in your children early the habit of being interested
about the work of God, and about cases of need and distress, and use
them too at suitable times, and under suitable circumstances, as
your almoners, and you will reap fruit from doing so.

The Christian, like the bee, might suck honey out of every flower. I saw
upon a snuffer-stand in bas-relief, "A heart, a cross under it, and
roses under both." The meaning was obviously this, that the heart which
bears the cross for a time meets with roses afterwards.

It has been often mentioned to me, in various places, that brethren in
business do not sufficiently attend to the keeping of promises, and I
cannot therefore but entreat all who love our Lord Jesus, and who are
engaged in a trade or business, to seek for His sake not to make any
promises, except they have every reason to believe they shall be able to
fulfil them, and therefore carefully to weigh all the circumstances,
before making any engagement, lest they should fail in its
accomplishment. It is even in these little ordinary affairs of life that
we may either bring much honour or dishonour to the Lord; and these are
the things which every unbeliever can take notice of. Why should it be
so often said, and sometimes with a measure of ground, or even much
ground: "Believers are bad servants, bad tradesmen, bad masters"? Surely
it ought not to be true that we, who have power with God to obtain by
prayer and faith all needful grace, wisdom, and skill, should be bad
servants, bad tradesmen, bad masters.

It is altogether wrong that I, a child of God, should have anything to
do with so worldly a system as that of the lottery. But it was also
unscriptural to go to the lot at all for the sake of ascertaining the
Lord''s mind, and this I ground on the following reasons. We have neither
a commandment of God for it, nor the example of our Lord, nor that of
the apostles, after the Holy Spirit had been given on the day of
Pentecost. 1. We have many exhortations in the word of God to seek to
know His mind by prayer and searching the Holy Scriptures, but no
passage which exhorts us to use the lot. 2. The example of the apostles
(Acts i.) in using the lot, in the choice of an apostle in the room of
Judas Iscariot, is the only passage which can be brought in favour of
the lot from the New Testament (and to the Old we have not to go, under
this dispensation, for the sake of ascertaining how we ought to live as
disciples of Christ). Now concerning this circumstance we have to
remember that the Spirit was not yet given (John vii. 39; xiv. 16, 17;
xvi. 7, 13), by whose teaching especially it is that we may know the
mind of the Lord; and hence we find that, after the day of Pentecost,
the lot was no more used, but the apostles gave themselves to prayer and
fasting to ascertain how they ought to act.

What a difference grace makes! There were few people, perhaps, more
passionately fond of travelling, and seeing fresh places, and new
scenes, than myself; but now, since, by the grace of God, I have seen
beauty in the Lord Jesus, I have lost my taste for these things.... What
a different thing, also, to travel in the service of the Lord Jesus,
from what it is to travel in the service of the flesh!

Every instance of obedience, from right motives, strengthens us
spiritually, whilst every act of disobedience weakens us spiritually.

May the Lord grant that the eyes of many of His children may be opened,
so that they may seek, in all spiritual things, to be separated from
unbelievers (2 Cor. vi. 14-18), and to do God''s work according to
God''s mind!

My business is, with all my might to serve my own generation; in doing
so I shall best serve the next generation, should the Lord Jesus
tarry.... The longer I live, the more I am enabled to realize that I
have but one life to live on earth, and that this one life is but a
brief life, for sowing, in comparison with eternity, for reaping.

How precious it is, even for this life, to act according to the word of
God! This perfect revelation of His mind gives us directions for
everything, even the most minute affairs of this life. It commands us,
"Be thou not one of them that strike hands, or of them that are sureties
for debts." (Prov. xxii. 26.) The way in which Satan ensnares persons,
to bring them into the net, and to bring trouble upon them by becoming
sureties, is, that he seeks to represent the matter as if there were no
danger connected with that particular case, and that one might be sure
one should never be called upon to pay the money; but the Lord, the
faithful Friend, tells us in His own word that the only way in such a
matter "to be sure" is "to hate suretyship." (Prov. xi. 15.) The
following points seem to me of solemn moment for consideration, if I
were called upon to become surety for another: 1. What obliges the
person, who wishes me to become surety for him, to need a surety? Is it
really a good cause in which I am called upon to become surety? I do not
remember ever to have met with a case in which in a plain, and godly,
and in all respects scriptural matter such a thing occurred. There was
generally some sin or other connected with it. 2. If I become surety,
notwithstanding what the Lord has said to me in His word, am I in such a
position that no one will be injured by my being called upon to fulfil
the engagements of the person for whom I am going to be surety? In most
instances this alone ought to keep one from it.

3. If still I become surety, the amount of money for which I become
responsible must be so in my power that I am able to produce it whenever
it is called for, in order that the name of the Lord may not be
dishonoured.

4. But if there be the possibility of having to fulfil the engagements
of the person in whose stead I have to stand, is it the will of the Lord
that I should spend my means in that way? Is it not rather His will that
my means should be spent in another way? 5. How can I get over the plain
word of the Lord, which is to the contrary, even if the first four
points could be satisfactorily settled?

It has been my own happy lot, during the last thirty-seven years, to
become acquainted with hundreds of individuals, who were not inferior to
apostolic Christians.

That the disciples of Jesus should meet together on the first day of the
week for the breaking of bread, and that that should be their principal
meeting, and that those, whether one or several, who are truly gifted by
the Holy Spirit for service, be it for exhortation, or teaching, or
rule, etc., are responsible to the Lord for the exercise of their
gifts—these are to me no matters of uncertainty, but points on which my
soul, by grace, is established, through the revealed will of God.

I have often remarked the injurious effects of doing things because
others did them, or because it was the custom, or because they were
persuaded into acts of outward self-denial, or giving up things whilst
the heart did not go along with it, and whilst the outward act WAS NOT
the result of the inward powerful working of the Holy Ghost, and the
happy entering into our fellowship with the Father and with the Son.

Everything that is a mere form, a mere habit and custom in divine
things, is to be dreaded exceedingly: life, power, reality, this is
what we have to aim after. Things should not result from without, but
from within. The sort of clothes I wear, the kind of house I live in,
the quality of the furniture I use, all such like things should not
result from other persons'' doing so and so, or because it is customary
among those brethren with whom I associate to live in such and such a
simple, inexpensive self-denying way; but whatever be done in these
things, in the way of giving up, or self-denial, or deadness to the
world, should result from the joy we have in God, from the knowledge of
our being the children of God, from the entering into the preciousness
of our future inheritance, etc. Far better that for the time being we
stand still, and do not take the steps which we see others take, than
that it is merely the force of example that leads us to do a thing, and
afterwards it be regretted. Not that I mean in the least by this to
imply we should continue to live in luxury, self-indulgence, and the
like, whilst others are in great need; but we should begin the thing in
a right way, i.e., aim after the right state of heart; begin inwardly
instead of outwardly. If otherwise, it will not last. We shall look
back, or even get into a worse state than we were before. But oh, how
different if joy in God leads us to any little act of self-denial! How
gladly do we do it then! How great an honour then do we esteem it to be!
How much does the heart then long to be able to do more for Him who has
done so much for us! We are far then from looking down in proud
self-complacency upon those who do not go as far as we do, but rather
pray to the Lord that He would be pleased to help our dear brethren and
sisters forward who may seem to us weak in any particular point; and we
also are conscious to ourselves that if we have a little more light or
strength with reference to one point, other brethren may have more light
or grace in other respects.

As to the importance of the children of God''s opening their hearts to
each other, especially when they are getting into a cold state, or are
under the power of a certain sin, or are in especial difficulty; I know
from my own experience how often the snare of the devil has been broken
when under the power of sin; how often the heart has been comforted when
nigh to be overwhelmed; how often advice, under great perplexity, has
been obtained,—by opening my heart to a brother in whom I had
confidence. We are children of the same family, and ought therefore to
be helpers one of another.

1. Many persons, on account of timidity, would prefer coming at an
appointed time to the vestry to converse with us, to calling on us in
our own house. 2. The very fact of appointing a time for seeing people,
to converse with them in private concerning the things of eternity, has
brought some who, humanly speaking, never would have called on us under
other circumstances; yea, it has brought even those who, though they
thought they were concerned about the things of God, yet were completely
ignorant; and thus we have had an opportunity of speaking to them. 3.
These meetings have also been a great encouragement to ourselves in the
work; for often, when we thought that such and such expositions of the
Word had done no good at all, it was, through these meetings, found to
be the reverse; and likewise, when our hands were hanging down, we have
been afresh encouraged to go forward in the work of the Lord, and to
continue sowing the seed in hope, by seeing at these meetings fresh
cases, in which the Lord had condescended to use us as instruments,
particularly as in this way instances have sometimes occurred in which
individuals have spoken to us about the benefit which they derived from
our ministry, not only a few months before, but even as long as two,
three, and four years before.

For the above reasons I would particularly recommend to other servants
of Christ, especially to those who live in large towns, if they have not
already introduced a similar plan, to consider whether it may not be
well for them also to set apart such times for seeing inquirers. Those
meetings, however, require much prayer, to be enabled to speak aright,
to all those who come, according to their different need; and one is led
continually to feel that one is not sufficient of one''s self for these
things, but that our sufficiency can be alone of God. These meetings
also have been by far the most wearing-out part of all our work, though
at the same time the most refreshing.

1. Pew-rents are, according to James ii. 1-6, against the mind of the
Lord, as, in general, the poor brother cannot have so good a seat as the
rich. 2. A brother may gladly do something towards my support if left to
his own time; but when the quarter is up, he has perhaps other expenses,
and I do not know whether he pays his money grudgingly, and of
necessity, or cheerfully; but God loveth a cheerful giver. I knew it to
be a fact that sometimes it had not been convenient to individuals to
pay the money, when it had been asked for by the brethren who collected
it. 3. Though the Lord had been pleased to give me grace to be faithful,
so that I had been enabled not to keep back the truth, when He had shown
it to me; still I felt that the pew-rents were a snare to the servant of
Christ. It was a temptation to me, at least for a few minutes, at the
time when the Lord had stirred me up to pray and search the Word
respecting the ordinance of baptism, because £30 of my salary was
at stake if I should be baptized.

All establishments, even because they are establishment, i.e., the world
and the church mixed up together, not only contain in them the
principles which necessarily must lead to departure from the word of
God; but also, as long as they remain establishments, entirely preclude
the acting throughout according to the Holy Scriptures.

Ponder these words of the Lord Jesus, "Only believe." As long as we are
able to trust in God, holding fast in heart, that he is able and willing
to help those who rest on the Lord Jesus for salvation, in all matters
which are for His glory and their good, the heart remains calm and
peaceful. It is only when we practically let go faith in His power or
His love, that we lose our peace and become troubled. This very day I am
in great trial in connection with the work in which I am engaged; yet my
soul was calmed and quieted by the remembrance of God''s power and love;
and I said to myself this morning: "As David encouraged himself in
Jehovah his God, when he returned to Ziklag, so will I encourage myself
in God;" and the result was peace of soul.... It is the very time for
faith to work, when sight ceases. The greater the difficulties, the
easier for faith. As long as there remain certain natural prospects,
faith does not get on even as easily (if I may say so), as when all
natural prospects fail.

Observe two things! We acted for God in delaying the public meetings
and the publishing of the Report; but God''s way leads always into
trial, so far as sight and sense are concerned. Nature always will be
tried in God''s ways. The Lord was saying by this poverty, "I will now
see whether you truly lean upon me, and whether you truly look to me."
Of all the seasons that I had ever passed through since I had been
living in this way, up to that time, I never knew any period in which
my faith was tried so sharply, as during the four months from Dec. 12,
1841, to April 12, 1842. But observe further: We might even now have
altered our minds with respect to the public meetings and publishing the
Report; for no one knew our determination, at this time, concerning
the point. Nay, on the contrary, we knew with what delight very many
children of God were looking forward to receive further accounts. But
the Lord kept us steadfast to the conclusion, at which we had arrived
under His guidance.

It pleased the Lord, I think, to give me in some cases something like
the gift (not grace) of faith, so that unconditionally I could ask and
look for an answer. The difference between the gift and the grace of
faith seems to me this. According to the gift of faith I am able to do
a thing, or believe that a thing will come to pass, the not doing of
which, or the not believing of which would not be sin; according to the
grace of faith I am able to do a thing, or believe that a thing will
come to pass, respecting which I have the word of God as the ground to
rest upon, and, therefore, the not doing it, or the not believing it
would be sin. For instance, the gift of faith would be needed, to
believe that a sick person should be restored again, though there is no
human probability: for there is no promise to that effect; the grace of
faith is needed to believe that the Lord will give me the necessaries
of life, if I first seek the kingdom of God and His righteousness: for
there is a promise to that effect. (Matt. vi. 33.)

The natural mind is ever prone to reason, when we ought to believe;
to be at work, when we ought to be quiet; to go our own way, when we
ought steadily to walk on in God''s ways, however trying to nature.

The Lord gives faith, for the very purpose of trying it for the glory of
His own name, and for the good of him who has it; and, by the very trial
of our faith, we not only obtain blessing to our own souls, by becoming
the better acquainted with God, if we hold fast our confidence in Him,
but our faith is also, by the exercise, strengthened: and so it comes,
that, if we walk with God in any measure of uprightness of heart, the
trials of faith will be greater and greater.

It is for the church''s benefit that we are put in these straits; and if,
therefore, in the hour of need, we were to take goods on credit, the
first and primary object of the work would be completely frustrated, and
no heart would be further strengthened to trust in God, nor would there
be any longer that manifestation of the special and particular
providence of God, which has hitherto been so abundantly shown through
this work, even in the eyes of unbelievers, whereby they have been led
to see that there is, after all, reality in the things of God, and
many, through these printed accounts, have been truly converted. For
these reasons, then, we consider it our precious privilege, as
heretofore, to continue to wait upon the Lord only, instead of taking
goods on credit, or borrowing money from some kind friends, when we are
in need. Nay, we purpose, as God shall give us grace, to look to Him
only, though morning after morning we should have nothing in hand for
the work—yea, though from meal to meal we should have to look to Him;
being fully assured that He who is now (1845) in the tenth year feeding
these many orphans, and who has never suffered them to want, and that He
who is now (1845) in the twelfth year carrying on the other parts of the
work, without any branch of it having had to be stopped for want of
means, will do so for the future also. And here I do desire in the deep
consciousness of my natural helplessness and dependence upon the Lord to
confess that through the grace of God my soul has been in peace, though
day after day we have had to wait for our daily provisions upon the
Lord; yea, though even from meal to meal we have been required to do
this.

It is not enough to obtain means for the work of God, but that these
means should be obtained in God''s way. To ask unbelievers for means is
not God''s way; to press even believers to give, is not God''s way;
but the duty and the privilege of being allowed to contribute to the
work of God should be pointed out, and this should be followed up with
earnest prayer, believing prayer, and will result in the desired end.

It is true, the Gospel demands our All; but I fear that, in the
general claim on All, we have shortened the claim on everything. We
are not under law. True; but that is not to make our obedience less
complete, or our giving less bountiful: rather, is it not, that after
all claims of law are settled, the new nature finds its joy in doing
more than the law requires? Let us abound in the work of the Lord more
and more.

At the end of the last century a very godly and liberal merchant in
London was one day called on by a gentleman, to ask him for some money
for a charitable object. The gentleman expected very little, having just
heard that the merchant had sustained heavy loss from the wreck of some
of his ships. Contrary, however, to expectation, he received about ten
times as much as h' WHERE id = 'eb428426-4daa-4d37-9423-55ef0a84d874';
