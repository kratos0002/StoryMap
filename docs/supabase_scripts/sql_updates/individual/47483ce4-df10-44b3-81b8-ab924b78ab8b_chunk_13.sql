      horrible idea came to me. These negroes were born close to a country where
      they eat human beings! And each day such a number of soldiers were killed
      around the town! I questioned Timbuctoo. He would not answer. I did not
      insist, but from that time on I declined his presents.

“He worshipped me. One night snow took us by surprise at the
      outposts. We were seated, on the ground. I looked with pity at those poor
      negroes shivering beneath this white frozen shower. I was very cold and
      began to cough. At once I felt something fall on me like a large warm
      quilt. It was Timbuctoo''s cape that he had thrown on my shoulders.

“He then stood up, drew his sword, which he had sharpened to an edge
      like a scythe, and holding in his other hand the large cape which I had
      refused, said:

“Eight days later we capitulated. Some of us had been able to
      escape, the rest were to march out of the town and give themselves up to
      the conquerors.

“I went towards the exercising ground, where we were all to meet,
      when I was dumfounded at the sight of a gigantic negro dressed in white
      duck and wearing a straw hat. It was Timbuctoo. He was beaming and was
      walking with his hands in his pockets in front of a little shop where two
      plates and two glasses were displayed.

“''Me not go. Me good cook; me make food for Colonel Algeria. Me eat
      Prussians; much steal, much.''

“There were ten degrees of frost. I shivered at sight of this negro
      in white duck. He took me by the arm and made me go inside. I noticed an
      immense flag that he was going to place outside his door as soon as we had
      left, for he had some shame.”

“In spite of the despair that was gnawing at my heart, I could not
      help laughing, and I left my negro to his new enterprise.

“Bezieres to-day belongs to the Germans. The ''Restaurant Timbuctoo''
      is the beginning of a retaliation.”

The five friends had finished dinner, five men of the world, mature, rich,
      three married, the two others bachelors. They met like this every month in
      memory of their youth, and after dinner they chatted until two o''clock in
      the morning. Having remained intimate friends, and enjoying each other''s
      society, they probably considered these the pleasantest evenings of their
      lives. They talked on every subject, especially of what interested and
      amused Parisians. Their conversation was, as in the majority of salons
      elsewhere, a verbal rehash of what they had read in the morning papers.

One of the most lively of them was Joseph de Bardon, a celibate living the
      Parisian life in its fullest and most whimsical manner. He was not a
      debauche nor depraved, but a singular, happy fellow, still young, for he
      was scarcely forty. A man of the world in its widest and best sense,
      gifted with a brilliant, but not profound, mind, with much varied
      knowledge, but no true erudition, ready comprehension without true
      understanding, he drew from his observations, his adventures, from
      everything he saw, met with and found, anecdotes at once comical and
      philosophical, and made humorous remarks that gave him a great reputation
      for cleverness in society.

He was the after dinner speaker and had his own story each time, upon
      which they counted, and he talked without having to be coaxed.

As he sat smoking, his elbows on the table, a petit verre half full beside
      his plate, half torpid in an atmosphere of tobacco blended with steaming
      coffee, he seemed to be perfectly at home. He said between two whiffs:

“With pleasure. You know that I wander about Paris a great deal,
      like book collectors who ransack book stalls. I just look at the sights,
      at the people, at all that is passing by and all that is going on.

“Toward the middle of September—it was beautiful weather—I
      went out one afternoon, not knowing where I was going. One always has a
      vague wish to call on some pretty woman or other. One chooses among them
      in one''s mental picture gallery, compares them in one''s mind, weighs the
      interest with which they inspire you, their comparative charms and finally
      decides according to the influence of the day. But when the sun is very
      bright and the air warm, it takes away from you all desire to make calls.

“The sun was bright, the air warm. I lighted a cigar and sauntered
      aimlessly along the outer boulevard. Then, as I strolled on, it occurred
      to me to walk as far as Montmartre and go into the cemetery.

“I am very fond of cemeteries. They rest me and give me a feeling of
      sadness; I need it. And, besides, I have good friends in there, those that
      one no longer goes to call on, and I go there from time to time.

“It is in this cemetery of Montmartre that is buried a romance of my
      life, a sweetheart who made a great impression on me, a very emotional,
      charming little woman whose memory, although it causes me great sorrow,
      also fills me with regrets—regrets of all kinds. And I go to dream
      beside her grave. She has finished with life.

“And then I like cemeteries because they are immense cities filled
      to overflowing with inhabitants. Think how many dead people there are in
      this small space, think of all the generations of Parisians who are housed
      there forever, veritable troglodytes enclosed in their little vaults, in
      their little graves covered with a stone or marked by a cross, while
      living beings take up so much room and make so much noise —imbeciles
      that they are!

“Then, again, in cemeteries there are monuments almost as
      interesting as in museums. The tomb of Cavaignac reminded me, I must
      confess without making any comparison, of the chef d''oeuvre of Jean
      Goujon: the recumbent statue of Louis de Breze in the subterranean chapel
      of the Cathedral of Rouen. All modern and realistic art has originated
      there, messieurs. This dead man, Louis de Breze, is more real, more
      terrible, more like inanimate flesh still convulsed with the death agony
      than all the tortured corpses that are distorted to-day in funeral
      monuments.

“But in Montmartre one can yet admire Baudin''s monument, which has a
      degree of grandeur; that of Gautier, of Murger, on which I saw the other
      day a simple, paltry wreath of immortelles, yellow immortelles, brought
      thither by whom? Possibly by the last grisette, very old and now janitress
      in the neighborhood. It is a pretty little statue by Millet, but ruined by
      dirt and neglect. Sing of youth, O Murger!

“Well, there I was in Montmartre Cemetery, and was all at once
      filled with sadness, a sadness that is not all pain, a kind of sadness
      that makes you think when you are in good health, ''This place is not
      amusing, but my time has not come yet.''

“The feeling of autumn, of the warm moisture which is redolent of
      the death of the leaves, and the weakened, weary, anaemic sun increased,
      while rendering it poetical, the sensation of solitude and of finality
      that hovered over this spot which savors of human mortality.

“I walked along slowly amid these streets of tombs, where the
      neighbors do not visit each other, do not sleep together and do not read
      the newspapers. And I began to read the epitaphs. That is the most amusing
      thing in the world. Never did Labiche or Meilhac make me laugh as I have
      laughed at the comical inscriptions on tombstones. Oh, how much superior
      to the books of Paul de Kock for getting rid of the spleen are these
      marble slabs and these crosses where the relatives of the deceased have
      unburdened their sorrow, their desires for the happiness of the vanished
      ones and their hope of rejoining them—humbugs!

“But I love above all in this cemetery the deserted portion,
      solitary, full of great yews and cypresses, the older portion, belonging
      to those dead long since, and which will soon be taken into use again; the
      growing trees nourished by the human corpses cut down in order to bury in
      rows beneath little slabs of marble those who have died more recently.

“When I had sauntered about long enough to refresh my mind I felt
      that I would soon have had enough of it and that I must place the faithful
      homage of my remembrance on my little friend''s last resting place. I felt
      a tightening of the heart as I reached her grave. Poor dear, she was so
      dainty, so loving and so white and fresh—and now—if one should
      open the grave—

“Leaning over the iron grating, I told her of my sorrow in a low
      tone, which she doubtless did not hear, and was moving away when I saw a
      woman in black, in deep mourning, kneeling on the next grave. Her crape
      veil was turned back, uncovering a pretty fair head, the hair in Madonna
      bands looking like rays of dawn beneath her sombre headdress. I stayed.

“Surely she must be in profound grief. She had covered her face with
      her hands and, standing there in meditation, rigid as a statue, given up
      to her grief, telling the sad rosary of her remembrances within the shadow
      of her concealed and closed eyes, she herself seemed like a dead person
      mourning another who was dead. All at once a little motion of her back,
      like a flutter of wind through a willow, led me to suppose that she was
      going to cry. She wept softly at first, then louder, with quick motions of
      her neck and shoulders. Suddenly she uncovered her eyes. They were full of
      tears and charming, the eyes of a bewildered woman, with which she glanced
      about her as if awaking from a nightmare. She looked at me, seemed abashed
      and hid her face completely in her hands. Then she sobbed convulsively,
      and her head slowly bent down toward the marble. She leaned her forehead
      on it, and her veil spreading around her, covered the white corners of the
      beloved tomb, like a fresh token of mourning. I heard her sigh, then she
      sank down with her cheek on the marble slab and remained motionless,
      unconscious.

“I darted toward her, slapped her hands, blew on her eyelids, while
      I read this simple epitaph: ''Here lies Louis-Theodore Carrel, Captain of
      Marine Infantry, killed by the enemy at Tonquin. Pray for him.''

“He had died some months before. I was affected to tears and
      redoubled my attentions. They were successful. She regained consciousness.
      I appeared very much moved. I am not bad looking, I am not forty. I saw by
      her first glance that she would be polite and grateful. She was, and amid
      more tears she told me her history in detached fragments as well as her
      gasping breath would allow, how the officer was killed at Tonquin when
      they had been married a year, how she had married him for love, and being
      an orphan, she had only the usual dowry.

“And we set off together, she leaning on my arm, while I almost
      carried her along the paths of the cemetery. When we got outside she
      faltered:

“I perceived a restaurant, one of those places where the mourners of
      the dead go to celebrate the funeral. We went in. I made her drink a cup
      of hot tea, which seemed to revive her. A faint smile came to her lips.
      She began to talk about herself. It was sad, so sad to be always alone in
      life, alone in one''s home, night and day, to have no one on whom one can
      bestow affection, confidence, intimacy.

“That sounded sincere. It sounded pretty from her mouth. I was
      touched. She was very young, perhaps twenty. I paid her compliments, which
      she took in good part. Then, as time was passing, I suggested taking her
      home in a carriage. She accepted, and in the cab we sat so close that our
      shoulders touched.

“When the cab stopped at her house she murmured: ''I do not feel
      equal to going upstairs alone, for I live on the fourth floor. You have
      been so good. Will you let me take your arm as far as my own door?''

“I agreed with eagerness. She ascended the stairs slowly, breathing
      hard. Then, as we stood at her door, she said:

“And, by Jove, I went in. Everything was modest, even rather poor,
      but simple and in good taste.

“We sat down side by side on a little sofa and she began to talk
      again about her loneliness. She rang for her maid, in order to offer me
      some wine. The maid did not come. I was delighted, thinking that this maid
      probably came in the morning only, what one calls a charwoman.

“She had taken off her hat. She was really pretty, and she gazed at
      me with her clear eyes, gazed so hard and her eyes were so clear that I
      was terribly tempted. I caught her in my arms and rained kisses on her
      eyelids, which she closed suddenly.

“But I next kissed her on the mouth and she did not resist, and as
      our glances met after thus outraging the memory of the captain killed in
      Tonquin, I saw that she had a languid, resigned expression that set my
      mind at rest.

“She demurred a little. I insisted. She yielded, saying by way of
      apology to herself: ''I am so lonely—so lonely.'' Then she added:

“''I must put on something less sombre, and went into her bedroom.
      When she reappeared she was dressed in half-mourning, charming, dainty and
      slender in a very simple gray dress. She evidently had a costume for the
      cemetery and one for the town.

“The dinner was very enjoyable. She drank some champagne, brightened
      up, grew lively and I went home with her.

“This friendship, begun amid the tombs, lasted about three weeks.
      But one gets tired of everything, especially of women. I left her under
      pretext of an imperative journey. She made me promise that I would come
      and see her on my return. She seemed to be really rather attached to me.

“Other things occupied my attention, and it was about a month before
      I thought much about this little cemetery friend. However, I did not
      forget her. The recollection of her haunted me like a mystery, like a
      psychological problem, one of those inexplicable questions whose solution
      baffles us.

“I do not know why, but one day I thought I might possibly meet her
      in the Montmartre Cemetery, and I went there.

“I walked about a long time without meeting any but the ordinary
      visitors to this spot, those who have not yet broken off all relations
      with their dead. The grave of the captain killed at Tonquin had no mourner
      on its marble slab, no flowers, no wreath.

“But as I wandered in another direction of this great city of the
      dead I perceived suddenly, at the end of a narrow avenue of crosses, a
      couple in deep mourning walking toward me, a man and a woman. Oh, horrors!
      As they approached I recognized her. It was she!

“She saw me, blushed, and as I brushed past her she gave me a little
      signal, a tiny little signal with her eye, which meant: ''Do not recognize
      me!'' and also seemed to say, ''Come back to see me again, my dear!''

“The man was a gentleman, distingue, chic, an officer of the Legion
      of Honor, about fifty years old. He was supporting her as I had supported
      her myself when we were leaving the cemetery.

“I went my way, filled with amazement, asking myself what this all
      meant, to what race of beings belonged this huntress of the tombs? Was she
      just a common girl, one who went to seek among the tombs for men who were
      in sorrow, haunted by the recollection of some woman, a wife or a
      sweetheart, and still troubled by the memory of vanished caresses? Was she
      unique? Are there many such? Is it a profession? Do they parade the
      cemetery as they parade the street? Or else was she only impressed with
      the admirable, profoundly philosophical idea of exploiting love
      recollections, which are revived in these funereal places?

Every year I celebrate Twelfth Night with my old friend Chantal. My
      father, who was his most intimate friend, used to take me round there when
      I was a child. I continued the custom, and I doubtless shall continue it
      as long as I live and as long as there is a Chantal in this world.

The Chantals lead a peculiar existence; they live in Paris as though they
      were in Grasse, Evetot, or Pont-a-Mousson.

They have a house with a little garden near the observatory. They live
      there as though they were in the country. Of Paris, the real Paris, they
      know nothing at all, they suspect nothing; they are so far, so far away!
      However, from time to time, they take a trip into it. Mademoiselle Chantal
      goes to lay in her provisions, as it is called in the family. This is how
      they go to purchase their provisions:

Mademoiselle Pearl, who has the keys to the kitchen closet (for the linen
      closets are administered by the mistress herself), Mademoiselle Pearl
      gives warning that the supply of sugar is low, that the preserves are
      giving out, that there is not much left in the bottom of the coffee bag.
      Thus warned against famine, Mademoiselle Chantal passes everything in
      review, taking notes on a pad. Then she puts down a lot of figures and
      goes through lengthy calculations and long discussions with Mademoiselle
      Pearl. At last they manage to agree, and they decide upon the quantity of
      each thing of which they will lay in a three months'' provision; sugar,
      rice, prunes, coffee, preserves, cans of peas, beans, lobster, salt or
      smoked fish, etc., etc. After which the day for the purchasing is
      determined on and they go in a cab with a railing round the top and drive
      to a large grocery store on the other side of the river in the new
      sections of the town.

Madame Chantal and Mademoiselle Pearl make this trip together,
      mysteriously, and only return at dinner time, tired out, although still
      excited, and shaken up by the cab, the roof of which is covered with
      bundles and bags, like an express wagon.

For the Chantals all that part of Paris situated on the other side of the
      Seine constitutes the new quarter, a section inhabited by a strange, noisy
      population, which cares little for honor, spends its days in dissipation,
      its nights in revelry, and which throws money out of the windows. From
      time to time, however, the young girls are taken to the Opera-Comique or
      the Theatre Francais, when the play is recommended by the paper which is
      read by M. Chantal.

At present the young ladies are respectively nineteen and seventeen. They
      are two pretty girls, tall and fresh, very well brought up, in fact, too
      well brought up, so much so that they pass by unperceived like two pretty
      dolls. Never would the idea come to me to pay the slightest attention or
      to pay court to one of the young Chantal ladies; they are so immaculate
      that one hardly dares speak to them; one almost feels indecent when bowing
      to them.

As for the father, he is a charming man, well educated, frank, cordial,
      but he likes calm and quiet above all else, and has thus contributed
      greatly to the mummifying of his family in order to live as he pleased in
      stagnant quiescence. He reads a lot, loves to talk and is readily
      affected. Lack of contact and of elbowing with the world has made his
      moral skin very tender and sensitive. The slightest thing moves him,
      excites him, and makes him suffer.

The Chantals have limited connections carefully chosen in the
      neighborhood. They also exchange two or three yearly visits with relatives
      who live in the distance.

As for me, I take dinner with them on the fifteenth of August and on
      Twelfth Night. That is as much one of my duties as Easter communion is for
      a Catholic.

On the fifteenth of August a few friends are invited, but on Twelfth Night
      I am the only stranger.

According to my usual custom, I kissed M. Chantal, Madame Chantal and
      Mademoiselle Pearl, and I made a deep bow to the Misses Louise and
      Pauline. I was questioned about a thousand and one things, about what had
      happened on the boulevards, about politics, about how matters stood in
      Tong-King, and about our representatives in Parliament. Madame Chantal, a
      fat lady, whose ideas always gave me the impression of being carved out
      square like building stones, was accustomed to exclaiming at the end of
      every political discussion: “All that is seed which does not promise
      much for the future!” Why have I always imagined that Madame
      Chantal''s ideas are square? I don''t know; but everything that she says
      takes that shape in my head: a big square, with four symmetrical angles.
      There are other people whose ideas always strike me as being round and
      rolling like a hoop. As soon as they begin a sentence on any subject it
      rolls on and on, coming out in ten, twenty, fifty round ideas, large and
      small, which I see rolling along, one behind the other, to the end of the
      horizon. Other people have pointed ideas—but enough of this.

We sat down as usual and finished our dinner without anything out of the
      ordinary being said. At dessert the Twelfth Night cake was brought on.
      Now, M. Chantal had been king every year. I don''t know whether this was
      the result of continued chance or a family convention, but he unfailingly
      found the bean in his piece of cake, and he would proclaim Madame Chantal
      to be queen. Therefore, I was greatly surprised to find something very
      hard, which almost made me break a tooth, in a mouthful of cake. Gently I
      took this thing from my mouth and I saw that it was a little porcelain
      doll, no bigger than a bean. Surprise caused me to exclaim:

“Ah!” All looked at me, and Chantal clapped his hands and
      cried: “It''s Gaston! It''s Gaston! Long live the king! Long live the
      king!”

All took up the chorus: “Long live the king!” And I blushed to
      the tip of my ears, as one often does, without any reason at all, in
      situations which are a little foolish. I sat there looking at my plate,
      with this absurd little bit of pottery in my fingers, forcing myself to
      laugh and not knowing what to do or say, when Chantal once more cried out:
      “Now, you must choose a queen!”

Then I was thunderstruck. In a second a thousand thoughts and suppositions
      flashed through my mind. Did they expect me to pick out one of the young
      Chantal ladies? Was that a trick to make me say which one I prefer? Was it
      a gentle, light, direct hint of the parents toward a possible marriage?
      The idea of marriage roams continually in houses with grown-up girls, and
      takes every shape and disguise, and employs every subterfuge. A dread of
      compromising myself took hold of me as well as an extreme timidity before
      the obstinately correct and reserved attitude of the Misses Louise and
      Pauline. To choose one of them in preference to the other seemed to me as
      difficult as choosing between two drops of water; and then the fear of
      launching myself into an affair which might, in spite of me, lead me
      gently into matrimonial ties, by means as wary and imperceptible and as
      calm as this insignificant royalty—the fear of all this haunted me.

Suddenly I had an inspiration, and I held out to Mademoiselle Pearl the
      symbolical emblem. At first every one was surprised, then they doubtless
      appreciated my delicacy and discretion, for they applauded furiously.
      Everybody was crying: “Long live the queen! Long live the queen!”

As for herself, poor old maid, she was so amazed that she completely lost
      control of herself; she was trembling and stammering: “No—no—oh!
      no—not me—please—not me—I beg of you——”

I was accustomed to seeing her in this house, just as one sees old
      upholstered armchairs on which one has been sitting since childhood
      without ever noticing them. One day, with no reason at all, because a ray
      of sunshine happens to strike the seat, you suddenly think: “Why,
      that chair is very curious”; and then you discover that the wood has
      been worked by a real artist and that the material is remarkable. I had
      never taken any notice of Mademoiselle Pearl.

She was a part of the Chantal family, that was all. But how? By what
      right? She was a tall, thin person who tried to remain in the background,
      but who was by no means insignificant. She was treated in a friendly
      manner, better than a housekeeper, not so well as a relative. I suddenly
      observed several shades of distinction which I had never noticed before.
      Madame Chantal said: “Pearl.” The young ladies: “Mademoiselle
      Pearl,” and Chantal only addressed her as “Mademoiselle,”
      with an air of greater respect, perhaps.

I began to observe her. How old could she be? Forty? Yes, forty. She was
      not old, she made herself old. I was suddenly struck by this fact. She
      fixed her hair and dressed in a ridiculous manner, and, notwithstanding
      all that, she was not in the least ridiculous, she had such simple,
      natural gracefulness, veiled and hidden. Truly, what a strange creature!
      How was it I had never observed her before? She dressed her hair in a
      grotesque manner with little old maid curls, most absurd; but beneath this
      one could see a large, calm brow, cut by two deep lines, two wrinkles of
      long sadness, then two blue eyes, large and tender, so timid, so bashful,
      so humble, two beautiful eyes which had kept the expression of naive
      wonder of a young girl, of youthful sensations, and also of sorrow, which
      had softened without spoiling them.

Her whole face was refined and discreet, a face the expression of which
      seemed to have gone out without being used up or faded by the fatigues and
      great emotions of life.

What a dainty mouth! and such pretty teeth! But one would have thought
      that she did not dare smile.

Suddenly I compared her to Madame Chantal! Undoubtedly Mademoiselle Pearl
      was the better of the two, a hundred times better, daintier, prouder, more
      noble. I was surprised at my observation. They were pouring out champagne.
      I held my glass up to the queen and, with a well-turned compliment, I
      drank to her health. I could see that she felt inclined to hide her head
      in her napkin. Then, as she was dipping her lips in the clear wine,
      everybody cried: “The queen drinks! the queen drinks!” She
      almost turned purple and choked. Everybody was laughing; but I could see
      that all loved her.

As soon as dinner was over Chantal took me by the arm. It was time for his
      cigar, a sacred hour. When alone he would smoke it out in the street; when
      guests came to dinner he would take them to the billiard room and smoke
      while playing. That evening they had built a fire to celebrate Twelfth
      Night; my old friend took his cue, a very fine one, and chalked it with
      great care; then he said:

I started the game and made a few carroms. I missed some others, but as
      the thought of Mademoiselle Pearl kept returning to my mind, I suddenly
      asked:

“And if you only knew how peculiar it is that you should ask me that
      to-day, on Twelfth Night!”

“Why? Well, listen. Forty-one years ago to day, the day of the
      Epiphany, the following events occurred: We were then living at
      Roily-le-Tors, on the ramparts; but in order that you may understand, I
      must first explain the house. Roily is built on a hill, or, rather, on a
      mound which overlooks a great stretch of prairie. We had a house there
      with a beautiful hanging garden supported by the old battlemented wall; so
      that the house was in the town on the streets, while the garden overlooked
      the plain. There was a door leading from the garden to the open country,
      at the bottom of a secret stairway in the thick wall—the kind you
      read about in novels. A road passed in front of this door, which was
      provided with a big bell; for the peasants, in order to avoid the
      roundabout way, would bring their provisions up this way.

“You now understand the place, don''t you? Well, this year, at
      Epiphany, it had been snowing for a week. One might have thought that the
      world was coming to an end. When we went to the ramparts to look over the
      plain, this immense white, frozen country, which shone like varnish, would
      chill our very souls. One might have thought that the Lord had packed the
      world in cotton to put it away in the storeroom for old worlds. I can
      assure you that it was dreary looking.

“We were a very numerous family at that time my father, my mother,
      my uncle and aunt, my two brothers and four cousins; they were pretty
      little girls; I married the youngest. Of all that crowd, there are only
      three of us left: my wife, I, and my sister-in-law, who lives in
      Marseilles. Zounds! how quickly a family like that dwindles away! I
      tremble when I think of it! I was fifteen years old then, since I am
      fifty-six now.

“We were going to celebrate the Epiphany, and we were all happy,
      very happy! Everybody was in the parlor, awaiting dinner, and my oldest
      brother, Jacques, said: ''There has been a dog howling out in the plain for
      about ten minutes; the poor beast must be lost.''

“He had hardly stopped talking when the garden bell began to ring.
      It had the deep sound of a church bell, which made one think of death. A
      shiver ran through everybody. My father called the servant and told him to
      go outside and look. We waited in complete silence; we were thinking of
      the snow which covered the ground. When the man returned he declared that
      he had seen nothing. The dog kept up its ceaseless howling, and always
      from the same spot.

“We sat down to dinner; but we were all uneasy, especially the young
      people. Everything went well up to the roast, then the bell began to ring
      again, three times in succession, three heavy, long strokes which vibrated
      to the tips of our fingers and which stopped our conversation short. We
      sat there looking at each other, fork in the air, still listening, and
      shaken by a kind of supernatural fear.

“At last my mother spoke: ''It''s surprising that they should have
      waited so long to come back. Do not go alone, Baptiste; one of these
      gentlemen will accompany you.''

“My Uncle Francois arose. He was a kind of Hercules, very proud of
      his strength, and feared nothing in the world. My father said to him:
      ''Take a gun. There is no telling what it might be.''

“We others remained there trembling with fear and apprehension,
      without eating or speaking. My father tried to reassure us: ''Just wait and
      see,'' he said; ''it will be some beggar or some traveller lost in the snow.
      After ringing once, seeing that the door was not immediately opened, he
      attempted again to find his way, and being unable to, he has returned to
      our door.''

“Our uncle seemed to stay away an hour. At last he came back,
      furious, swearing: ''Nothing at all; it''s some practical joker! There is
      nothing but that damned dog howling away at about a hundred yards from the
      walls. If I had taken a gun I would have killed him to make him keep
      quiet.''

“We sat down to dinner again, but every one was excited; we felt
      that all was not over, that something was going to happen, that the bell
      would soon ring again.

“It rang just as the Twelfth Night cake was being cut. All the men
      jumped up together. My Uncle, Francois, who had been drinking champagne,
      swore so furiously that he would murder it, whatever it might be, that my
      mother and my aunt threw themselves on him to prevent his going. My
      father, although very calm and a little helpless (he limped ever since he
      had broken his leg when thrown by a horse), declared, in turn, that he
      wished to find out what was the matter and that he was going. My brothers,
      aged eighteen and twenty, ran to get their guns; and as no one was paying
      any attention to me I snatched up a little rifle that was used in the
      garden and got ready to accompany the expedition.

“It started out immediately. My father and uncle were walking ahead
      with Baptiste, who was carrying a lantern. My brothers, Jacques and Paul,
      followed, and I trailed on behind in spite of the prayers of my mother,
      who stood in front of the house with her sister and my cousins.

“It had been snowing again for the last hour, and the trees were
      weighted down. The pines were bending under this heavy, white garment, and
      looked like white pyramids or enormous sugar cones, and through the gray
      curtains of small hurrying flakes could be seen the lighter bushes which
      stood out pale in the shadow. The snow was falling so thick that we could
      hardly see ten feet ahead of us. But the lantern threw a bright light
      around us. When we began to go down the winding stairway in the wall I
      really grew frightened. I felt as though some one were walking behind me,
      were going to grab me by the shoulders and carry me away, and I felt a
      strong desire to return; but, as I would have had to cross the garden all
      alone, I did not dare. I heard some one opening the door leading to the
      plain; my uncle began to swear again, exclaiming: ''By—-! He has gone
      again! If I can catch sight of even his shadow, I''ll take care not to miss
      him, the swine!''

“It was a discouraging thing to see this great expanse of plain, or,
      rather, to feel it before us, for we could not see it; we could only see a
      thick, endless veil of snow, above, below, opposite us, to the right, to
      the left, everywhere. My uncle continued:

“''Listen! There is the dog howling again; I will teach him how I
      shoot. That will be something gained, anyhow.''

“''It will be much better to go on and get the poor animal, who is
      crying for hunger. The poor fellow is barking for help; he is calling like
      a man in distress. Let us go to him.''

“So we started out through this mist, through this thick continuous
      fall of snow, which filled the air, which moved, floated, fell, and
      chilled the skin with a burning sensation like a sharp, rapid pain as each
      flake melted. We were sinking in up to our knees in this soft, cold mass,
      and we had to lift our feet very high in order to walk. As we advanced the
      dog''s voice became clearer and stronger. My uncle cried: ''Here he is!'' We
      stopped to observe him as one does when he meets an enemy at night.

“I could see nothing, so I ran up to the others, and I caught sight
      of him; he was frightful and weird-looking; he was a big black shepherd''s
      dog with long hair and a wolf''s head, standing just within the gleam of
      light cast by our lantern on the snow. He did not move; he was silently
      watching us.

“My uncle said: ''That''s peculiar, he is neither advancing nor
      retreating. I feel like taking a shot at him.''

“There was indeed something behind him, something gray, impossible
      to distinguish. We started out again cautiously. When he saw us
      approaching the dog sat down. He did not look wicked. Instead, he seemed
      pleased at having been able to attract the attention of some one.

“My father went straight to him and petted him. The dog licked his
      hands. We saw that he was tied to the wheel of a little carriage, a sort
      of toy carriage entirely wrapped up in three or four woolen blankets. We
      carefully took off these coverings, and as Baptiste approached his lantern
      to the front of this little vehicle, which looked like a rolling kennel,
      we saw in it a little baby sleeping peacefully.

“My father was the first to collect his wits, and as he had a warm
      heart and a broad mind, he stretched his hand over the roof of the
      carriage and said: ''Poor little waif, you shall be one of us!'' And he
      ordered my brother Jacques to roll the foundling ahead of us. Thinking out
      loud, my father continued:

“''Some child of love whose poor mother rang at my door on this night
      of Epiphany in memory of the Child of God.''

“He once more stopped and called at the top of his lungs through the
      night to the four corners of the heavens: ''We have found it!'' Then,
      putting his hand on his brother''s shoulder, he murmured: ''What if you had
      shot the dog, Francois?''

“My uncle did not answer, but in the darkness he crossed himself,
      for, notwithstanding his blustering manner, he was very religious.

“Ah! But you should have seen us when we got to the house! At first
      we had a lot of trouble in getting the carriage up through the winding
      stairway; but we succeeded and even rolled it into the vestibule.

“How funny mamma was! How happy and astonished! And my four little
      cousins (the youngest was only six), they looked like four chickens around
      a nest. At last we took the child from the carriage. It was still
      sleeping. It was a girl about six weeks old. In its clothes we found ten
      thousand francs in gold, yes, my boy, ten thousand francs!—which
      papa saved for her dowry. Therefore, it was not a child of poor people,
      but, perhaps, the child of some nobleman and a little bourgeoise of the
      town—or again—we made a thousand suppositions, but we never
      found out anything-never the slightest clue. The dog himself was
      recognized by no one. He was a stranger in the country. At any rate, the
      person who rang three times at our door must have known my parents well,
      to have chosen them thus.

“It was not until later that she was called Mademoiselle Pearl. She
      was at first baptized ''Marie Simonne Claire,'' Claire being intended, for
      her family name.

“I can assure you that our return to the diningroom was amusing,
      with this baby now awake and looking round her at these people and these
      lights with her vague blue questioning eyes.

“We sat down to dinner again and the cake was cut. I was king, and
      for queen I took Mademoiselle Pearl, just as you did to-day. On that day
      she did not appreciate the honor that was being shown her.

“Well, the child was adopted and brought up in the family. She grew,
      and the years flew by. She was so gentle and loving and minded so well
      that every one would have spoiled her abominably had not my mother
      prevented it.

“My mother was an orderly woman with a great respect for class
      distinctions. She consented to treat little Claire as she did her own
      sons, but, nevertheless, she wished the distance which separated us to be
      well marked, and our positions well established. Therefore, as soon as the
      child could understand, she acquainted her with her story and gently, even
      tenderly, impressed on the little one''s mind that, for the Chantals, she
      was an adopted daughter, taken in, but, nevertheless, a stranger. Claire
      understood the situation with peculiar intelligence and with surprising
      instinct; she knew how to take the place which was allotted her, and to
      keep it with so much tact, gracefulness and gentleness that she often
      brought tears to my father''s eyes. My mother herself was often moved by
      the passionate gratitude and timid devotion of this dainty and loving
      little creature that she began calling her: ''My daughter.'' At times, when
      the little one had done something kind and good, my mother would raise her
      spectacles on her forehead, a thing which always indicated emotion with
      her, and she would repeat: ''This child is a pearl, a perfect pearl!'' This
      name stuck to the little Claire, who became and remained for us
      Mademoiselle Pearl.”

M. Chantal stopped. He was sitting on the edge of the billiard table, his
      feet hanging, and was playing with a ball with his left hand, while with
      his right he crumpled a rag which served to rub the chalk marks from the
      slate. A little red in the face, his voice thick, he was talking away to
      himself now, lost in his memories, gently drifting through the old scenes
      and events which awoke in his mind, just as we walk through old family
      gardens where we were brought up and where each tree, each walk, each
      hedge reminds us of some occurrence.

“By Jove! She was pretty at eighteen—and graceful—and
      perfect. Ah! She was so sweet—and good and true—and charming!
      She had such eyes—blue-transparent—clear—such eyes as I
      have never seen since!”

He answered, not to me, but to the word “marry” which had
      caught his ear: “Why? why? She never would—she never would!
      She had a dowry of thirty thousand francs, and she received several offers—but
      she never would! She seemed sad at that time. That was when I married my
      cousin, little Charlotte, my wife, to whom I had been engaged for six
      years.”

I looked at M. Chantal, and it seemed to me that I was looking into his
      very soul, and I was suddenly witnessing one of those humble and cruel
      tragedies of honest, straightforward, blameless hearts, one of those
      secret tragedies known to no one, not even the silent and resigned
      victims. A rash curiosity suddenly impelled me to exclaim:

“Why, anyone can see that—and it''s even on account of her that
      you delayed for so long your marriage to your cousin who had been waiting
      for you for six years.”

He dropped the ball which he was holding in his left hand, and, seizing
      the chalk rag in both hands, he buried his face in it and began to sob. He
      was weeping with his eyes, nose and mouth in a heartbreaking yet
      ridiculous manner, like a sponge which one squeezes. He was coughing,
      spitting and blowing his nose in the chalk rag, wiping his eyes and
      sneezing; then the tears would again begin to flow down the wrinkles on
      his face and he would make a strange gurgling noise in his throat. I felt
      bewildered, ashamed; I wanted to run away, and I no longer knew what to
      say, do, or attempt.

Suddenly Madame Chantal''s voice sounded on the stairs. “Haven''t you
      men almost finished smoking your cigars?”

Then I rushed to her husband, and, seizing him by the shoulders, I cried:
      “Monsieur Chantal, my friend Chantal, listen to me; your wife is
      calling; pull yourself together, we must go downstairs.”

He began conscientiously to wipe his face on the cloth which, for the last
      two or three years, had been used for marking off the chalk from the
      slate; then he appeared, half white and half red, his forehead, nose,
      cheeks and chin covered with chalk, and his eyes swollen, still full of
      tears.

I caught him by the hands and dragged him into his bedroom, muttering:
      “I beg your pardon, I beg your pardon, Monsieur Chantal, for having
      caused you such sorrow—but—I did not know—you—you
      understand.”

Then he plunged his face into a bowl of water. When he emerged from it he
      did not yet seem to me to be presentable; but I thought of a little
      stratagem. As he was growing worried, looking at himself in the mirror, I
      said to him: “All you have to do is to say that a little dust flew
      into your eye and you can cry before everybody to your heart''s content.”

He went downstairs rubbing his eyes with his handkerchief. All were
      worried; each one wished to look for the speck, which could not be found;
      and stories were told of similar cases where it had been necessary to call
      in a physician.

I went over to Mademoiselle Pearl and watched her, tormented by an ardent
      curiosity, which was turning to positive suffering. She must indeed have
      been pretty, with her gentle, calm eyes, so large that it looked as though
      she never closed them like other mortals. Her gown was a little
      ridiculous, a real old maid''s gown, which was unbecoming without appearing
      clumsy.

It seemed to me as though I were looking into her soul, just as I had into
      Monsieur Chantal''s; that I was looking right from one end to the other of
      this humble life, so simple and devoted. I felt an irresistible longing to
      question her, to find out whether she, too, had loved him; whether she
      also had suffered, as he had, from this long, secret, poignant grief,
      which one cannot see, know, or guess, but which breaks forth at night in
      the loneliness of the dark room. I was watching her, and I could observe
      her heart beating under her waist, and I wondered whether this sweet,
      candid face had wept on the soft pillow and she had sobbed, her whole body
      shaken by the violence of her anguish.

I said to her in a low voice, like a child who is breaking a toy to see
      what is inside: “If you could have seen Monsieur Chantal crying a
      while ago it would have moved you.”

“Yes. He was telling me how much he had loved you in the days gone
      by; and what a pang it had given him to marry his cousin instead of you.”

Her pale face seemed to grow a little longer; her calm eyes, which always
      remained open, suddenly closed so quickly that they seemed shut forever.
      She slipped from her chair to the floor, and slowly, gently sank down as
      would a fallen garment.

Madame Chantal and her daughters rushed forward, and while they were
      looking for towels, water and vinegar, I grabbed my hat and ran away.

I walked away with rapid strides, my heart heavy, my mind full of remorse
      and regret. And yet sometimes I felt pleased; I felt as though I had done
      a praiseworthy and necessary act. I was asking myself: “Did I do
      wrong or right?” They had that shut up in their hearts, just as some
      people carry a bullet in a closed wound. Will they not be happier now? It
      was too late for their torture to begin over again and early enough for
      them to remember it with tenderness.

And perhaps some evening next spring, moved by a beam of moonlight falling
      through the branches on the grass at their feet, they will join and press
      their hands in memory of all this cruel and suppressed suffering; and,
      perhaps, also this short embrace may infuse in their veins a little of
      this thrill which they would not have known without it, and will give to
      those two dead souls, brought to life in a second, the rapid and divine
      sensation of this intoxication, of this madness which gives to lovers more
      happiness in an instant than other men can gather during a whole lifetime!

While apparently thinking of something else, Dr. Sorbier had been
      listening quietly to those amazing accounts of burglaries and daring deeds
      that might have been taken from the trial of Cartouche. “Assuredly,”
      he exclaimed, “assuredly, I know of no viler fault nor any meaner
      action than to attack a girl''s innocence, to corrupt her, to profit by a
      moment of unconscious weakness and of madness, when her heart is beating
      like that of a frightened fawn, and her pure lips seek those of her
      tempter; when she abandons herself without thinking of the irremediable
      stain, nor of her fall, nor of the morrow.

“The man who has brought this about slowly, viciously, who can tell
      with what science of evil, and who, in such a case, has not steadiness and
      self-restraint enough to quench that flame by some icy words, who has not
      sense enough for two, who cannot recover his self-possession and master
      the runaway brute within him, and who loses his head on the edge of the
      precipice over which she is going to fall, is as contemptible as any man
      who breaks open a lock, or as any rascal on the lookout for a house left
      defenceless and unprotected or for some easy and dishonest stroke of
      business, or as that thief whose various exploits you have just related to
      us.

“I, for my part, utterly refuse to absolve him, even when
      extenuating circumstances plead in his favor, even when he is carrying on
      a dangerous flirtation, in which a man tries in vain to keep his balance,
      not to exceed the limits of the game, any more than at lawn tennis; even
      when the parts are inverted and a man''s adversary is some precocious,
      curious, seductive girl, who shows you immediately that she has nothing to
      learn and nothing to experience, except the last chapter of love, one of
      those girls from whom may fate always preserve our sons, and whom a
      psychological novel writer has christened ''The Semi-Virgins.''

“It is, of course, difficult and painful for that coarse and
      unfathomable vanity which is characteristic of every man, and which might
      be called ''malism'', not to stir such a charming fire, difficult to act the
      Joseph and the fool, to turn away his eyes, and, as it were, to put wax
      into his ears, like the companions of Ulysses when they were attracted by
      the divine, seductive songs of the Sirens, difficult only to touch that
      pretty table covered with a perfectly new cloth, at which you are invited
      to take a seat before any one else, in such a suggestive voice, and are
      requested to quench your thirst and to taste that new wine, whose fresh
      and strange flavor you will never forget. But who would hesitate to
      exercise such self-restraint if, when he rapidly examines his conscience,
      in one of those instinctive returns to his sober self in which a man
      thinks clearly and recovers his head, he were to measure the gravity of
      his fault, consider it, think of its consequences, of the reprisals, of
      the uneasiness which he would always feel in the future, and which would
      destroy the repose and happiness of his life?

“You may guess that behind all these moral reflections, such as a
      graybeard like myself may indulge in, there is a story hidden, and, sad as
      it is, I am sure it will interest you on account of the strange heroism it
      shows.”

He was silent for a few moments, as if to classify his recollections, and,
      with his elbows resting on the arms of his easy-chair and his eyes looking
      into space, he continued in the slow voice of a hospital professor who is
      explaining a case to his class of medical students, at a bedside:

“He was one of those men who, as our grandfathers used to say, never
      met with a cruel woman, the type of the adventurous knight who was always
      foraging, who had something of the scamp about him, but who despised
      danger and was bold even to rashness. He was ardent in the pursuit of
      pleasure, and had an irresistible charm about him, one of those men in
      whom we excuse the greatest excesses as the most natural things in the
      world. He had run through all his money at gambling and with pretty girls,
      and so became, as it were, a soldier of fortune. He amused himself
      whenever and however he could, and was at that time quartered at
      Versailles.

“I knew him to the very depths of his childlike heart, which was
      only too easily seen through and sounded, and I loved him as some old
      bachelor uncle loves a nephew who plays him tricks, but who knows how to
      coax him. He had made me his confidant rather than his adviser, kept me
      informed of his slightest pranks, though he always pretended to be
      speaking about one of his friends, and not about himself; and I must
      confess that his youthful impetuosity, his careless gaiety, and his
      amorous ardor sometimes distracted my thoughts and made me envy the
      handsome, vigorous young fellow who was so happy at being alive, that I
      had not the courage to check him, to show him the right road, and to call
      out to him: ''Take care!'' as children do at blind man''s buff.

“And one day, after one of those interminable cotillons, where the
      couples do not leave each other for hours, and can disappear together
      without anybody thinking of noticing them, the poor fellow at last
      discovered what love was, that real love which takes up its abode in the
      very centre of the heart and in the brain, and is proud of being there,
      and which rules like a sovereign and a tyrannous master, and he became
      desperately enamored of a pretty but badly brought up girl, who was as
      disquieting and wayward as she was pretty.

“She loved him, however, or rather she idolized him despotically,
      madly, with all her enraptured soul and all her being. Left to do as she
      pleased by imprudent and frivolous parents, suffering from neurosis, in
      consequence of the unwholesome friendships which she contracted at the
      convent school, instructed by what she saw and heard and knew was going on
      around her, in spite of her deceitful and artificial conduct, knowing that
      neither her father nor her mother, who were very proud of their race as
      well as avaricious, would ever agree to let her marry the man whom she had
      taken a liking to, that handsome fellow who had little besides vision,
      ideas and debts, and who belonged to the middle-class, she laid aside all
      scruples, thought of nothing but of becoming his, no matter what might be
      the cost.

“By degrees, the unfortunate man''s strength gave way, his heart
      softened, and he allowed himself to be carried away by that current which
      buffeted him, surrounded him, and left him on the shore like a waif and a
      stray.

“They wrote letters full of madness to each other, and not a day
      passed without their meeting, either accidentally, as it seemed, or at
      parties and balls. She had yielded her lips to him in long, ardent
      caresses, which had sealed their compact of mutual passion.”

The doctor stopped, and his eyes suddenly filled with tears, as these
      former troubles came back to his mind; and then, in a hoarse voice, he
      went on, full of the horror of what he was going to relate:

“For months he scaled the garden wall, and, holding his breath and
      listening for the slightest noise, like a burglar who is going to break
      into a house, he went in by the servants'' entrance, which she had left
      open, slunk barefoot down a long passage and up the broad staircase, which
      creaked occasionally, to the second story, where his sweetheart''s room
      was, and stayed there for hours.

“One night, when it was darker than usual, and he was hurrying lest
      he should be later than the time agreed on, he knocked up against a piece
      of furniture in the anteroom and upset it. It so happened that the girl''s
      mother had not gone to sleep, either because she had a sick headache, or
      else because she had sat up late over some novel, and, frightened at that
      unusual noise which disturbed the silence of the house, she jumped out of
      bed, opened the door, saw some one indistinctly running away and keeping
      close to the wall, and, immediately thinking that there were burglars in
      the house, she aroused her husband and the servants by her frantic
      screams. The unfortunate man understood the situation; and, seeing what a
      terrible fix he was in, and preferring to be taken for a common thief to
      dishonoring his adored one''s name, he ran into the drawing-room, felt on
      the tables and what-nots, filled his pockets at random with valuable
      bric-a-brac, and then cowered down behind the grand piano, which barred
      the corner of a large room.

“The servants, who had run in with lighted candles, found him, and,
      overwhelming him with abuse, seized him by the collar and dragged him,
      panting and apparently half dead with shame and terror, to the nearest
      police station. He defended himself with intentional awkwardness when he
      was brought up for trial, kept up his part with the most perfect
      self-possession and without any signs of the despair and anguish that he
      felt in his heart, and, condemned and degraded and made to suffer
      martyrdom in his honor as a man and a soldier—he was an officer—he
      did not protest, but went to prison as one of those criminals whom society
      gets rid of like noxious vermin.

“He died there of misery and of bitterness of spirit, with the name
      of the fair-haired idol, for whom he had sacrificed himself, on his lips,
      as if it had been an ecstatic prayer, and he intrusted his will ''to the
      priest who administered extreme unction to him, and requested him to give
      it to me. In it, without mentioning anybody, and without in the least
      lifting the veil, he at last explained the enigma, and cleared himself of
      those accusations the terrible burden of which he had borne until his last
      breath.

“I have always thought myself, though I do not know why, that the
      girl married and had several charming children, whom she brought up with
      the austere strictness and in the serious piety of former days!”

Abbe Marignan''s martial name suited him well. He was a tall, thin priest,
      fanatic, excitable, yet upright. All his beliefs were fixed, never
      varying. He believed sincerely that he knew his God, understood His plans,
      desires and intentions.

When he walked with long strides along the garden walk of his little
      country parsonage, he would sometimes ask himself the question: “Why
      has God done this?” And he would dwell on this continually, putting
      himself in the place of God, and he almost invariably found an answer. He
      would never have cried out in an outburst of pious humility: “Thy
      ways, O Lord, are past finding out.”

He said to himself: “I am the servant of God; it is right for me to
      know the reason of His deeds, or to guess it if I do not know it.”

Everything in nature seemed to him to have been created in accordance with
      an admirable and absolute logic. The “whys” and “becauses”
      always balanced. Dawn was given to make our awakening pleasant, the days
      to ripen the harvest, the rains to moisten it, the evenings for
      preparation for slumber, and the dark nights for sleep.

The four seasons corresponded perfectly to the needs of agriculture, and
      no suspicion had ever come to the priest of the fact that nature has no
      intentions; that, on the contrary, everything which exists must conform to
      the hard demands of seasons, climates and matter.

But he hated woman—hated her unconsciously, and despised her by
      instinct. He often repeated the words of Christ: “Woman, what have I
      to do with thee?” and he would add: “It seems as though God,
      Himself, were dissatisfied with this work of His.” She was the
      tempter who led the first man astray, and who since then had ever been
      busy with her work of damnation, the feeble creature, dangerous and
      mysteriously affecting one. And even more than their sinful bodies, he
      hated their loving hearts.

He had often felt their tenderness directed toward himself, and though he
      knew that he was invulnerable, he grew angry at this need of love that is
      always vibrating in them.

According to his belief, God had created woman for the sole purpose of
      tempting and testing man. One must not approach her without defensive
      precautions and fear of possible snares. She was, indeed, just like a
      snare, with her lips open and her arms stretched out to man.

He had no indulgence except for nuns, whom their vows had rendered
      inoffensive; but he was stern with them, nevertheless, because he felt
      that at the bottom of their fettered and humble hearts the everlasting
      tenderness was burning brightly—that tenderness which was shown even
      to him, a priest.

He felt this cursed tenderness, even in their docility, in the low tones
      of their voices when speaking to him, in their lowered eyes, and in their
      resigned tears when he reproved them roughly. And he would shake his
      cassock on leaving the convent doors, and walk off, lengthening his stride
      as though flying from danger.

He had a niece who lived with her mother in a little house near him. He
      was bent upon making a sister of charity of her.

She was a pretty, brainless madcap. When the abbe preached she laughed,
      and when he was angry with her she would give him a hug, drawing him to
      her heart, while he sought unconsciously to release himself from this
      embrace which nevertheless filled him with a sweet pleasure, awakening in
      his depths the sensation of paternity which slumbers in every man.

Often, when walking by her side, along the country road, he would speak to
      her of God, of his God. She never listened to him, but looked about her at
      the sky, the grass and flowers, and one could see the joy of life
      sparkling in her eyes. Sometimes she would dart forward to catch some
      flying creature, crying out as she brought it back: “Look, uncle,
      how pretty it is! I want to hug it!” And this desire to “hug”
      flies or lilac blossoms disquieted, angered, and roused the priest, who
      saw, even in this, the ineradicable tenderness that is always budding in
      women''s hearts.

Then there came a day when the sexton''s wife, who kept house for Abbe
      Marignan, told him, with caution, that his niece had a lover.

Almost suffocated by the fearful emotion this news roused in him, he stood
      there, his face covered with soap, for he was in the act of shaving.

When he had sufficiently recovered to think and speak he cried: “It
      is not true; you lie, Melanie!”

But the peasant woman put her hand on her heart, saying: “May our
      Lord judge me if I lie, Monsieur le Cure! I tell you, she goes there every
      night when your sister has gone to bed. They meet by the river side; you
      have only to go there and see, between ten o''clock and midnight.”

He ceased scraping his chin, and began to walk up and down impetuously, as
      he always did when he was in deep thought. When he began shaving again he
      cut himself three times from his nose to his ear.

All day long he was silent, full of anger and indignation. To his priestly
      hatred of this invincible love was added the exasperation of her spiritual
      father, of her guardian and pastor, deceived and tricked by a child, and
      the selfish emotion shown by parents when their daughter announces that
      she has chosen a husband without them, and in spite of them.

After dinner he tried to read a little, but could not, growing more and,
      more angry. When ten o''clock struck he seized his cane, a formidable oak
      stick, which he was accustomed to carry in his nocturnal walks when
      visiting the sick. And he smiled at the enormous club which he twirled in
      a threatening manner in his strong, country fist. Then he raised it
      suddenly and, gritting his teeth, brought it down on a chair, the broken
      back of which fell over on the floor.

He opened the door to go out, but stopped on the sill, surprised by the
      splendid moonlight, of such brilliance as is seldom seen.

And, as he was gifted with an emotional nature, one such as had all those
      poetic dreamers, the Fathers of the Church, he felt suddenly distracted
      and moved by all the grand and serene beauty of this pale night.

In his little garden, all bathed in soft light, his fruit trees in a row
      cast on the ground the shadow of their slender branches, scarcely in full
      leaf, while the giant honeysuckle, clinging to the wall of his house,
      exhaled a delicious sweetness, filling the warm moonlit atmosphere with a
      kind of perfumed soul.

He began to take long breaths, drinking in the air as drunkards drink
      wine, and he walked along slowly, delighted, marveling, almost forgetting
      his niece.

As soon as he was outside of the garden, he stopped to gaze upon the plain
      all flooded with the caressing light, bathed in that tender, languishing
      charm of serene nights. At each moment was heard the short, metallic note
      of the cricket, and distant nightingales shook out their scattered notes—their
      light, vibrant music that sets one dreaming, without thinking, a music
      made for kisses, for the seduction of moonlight.

The abbe walked on again, his heart failing, though he knew not why. He
      seemed weakened, suddenly exhausted; he wanted to sit down, to rest there,
      to think, to admire God in His works.

Down yonder, following the undulations of the little river, a great line
      of poplars wound in and out. A fine mist, a white haze through which the
      moonbeams passed, silvering it and making it gleam, hung around and above
      the mountains, covering all the tortuous course of the water with a kind
      of light and transparent cotton.

And a doubt, a vague feeling of disquiet came over him; he was asking one
      of those questions that he sometimes put to himself.

“Why did God make this? Since the night is destined for sleep,
      unconsciousness, repose, forgetfulness of everything, why make it more
      charming than day, softer than dawn or evening? And why does this
      seductive planet, more poetic than the sun, that seems destined, so
      discreet is it, to illuminate things too delicate and mysterious for the
      light of day, make the darkness so transparent?

“Why does not the greatest of feathered songsters sleep like the
      others? Why does it pour forth its voice in the mysterious night?

“Why this half-veil cast over the world? Why these tremblings of the
      heart, this emotion of the spirit, this enervation of the body? Why this
      display of enchantments that human beings do not see, since they are lying
      in their beds? For whom is destined this sublime spectacle, this abundance
      of poetry cast from heaven to earth?”

But see, out there, on the edge of the meadow, under the arch of trees
      bathed in a shining mist, two figures are walking side by side.

The man was the taller, and held his arm about his sweetheart''s neck and
      kissed her brow every little while. They imparted life, all at once, to
      the placid landscape in which they were framed as by a heavenly hand. The
      two seemed but a single being, the being for whom was destined this calm
      and silent night, and they came toward the priest as a living answer, the
      response his Master sent to his questionings.

He stood still, his heart beating, all upset; and it seemed to him that he
      saw before him some biblical scene, like the loves of Ruth and Boaz, the
      accomplishment of the will of the Lord, in some of those glorious stories
      of which the sacred books tell. The verses of the Song of Songs began to
      ring in his ears, the appeal of passion, all the poetry of this poem
      replete with tenderness.

And he said unto himself: “Perhaps God has made such nights as these
      to idealize the love of men.”

He shrank back from this couple that still advanced with arms intertwined.
      Yet it was his niece. But he asked himself now if he would not be
      disobeying God. And does not God permit love, since He surrounds it with
      such visible splendor?

And he went back musing, almost ashamed, as if he had intruded into a
      temple where he had, no right to enter.

Why did I go into that beer hall on that particular evening? I do not
      know. It was cold; a fine rain, a flying mist, veiled the gas lamps with a
      transparent fog, made the side walks reflect the light that streamed from
      the shop windows—lighting up the soft slush and the muddy feet of
      the passers-by.

I was going nowhere in particular; was simply having a short walk after
      dinner. I had passed the Credit Lyonnais, the Rue Vivienne, and several
      other streets. I suddenly descried a large beer hall which was more than
      half full. I walked inside, with no object in view. I was not the least
      thirsty.

I glanced round to find a place that was not too crowded, and went and sat
      down by the side of a man who seemed to me to be old, and who was smoking
      a two-sous clay pipe, which was as black as coal. From six to eight
      glasses piled up on the table in front of him indicated the number of
      “bocks” he had already absorbed. At a glance I recognized a
      “regular,” one of those frequenters of beer houses who come in
      the morning when the place opens, and do not leave till evening when it is
      about to close. He was dirty, bald on top of his head, with a fringe of
      iron-gray hair falling on the collar of his frock coat. His clothes, much
      too large for him, appeared to have been made for him at a time when he
      was corpulent. One could guess that he did not wear suspenders, for he
      could not take ten steps without having to stop to pull up his trousers.
      Did he wear a vest? The mere thought of his boots and of that which they
      covered filled me with horror. The frayed cuffs were perfectly black at
      the edges, as were his nails.

As soon as I had seated myself beside him, this individual said to me in a
      quiet tone of voice:

I seized him by the hand, and was so dumbfounded that I could find nothing
      to say. At length I managed to stammer out:

“Every day it is the same thing,” was his reply, accompanied
      with a thick puff of tobacco smoke.

He then tapped with a sou on the top of the marble table, to attract the
      attention of the waiter, and called out:

Immediately a man with a white apron appeared, carrying two “bocks,”
      which he set down, foaming, on the table, spilling some of the yellow
      liquid on the sandy floor in his haste.

Des Barrets emptied his glass at a single draught and replaced it on the
      table, while he sucked in the foam that had been left on his mustache. He
      next asked:

“What''s the use of an occupation? For my part, I do nothing at all,
      as you see, never anything. When one has not a sou I can understand why
      one should work. But when one has enough to live on, what''s the use? What
      is the good of working? Do you work for yourself, or for others? If you
      work for yourself, you do it for your own amusement, which is all right;
      if you work for others, you are a fool.”

“Waiter, a ''bock.''” And continued: “It makes me thirsty
      to keep calling so. I am not accustomed to that sort of thing. Yes, yes, I
      do nothing. I let things slide, and I am growing old. In dying I shall
      have nothing to regret. My only remembrance will be this beer hall. No
      wife, no children, no cares, no sorrows, nothing. That is best.”

He then emptied the glass which had been brought him, passed his tongue
      over his lips, and resumed his pipe.

“That is not a proper life to lead, my dear fellow; it is simply
      horrible. Come, you must have something to do, you must love something,
      you must have friends.”

“No, I get up at noon, I come here, I have my breakfast, I drink my
      beer, I remain until the evening, I have my dinner, I drink beer. Then
      about half-past one in the morning, I go home to bed, because the place
      closes up; that annoys me more than anything. In the last ten years I have
      passed fully six years on this bench, in my corner; and the other four in
      my bed, nowhere else. I sometimes chat with the regular customers.”

“What do you mean? One cannot remain all one''s life in the Latin
      Quarter. The students make too much noise. Now I shall not move again.
      Waiter, a ''bock.''”

“Come now, be frank. You have been the victim of some great sorrow;
      some disappointment in love, no doubt! It is easy to see that you are a
      man who has had some trouble. What age are you?”

I looked him straight in the face. His wrinkled, ill-shaven face gave one
      the impression that he was an old man. On the top of his head a few long
      hairs waved over a skin of doubtful cleanliness. He had enormous
      eyelashes, a heavy mustache, and a thick beard. Suddenly I had a kind of
      vision, I know not why, of a basin filled with dirty water in which all
      that hair had been washed. I said to him:

“I tell you that I have not. I am old because I never go out into
      the air. Nothing makes a man deteriorate more than the life of a cafe.”

“You must surely also have been married? One could not get as
      bald-headed as you are without having been in love.”

“If I am bald, it is the fault of the gas. It destroys the hair.
      Waiter, a ''bock.'' Are you not thirsty?”

“No, thank you. But you really interest me. Since when have you been
      so morbid? Your life is not normal, it is not natural. There is something
      beneath it all.”

“Yes, and it dates from my infancy. I received a great shock when I
      was very young, and that turned my life into darkness which will last to
      the end.”

“You wish to know about it? Well, then, listen. You recall, of
      course, the castle in which I was brought up, for you used to spend five
      or six months there during vacation. You remember that large gray
      building, in the middle of a great park, and the long avenues of oaks
      which opened to the four points of the compass. You remember my father and
      mother, both of whom were ceremonious, solemn, and severe.

“I worshipped my mother; I was afraid of my father; but I respected
      both, accustomed always as I was to see every one bow before them. They
      were Monsieur le Comte and Madame la Comtesse to all the country round,
      and our neighbors, the Tannemares, the Ravelets, the Brennevilles, showed
      them the utmost consideration.

“I was then thirteen years old. I was happy, pleased with
      everything, as one is at that age, full of the joy of life.

“Well, toward the end of September, a few days before returning to
      college, as I was playing about in the shrubbery of the park, among the
      branches and leaves, as I was crossing a path, I saw my father and mother,
      who were walking along.

“I recall it as though it were yesterday. It was a very windy day.
      The whole line of trees swayed beneath the gusts of wind, groaning, and
      seeming to utter cries-those dull, deep cries that forests give out during
      a tempest.

“The falling leaves, turning yellow, flew away like birds, circling
      and falling, and then running along the path like swift animals.

“Evening came on. It was dark in the thickets. The motion of the
      wind and of the branches excited me, made me tear about as if I were
      crazy, and howl in imitation of the wolves.

“As soon as I perceived my parents, I crept furtively toward them,
      under the branches, in order to surprise them, as though I had been a
      veritable prowler. But I stopped in fear a few paces from them. My father,
      who was in a terrible passion, cried:

“''Your mother is a fool; moreover, it is not a question of your
      mother. It is you. I tell you that I need this money, and I want you to
      sign this.''

“''I will not sign it. It is Jean''s fortune. I shall guard it for him
      and I will not allow you to squander it with strange women, as you have
      your own heritage.''

“Then my father, trembling with rage, wheeled round and, seizing his
      wife by the throat, began to slap her with all his might full in the face
      with his disengaged hand.

“My mother''s hat fell off, her hair became loosened and fell over
      her shoulders; she tried to parry the blows, but she could not do so. And
      my father, like a madman, kept on striking her. My mother rolled over on
      the ground, covering her face with her hands. Then he turned her over on
      her back in order to slap her still more, pulling away her hands, which
      were covering her face.

“As for me, my friend, it seemed as though the world was coming to
      an end, that the eternal laws had changed. I experienced the overwhelming
      dread that one has in presence of things supernatural, in presence of
      irreparable disasters. My childish mind was bewildered, distracted. I
      began to cry with all my might, without knowing why; a prey to a fearful
      dread, sorrow, and astonishment. My father heard me, turned round, and, on
      seeing me, started toward me. I believe that he wanted to kill me, and I
      fled like a hunted animal, running straight ahead into the thicket.

“I ran perhaps for an hour, perhaps for two. I know not. Darkness
      set in. I sank on the grass, exhausted, and lay there dismayed, frantic
      with fear, and devoured by a sorrow capable of breaking forever the heart
      of a poor child. I was cold, hungry, perhaps. At length day broke. I was
      afraid to get up, to walk, to return home, to run farther, fearing to
      encounter my father, whom I did not wish to see again.

“I should probably have died of misery and of hunger at the foot of
      a tree if the park guard had not discovered me and led me home by force.

“I found my parents looking as usual. My mother alone spoke to me
      “''How you frightened me, you naughty boy. I lay awake the whole
      night.''

“Well, my friend, it was all over with me. I had witnessed the other
      side of things, the bad side. I have not been able to perceive the good
      side since that day. What has taken place in my mind, what strange
      phenomenon has warped my ideas, I do not know. But I no longer had a taste
      for anything, a wish for anything, a love for anybody, a desire for
      anything whatever, any ambition, or any hope. And I always see my poor
      mother on the ground, in the park, my father beating her. My mother died
      some years later; my, father still lives. I have not seen him since.
      Waiter, a ''bock.''”

A waiter brought him his “bock,” which he swallowed at a gulp.
      But, in taking up his pipe again, trembling as he was, he broke it.
      “Confound it!” he said, with a gesture of annoyance. “That
      is a real sorrow. It will take me a month to color another!”

And he called out across the vast hall, now reeking with smoke and full of
      men drinking, his everlasting: “Garcon, un ''bock''—and a new
      pipe.”

The three children, two girls and a boy, rose and kissed their
      grandmother. Then they said good-night to M. le Cure, who had dined at the
      chateau, as was his custom every Thursday.

The Abbe Mauduit lifted two of the children on his knees, passing his long
      arms clad in black round their necks, and kissing them tenderly on the
      forehead as he drew their heads toward him as a father might.

Then he set them down on the ground, and the little beings went off, the
      boy ahead, and the girls following.
