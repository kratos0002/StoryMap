UPDATE stories SET original_text = original_text || 'to senile decay. It seemed to me that so far Gibberne was only
      going to do for any one who took his drug exactly what Nature has done for
      the Jews and Orientals, who are men in their teens and aged by fifty, and
      quicker in thought and act than we are all the time. The marvel of drugs
      has always been great to my mind; you can madden a man, calm a man, make
      him incredibly strong and alert or a helpless log, quicken this passion
      and allay that, all by means of drugs, and here was a new miracle to be
      added to this strange armoury of phials the doctors use! But Gibberne was
      far too eager upon his technical points to enter very keenly into my
      aspect of the question.

It was the 7th or 8th of August when he told me the distillation that
      would decide his failure or success for a time was going forward as we
      talked, and it was on the 10th that he told me the thing was done and the
      New Accelerator a tangible reality in the world. I met him as I was going
      up the Sandgate Hill towards Folkestone—I think I was going to get
      my hair cut, and he came hurrying down to meet me—I suppose he was
      coming to my house to tell me at once of his success. I remember that his
      eyes were unusually bright and his face flushed, and I noted even then the
      swift alacrity of his step.

"It''s done," he cried, and gripped my hand, speaking very fast; "it''s more
      than done. Come up to my house and see."

"It does more, much more. It scares me. Come up and see the stuff. Taste
      it! Try it! It''s the most amazing stuff on earth." He gripped my arm and;
      walking at such a pace that he forced me into a trot, went shouting with
      me up the hill. A whole char-`-banc-ful of people turned and stared
      at us in unison after the manner of people in chars-`-banc. It was
      one of those hot, clear days that Folkestone sees so much of, every colour
      incredibly bright and every outline hard. There was a breeze, of course,
      but not so much breeze as sufficed under these conditions to keep me cool
      and dry. I panted for mercy.

"No," he said. "At the utmost a drop of water that stood in a beaker from
      which I had washed out the last traces of the stuff. I took some last
      night, you know. But that is ancient history now."

"It goes a thousand times, many thousand times!" cried Gibberne, with a
      dramatic gesture, flinging open his Early English carved oak gate.

"It throws all sorts of light on nervous physiology, it kicks the theory
      of vision into a perfectly new shape! ... Heaven knows how many thousand
      times. We''ll try all that after——The thing is to try the stuff
      now."

"Rather," said Gibberne, turning on me in his study. "There it is in that
      little green phial there! Unless you happen to be afraid?"

I am a careful man by nature, and only theoretically adventurous. I was
      afraid. But on the other hand, there is pride.

"I''ve tried it," he said, "and I don''t look hurt by it, do I? I don''t even
      look livery, and I feel——"

I sat down. "Give me the potion," I said. "If the worst comes to the worst
      it will save having my hair cut, and that, I think, is one of the most
      hateful duties of a civilised man. How do you take the mixture?"

He stood up in front of his desk and regarded me in his easy-chair; his
      manner was suddenly affected by a touch of the Harley Street specialist.
      "It''s rum stuff, you know," he said.

"I must warn you, in the first place, as soon as you''ve got it down to
      shut your eyes, and open them very cautiously in a minute or so''s time.
      One still sees. The sense of vision is a question of length of vibration,
      and not of multitude of impacts; but there''s a kind of shock to the
      retina, a nasty giddy confusion just at the time if the eyes are open.
      Keep ''em shut."

"And the next thing is, keep still. Don''t begin to whack about. You may
      fetch something a nasty rap if you do. Remember you will be going several
      thousand times faster than you ever did before, heart, lungs, muscles,
      brain—everything—and you will hit hard without knowing it. You
      won''t know it, you know. You''ll feel just as you do now. Only everything
      in the world will seem to be going ever so many thousand times slower than
      it ever went before. That''s what makes it so deuced queer."

"You''ll see," said he, and took up a little measure. He glanced at the
      material on his desk. "Glasses," he said, "water. All here. Mustn''t take
      too much for the first attempt."

The little phial glucked out its precious contents. "Don''t forget what I
      told you," he said, turning the contents of the measure into a glass in
      the manner of an Italian waiter measuring whisky. "Sit with the eyes
      tightly shut and in absolute stillness for two minutes," he said. "Then
      you will hear me speak."

"By-the-by," he said, "don''t put your glass down. Keep it in your hand and
      rest your hand on your knee. Yes—so. And now——"

"The New Accelerator," he answered, and we touched glasses and drank, and
      instantly I closed my eyes.

You know that blank non-existence into which one drops when one has taken
      "gas." For an indefinite interval it was like that. Then I heard Gibberne
      telling me to wake up, and I stirred and opened my eyes. There he stood as
      he had been standing, glass still in hand. It was empty, that was all the
      difference.

"Things are still," I said. "By Jove! yes! They are still. Except
      the sort of faint pat, patter, like rain falling on different things. What
      is it?"

"Analysed sounds," I think he said, but I am not sure. He glanced at the
      window. "Have you ever seen a curtain before a window fixed in that way
      before?"

I followed his eyes, and there was the end of the curtain, frozen, as it
      were, corner high, in the act of flapping briskly in the breeze.

"And here," he said, and opened the hand that held the glass. Naturally I
      winced, expecting the glass to smash. But so far from smashing, it did not
      even seem to stir; it hung in mid-air—motionless. "Roughly
      speaking," said Gibberne, "an object in these latitudes falls 16 feet in
      the first second. This glass is falling 16 feet in a second now. Only, you
      see, it hasn''t been falling yet for the hundredth part of a second. That
      gives you some idea of the pace of my Accelerator."

And he waved his hand round and round, over and under the slowly sinking
      glass. Finally he took it by the bottom, pulled it down and placed it very
      carefully on the table. "Eh?" he said to me, and laughed.

"That seems all right," I said, and began very gingerly to raise myself
      from my chair. I felt perfectly well, very light and comfortable, and
      quite confident in my mind. I was going fast all over. My heart, for
      example, was beating a thousand times a second, but that caused me no
      discomfort at all. I looked out of the window. An immovable cyclist, head
      down and with a frozen puff of dust behind his driving-wheel, scorched to
      overtake a galloping char-`-banc that did not stir. I gaped in
      amazement at this incredible spectacle. "Gibberne," I cried, "how long
      will this confounded stuff last?"

"Heaven knows!" he answered. "Last time I took it I went to bed and slept
      it off. I tell you, I was frightened. It must have lasted some minutes, I
      think—it seemed like hours. But after a bit it slows down rather
      suddenly, I believe."

I was proud to observe that I did not feel frightened—I suppose
      because there were two of us. "Why shouldn''t we go out?" I asked.

"Not they. Goodness, no! Why, we shall be going a thousand times faster
      than the quickest conjuring trick that was ever done. Come along! Which
      way shall we go? Window, or door?"

Assuredly of all the strange experiences that I have ever had, or
      imagined, or read of other people having or imagining, that little raid I
      made with Gibberne on the Folkestone Leas, under the influence of the New
      Accelerator, was the strangest and maddest of all. We went out by his gate
      into the road, and there we made a minute examination of the statuesque
      passing traffic. The tops of the wheels and some of the legs of the horses
      of this char-`-banc, the end of the whip-lash and the lower jaw of
      the conductor—who was just beginning to yawn—were perceptibly
      in motion, but all the rest of the lumbering conveyance seemed still. And
      quite noiseless except for a faint rattling that came from one man''s
      throat. And as parts of this frozen edifice there were a driver, you know,
      and a conductor, and eleven people! The effect as we walked about the
      thing began by being madly queer and ended by being—disagreeable.
      There they were, people like ourselves and yet not like ourselves, frozen
      in careless attitudes, caught in mid-gesture. A girl and a man smiled at
      one another, a leering smile that threatened to last for evermore; a woman
      in a floppy capelline rested her arm on the rail and stared at Gibberne''s
      house with the unwinking stare of eternity; a man stroked his moustache
      like a figure of wax, and another stretched a tiresome stiff hand with
      extended fingers towards his loosened hat. We stared at them, we laughed
      at them, we made faces at them, and then a sort of disgust of them came
      upon us, and we turned away and walked round in front of the cyclist
      towards the Leas.

He pointed, and there at the tip of his finger and sliding down the air
      with wings flapping slowly and at the speed of an exceptionally languid
      snail—was a bee.

And so we came out upon the Leas. There the thing seemed madder than ever.
      The band was playing in the upper stand, though all the sound it made for
      us was a low-pitched, wheezy rattle, a sort of prolonged last sigh that
      passed at times into a sound like the slow, muffled ticking of some
      monstrous clock. Frozen people stood erect, strange, silent,
      self-conscious-looking dummies hung unstably in mid-stride, promenading
      upon the grass. I passed close to a little poodle dog suspended in the act
      of leaping, and watched the slow movement of his legs as he sank to earth.
      "Lord, look here!" cried Gibberne, and we halted for a moment
      before a magnificent person in white faint—striped flannels, white
      shoes, and a Panama hat, who turned back to wink at two gaily dressed
      ladies he had passed. A wink, studied with such leisurely deliberation as
      we could afford, is an unattractive thing. It loses any quality of alert
      gaiety, and one remarks that the winking eye does not completely close,
      that under its drooping lid appears the lower edge of an eyeball and a
      little line of white. "Heaven give me memory," said I, "and I will never
      wink again."

We picked our way among the bath-chairs in the path. Many of the people
      sitting in the chairs seemed almost natural in their passive poses, but
      the contorted scarlet of the bandsmen was not a restful thing to see. A
      purple-faced little gentleman was frozen in the midst of a violent
      struggle to refold his newspaper against the wind; there were many
      evidences that all these people in their sluggish way were exposed to a
      considerable breeze, a breeze that had no existence so far as our
      sensations went. We came out and walked a little way from the crowd, and
      turned and regarded it. To see all that multitude changed to a picture,
      smitten rigid, as it were, into the semblance of realistic wax, was
      impossibly wonderful. It was absurd, of course; but it filled me with an
      irrational, an exultant sense of superior advantage. Consider the wonder
      of it! All that I had said, and thought, and done since the stuff had
      begun to work in my veins had happened, so far as those people, so far as
      the world in general went, in the twinkling of an eye. "The New
      Accelerator——" I began, but Gibberne interrupted me.

"Lives next door to me," said Gibberne. "Has a lapdog that yaps. Gods! The
      temptation is strong!"

There is something very boyish and impulsive about Gibberne at times.
      Before I could expostulate with him he had dashed forward, snatched the
      unfortunate animal out of visible existence, and was running violently
      with it towards the cliff of the Leas. It was most extraordinary. The
      little brute, you know, didn''t bark or wriggle or make the slightest sign
      of vitality. It kept quite stiffly in an attitude of somnolent repose, and
      Gibberne held it by the neck. It was like running about with a dog of
      wood. "Gibberne," I cried, "put it down!" Then I said something else. "If
      you run like that, Gibberne," I cried, "you''ll set your clothes on fire.
      Your linen trousers are going brown as it is!"

He clapped his hand on his thigh and stood hesitating on the verge.
      "Gibberne," I cried, coming up, "put it down. This heat is too much! It''s
      our running so! Two or three miles a second! Friction of the air!"

"Friction of the air," I shouted. "Friction of the air. Going too fast.
      Like meteorites and things. Too hot. And, Gibberne! Gibberne! I''m all over
      pricking and a sort of perspiration. You can see people stirring slightly.
      I believe the stuff''s working off! Put that dog down."

He stared at me, then at the band, the wheezy rattle of whose performance
      was certainly going faster. Then with a tremendous sweep of the arm he
      hurled the dog away from him and it went spinning upward, still inanimate,
      and hung at last over the grouped parasols of a knot of chattering people.
      Gibberne was gripping my elbow. "By Jove!" he cried, "I believe it is! A
      sort of hot pricking and—yes. That man''s moving his
      pocket-handkerchief! Perceptibly. We must get out of this sharp."

But we could not get out of it sharply enough. Luckily, perhaps! For we
      might have run, and if we had run we should, I believe, have burst into
      flames. Almost certainly we should have burst into flames! You know we had
      neither of us thought of that... But before we could even begin to run the
      action of the drug had ceased. It was the business of a minute fraction of
      a second. The effect of the New Accelerator passed like the drawing of a
      curtain, vanished in the movement of a hand. I heard Gibberne''s voice in
      infinite alarm. "Sit down," he said, and flop, down upon the turf at the
      edge of the Leas I sat—scorching as I sat. There is a patch of burnt
      grass there still where I sat down. The whole stagnation seemed to wake up
      as I did so, the disarticulated vibration of the band rushed together into
      a blast of music, the promenaders put their feet down and walked their
      ways, the papers and flags began flapping, smiles passed into words, the
      winker finished his wink and went on his way complacently, and all the
      seated people moved and spoke.

The whole world had come alive again, was going as fast as we were, or
      rather we were going no faster than the rest of the world. It was like
      slowing down as one comes into a railway station. Everything seemed to
      spin round for a second or two, I had the most transient feeling of
      nausea, and that was all. And the little dog, which had seemed to hang for
      a moment when the force of Gibberne''s arm was expended, fell with a swift
      acceleration clean through a lady''s parasol!

That was the saving of us. Unless it was for one corpulent old gentleman
      in a bath-chair, who certainly did start at the sight of us, and
      afterwards regarded us at intervals with a darkly suspicious eye, and,
      finally, I believe, said something to his nurse about us, I doubt if a
      solitary person remarked our sudden appearance among them. Plop! We must
      have appeared abruptly. We ceased to smoulder almost at once, though the
      turf beneath me was uncomfortably hot. The attention of every one—
      including even the Amusements'' Association band, which on this occasion,
      for the only time in its history, got out of tune—was arrested by
      the amazing fact, and the still more amazing yapping and uproar caused by
      the fact, that a respectable, over-fed lapdog sleeping quietly to the east
      of the bandstand should suddenly fall through the parasol of a lady on the
      west—in a slightly singed condition due to the extreme velocity of
      its movements through the air. In these absurd days, too, when we are all
      trying to be as psychic, and silly, and superstitious as possible! People
      got up and trod on other people, chairs were overturned, the Leas
      policeman ran. How the matter settled itself I do not know—we were
      much too anxious to disentangle ourselves from the affair and get out of
      range of the eye of the old gentleman in the bath-chair to make minute
      inquiries. As soon as we were sufficiently cool and sufficiently recovered
      from our giddiness and nausea and confusion of mind to do so we stood up,
      and skirting the crowd, directed our steps back along the road below the
      Metropole towards Gibberne''s house. But amidst the din I heard very
      distinctly the gentleman who had been sitting beside the lady of the
      ruptured sunshade using quite unjustifiable threats and language to one of
      those chair-attendants who have "Inspector" written on their caps: "If you
      didn''t throw the dog," he said, "who did?"

The sudden return of movement and familiar noises, and our natural anxiety
      about ourselves (our clothes were still dreadfully hot, and the fronts of
      the thighs of Gibberne''s white trousers were scorched a drabbish brown),
      prevented the minute observations I should have liked to make on all these
      things. Indeed, I really made no observations of any scientific value on
      that return. The bee, of course, had gone. I looked for that cyclist, but
      he was already out of sight as we came into the Upper Sandgate Road or
      hidden from us by traffic; the char-`-banc, however, with its
      people now all alive and stirring, was clattering along at a spanking pace
      almost abreast of the nearer church.

We noted, however, that the window-sill on which we had stepped in getting
      out of the house was slightly singed, and that the impressions of our feet
      on the gravel of the path were unusually deep.

So it was I had my first experience of the New Accelerator. Practically we
      had been running about and saying and doing all sorts of things in the
      space of a second or so of time. We had lived half an hour while the band
      had played, perhaps, two bars. But the effect it had upon us was that the
      whole world had stopped for our convenient inspection. Considering all
      things, and particularly considering our rashness in venturing out of the
      house, the experience might certainly have been much more disagreeable
      than it was. It showed, no doubt, that Gibberne has still much to learn
      before his preparation is a manageable convenience, but its practicability
      it certainly demonstrated beyond all cavil.

Since that adventure he has been steadily bringing its use under control,
      and I have several times, and without the slightest bad result, taken
      measured doses under his direction; though I must confess I have not yet
      ventured abroad again while under its influence. I may mention, for
      example, that this story has been written at one sitting and without
      interruption, except for the nibbling of some chocolate, by its means. I
      began at 6.25, and my watch is now very nearly at the minute past the
      half-hour. The convenience of securing a long, uninterrupted spell of work
      in the midst of a day full of engagements cannot be exaggerated. Gibberne
      is now working at the quantitative handling of his preparation, with
      especial reference to its distinctive effects upon different types of
      constitution. He then hopes to find a Retarder, with which to dilute its
      present rather excessive potency. The Retarder will, of course, have the
      reverse effect to the Accelerator; used alone it should enable the patient
      to spread a few seconds over many hours of ordinary time, and so to
      maintain an apathetic inaction, a glacier-like absence of alacrity, amidst
      the most animated or irritating surroundings. The two things together must
      necessarily work an entire revolution in civilised existence. It is the
      beginning of our escape from that Time Garment of which Carlyle speaks.
      While this Accelerator will enable us to concentrate ourselves with
      tremendous impact upon any moment or occasion that demands our utmost
      sense and vigour, the Retarder will enable us to pass in passive
      tranquillity through infinite hardship and tedium. Perhaps I am a little
      optimistic about the Retarder, which has indeed still to be discovered,
      but about the Accelerator there is no possible sort of doubt whatever. Its
      appearance upon the market in a convenient, controllable, and assimilable
      form is a matter of the next few months. It will be obtainable of all
      chemists and druggists, in small green bottles, at a high but, considering
      its extraordinary qualities, by no means excessive price. Gibberne''s
      Nervous Accelerator it will be called, and he hopes to be able to supply
      it in three strengths: one in 200, one in 900, and one in 2000,
      distinguished by yellow, pink, and white labels respectively.

No doubt its use renders a great number of very extraordinary things
      possible; for, of course, the most remarkable and, possibly, even criminal
      proceedings may be effected with impunity by thus dodging, as it were,
      into the interstices of time. Like all potent preparations, it will be
      liable to abuse. We have, however, discussed this aspect of the question
      very thoroughly, and we have decided that this is purely a matter of
      medical jurisprudence and altogether outside our province. We shall
      manufacture and sell the Accelerator, and as for the consequences—we
      shall see.

He sits not a dozen yards away. If I glance over my shoulder I can see
      him. And if I catch his eye—and usually I catch his eye—it
      meets me with an expression——

Confound his suspicion! If I wanted to tell on him I should have told long
      ago. I don''t tell and I don''t tell, and he ought to feel at his ease. As
      if anything so gross and fat as he could feel at ease! Who would believe
      me if I did tell?

He sits at one of the little club tables in the huge bay by the fire,
      stuffing. What is he stuffing? I glance judiciously, and catch him biting
      at a round of hot buttered teacake, with his eyes on me. Confound him!
      —with his eyes on me!

That settles it, Pyecraft! Since you will be abject, since you will
      behave as though I was not a man of honour, here, right under your
      embedded eyes, I write the thing down—the plain truth about
      Pyecraft. The man I helped, the man I shielded, and who has requited me by
      making my club unendurable, absolutely unendurable, with his liquid
      appeal, with the perpetual "don''t tell" of his looks.

Pyecraft——. I made the acquaintance of Pyecraft in this very
      smoking-room. I was a young, nervous new member, and he saw it. I was
      sitting all alone, wishing I knew more of the members, and suddenly he
      came, a great rolling front of chins and abdomina, towards me, and grunted
      and sat down in a chair close by me and wheezed for a space, and scraped
      for a space with a match and lit a cigar, and then addressed me. I forget
      what he said—something about the matches not lighting properly, and
      afterwards as he talked he kept stopping the waiters one by one as they
      went by, and telling them about the matches in that thin, fluty voice he
      has. But, anyhow, it was in some such way we began our talking.

He talked about various things and came round to games. And thence to my
      figure and complexion. "You ought to be a good cricketer," he said.
      I suppose I am slender, slender to what some people would call lean, and I
      suppose I am rather dark, still——I am not ashamed of having a
      Hindu great-grandmother, but, for all that, I don''t want casual strangers
      to see through me at a glance to her. So that I was set against
      Pyecraft from the beginning.

"I expect," he said, "you take no more exercise than I do, and probably
      you eat no less." (Like all excessively obese people he fancied he ate
      nothing.) "Yet"—and he smiled an oblique smile—"we differ."

And then he began to talk about his fatness and his fatness; all he did
      for his fatness and all he was going to do for his fatness; what people
      had advised him to do for his fatness and what he had heard of people
      doing for fatness similar to his. "A priori," he said, "one would
      think a question of nutrition could be answered by dietary and a question
      of assimilation by drugs." It was stifling. It was dumpling talk. It made
      me feel swelled to hear him.

One stands that sort of thing once in a way at a club, but a time came
      when I fancied I was standing too much. He took to me altogether too
      conspicuously. I could never go into the smoking-room but he would come
      wallowing towards me, and sometimes he came and gormandised round and
      about me while I had my lunch. He seemed at times almost to be clinging to
      me. He was a bore, but not so fearful a bore as to be limited to me and
      from the first there was something in his manner—almost as though he
      knew, almost as though he penetrated to the fact that I might—that
      there was a remote, exceptional chance in me that no one else presented.

"I''d give anything to get it down," he would say—"anything," and
      peer at me over his vast cheeks and pant. Poor old Pyecraft! He has just
      gonged; no doubt to order another buttered teacake!

He came to the actual thing one day. "Our Pharmacopoeia," he said, "our
      Western Pharmacopoeia, is anything but the last word of medical science.
      In the East, I''ve been told——"

I was quite suddenly angry with him. "Look here," I said, "who told you
      about my great-grandmother''s recipes?"

"Every time we''ve met for a week," I said—"and we''ve met pretty
      often— you''ve given me a broad hint or so about that little secret
      of mine."

"My great-grandmother''s recipes," I said, "are queer things to handle. My
      father was near making me promise——"

But after going so far Pyecraft was resolved I should go farther. I was
      always a little afraid if I tried his patience too much he would fall on
      me suddenly and smother me. I own I was weak. But I was also annoyed with
      Pyecraft. I had got to that state of feeling for him that disposed me to
      say, "Well, take the risk!" The little affair of Pattison to which
      I have alluded was a different matter altogether. What it was doesn''t
      concern us now, but I knew, anyhow, that the particular recipe I used then
      was safe. The rest I didn''t know so much about, and, on the whole, I was
      inclined to doubt their safety pretty completely.

That evening I took that queer, odd-scented sandal-wood box out of my
      safe, and turned the rustling skins over. The gentleman who wrote the
      recipes for my great-grandmother evidently had a weakness for skins of a
      miscellaneous origin, and his handwriting was cramped to the last degree.
      Some of the things are quite unreadable to me—though my family, with
      its Indian Civil Service associations, has kept up a knowledge of
      Hindustani from generation to generation—and none are absolutely
      plain sailing. But I found the one that I knew was there soon enough, and
      sat on the floor by my safe for some time looking at it.

"So far as I can make it out, this is a recipe for Loss of Weight. ("Ah!"
      said Pyecraft.) I''m not absolutely sure, but I think it''s that. And if you
      take my advice you''ll leave it alone. Because, you know—I blacken my
      blood in your interest, Pyecraft—my ancestors on that side were, so
      far as I can gather, a jolly queer lot. See?"

I leant back in my chair. My imagination made one mighty effort and fell
      flat within me. "What in Heaven''s name, Pyecraft," I asked, "do you think
      you''ll look like when you get thin?"

He was impervious to reason, I made him promise never to say a word to me
      about his disgusting fatness again whatever happened—never, and then
      I handed him that little piece of skin.

I did my best. After that we didn''t speak for a fortnight. Whenever he
      approached me I frowned and motioned him away, and he respected our
      compact, but at the end of the fortnight he was as fat as ever. And then
      he got a word in.

"I must speak," he said, "It isn''t fair. There''s something wrong. It''s
      done me no good. You''re not doing your great-grandmother justice."

"That," I said, "goes without saying in all my poor dear
      great-grandmother''s recipes. When condition or quality is not specified
      you must get the worst. She was drastic or nothing... And there''s one or
      two possible alternatives to some of these other things. You got fresh
      rattlesnake venom?"

"Yes. H''m. Well, I''ll write the alternatives down. So far as I know the
      language, the spelling of this recipe is particularly atrocious.
      By-the-by, dog here probably means pariah dog."

For a month after that I saw Pyecraft constantly at the club and as fat
      and anxious as ever. He kept our treaty, but at times he broke the spirit
      of it by shaking his head despondently. Then one day in the cloakroom he
      said, "Your great-grandmother——"

I could have fancied he had desisted, and I saw him one day talking to
      three new members about his fatness as though he was in search of other
      recipes. And then, quite unexpectedly, his telegram came.

"Mr. Formalyn!" bawled a page-boy under my nose, and I took the telegram
      and opened it at once.

"H''m," said I, and to tell the truth I was so pleased at the
      rehabilitation of my great-grandmother''s reputation this evidently
      promised that I made a most excellent lunch.

I got Pyecraft''s address from the hall porter. Pyecraft inhabited the
      upper half of a house in Bloomsbury, and I went there so soon as I had
      done my coffee and Trappistine. I did not wait to finish my cigar.

"He shouldn''t have tried it, anyhow," I said to myself. "A man who eats
      like a pig ought to look like a pig."

An obviously worthy woman, with an anxious face and a carelessly placed
      cap, came and surveyed me through the lattice.

"''E said you was to come in if you came," she said, and regarded me,
      making no motion to show me anywhere. And then, confidentially, "''E''s
      locked in, sir."

"Locked ''imself in yesterday morning and ''asn''t let any one in since, sir.
      And ever and again swearing. Oh, my!"

She shook her head sadly. "''E keeps on calling for vittles, sir. ''Eavy
      vittles ''e wants. I get ''im what I can. Pork ''e''s had, sooit puddin'',
      sossiges, noo bread. Everythink like that. Left outside, if you please,
      and me go away. ''E''s eatin'', sir, somethink awful."

Then I could hear a curious pattering upon the door, almost like some one
      feeling for the handle in the dark, and Pyecraft''s familiar grunts.

I never had such a shock in my life. There was his sitting-room in a state
      of untidy disorder, plates and dishes among the books and writing things,
      and several chairs overturned, but Pyecraft——

There he was, right up close to the cornice in the corner by the door, as
      though some one had glued him to the ceiling. His face was anxious and
      angry. He panted and gesticulated. "Shut the door," he said. "If that
      woman gets hold of it——"

And then abruptly I realised that he was not holding on at all, that he
      was floating up there—just as a gas-filled bladder might have
      floated in the same position. He began a struggle to thrust himself away
      from the ceiling and to clamber down the wall to me. "It''s that
      prescription," he panted, as he did so. "Your great-gran——"

He took hold of a framed engraving rather carelessly as he spoke and it
      gave way, and he flew back to the ceiling again, while the picture smashed
      on to the sofa. Bump he went against the ceiling, and I knew then why he
      was all over white on the more salient curves and angles of his person. He
      tried again more carefully, coming down by way of the mantel.

It was really a most extraordinary spectacle, that great, fat,
      apoplectic-looking man upside down and trying to get from the ceiling to
      the floor. "That prescription," he said. "Too successful."

"By Jove, Pyecraft," said I, "what you wanted was a cure for fatness! But
      you always called it weight. You would call it weight."

Somehow I was extremely delighted. I quite liked Pyecraft for the time.
      "Let me help you!" I said, and took his hand and pulled him down. He
      kicked about, trying to get foothold somewhere. It was very like holding a
      flag on a windy day.

"That table," he said, pointing, "is solid mahogany and very heavy. If you
      can put me under that——"

I did, and there he wallowed about like a captive balloon, while I stood
      on his hearthrug and talked to him.

I should fancy they all did. Whether one regards the ingredients or the
      probable compound or the possible results, almost all my
      great-grandmother''s remedies appear to me at least to be extraordinarily
      uninviting. For my own part——

"I held my nose," he explained. "And then I kept on getting lighter and
      lighter—and helpless, you know."

"There''s one thing pretty evident," I said, "that you mustn''t do. If you
      go out of doors you''ll go up and up." I waved an arm upward. "They''d have
      to send Santos-Dumont after you to bring you down again."

And then there was another burst of passion, and he kicked out at adjacent
      chairs and banged the floor. He behaved just as I should have expected a
      great, fat, self-indulgent man to behave under trying circumstances—that
      is to say, very badly. He spoke of me and of my great-grandmother with an
      utter want of discretion.

And generously disregarding the insults he was putting upon me, I sat down
      in his armchair and began to talk to him in a sober, friendly fashion.

I pointed out to him that this was a trouble he had brought upon himself,
      and that it had almost an air of poetical justice. He had eaten too much.
      This he disputed, and for a time we argued the point.

He became noisy and violent, so I desisted from this aspect of his lesson.
      "And then," said I, "you committed the sin of euphuism. You called it, not
      Fat, which is just and inglorious, but Weight. You——"

I suggested he should adapt himself to his new conditions. So we came to
      the really sensible part of the business. I suggested that it would not be
      difficult for him to learn to walk about on the ceiling with his hands——

But that was no great difficulty. It was quite possible, I pointed out, to
      make a shake-up under a wire mattress, fasten the under things on with
      tapes, and have a blanket, sheet, and coverlet to button at the side. He
      would have to confide in his housekeeper, I said; and after some
      squabbling he agreed to that. (Afterwards it was quite delightful to see
      the beautifully matter-of-fact way with which the good lady took all these
      amazing inversions.) He could have a library ladder in his room, and all
      his meals could be laid on the top of his bookcase. We also hit on an
      ingenious device by which he could get to the floor whenever he wanted,
      which was simply to put the British Encyclopaedia (tenth edition)
      on the top of his open shelves. He just pulled out a couple of volumes and
      held on, and down he came. And we agreed there must be iron staples along
      the skirting, so that he could cling to those whenever he wanted to get
      about the room on the lower level.

As we got on with the thing I found myself almost keenly interested. It
      was I who called in the housekeeper and broke matters to her, and it was I
      chiefly who fixed up the inverted bed. In fact, I spent two whole days at
      his flat. I am a handy, interfering sort of man with a screw-driver, and I
      made all sorts of ingenious adaptations for him—ran a wire to bring
      his bells within reach, turned all his electric lights up instead of down,
      and so on. The whole affair was extremely curious and interesting to me,
      and it was delightful to think of Pyecraft like some great, fat blow-fly,
      crawling about on his ceiling and clambering round the lintel of his doors
      from one room to another, and never, never, never coming to the club any
      more...

Then, you know, my fatal ingenuity got the better of me. I was sitting by
      his fire drinking his whisky, and he was up in his favourite corner by the
      cornice, tacking a Turkey carpet to the ceiling, when the idea struck me.
      "By Jove, Pyecraft!" I said, "all this is totally unnecessary."

And before I could calculate the complete consequences of my notion I
      blurted it out. "Lead underclothing," said I, and the mischief was done.

I gave him the whole secret before I saw where it would take me. "Buy
      sheet lead," I said, "stamp it into discs. Sew ''em all over your
      underclothes until you have enough. Have lead-soled boots, carry a bag of
      solid lead, and the thing is done! Instead of being a prisoner here you
      may go abroad again, Pyecraft; you may travel——"

A still happier idea came to me. "You need never fear a shipwreck. All you
      need do is just slip off some or all of your clothes, take the necessary
      amount of luggage in your hand, and float up in the air——"

In his emotion he dropped the tack-hammer within an ace of my head. "By
      Jove!" he said, "I shall be able to come back to the club again."

He did. He does. There he sits behind me now, stuffing—as I live!—a
      third go of buttered teacake. And no one in the whole world knows—except
      his housekeeper and me—-that he weighs practically nothing; that he
      is a mere boring mass of assimilatory matter, mere clouds in clothing, niente,
      nefas, the most inconsiderable of men. There he sits watching until I
      have done this writing. Then, if he can, he will waylay me. He will come
      billowing up to me...

He will tell me over again all about it, how it feels, how it doesn''t
      feel, how he sometimes hopes it is passing off a little. And always
      somewhere in that fat, abundant discourse he will say, "The secret''s
      keeping, eh? If any one knew of it—I should be so ashamed... Makes a
      fellow look such a fool, you know. Crawling about on a ceiling and all
      that..."

And now to elude Pyecraft, occupying, as he does, an admirable strategic
      position between me and the door.

I had seen the Magic Shop from afar several times; I had passed it once or
      twice, a shop window of alluring little objects, magic balls, magic hens,
      wonderful cones, ventriloquist dolls, the material of the basket trick,
      packs of cards that looked all right, and all that sort of thing,
      but never had I thought of going in until one day, almost without warning,
      Gip hauled me by my finger right up to the window, and so conducted
      himself that there was nothing for it but to take him in. I had not
      thought the place was there, to tell the truth—a modest-sized
      frontage in Regent Street, between the picture shop and the place where
      the chicks run about just out of patent incubators,—but there it was
      sure enough. I had fancied it was down nearer the Circus, or round the
      corner in Oxford Street, or even in Holborn; always over the way and a
      little inaccessible it had been, with something of the mirage in its
      position; but here it was now quite indisputably, and the fat end of Gip''s
      pointing finger made a noise upon the glass.

"If I was rich," said Gip, dabbing a finger at the Disappearing Egg, "I''d
      buy myself that. And that"—which was The Crying Baby, Very Human—"and
      that," which was a mystery, and called, so a neat card asserted, "Buy One
      and Astonish Your Friends."

"Anything," said Gip, "will disappear under one of those cones. I have
      read about it in a book.

"And there, dadda, is the Vanishing Halfpenny—only they''ve put it
      this way up so''s we can''t see how it''s done."

Gip, dear boy, inherits his mother''s breeding, and he did not propose to
      enter the shop or worry in any way; only, you know, quite unconsciously,
      he lugged my finger doorward, and he made his interest clear.

"It''s less than a hundred days to your birthday, Gibbles," I said, and
      laid my hand on the door-handle.

It was no common shop this; it was a magic shop, and all the prancing
      precedence Gip would have taken in the matter of mere toys was wanting. He
      left the burthen of the conversation to me.

It was a little, narrow shop, not very well lit, and the door-bell pinged
      again with a plaintive note as we closed it behind us. For a moment or so
      we were alone and could glance about us. There was a tiger in papier-machi
      on the glass case that covered, the low counter—a grave, kind-eyed
      tiger that waggled his head in a methodical manner; there were several
      crystal spheres, a china hand holding magic cards, a stock of magic
      fish-bowls in various sizes, and an immodest magic hat that shamelessly
      displayed its springs. On the floor were magic mirrors; one to draw you
      out long and thin, one to swell your head and vanish your legs, and one to
      make you short and fat like a draught; and while, we were laughing at
      these the shopman, as I suppose, came in.

At any rate, there he was behind the counter—a curious, sallow, dark
      man, with one ear larger than the other and a chin like the toe-cap of a
      boot.

"What can we have the pleasure?" he said, spreading his long magic fingers
      on the glass case; and so with a start we were aware of him.

"Anything amusing?" said I. — "Um!" said the shopman, and scratched
      his head for a moment as if thinking. Then, quite distinctly, he drew from
      his head a glass ball. "Something in this way?" he said, and held it out.

The action was unexpected. I had seen the trick done at entertainments
      endless times before—it''s part of the common stock of conjurers—but
      I had not expected it here. "That''s good," I said, with a laugh.

"We make no charge for glass balls," said the shopman politely. "We get
      them"—he picked one out of his elbow as he spoke—"free." He
      produced another from the back of his neck, and laid it beside its
      predecessor on the counter. Gip regarded his glass ball sagely, then
      directed a look of inquiry at the two on the counter, and finally brought
      his round-eyed scrutiny to the shopman, who smiled. "You may have those
      two," said the shopman, "and, if you don''t mind one from my mouth.
      So!"

Gip counselled me mutely for a moment, and then in a profound silence put
      away the four balls, resumed my reassuring finger, and nerved himself for
      the next event.

I laughed in the manner of one who subscribes to a jest. "Instead of going
      to the wholesale shop," I said. "Of course, it''s cheaper."

"In a way," the shopman said. "Though we pay in the end. But not so
      heavily—as people suppose... Our larger tricks, and our daily
      provisions and all the other things we want, we get out of that hat... And
      you know, sir, if you''ll excuse my saying it, there isn''t a
      wholesale shop, not for Genuine Magic goods, sir. I don''t know if you
      noticed our inscription—the Genuine Magic Shop." He drew a business
      card from his cheek and handed it to me. "Genuine," he said, with his
      finger on the word, and added, "There is absolutely no deception, sir."

He turned to Gip with a smile of remarkable affability. "You, you know,
      are the Right Sort of Boy."

I was surprised at his knowing that, because, in the interests of
      discipline, we keep it rather a secret even at home; but Gip received it
      in unflinching silence, keeping a steadfast eye on him.

And, as if by way of illustration, there came a rattling at the door, and
      a squeaking little voice could be faintly heard. "Nyar! I warn ''a
      go in there, dadda, I WARN ''a go in there. Ny-a-a-ah!" and then the
      accents of a downtrodden parent, urging consolations and propitiations.
      "It''s locked, Edward," he said.

"But it isn''t," said I. — "It is, sir," said the shopman, "always—for
      that sort of child," and as he spoke we had a glimpse of the other
      youngster, a little, white face, pallid from sweet-eating and over-sapid
      food, and distorted by evil passions, a ruthless little egotist, pawing at
      the enchanted pane. "It''s no good, sir," said the shopman, as I moved,
      with my natural helpfulness, doorward, and presently the spoilt child was
      carried off howling.

"Magic!" said the shopman, with a careless wave of the hand, and behold!
      sparks of coloured fire flew out of his fingers and vanished into the
      shadows of the shop.

"You were saying," he said, addressing himself to Gip, "before you came
      in, that you would like one of our ''Buy One and Astonish your Friends''
      boxes?"

And leaning over the counter—he really had an extraordinary long
      body— this amazing person produced the article in the customary
      conjurer''s manner. "Paper," he said, and took a sheet out of the empty hat
      with the springs; "string," and behold his mouth was a string box, from
      which he drew an unending thread, which when he had tied his parcel he bit
      off— and, it seemed to me, swallowed the ball of string. And then he
      lit a candle at the nose of one of the ventriloquist''s dummies, stuck one
      of his fingers (which had become sealing-wax red) into the flame, and so
      sealed the parcel. "Then there was the Disappearing Egg," he remarked, and
      produced one from within my coat-breast and packed it, and also The Crying
      Baby, Very Human. I handed each parcel to Gip as it was ready, and he
      clasped them to his chest.

He said very little, but his eyes were eloquent; the clutch of his arms
      was eloquent. He was the playground of unspeakable emotions. These, you
      know, were real Magics.

Then, with a start, I discovered something moving about in my hat—
      something soft and jumpy. I whipped it off, and a ruffled pigeon—no
      doubt a confederate—dropped out and ran on the counter, and went, I
      fancy, into a cardboard box behind the papier-machi tiger.

"Tut, tut!" said the shopman, dexterously relieving, me of my headdress;
      "careless bird, and—as I live—nesting!"

He shook my hat, and shook out into his extended hand, two or three eggs,
      a large marble, a watch, about half a dozen of the inevitable glass balls,
      and then crumpled, crinkled paper, more and more and more, talking all the
      time of the way in which people neglect to brush their hats inside
      as well as out—politely, of course, but with a certain personal
      application. "All sorts of things accumulate, sir... Not you, of
      course, in particular... Nearly every customer... Astonishing what they
      carry about with them..." The crumpled paper rose and billowed on the
      counter more and more and more, until he was nearly hidden from us, until
      he was altogether hidden, and still his voice went on and on. "We none of
      us know what the fair semblance of a human being may conceal, Sir. Are we
      all then no better than brushed exteriors, whited sepulchres——-"

His voice stopped—exactly like when you hit a neighbour''s gramophone
      with a well-aimed brick, the same instant silence—and the rustle of
      the paper stopped, and everything was still...

I stared at Gip, and Gip stared at me, and there were our distortions in
      the magic mirrors, looking very rum, and grave, and quiet...

I led Gip round the head-wagging tiger, and what do you think there was
      behind the counter? No one at all! Only my hat on the floor, and a common
      conjurer''s lop-eared white rabbit lost in meditation, and looking as
      stupid and crumpled as only a conjurer''s rabbit can do. I resumed my hat,
      and the rabbit lolloped a lollop or so out of my way.

"So should I," I said to myself, "if the counter wouldn''t suddenly extend
      itself to shut one off from the door." But I didn''t call Gip''s attention
      to that. "Pussy!" he said, with a hand out to the rabbit as it came
      lolloping past us; "Pussy, do Gip a magic!" and his eyes followed it as it
      squeezed through a door I had certainly not remarked a moment before. Then
      this door opened wider, and the man with one ear larger than the other
      appeared again. He was smiling still, but his eye met mine with something
      between amusement and defiance. "You''d like to see our showroom, sir," he
      said, with an innocent suavity. Gip tugged my finger forward. I glanced at
      the counter and met the shopman''s eye again. I was beginning to think the
      magic just a little too genuine. "We haven''t very much time," I
      said. But somehow we were inside the showroom before I could finish that.

"All goods of the same quality," said the shopman, rubbing his flexible
      hands together, "and that is the Best. Nothing in the place that isn''t
      genuine Magic, and warranted thoroughly rum. Excuse me, sir!"

I felt him pull at something that clung to my coat-sleeve, and then I saw
      he held a little, wriggling red demon by the tail—the little
      creature bit and fought and tried to get at his hand—and in a moment
      he tossed it carelessly behind a counter. No doubt the thing was only an
      image of twisted indiarubber, but for the moment—! And his gesture
      was exactly that of a man who handles some petty biting bit of vermin. I
      glanced at Gip, but Gip was looking at a magic rocking-horse. I was glad
      he hadn''t seen the thing. "I say," I said, in an undertone, and indicating
      Gip and the red demon with my eyes, "you haven''t many things like that
      about, have you?"

"None of ours! Probably brought it with you," said the shopman—also
      in an undertone, and with a more dazzling smile than ever. "Astonishing
      what people will, carry about with them unawares!" And then to Gip,
      "Do you see anything you fancy here?"

He turned to this astonishing tradesman with mingled confidence and
      respect. "Is that a Magic Sword?" he said.

"A Magic Toy Sword. It neither bends, breaks, nor cuts the fingers. It
      renders the bearer invincible in battle against any one under eighteen.
      Half a crown to seven and sixpence, according to size. These panoplies on
      cards are for juvenile knights-errant and very useful—shield of
      safety, sandals of swiftness, helmet of invisibility."

I tried to find out what they cost, but the shopman did not heed me. He
      had got Gip now; he had got him away from my finger; he had embarked upon
      the exposition of all his confounded stock, and nothing was going to stop
      him. Presently I saw with a qualm of distrust and something very like
      jealousy that Gip had hold of this person''s finger as usually he has hold
      of mine. No doubt the fellow was interesting, I thought, and had an
      interestingly faked lot of stuff, really good faked stuff, still——

I wandered after them, saying very little, but keeping an eye on this
      prestidigital fellow. After all, Gip was enjoying it. And no doubt when
      the time came to go we should be able to go quite easily.

It was a long, rambling place, that showroom, a gallery broken up by
      stands and stalls and pillars, with archways leading off to other
      departments, in which the queerest-looking assistants loafed and stared at
      one, and with perplexing mirrors and curtains. So perplexing, indeed, were
      these that I was presently unable to make out the door by which we had
      come.

The shopman showed Gip magic trains that ran without steam or clockwork,
      just as you set the signals, and then some very, very valuable boxes of
      soldiers that all came alive directly you took off the lid and said——I
      myself haven''t a very quick ear, and it was a tongue-twisting sound, but
      Gip—he has his mother''s ear—got it in no time. "Bravo!" said
      the shopman, putting the men back into the box unceremoniously and handing
      it to Gip. "Now," said the shopman, and in a moment Gip had made them all
      alive again.

"We''ll take that box," said I, "unless you charge its full value. In which
      case it would need a Trust Magnate——"

"Dear heart! No!" and the shopman swept the little men back again,
      shut the lid, waved the box in the air, and there it was, in brown paper,
      tied up and—with Gip''s full name and address on the paper!

After that he fell to showing Gip tricks, odd tricks, and still odder the
      way they were done. He explained them, he turned them inside out, and
      there was the dear little chap nodding his busy bit of a head in the
      sagest manner.

I did not attend as well as I might. "Hey, presto!" said the Magic
      Shopman, and then would come the clear, small "Hey, presto!" of the boy.
      But I was distracted by other things. It was being borne in upon me just
      how tremendously rum this place was; it was, so to speak, inundated by a
      sense of rumness. There was something a little rum about the fixtures
      even, about the ceiling, about the floor, about the casually distributed
      chairs. I had a queer feeling that whenever I wasn''t looking at them
      straight they went askew, and moved about, and played a noiseless
      puss-in-the-corner behind my back. And the cornice had a serpentine design
      with masks—masks altogether too expressive for proper plaster.

Then abruptly my attention was caught by one of the odd-looking
      assistants. He was some way off and evidently unaware of my presence—I
      saw a sort of three-quarter length of him over a pile of toys and through
      an arch—and, you know, he was leaning against a pillar in an idle
      sort of way doing the most horrid things with his features! The particular
      horrid thing he did was with his nose. He did it just as though he was
      idle and wanted to amuse himself. First of all it was a short, blobby
      nose, and then suddenly he shot it out like a telescope, and then out it
      flew and became thinner and thinner until it was like a long, red flexible
      whip. Like a thing in a nightmare it was! He flourished it about and flung
      it forth as a fly-fisher flings his line.

My instant thought was that Gip mustn''t see him. I turned about, and there
      was Gip quite preoccupied with the shopman, and thinking no evil. They
      were whispering together and looking at me. Gip was standing on a little
      stool, and the shopman was holding a sort of big drum in his hand.

I saw what was up directly. "Take that off," I cried, "this instant!
      You''ll frighten the boy. Take it off!"

The shopman with the unequal ears did so without a word, and held the big
      cylinder towards me to show its emptiness. And the little stool was
      vacant! In that instant my boy had utterly disappeared!...

You know, perhaps, that sinister something that comes like a hand out of
      the unseen and grips your heart about. You know it takes your common self
      away and leaves you tense and deliberate, neither slow nor hasty, neither
      angry nor afraid. So it was with me.

I put out my hand to grip him, and he eluded me by a dexterous movement. I
      snatched again, and he turned from me and pushed open a door to escape.
      "Stop!" I said, and he laughed, receding. I leapt after him—into
      utter darkness.

I was in Regent Street, and I had collided with a decent-looking working
      man; and a yard away, perhaps, and looking a little perplexed with
      himself, was Gip. There was some sort of apology, and then Gip had turned
      and come to me with a bright little smile, as though for a moment he had
      missed me.

For the second I was rather at a loss. I stared round to see the door of
      the Magic Shop, and, behold, it was not there! There was no door, no shop,
      nothing, only the common pilaster between the shop where they sell
      pictures and the window with the chicks! ...

I did the only thing possible in that mental tumult; I walked straight to
      the kerbstone and held up my umbrella for a cab.

I helped him in, recalled my address with an effort, and got in also.
      Something unusual proclaimed itself in my tail-coat pocket, and I felt and
      discovered a glass ball. With a petulant expression I flung it into the
      street.

I came round with that to the problem of just how the whole thing had
      seemed to him. He looked completely undamaged—so far, good; he was
      neither scared nor unhinged, he was simply tremendously satisfied with the
      afternoon''s entertainment, and there in his arms were the four parcels.

He received this with his usual stoicism, and for a moment I was sorry I
      was his father and not his mother, and so couldn''t suddenly there, coram
      publico, in our hansom, kiss him. After all, I thought, the thing
      wasn''t so very bad.

But it was only when we opened the parcels that I really began to be
      reassured. Three of them contained boxes of soldiers, quite ordinary lead
      soldiers, but of so good a quality as to make Gip altogether forget that
      originally these parcels had been Magic Tricks of the only genuine sort,
      and the fourth contained a kitten, a little living white kitten, in
      excellent health and appetite and temper.

I saw this unpacking with a sort of provisional relief. I hung about in
      the nursery for quite an unconscionable time...

That happened six months ago. And now I am beginning to believe it is all
      right. The kitten had only the magic natural to all kittens, and the
      soldiers seemed as steady a company as any colonel could desire. And Gip——?

But I went so far as this one day. I said, "How would you like your
      soldiers to come alive, Gip, and march about by themselves?"

I displayed no unbecoming surprise, and since then I have taken occasion
      to drop in upon him once or twice, unannounced, when the soldiers were
      about, but so far I have never discovered them performing in anything like
      a magical manner...

There''s also a question of finance. I have an incurable habit of paying
      bills. I have been up and down Regent Street several times looking for
      that shop. I am inclined to think, indeed, that in that matter honour is
      satisfied, and that, since Gip''s name and address are known to them, I may
      very well leave it to these people, whoever they may be, to send in their
      bill in their own time.

When Captain Gerilleau received instructions to take his new gunboat, the
      Benjamin Constant, to Badama on the Batemo arm of the Guaramadema
      and there assist the inhabitants against a plague of ants, he suspected
      the authorities of mockery. His promotion had been romantic and irregular,
      the affections of a prominent Brazilian lady and the captain''s liquid eyes
      had played a part in the process, and the Diario and O Futuro
      had been lamentably disrespectful in their comments. He felt he was to
      give further occasion for disrespect.

He was a Creole, his conceptions of etiquette and discipline were
      pure-blooded Portuguese, and it was only to Holroyd, the Lancashire
      engineer who had come over with the boat, and as an exercise in the use of
      English—his "th" sounds were very uncertain—that he opened his
      heart.

"It is in effect," he said, "to make me absurd! What can a man do against
      ants? Dey come, dey go."

The captain smoked fretfully for a time. "Dese tings ''ave to happen," he
      said at last. "What is it? Plagues of ants and suchlike as God wills. Dere
      was a plague in Trinidad—the little ants that carry leaves. Orl der
      orange-trees, all der mangoes! What does it matter? Sometimes ant armies
      come into your houses—fighting ants; a different sort. You go and
      they clean the house. Then you come back again;—the house is clean,
      like new! No cockroaches, no fleas, no jiggers in the floor."

Afterwards he reopened the subject. "My dear ''Olroyd, what am I to do
      about dese infernal ants?"

The captain reflected. "It is ridiculous," he said. But in the afternoon
      he put on his full uniform and went ashore, and jars and boxes came back
      to the ship and subsequently he did. And Holroyd sat on deck in the
      evening coolness and smoked profoundly and marvelled at Brazil. They were
      six days up the Amazon, some hundreds of miles from the ocean, and east
      and west of him there was a horizon like the sea, and to the south nothing
      but a sand-bank island with some tufts of scrub. The water was always
      running like a sluice, thick with dirt, animated with crocodiles and
      hovering birds, and fed by some inexhaustible source of tree trunks; and
      the waste of it, the headlong waste of it, filled his soul. The town of
      Alemquer, with its meagre church, its thatched sheds for houses, its
      discoloured ruins of ampler days, seemed a little thing lost in this
      wilderness of Nature, a sixpence dropped on Sahara. He was a young man,
      this was his first sight of the tropics, he came straight from England,
      where Nature is hedged, ditched, and drained, into the perfection of
      submission, and he had suddenly discovered the insignificance of man. For
      six days they had been steaming up from the sea by unfrequented channels;
      and man had been as rare as a rare butterfly. One saw one day a canoe,
      another day a distant station, the next no men at all. He began to
      perceive that man is indeed a rare animal, having but a precarious hold
      upon this land.

He perceived it more clearly as the days passed, and he made his devious
      way to the Batemo, in the company of this remarkable commander, who ruled
      over one big gun, and was forbidden to waste his ammunition. Holroyd was
      learning Spanish industriously, but he was still in the present tense and
      substantive stage of speech, and the only other person who had any words
      of English was a negro stoker, who had them all wrong. The second in
      command was a Portuguese, da Cunha, who spoke French, but it was a
      different sort of French from the French Holroyd had learnt in Southport,
      and their intercourse was confined to politenesses and simple propositions
      about the weather. And the weather, like everything else in this amazing
      new world, the weather had no human aspect, and was hot by night and hot
      by day, and the air steam, even the wind was hot steam, smelling of
      vegetation in decay: and the alligators and the strange birds, the flies
      of many sorts and sizes, the beetles, the ants, the snakes and monkeys
      seemed to wonder what man was doing in an atmosphere that had no gladness
      in its sunshine and no coolness in its night. To wear clothing was
      intolerable, but to cast it aside was to scorch by day, and expose an
      ampler area to the mosquitoes by night; to go on deck by day was to be
      blinded by glare and to stay below was to suffocate. And in the daytime
      came certain flies, extremely clever and noxious about one''s wrist and
      ankle. Captain Gerilleau, who was Holroyd''s sole distraction from these
      physical distresses, developed into a formidable bore, telling the simple
      story of his heart''s affections day by day, a string of anonymous women,
      as if he was telling beads. Sometimes he suggested sport, and they shot at
      alligators, and at rare intervals they came to human aggregations in the
      waste of trees, and stayed for a day or so, and drank and sat about, and,
      one night, danced with Creole girls, who found Holroyd''s poor elements of
      Spanish, without either past tense or future, amply sufficient for their
      purposes. But these were mere luminous chinks in the long grey passage of
      the streaming river, up which the throbbing engines beat. A certain
      liberal heathen deity, in the shape of a demi-john, held seductive court
      aft, and, it is probable, forward.

But Gerilleau learnt things about the ants, more things and more, at this
      stopping-place and that, and became interested in his mission.

"Dey are a new sort of ant," he said. "We have got to be—what do you
      call it?—entomologie? Big. Five centimetres! Some bigger! It is
      ridiculous. We are like the monkeys—-sent to pick insects... But dey
      are eating up the country."

He burst out indignantly. "Suppose—suddenly, there are complications
      with Europe. Here am I—soon we shall be above the Rio Negro—and
      my gun, useless!"

"Dose people who were dere at de dancing place, dey ''ave come down. Dey
      ''ave lost all they got. De ants come to deir house one afternoon. Everyone
      run out. You know when de ants come one must—everyone runs out and
      they go over the house. If you stayed they''d eat you. See? Well, presently
      dey go back; dey say, ''The ants ''ave gone.'' ... De ants ''aven''t
      gone. Dey try to go in—de son, ''e goes in. De ants fight."

"Bite ''im. Presently he comes out again—screaming and running. He
      runs past them to the river. See? He gets into de water and drowns de ants—
      yes." Gerilleau paused, brought his liquid eyes close to Holroyd''s face,
      tapped Holroyd''s knee with his knuckle. "That night he dies, just as if he
      was stung by a snake."

"Who knows?" Gerilleau shrugged his shoulders. "Perhaps they bit him
      badly... When I joined dis service I joined to fight men. Dese things,
      dese ants, dey come and go. It is no business for men."

After that he talked frequently of the ants to Holroyd, and whenever they
      chanced to drift against any speck of humanity in that waste of water and
      sunshine and distant trees, Holroyd''s improving knowledge of the language
      enabled him to recognise the ascendant word Sa|ba, more and more
      completely dominating the whole.

He perceived the ants were becoming interesting, and the nearer he drew to
      them the more interesting they became. Gerilleau abandoned his old themes
      almost suddenly, and the Portuguese lieutenant became a conversational
      figure; he knew something about the leaf-cutting ant, and expanded his
      knowledge. Gerilleau sometimes rendered what he had to tell to Holroyd. He
      told of the little workers that swarm and fight, and the big workers that
      command and rule, and how these latter always crawled to the neck and how
      their bites drew blood. He told how they cut leaves and made fungus beds,
      and how their nests in Caracas are sometimes a hundred yards across. Two
      days the three men spent disputing whether ants have eyes. The discussion
      grew dangerously heated on the second afternoon, and Holroyd saved the
      situation by going ashore in a boat to catch ants and see. He captured
      various specimens and returned, and some had eyes and some hadn''t. Also,
      they argued, do ants bite or sting?

"Dese ants," said Gerilleau, after collecting information at a rancho,
      "have big eyes. They don''t run about blind—not as most ants do. No!
      Dey get in corners and watch what you do."

"Yes. Dey sting. Dere is poison in the sting." He meditated. "I do not see
      what men can do against ants. Dey come and go."

Past Tamandu there is a long low coast of eighty miles without any
      population, and then one comes to the confluence of the main river and the
      Batemo arm like a great lake, and then the forest came nearer, came at
      last intimately near. The character of the channel changes, snags abound,
      and the Benjamin Constant moored by a cable that night, under the
      very shadow of dark trees. For the first time for many days came a spell
      of coolness, and Holroyd and Gerilleau sat late, smoking cigars and
      enjoying this delicious sensation. Gerilleau''s mind was full of ants and
      what they could do. He decided to sleep at last, and lay down on a
      mattress on deck, a man hopelessly perplexed, his last words, when he
      already seemed asleep, were to ask, with a flourish of despair, "What can
      one do with ants?... De whole thing is absurd."

He sat on the bulwark and listened to the little changes in Gerilleau''s
      breathing until he was fast asleep, and then the ripple and lap of the
      stream took his mind, and brought back that sense of immensity that had
      been growing upon him since first he had left Para and come up the river.
      The monitor showed but one small light, and there was first a little
      talking forward and then stillness. His eyes went from the dim black
      outlines of the middle works of the gunboat towards the bank, to the black
      overwhelming mysteries of forest, lit now and then by a fire-fly, and
      never still from the murmur of alien and mysterious activities...

It was the inhuman immensity of this land that astonished and oppressed
      him. He knew the skies were empty of men, the stars were specks in an
      incredible vastness of space; he knew the ocean was enormous and
      untamable, but in England he had come to think of the land as man''s. In
      England it is indeed man''s, the wild things live by sufferance, grow on
      lease, everywhere the roads, the fences, and absolute security runs. In an
      atlas, too, the land is man''s, and all coloured to show his claim to it—
      in vivid contrast to the universal independent blueness of the sea. He had
      taken it for granted that a day would come when everywhere about the
      earth, plough and culture, light tramways and good roads, an ordered
      security, would prevail. But now, he doubted.

This forest was interminable, it had an air of being invincible, and Man
      seemed at best an infrequent precarious intruder. One travelled for miles,
      amidst the still, silent struggle of giant trees, of strangulating
      creepers, of assertive flowers, everywhere the alligator, the turtle, and
      endless varieties of birds and insects seemed at home, dwelt irreplaceably—but
      man, man at most held a footing upon resentful clearings, fought weeds,
      fought beasts and insects for the barest foothold, fell a prey to snake
      and beast, insect and fever, and was presently carried away. In many
      places down the river he had been manifestly driven back, this deserted
      creek or that preserved the name of a casa, and here and there
      ruinous white walls and a shattered tower enforced the lesson. The puma,
      the jaguar, were more the masters here...

In a few miles of this forest there must be more ants than there are men
      in the whole world! This seemed to Holroyd a perfectly new idea. In a few
      thousand years men had emerged from barbarism to a stage of civilisation
      that made them feel lords of the future and masters of the earth! But what
      was to prevent the ants evolving also? Such ants as one knew lived in
      little communities of a few thousand individuals, made no concerted
      efforts against the greater world. But they had a language, they had an
      intelligence! Why should things stop at that any more than men had stopped
      at the barbaric stage? Suppose presently the ants began to store
      knowledge, just as men had done by means of books and records, use
      weapons, form great empires, sustain a planned and organised war?

Things came back to him that Gerilleau had gathered about these ants they
      were approaching. They used a poison like the poison of snakes. They
      obeyed greater leaders even as the leaf-cutting ants do. They were
      carnivorous, and where they came they stayed...

The forest was very still. The water lapped incessantly against the side.
      About the lantern overhead there eddied a noiseless whirl of phantom
      moths.

Gerilleau stirred in the darkness and sighed. "What can one do?" he
      murmured, and turned over and was still again.

II. — The next morning Holroyd learnt they were within forty
      kilometres of Badama, and his interest in the banks intensified. He came
      up whenever an opportunity offered to examine his surroundings. He could
      see no signs of human occupation whatever, save for a weedy ruin of a
      house and the green-stained facade of the long-deserted monastery at Moj{,
      with a forest tree growing out of a vacant window space, and great
      creepers netted across its vacant portals. Several flights of strange
      yellow butterflies with semi-transparent wings crossed the river that
      morning, and many alighted on the monitor and were killed by the men. It
      was towards afternoon that they came upon the derelict cuberta.

She did not at first appear to be derelict; both her sails were set and
      hanging slack in the afternoon calm, and there was the figure of a man
      sitting on the fore planking beside the shipped sweeps. Another man
      appeared to be sleeping face downwards on the sort of longitudinal bridge
      these big canoes have in the waist. But it was presently apparent, from
      the sway of her rudder and the way she drifted into the course of the
      gunboat, that something was out of order with her. Gerilleau surveyed her
      through a field-glass, and became interested in the queer darkness of the
      face of the sitting man, a red-faced man he seemed, without a nose—
      crouching he was rather than sitting, and the longer the captain looked
      the less he liked to look at him, and the less able he was to take his
      glasses away.

But he did so at last, and went a little way to call up Holroyd. Then he
      went back to hail the cuberta. He hailed her again, and so she drove past
      him. Santa Rosa stood out clearly as her name.

As she came by and into the wake of the monitor, she pitched a little, and
      suddenly the figure of the crouching man collapsed as though all its
      joints had given way. His hat fell off, his head was not nice to look at,
      and his body flopped lax and rolled out of sight behind the bulwarks.

"It was—ugh!—I have no words." And the captain suddenly turned
      his back on Holroyd and became an active and strident commander.

The gunboat came about, steamed parallel to the erratic course of the
      canoe, and dropped the boat with Lieutenant da Cunha and three sailors to
      board her. Then the curiosity of the captain made him draw up almost
      alongside as the lieutenant got aboard, so that the whole of the Santa
      Rosa, deck and hold, was visible to Holroyd.

He saw now clearly that the sole crew of the vessel was these two dead
      men, and though he could not see their faces, he saw by their outstretched
      hands, which were all of ragged flesh, that they had been subjected to
      some strange exceptional process of decay. For a moment his attention
      concentrated on those two enigmatical bundles of dirty clothes and laxly
      flung limbs, and then his eyes went forward to discover the open hold
      piled high with trunks and cases, and aft, to where the little cabin gaped
      inexplicably empty. Then he became aware that the planks of the middle
      decking were dotted with moving black specks.

His attention was riveted by these specks. They were all walking in
      directions radiating from the fallen man in a manner—the image came
      unsought to his mind—like the crowd dispersing from a bull-fight.

He became aware of Gerilleau beside him. "Capo," he said, "have you your
      glasses? Can you focus as closely as those planks there?"

There followed a moment of scrutiny. "It''s ants," said the Englishman, and
      handed the focused field-glass back to Gerilleau.

His impression of them was of a crowd of large black ants, very like
      ordinary ants except for their size, and for the fact that some of the
      larger of them bore a sort of clothing of grey. But at the time his
      inspection was too brief for particulars. The head of Lieutenant da Cunha
      appeared over the side of the cuberta, and a brief colloquy ensued.

Captain Gerilleau embarked upon speculations that Holroyd could not
      follow, and the two men disputed with a certain increasing vehemence.
      Holroyd took up the field-glass and resumed his scrutiny, first of the
      ants and then of the dead man amidships.

He says they were as large as any ants he has ever seen, black and moving
      with a steady deliberation very different from the mechanical fussiness of
      the common ant. About one in twenty was much larger than its fellows, and
      with an exceptionally large head. These reminded him at once of the master
      workers who are said to rule over the leaf-cutter ants; like them they
      seemed to be directing and co-ordinating the general movements. They
      tilted their bodies back in a manner altogether singular as if they made
      some use of the fore feet. And he had a curious fancy that he was too far
      off to verify, that most of these ants of both kinds were wearing
      accoutrements, had things strapped about their bodies by bright white
      bands like white metal threads...

He put down the glasses abruptly, realising that the question of
      discipline between the captain and his subordinate had become acute.

The lieutenant seemed on the verge of refusing. The head of one of the
      mulatto sailors appeared beside him.

The captain burst into a rage. He made no answer to Holroyd. "I have
      commanded you to go aboard," he screamed to his subordinate in Portuguese.
      "If you do not go aboard forthwith it is mutiny—rank mutiny. Mutiny
      and cowardice! Where is the courage that should animate us? I will have
      you in irons, I will have you shot like a dog." He began a torrent of
      abuse and curses,' WHERE id = 'ee364418-59f6-4a5c-b61e-e19060e1944f';
