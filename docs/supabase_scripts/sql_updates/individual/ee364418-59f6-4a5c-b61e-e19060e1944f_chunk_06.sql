UPDATE stories SET original_text = original_text || 'lightest sense of our position," said Mrs. Coombes;
      "that''s what I complain of. He cares for nothing but his old shop; and if
      I have a bit of company, or buy anything to keep myself decent, or get any
      little thing I want out of the housekeeping money, there''s disagreeables.
      ''Economy'' he says; ''struggle for life,'' and all that. He lies awake of
      nights about it, worrying how he can screw me out of a shilling. He wanted
      us to eat Dorset butter once. If once I was to give in to him—there!"

"If a man values a woman," said Mr. Clarence, lounging back in the
      arm-chair, "he must be prepared to make sacrifices for her. For my own
      part," said Mr. Clarence, with his eye on Jennie, "I shouldn''t think of
      marrying till I was in a position to do the thing in style. It''s downright
      selfishness. A man ought to go through the rough-and-tumble by himself,
      and not drag her—"

"I don''t agree altogether with that," said Jennie. "I don''t see why a man
      shouldn''t have a woman''s help, provided he doesn''t treat her meanly, you
      know. It''s meanness—"

"You wouldn''t believe," said Mrs. Coombes. "But I was a fool to ''ave ''im.
      I might ''ave known. If it ''adn''t been for my father, we shouldn''t ''ave ''ad
      not a carriage to our wedding."

"Said he wanted the money for his stock, or some such rubbish. Why, he
      wouldn''t have a woman in to help me once a week if it wasn''t for my
      standing out plucky. And the fusses he makes about money—comes to
      me, well, pretty near crying, with sheets of paper and figgers. ''If only
      we can tide over this year,'' he says, ''the business is bound to go.'' ''If
      only we can tide over this year,'' I says; ''then it''ll be, if only we can
      tide over next year. I know you,'' I says. ''And you don''t catch me screwing
      myself lean and ugly. Why didn''t you marry a slavey?'' I says, ''if you
      wanted one—instead of a respectable girl,'' I says."

So Mrs. Coombes. But we will not follow this unedifying conversation
      further. Suffice it that Mr. Coombes was very satisfactorily disposed of,
      and they had a snug little time round the fire. Then Mrs. Coombes went to
      get the tea, and Jennie sat coquettishly on the arm of Mr. Clarence''s
      chair until the tea-things clattered outside. "What was that I heard?"
      asked Mrs. Coombes playfully, as she entered, and there was badinage about
      kissing. They were just sitting down to the little circular table when the
      first intimation of Mr. Coombes'' return was heard.

"''Ere''s my lord," said Mrs. Coombes. "Went out like a lion and comes back
      like a lamb, I''ll lay."

Something fell over in the shop: a chair, it sounded like. Then there was
      a sound as of some complicated step exercise in the passage. Then the door
      opened and Coombes appeared. But it was Coombes transfigured. The
      immaculate collar had been torn carelessly from his throat. His
      carefully-brushed silk hat, half-full of a crush of fungi, was under one
      arm; his coat was inside out, and his waistcoat adorned with bunches of
      yellow-blossomed furze. These little eccentricities of Sunday costume,
      however, were quite overshadowed by the change in his face; it was livid
      white, his eyes were unnaturally large and bright, and his pale blue lips
      were drawn back in a cheerless grin. "Merry!" he said. He had stopped
      dancing to open the door. "Rational ''njoyment. Dance." He made three
      fantastic steps into the room, and stood bowing.

"He''s drunk," said Jennie in a weak voice. Never before had she seen this
      intense pallor in a drunken man, or such shining, dilated eyes.

Mr. Coombes held out a handful of scarlet agaric to Mr. Clarence. "Jo''
      stuff," said he; "ta'' some."

At that moment he was genial. Then at the sight of their startled faces he
      changed, with the swift transition of insanity, into overbearing fury. And
      it seemed as if he had suddenly recalled the quarrel of his departure. In
      such a huge voice as Mrs. Coombes had never heard before, he shouted, "My
      house. I''m master ''ere. Eat what I give yer!" He bawled this, as it
      seemed, without an effort, without a violent gesture, standing there as
      motionless as one who whispers, holding out a handful of fungus.

Clarence approved himself a coward. He could not meet the mad fury in
      Coombes'' eyes; he rose to his feet, pushing back his chair, and turned,
      stooping. At that Coombes rushed at him. Jennie saw her opportunity, and,
      with the ghost of a shriek, made for the door.

Mrs. Coombes followed her. Clarence tried to dodge. Over went the
      tea-table with a smash as Coombes clutched him by the collar and tried to
      thrust the fungus into his mouth. Clarence was content to leave his collar
      behind him, and shot out into the passage with red patches of fly agaric
      still adherent to his face. "Shut ''im in!" cried Mrs. Coombes, and would
      have closed the door, but her supports deserted her; Jennie saw the shop
      door open, and vanished thereby, locking it behind her, while Clarence
      went on hastily into the kitchen. Mr. Coombes came heavily against the
      door, and Mrs. Coombes, finding the key was inside, fled upstairs and
      locked herself in the spare bedroom.

So the new convert to joie de vivre emerged upon the passage, his
      decorations a little scattered, but that respectable hatful of fungi still
      under his arm. He hesitated at the three ways, and decided on the kitchen.
      Whereupon Clarence, who was fumbling with the key, gave up the attempt to
      imprison his host, and fled into the scullery, only to be captured before
      he could open the door into the yard. Mr. Clarence is singularly reticent
      of the details of what occurred. It seems that Mr. Coombes'' transitory
      irritation had vanished again, and he was once more a genial playfellow.
      And as there were knives and meat choppers about, Clarence very generously
      resolved to humour him and so avoid anything tragic. It is beyond dispute
      that Mr. Coombes played with Mr. Clarence to his heart''s content; they
      could not have been more playful and familiar if they had known each other
      for years. He insisted gaily on Clarence trying the fungi, and, after a
      friendly tussle, was smitten with remorse at the mess he was making of his
      guest''s face. It also appears that Clarence was dragged under the sink and
      his face scrubbed with the blacking brush—he being still resolved to
      humour the lunatic at any cost—and that finally, in a somewhat
      dishevelled, chipped, and discoloured condition, he was assisted to his
      coat and shown out by the back door, the shopway being barred by Jennie.
      Mr. Coombes'' wandering thoughts then turned to Jennie. Jennie had been
      unable to unfasten the shop door, but she shot the bolts against Mr.
      Coombes'' latch-key, and remained in possession of the shop for the rest of
      the evening.

It would appear that Mr. Coombes then returned to the kitchen, still in
      pursuit of gaiety, and, albeit a strict Good Templar, drank (or spilt down
      the front of the first and only frock-coat) no less than five bottles of
      the stout Mrs. Coombes insisted upon having for her health''s sake. He made
      cheerful noises by breaking off the necks of the bottles with several of
      his wife''s wedding-present dinner-plates, and during the earlier part of
      this great drunk he sang divers merry ballads. He cut his finger rather
      badly with one of the bottles—the only bloodshed in this story—and
      what with that, and the systematic convulsion of his inexperienced
      physiology by the liquorish brand of Mrs. Coombes'' stout, it may be the
      evil of the fungus poison was somehow allayed. But we prefer to draw a
      veil over the concluding incidents of this Sunday afternoon. They ended in
      the coal cellar, in a deep and healing sleep.

An interval of five years elapsed. Again it was a Sunday afternoon in
      October, and again Mr. Coombes walked through the pine wood beyond the
      canal. He was still the same dark-eyed, black-moustached little man that
      he was at the outset of the story, but his double chin was now scarcely so
      illusory as it had been. His overcoat was new, with a velvet lapel, and a
      stylish collar with turn-down corners, free of any coarse starchiness, had
      replaced the original all-round article. His hat was glossy, his gloves
      newish—though one finger had split and been carefully mended. And a
      casual observer would have noticed about him a certain rectitude of
      bearing, a certain erectness of head that marks the man who thinks well of
      himself. He was a master now, with three assistants. Beside him walked a
      larger sunburnt parody of himself, his brother Tom, just back from
      Australia. They were recapitulating their early struggles, and Mr. Coombes
      had just been making a financial statement.

"It''s a very nice little business, Jim," said brother Tom. "In these days
      of competition you''re jolly lucky to have worked it up so. And you''re
      jolly lucky, too, to have a wife who''s willing to help like yours does."

"Between ourselves," said Mr. Coombes, "it wasn''t always so. It wasn''t
      always like this. To begin with, the missus was a bit giddy. Girls are
      funny creatures."

"Yes. You''d hardly think it, but she was downright extravagant, and always
      having slaps at me. I was a bit too easy and loving, and all that, and she
      thought the whole blessed show was run for her. Turned the ''ouse into a
      regular caravansery, always having her relations and girls from business
      in, and their chaps. Comic songs a'' Sunday, it was getting to, and driving
      trade away. And she was making eyes at the chaps, too! I tell you, Tom,
      the place wasn''t my own."

"It was so. Well—I reasoned with her. I said, ''I ain''t a duke, to
      keep a wife like a pet animal. I married you for ''elp and company.'' I
      said, ''You got to ''elp and pull the business through.'' She wouldn''t ''ear
      of it. ''Very well,'' I says?? ''I''m a mild man till I''m roused,'' I says,
      ''and it''s getting to that.'' But she wouldn''t ''ear of no warnings."

"It''s the way with women. She didn''t think I ''ad it in me to be roused.
      Women of her sort (between ourselves, Tom) don''t respect a man until
      they''re a bit afraid of him. So I just broke out to show her. In comes a
      girl named Jennie, that used to work with her, and her chap. We ''ad a bit
      of a row, and I came out ''ere—it was just such another day as this—and
      I thought it all out. Then I went back and pitched into them."

"I did. I was mad, I can tell you. I wasn''t going to ''it ''er if I could
      ''elp it, so I went back and licked into this chap, just to show ''er what I
      could do. ''E was a big chap, too. Well, I chucked him, and smashed things
      about, and gave ''er a scaring, and she ran up and locked ''erself into the
      spare room."

"That''s all. I says to ''er the next morning, ''Now you know,'' I says, ''what
      I''m like when I''m roused.'' And I didn''t have to say anything more."

"So to speak. There''s nothing like putting your foot down with them. If it
      ''adn''t been for that afternoon I should ''a'' been tramping the roads now,
      and she''d ''a'' been grumbling at me, and all her family grumbling for
      bringing her to poverty—I know their little ways. But we''re all
      right now. And it''s a very decent little business, as you say."

"What a lot of these funguses there are about here!" remarked Brother Tom
      presently. "I can''t see what use they are in the world."

And that was as much thanks as the purple pileus ever got for maddening
      this absurd little man to the pitch of decisive action, and so altering
      the whole course of his life.

Outside the laboratory windows was a watery-grey fog, and within a close
      warmth and the yellow light of the green-shaded gas lamps that stood two
      to each table down its narrow length. On each table stood a couple of
      glass jars containing the mangled vestiges of the crayfish, mussels,
      frogs, and guinea-pigs upon which the students had been working, and down
      the side of the room, facing the windows, were shelves bearing bleached
      dissections in spirits, surmounted by a row of beautifully executed
      anatomical drawings in white-wood frames and overhanging a row of cubical
      lockers. All the doors of the laboratory were panelled with blackboard,
      and on these were the half-erased diagrams of the previous day''s work. The
      laboratory was empty, save for the demonstrator, who sat near the
      preparation-room door, and silent, save for a low, continuous murmur and
      the clicking of the rocker microtome at which he was working. But
      scattered about the room were traces of numerous students: hand-bags,
      polished boxes of instruments, in one place a large drawing covered by
      newspaper, and in another a prettily bound copy of News from Nowhere,
      a book oddly at variance with its surroundings. These things had been put
      down hastily as the students had arrived and hurried at once to secure
      their seats in the adjacent lecture theatre. Deadened by the closed door,
      the measured accents of the professor sounded as a featureless muttering.

Presently, faint through the closed windows came the sound of the Oratory
      clock striking the hour of eleven. The clicking of the microtome ceased,
      and the demonstrator looked at his watch, rose, thrust his hands into his
      pockets, and walked slowly down the laboratory towards the lecture theatre
      door. He stood listening for a moment, and then his eye fell on the little
      volume by William Morris. He picked it up, glanced at the title, smiled,
      opened it, looked at the name on the fly-leaf, ran the leaves through with
      his hand, and put it down. Almost immediately the even murmur of the
      lecturer ceased, there was a sudden burst of pencils rattling on the desks
      in the lecture theatre, a stirring, a scraping of feet, and a number of
      voices speaking together. Then a firm footfall approached the door, which
      began to open, and stood ajar, as some indistinctly heard question
      arrested the new-comer.

The demonstrator turned, walked slowly back past the microtome, and left
      the laboratory by the preparation-room door. As he did so, first one, and
      then several students carrying notebooks entered the laboratory from the
      lecture theatre, and distributed themselves among the little tables, or
      stood in a group about the doorway. They were an exceptionally
      heterogeneous assembly, for while Oxford and Cambridge still recoil from
      the blushing prospect of mixed classes, the College of Science anticipated
      America in the matter years ago—mixed socially, too, for the
      prestige of the College is high, and its scholarships, free of any age
      limit, dredge deeper even than do those of the Scotch universities. The
      class numbered one-and-twenty, but some remained in the theatre
      questioning the professor, copying the black-board diagrams before they
      were washed off, or examining the special specimens he had produced to
      illustrate the day''s teaching. Of the nine who had come into the
      laboratory three were girls, one of whom, a little fair woman, wearing
      spectacles and dressed in greyish-green, was peering out of the window at
      the fog, while the other two, both wholesome-looking, plain-faced
      schoolgirls, unrolled and put on the brown holland aprons they wore while
      dissecting. Of the men, two went down the laboratory to their places, one
      a pallid, dark-bearded man, who had once been a tailor; the other a
      pleasant-featured, ruddy young man of twenty, dressed in a well-fitting
      brown suit; young Wedderburn, the son of Wedderburn, the eye specialist.
      The others formed a little knot near the theatre door. One of these, a
      dwarfed, spectacled figure, with a hunchback, sat on a bent wood stool;
      two others, one a short, dark youngster, and the other a flaxen-haired,
      reddish-complexioned young man, stood leaning side by side against the
      slate sink, while the fourth stood facing them, and maintained the larger
      share of the conversation.

This last person was named Hill. He was a sturdily built young fellow, of
      the same age as Wedderburn; he had a white face, dark grey eyes, hair of
      an indeterminate colour, and prominent, irregular features. He talked
      rather louder than was needful, and thrust his hands deeply into his
      pockets. His collar was frayed and blue with the starch of a careless
      laundress, his clothes were evidently ready-made, and there was a patch on
      the side of his boot near the toe. And as he talked or listened to the
      others, he glanced now and again towards the lecture theatre door. They
      were discussing the depressing peroration of the lecture they had just
      heard, the last lecture it was in the introductory course in zoology.
      "From ovum to ovum is the goal of the higher vertebrata," the lecturer had
      said in his melancholy tones, and so had neatly rounded off the sketch of
      comparative anatomy he had been developing. The spectacled hunchback had
      repeated it, with noisy appreciation, had tossed it towards the
      fair-haired student with an evident provocation, and had started one of
      these vague, rambling discussions on generalities, so unaccountably dear
      to the student mind all the world over.

"That is our goal, perhaps—I admit it, as far as science goes," said
      the fair-haired student, rising to the challenge. "But there are things
      above science."

"Science," said Hill confidently, "is systematic knowledge. Ideas that
      don''t come into the system—must anyhow—be loose ideas." He was
      not quite sure whether that was a clever saying or a fatuity until his
      hearers took it seriously.

"The thing I cannot understand," said the hunchback, at large, "is whether
      Hill is a materialist or not."

"There is one thing above matter," said Hill promptly, feeling he had a
      better thing this time; aware, too, of someone in the doorway behind him,
      and raising his voice a trifle for her benefit, "and that is, the delusion
      that there is something above matter."

"So we have your gospel at last," said the fair student. "It''s all a
      delusion, is it? All our aspirations to lead something more than dogs''
      lives, all our work for anything beyond ourselves. But see how
      inconsistent you are. Your socialism, for instance. Why do you trouble
      about the interests of the race? Why do you concern yourself about the
      beggar in the gutter? Why are you bothering yourself to lend that book "—
      he indicated William Morris by a movement of the head—"to everyone
      in the lab.?"

The girl in brown, with the brown eyes, had come into the laboratory, and
      stood on the other side of the table behind him, with her rolled-up apron
      in one hand, looking over her shoulder, listening to the discussion. She
      did not notice the hunchback, because she was glancing from Hill to his
      interlocutor. Hill''s consciousness of her presence betrayed itself to her
      only in his studious ignorance of the fact; but she understood that, and
      it pleased her. "I see no reason," said he, "why a man should live like a
      brute because he knows of nothing beyond matter, and does not expect to
      exist a hundred years hence."

"That''s the way with all you religious people. It''s all a business of
      inducements. Cannot a man seek after righteousness for righteousness''
      sake?"

There was a pause. The fair man answered, with a kind of vocal padding,
      "But—you see—inducement—when I said inducement," to gain
      time. And then the hunchback came to his rescue and inserted a question.
      He was a terrible person in the debating society with his questions, and
      they invariably took one form—a demand for a definition, "What''s
      your definition of righteousness?" said the hunchback at this stage.

Hill experienced a sudden loss of complacency at this question, but even
      as it was asked, relief came in the person of Brooks, the laboratory
      attendant, who entered by the preparation-room door, carrying a number of
      freshly killed guinea-pigs by their hind legs. "This is the last batch of
      material this session," said the youngster who had not previously spoken.
      Brooks advanced up the laboratory, smacking down a couple of guinea-pigs
      at each table. The rest of the class, scenting the prey from afar, came
      crowding in by the lecture theatre door, and the discussion perished
      abruptly as the students who were not already in their places hurried to
      them to secure the choice of a specimen. There was a noise of keys
      rattling on split rings as lockers were opened and dissecting instruments
      taken out. Hill was already standing by his table, and his box of scalpels
      was sticking out of his pocket. The girl in brown came a step towards him,
      and, leaning over his table, said softly, "Did you see that I returned
      your book, Mr. Hill?"

During the whole scene she and the book had been vividly present in his
      consciousness; but he made a clumsy pretence of looking at the book and
      seeing it for the first time. "Oh, yes," he said, taking it up. "I see.
      Did you like it?"

Then suddenly the laboratory was hushed by a curious, braying noise. It
      was the demonstrator. He was at the blackboard ready to begin the day''s
      instruction, and it was his custom to demand silence by a sound midway
      between the "Er" of common intercourse and the blast of a trumpet. The
      girl in brown slipped back to her place: it was immediately in front of
      Hill''s, and Hill, forgetting her forthwith, took a notebook out of the
      drawer of his table, turned over its leaves hastily, drew a stumpy pencil
      from his pocket, and prepared to make a copious note of the coming
      demonstration. For demonstrations and lectures are the sacred text of the
      College students. Books, saving only the Professor''s own, you may—it
      is even expedient to—ignore.

Hill was the son of a Landport cobbler, and had been hooked by a chance
      blue paper the authorities had thrown out to the Landport Technical
      College. He kept himself in London on his allowance of a guinea a week,
      and found that, with proper care, this also covered his clothing
      allowance, an occasional waterproof collar, that is; and ink and needles
      and cotton, and such-like necessaries for a man about town. This was his
      first year and his first session, but the brown old man in Landport had
      already got himself detested in many public-houses by boasting of his son,
      "the Professor." Hill was a vigorous youngster, with a serene contempt for
      the clergy of all denominations, and a fine ambition to reconstruct the
      world. He regarded his scholarship as a brilliant opportunity. He had
      begun to read at seven, and had read steadily whatever came in his way,
      good or bad, since then. His worldly experience had been limited to the
      island of Portsea, and acquired chiefly in the wholesale boot factory in
      which he had worked by day, after passing the seventh standard of the
      Board school. He had a considerable gift of speech, as the College
      Debating Society, which met amidst the crushing machines and mine models
      in the metallurgical theatre downstairs, already recognised—recognised
      by a violent battering of desks whenever he rose. And he was just at that
      fine emotional age when life opens at the end of a narrow pass like a
      broad valley at one''s feet, full of the promise of wonderful discoveries
      and tremendous achievements. And his own limitations, save that he knew
      that he knew neither Latin nor French, were all unknown to him.

At first his interest had been divided pretty equally between his
      biological work at the College and social and theological theorising, an
      employment which he took in deadly earnest. Of a night, when the big
      museum library was not open, he would sit on the bed of his room in
      Chelsea with his coat and a muffler on, and write out the lecture notes
      and revise his dissection memoranda, until Thorpe called him out by a
      whistle—the landlady objected to open the door to attic visitors—and
      then the two would go prowling about the shadowy, shiny, gas-lit streets,
      talking, very much in the fashion of the sample just given, of the God
      idea, and Righteousness, and Carlyle, and the Reorganisation of Society.
      And in the midst of it all, Hill, arguing not only for Thorpe, but for the
      casual passer-by, would lose the thread of his argument glancing at some
      pretty painted face that looked meaningly at him as he passed. Science and
      Righteousness! But once or twice lately there had been signs that a third
      interest was creeping into his life, and he had found his attention
      wandering from the fate of the mesoblastic somites or the probable meaning
      of the blastopore, to the thought of the girl with the brown eyes who sat
      at the table before him.

She was a paying student; she descended inconceivable social altitudes to
      speak to him. At the thought of the education she must have had, and the
      accomplishments she must possess, the soul of Hill became abject within
      him. She had spoken to him first over a difficulty about the alisphenoid
      of a rabbit''s skull, and he had found that, in biology at least, he had no
      reason for self-abasement. And from that, after the manner of young people
      starting from any starting-point, they got to generalities, and while Hill
      attacked her upon the question of socialism—some instinct told him
      to spare her a direct assault upon her religion—she was gathering
      resolution to undertake what she told herself was his aesthetic education.
      She was a year or two older than he, though the thought never occurred to
      him. The loan of News from Nowhere was the beginning of a series of
      cross loans. Upon some absurd first principle of his, Hill had never
      "wasted time" upon poetry, and it seemed an appalling deficiency to her.
      One day in the lunch hour, when she chanced upon him alone in the little
      museum where the skeletons were arranged, shamefully eating the bun that
      constituted his midday meal, she retreated, and returned to lend him, with
      a slightly furtive air, a volume of Browning. He stood sideways towards
      her and took the book rather clumsily, because he was holding the bun in
      the other hand. And in the retrospect his voice lacked the cheerful
      clearness he could have wished.

That occurred after the examination in comparative anatomy, on the day
      before the College turned out its students, and was carefully locked up by
      the officials, for the Christmas holidays. The excitement of cramming for
      the first trial of strength had for a little while dominated Hill, to the
      exclusion of his other interests. In the forecasts of the result in which
      everyone indulged he was surprised to find that no one regarded him as a
      possible competitor for the Harvey Commemoration Medal, of which this and
      the two subsequent examinations disposed. It was about this time that
      Wedderburn, who so far had lived inconspicuously on the uttermost margin
      of Hill''s perceptions, began to take on the appearance of an obstacle. By
      a mutual agreement, the nocturnal prowlings with Thorpe ceased for the
      three weeks before the examination, and his landlady pointed out that she
      really could not supply so much lamp oil at the price. He walked to and
      fro from the College with little slips of mnemonics in his hand, lists of
      crayfish appendages, rabbits'' skull-bones, and vertebrate nerves, for
      example, and became a positive nuisance to foot passengers in the opposite
      direction.

But, by a natural reaction, Poetry and the girl with the brown eyes ruled
      the Christmas holiday. The pending results of the examination became such
      a secondary consideration that Hill marvelled at his father''s excitement.
      Even had he wished it, there was no comparative anatomy to read in
      Landport, and he was too poor to buy books, but the stock of poets in the
      library was extensive, and Hill''s attack was magnificently sustained. He
      saturated himself with the fluent numbers of Longfellow and Tennyson, and
      fortified himself with Shakespeare; found a kindred soul in Pope, and a
      master in Shelley, and heard and fled the siren voices of Eliza Cook and
      Mrs. Hemans. But he read no more Browning, because he hoped for the loan
      of other volumes from Miss Haysman when he returned to London.

He walked from his lodgings to the College with that volume of Browning in
      his shiny black bag, and his mind teeming with the finest general
      propositions about poetry. Indeed, he framed first this little speech and
      then that with which to grace the return. The morning was an exceptionally
      pleasant one for London; there was a clear, hard frost and undeniable blue
      in the sky, a thin haze softened every outline, and warm shafts of
      sunlight struck between the house blocks and turned the sunny side of the
      street to amber and gold. In the hall of the College he pulled off his
      glove and signed his name with fingers so stiff with cold that the
      characteristic dash under the signature he cultivated became a quivering
      line. He imagined Miss Haysman about him everywhere. He turned at the
      staircase, and there, below, he saw a crowd struggling at the foot of the
      notice-board. This, possibly, was the biology list. He forgot Browning and
      Miss Haysman for the moment, and joined the scrimmage. And at last, with
      his cheek flattened against the sleeve of the man on the step above him,
      he read the list—

and thereafter followed a second class that is outside our present
      sympathies. It was characteristic that he did not trouble to look for
      Thorpe on the physics list, but backed out of the struggle at once, and in
      a curious emotional state between pride over common second-class humanity
      and acute disappointment at Wedderburn''s success, went on his way
      upstairs. At the top, as he was hanging up his coat in the passage, the
      zoological demonstrator, a young man from Oxford, who secretly regarded
      him as a blatant "mugger" of the very worst type, offered his heartiest
      congratulations.

At the laboratory door Hill stopped for a second to get his breath, and
      then entered. He looked straight up the laboratory and saw all five girl
      students grouped in their places, and Wedderburn, the once retiring
      Wedderburn, leaning rather gracefully against the window, playing with the
      blind tassel and talking, apparently, to the five of them. Now, Hill could
      talk bravely enough and even overbearingly to one girl, and he could have
      made a speech to a roomful of girls, but this business of standing at ease
      and appreciating, fencing, and returning quick remarks round a group was,
      he knew, altogether beyond him. Coming up the staircase his feelings for
      Wedderburn had been generous, a certain admiration perhaps, a willingness
      to shake his hand conspicuously and heartily as one who had fought but the
      first round. But before Christmas Wedderburn had never gone up to that end
      of the room to talk. In a flash Hill''s mist of vague excitement condensed
      abruptly to a vivid dislike of Wedderburn. Possibly his expression
      changed. As he came up to his place, Wedderburn nodded carelessly to him,
      and the others glanced round. Miss Haysman looked at him and away again,
      the faintest touch of her eyes. "I can''t agree with you, Mr. Wedderburn,"
      she said.

"I must congratulate you on your first-class, Mr. Hill," said the
      spectacled girl in green, turning round and beaming at him.

"It''s nothing," said Hill, staring at Wedderburn and Miss Haysman talking
      together, and eager to hear what they talked about.

What was it Wedderburn was saying? Something about William Morris! Hill
      did not answer the girl in spectacles, and the smile died out of his face.
      He could not hear, and failed to see how he could "cut in." Confound
      Wedderburn! He sat down, opened his bag, hesitated whether to return the
      volume of Browning forthwith, in the sight of all, and instead drew out
      his new notebooks for the short course in elementary botany that was now
      beginning, and which would terminate in February. As he did so, a fat,
      heavy man, with a white face and pale grey eyes—Bindon, the
      professor of botany, who came up from Kew for January and February—came
      in by the lecture theatre door, and passed, rubbing his hands together and
      smiling, in silent affability down the laboratory.

In the subsequent six weeks Hill experienced some very rapid and curiously
      complex emotional developments. For the most part he had Wedderburn in
      focus—a fact that Miss Haysman never suspected. She told Hill (for
      in the comparative privacy of the museum she talked a good deal to him of
      socialism and Browning and general propositions) that she had met
      Wedderburn at the house of some people she knew, and "he''s inherited his
      cleverness; for his father, you know, is the great eye-specialist."

"My father is a cobbler," said Hill, quite irrelevantly, and
      perceived the want of dignity even as he said it. But the gleam of
      jealousy did not offend her. She conceived herself the fundamental source
      of it. He suffered bitterly from a sense of Wedderburn''s unfairness, and a
      realisation of his own handicap. Here was this Wedderburn had picked up a
      prominent man for a father, and instead of his losing so many marks on the
      score of that advantage, it was counted to him for righteousness! And
      while Hill had to introduce himself and talk to Miss Haysman clumsily over
      mangled guinea-pigs in the laboratory, this Wedderburn, in some backstairs
      way, had access to her social altitudes, and could converse in a polished
      argot that Hill understood perhaps, but felt incapable of speaking. Not,
      of course, that he wanted to. Then it seemed to Hill that for Wedderburn
      to come there day after day with cuffs unfrayed, neatly tailored,
      precisely barbered, quietly perfect, was in itself an ill-bred, sneering
      sort of proceeding. Moreover, it was a stealthy thing for Wedderburn to
      behave insignificantly for a space, to mock modesty, to lead Hill to fancy
      that he himself was beyond dispute the man of the year, and then suddenly
      to dart in front of him, and incontinently to swell up in this fashion. In
      addition to these things, Wedderburn displayed an increasing disposition
      to join in any conversational grouping that included Miss Haysman, and
      would venture, and indeed seek occasion, to pass opinions derogatory to
      socialism and atheism. He goaded Hill to incivilities by neat, shallow,
      and exceedingly effective personalities about the socialist leaders, until
      Hill hated Bernard Shaw''s graceful egotisms, William Morris''s limited
      editions and luxurious wall-papers, and Walter Crane''s charmingly absurd
      ideal working men, about as much as he hated Wedderburn. The dissertations
      in the laboratory, that had been his glory in the previous term, became a
      danger, degenerated into inglorious tussels with Wedderburn, and Hill kept
      to them only out of an obscure perception that his honour was involved. In
      the debating society Hill knew quite clearly that, to a thunderous
      accompaniment of banged desks, he could have pulverised Wedderburn. Only
      Wedderburn never attended the debating society to be pulverised, because—nauseous
      affectation!—he "dined late."

You must not imagine that these things presented themselves in quite such
      a crude form to Hill''s perception. Hill was a born generaliser. Wedderburn
      to him was not so much an individual obstacle as a type, the salient angle
      of a class. The economic theories that, after infinite ferment, had shaped
      themselves in Hill''s mind, became abruptly concrete at the contact. The
      world became full of easy-mannered, graceful, gracefully-dressed,
      conversationally dexterous, finally shallow Wedderburns, Bishops
      Wedderburn, Wedderburn M.P.''s, Professors Wedderburn, Wedderburn
      landlords, all with finger-bowl shibboleths and epigrammatic cities of
      refuge from a sturdy debater. And everyone ill-clothed or ill-dressed,
      from the cobbler to the cab-runner, was a man and a brother, a
      fellow-sufferer, to Hill''s imagination. So that he became, as it were, a
      champion of the fallen and oppressed, albeit to outward seeming only a
      self-assertive, ill-mannered young man, and an unsuccessful champion at
      that. Again and again a skirmish over the afternoon tea that the girl
      students had inaugurated left Hill with flushed cheeks and a tattered
      temper, and the debating society noticed a new quality of sarcastic
      bitterness in his speeches.

You will understand now how it was necessary, if only in the interests of
      humanity, that Hill should demolish Wedderburn in the forthcoming
      examination and outshine him in the eyes of Miss Haysman; and you will
      perceive, too, how Miss Haysman fell into some common feminine
      misconceptions. The Hill-Wedderburn quarrel, for in his unostentatious way
      Wedderburn reciprocated Hill''s ill-veiled rivalry, became a tribute to her
      indefinable charm; she was the Queen of Beauty in a tournament of scalpels
      and stumpy pencils. To her confidential friend''s secret annoyance, it even
      troubled her conscience, for she was a good girl, and painfully aware,
      from Ruskin and contemporary fiction, how entirely men''s activities are
      determined by women''s attitudes. And if Hill never by any chance mentioned
      the topic of love to her, she only credited him with the finer modesty for
      that omission. So the time came on for the second examination, and Hill''s
      increasing pallor confirmed the general rumour that he was working hard.
      In the aerated bread shop near South Kensington Station you would see him,
      breaking his bun and sipping his milk, with his eyes intent upon a paper
      of closely written notes. In his bedroom there were propositions about
      buds and stems round his looking-glass, a diagram to catch his eye, if
      soap should chance to spare it, above his washing basin. He missed several
      meetings of the debating society, but he found the chance encounters with
      Miss Haysman in the spacious ways of the adjacent art museum, or in the
      little museum at the top of the College, or in the College corridors, more
      frequent and very restful. In particular, they used to meet in a little
      gallery full of wrought-iron chests and gates, near the art library, and
      there Hill used to talk, under the gentle stimulus of her flattering
      attention, of Browning and his personal ambitions. A characteristic she
      found remarkable in him was his freedom from avarice. He contemplated
      quite calmly the prospect of living all his life on an income below a
      hundred pounds a year. But he was determined to be famous, to make,
      recognisably in his own proper person, the world a better place to live
      in. He took Bradlaugh and John Burns for his leaders and models, poor,
      even impecunious, great men. But Miss Haysman thought that such lives were
      deficient on the aesthetic side, by which, though she did not know it, she
      meant good wall-paper and upholstery, pretty books, tasteful clothes,
      concerts, and meals nicely cooked and respectfully served.

At last came the day of the second examination, and the professor of
      botany, a fussy, conscientious man, rearranged all the tables in a long
      narrow laboratory to prevent copying, and put his demonstrator on a chair
      on a table (where he felt, he said, like a Hindoo god), to see all the
      cheating, and stuck a notice outside the door, "Door closed," for no
      earthly reason that any human being could discover. And all the morning
      from ten till one the quill of Wedderburn shrieked defiance at Hill''s, and
      the quills of the others chased their leaders in a tireless pack, and so
      also it was in the afternoon. Wedderburn was a little quieter than usual,
      and Hill''s face was hot all day, and his overcoat bulged with textbooks
      and notebooks against the last moment''s revision. And the next day, in the
      morning and in the afternoon, was the practical examination, when sections
      had to be cut and slides identified. In the morning Hill was depressed
      because he knew he had cut a thick section, and in the afternoon came the
      mysterious slip.

It was just the kind of thing that the botanical professor was always
      doing. Like the income tax, it offered a premium to the cheat. It was a
      preparation under the microscope, a little glass slip, held in its place
      on the stage of the instrument by light steel clips, and the inscription
      set forth that the slip was not to be moved. Each student was to go in
      turn to it, sketch it, write in his book of answers what he considered it
      to be, and return to his place. Now, to move such a slip is a thing one
      can do by a chance movement of the finger, and in a fraction of a second.
      The professor''s reason for decreeing that the slip should not be moved
      depended on the fact that the object he wanted identified was
      characteristic of a certain tree stem. In the position in which it was
      placed it was a difficult thing to recognise, but once the slip was moved
      so as to bring other parts of the preparation into view, its nature was
      obvious enough.

Hill came to this, flushed from a contest with staining re-agents, sat
      down on the little stool before the microscope, turned the mirror to get
      the best light, and then, out of sheer habit, shifted the slips. At once
      he remembered the prohibition, and, with an almost continuous motion of
      his hands, moved it back, and sat paralysed with astonishment at his
      action.

Then, slowly, he turned his head. The professor was out of the room; the
      demonstrator sat aloft on his impromptu rostrum, reading the Q. Jour.
      Mi. Sci.; the rest of the examinees were busy, and with their backs to
      him. Should he own up to the accident now? He knew quite clearly what the
      thing was. It was a lenticel, a characteristic preparation from the
      elder-tree. His eyes roved over his intent fellow-students, and Wedderburn
      suddenly glanced over his shoulder at him with a queer expression in his
      eyes. The mental excitement that had kept Hill at an abnormal pitch of
      vigour these two days gave way to a curious nervous tension. His book of
      answers was beside him. He did not write down what the thing was, but with
      one eye at the microscope he began making a hasty sketch of it. His mind
      was full of this grotesque puzzle in ethics that had suddenly been sprung
      upon him. Should he identify it? or should he leave this question
      unanswered? In that case Wedderburn would probably come out first in the
      second result. How could he tell now whether he might not have identified
      the thing without shifting it? It was possible that Wedderburn had failed
      to recognise it, of course. Suppose Wedderburn too had shifted the slide?
      He looked up at the clock. There were fifteen minutes in which to make up
      his mind. He gathered up his book of answers and the coloured pencils he
      used in illustrating his replies and walked back to his seat.

He read through his manuscript, and then sat thinking and gnawing his
      knuckle. It would look queer now if he owned up. He must beat
      Wedderburn. He forgot the examples of those starry gentlemen, John Burns
      and Bradlaugh. Besides, he reflected, the glimpse of the rest of the slip
      he had had was, after all, quite accidental, forced upon him by chance, a
      kind of providential revelation rather than an unfair advantage. It was
      not nearly so dishonest to avail himself of that as it was of Broome, who
      believed in the efficacy of prayer, to pray daily for a first-class. "Five
      minutes more," said the demonstrator, folding up his paper and becoming
      observant. Hill watched the clock hands until two minutes remained; then
      he opened the book of answers, and, with hot ears and an affectation of
      ease, gave his drawing of the lenticel its name.

When the second pass list appeared, the previous positions of Wedderburn
      and Hill were reversed, and the spectacled girl in green, who knew the
      demonstrator in private life (where he was practically human), said that
      in the result of the two examinations taken together Hill had the
      advantage of a mark—167 to 166 out of a possible 200. Everyone
      admired Hill in a way, though the suspicion of "mugging" clung to him. But
      Hill was to find congratulations and Miss Haysman''s enhanced opinion of
      him, and even the decided decline in the crest of Wedderburn, tainted by
      an unhappy memory. He felt a remarkable access of energy at first, and the
      note of a democracy marching to triumph returned to his debating-society
      speeches; he worked at his comparative anatomy with tremendous zeal and
      effect, and he went on with his aesthetic education. But through it all, a
      vivid little picture was continually coming before his mind''s eye—of
      a sneakish person manipulating a slide.

No human being had witnessed the act, and he was cocksure that no higher
      power existed to see, it; but for all that it worried him. Memories are
      not dead things but alive; they dwindle in disuse, but they harden and
      develop in all sorts of queer ways if they are being continually fretted.
      Curiously enough, though at the time he perceived clearly that the
      shifting was accidental, as the days wore on, his memory became confused
      about it, until at last he was not sure—although he assured himself
      that he was sure—whether the movement had been absolutely
      involuntary. Then it is possible that Hill''s dietary was conducive to
      morbid conscientiousness; a breakfast frequently eaten in a hurry, a
      midday bun, and, at such hours after five as chanced to be convenient,
      such meat as his means determined, usually in a chop-house in a back
      street off the Brompton Road. Occasionally he treated himself to
      threepenny or ninepenny classics, and they usually represented a
      suppression of potatoes or chops. It is indisputable that outbreaks of
      self-abasement and emotional revival have a distinct relation to periods
      of scarcity. But apart from this influence on the feelings, there was in
      Hill a distinct aversion to falsity that the blasphemous Landport cobbler
      had inculcated by strap and tongue from his earliest years. Of one fact
      about professed atheists I am convinced; they may be—they usually
      are—fools, void of subtlety, revilers of holy institutions, brutal
      speakers, and mischievous knaves, but they lie with difficulty. If it were
      not so, if they had the faintest grasp of the idea of compromise, they
      would simply be liberal churchmen. And, moreover, this memory poisoned his
      regard for Miss Haysman. For she now so evidently preferred him to
      Wedderburn that he felt sure he cared for her, and began reciprocating her
      attentions by timid marks of personal regard; at one time he even bought a
      bunch of violets, carried it about in his pocket, and produced it, with a
      stumbling explanation, withered and dead, in the gallery of old iron. It
      poisoned, too, the denunciation of capitalist dishonesty that had been one
      of his life''s pleasures. And, lastly, it poisoned his triumph in
      Wedderburn. Previously he had been Wedderburn''s superior in his own eyes,
      and had raged simply at a want of recognition. Now he began to fret at the
      darker suspicion of positive inferiority. He fancied he found
      justifications for his position in Browning, but they vanished on
      analysis. At last—moved, curiously enough, by exactly the same
      motive forces that had resulted in his dishonesty—he went to
      Professor Bindon, and made a clean breast of the whole affair. As Hill was
      a paid student, Professor Bindon did not ask him to sit down, and he stood
      before the professor''s desk as he made his confession.

"It''s a curious story," said Professor Bindon, slowly realising how the
      thing reflected on himself, and then letting his anger rise,—"a most
      remarkable story. I can''t understand your doing it, and I can''t understand
      this avowal. You''re a type of student—Cambridge men would never
      dream—I suppose I ought to have thought—why did you
      cheat?"

"I am not a metaphysician, I am a servant of science—of fact. You
      were told not to move the slip. You did move the slip. If that is not
      cheating—"

"If I was a cheat," said Hill, with the note of hysterics in his voice,
      "should I come here and tell you?"

"Your repentance, of course, does you credit," said Professor Bindon, "but
      it does not alter the original facts."

"Even now you cause an enormous amount of trouble. The examination list
      will have to be revised."

"Suppose so? Of course it must be revised. And I don''t see how I can
      conscientiously pass you."

"It''s the rule in all examinations. Or where should we be? What else did
      you expect? You don''t want to shirk the consequences of your own acts?"

"I thought, perhaps——" said Hill. And then, "Fail me? I
      thought, as I told you, you would simply deduct the marks given for that
      slip."

"Impossible!" said Bindon. "Besides, it would still leave you above
      Wedderburn. Deduct only the marks! Preposterous! The Departmental
      Regulations distinctly say——"

"The Regulations say nothing whatever of the manner in which the matter
      comes to light. They simply provide——"

"I cannot consider anything. Professors in this College are machines. The
      Regulations will not even let us recommend our students for appointments.
      I am a machine, and you have worked me. I have to do——"

"That is as you think proper." Bindon''s voice softened a little; he
      perceived he had been unjust, and, provided he did not contradict himself,
      he was disposed to amelioration. "As a private person," he said, "I think
      this confession of yours goes far to mitigate your offence. But you have
      set the machinery in motion, and now it must take its course. I—I am
      really sorry you gave way."

A wave of emotion prevented Hill from answering. Suddenly, very vividly,
      he saw the heavily-lined face of the old Landport cobbler, his father.
      "Good God! What a fool I have been!" he said hotly and abruptly.

"I would like a day to think, sir, and then I will let you know—about
      going home, I mean," said Hill, moving towards the door.

The next day Hill''s place was vacant. The spectacled girl in green was, as
      usual, first with the news. Wedderburn and Miss Haysman were talking of a
      performance of The Meistersingers when she came up to them.

"I didn''t," said the girl in spectacles. "But I know it now for a
      fact. Mr. Hill went and confessed to Professor Bindon himself."

"By Jove!" said Wedderburn. "Hill of all people. But I am always inclined
      to distrust these philanthropists-on-principle—"

"Quite. It''s dreadful, isn''t it? But, you know, what can you expect? His
      father is a cobbler."

"I don''t care. I will not believe it," she said, flushing darkly under her
      warm-tinted skin. "I will not believe it until he has told me so himself—
      face to face. I would scarcely believe it then," and abruptly she turned
      her back on the girl in spectacles, and walked to her own place.

But Wedderburn did not answer her. She was indeed one of those people who
      seemed destined to make unanswered remarks.

There was, until a year ago, a little and very grimy-looking shop near
      Seven Dials, over which, in weather-worn yellow lettering, the name of "C.
      Cave, Naturalist and Dealer in Antiquities," was inscribed. The contents
      of its window were curiously variegated. They comprised some elephant
      tusks and an imperfect set of chessmen, beads and weapons, a box of eyes,
      two skulls of tigers and one human, several moth-eaten stuffed monkeys
      (one holding a lamp), an old-fashioned cabinet, a fly-blown ostrich egg or
      so, some fishing-tackle, and an extraordinarily dirty, empty glass
      fish-tank. There was also, at the moment the story begins, a mass of
      crystal, worked into the shape of an egg and brilliantly polished. And at
      that two people who stood outside the window were looking, one of them a
      tall, thin clergyman, the other a black-bearded young man of dusky
      complexion and unobtrusive costume. The dusky young man spoke with eager
      gesticulation, and seemed anxious for his companion to purchase the
      article.

While they were there, Mr. Cave came into his shop, his beard still
      wagging with the bread and butter of his tea. When he saw these men and
      the object of their regard, his countenance fell. He glanced guiltily over
      his shoulder, and softly shut the door. He was a little old man, with pale
      face and peculiar watery blue eyes; his hair was a dirty grey, and he wore
      a shabby blue frock-coat, an ancient silk hat, and carpet slippers very
      much down at heel. He remained watching the two men as they talked. The
      clergyman went deep into his trouser pocket, examined a handful of money,
      and showed his teeth in an agreeable smile. Mr. Cave seemed still more
      depressed when they came into the shop.

The clergyman, without any ceremony, asked the price of the crystal egg.
      Mr. Cave glanced nervously towards the door leading into the parlour, and
      said five pounds. The clergyman protested that the price was high, to his
      companion as well as to Mr. Cave—it was, indeed, very much more than
      Mr. Cave had intended to ask when he had stocked the article—and an
      attempt at bargaining ensued. Mr. Cave stepped to the shop door, and held
      it open. "Five pounds is my price," he said, as though he wished to save
      himself the trouble of unprofitable discussion. As he did so, the upper
      portion of a woman''s face appeared above the blind in the glass upper
      panel of the door leading into the parlour, and stared curiously at the
      two customers. "Five pounds is my price," said Mr. Cave, with a quiver in
      his voice.

The swarthy young man had so far remained a spectator, watching Cave
      keenly. Now he spoke. "Give him five pounds," he said. The clergyman
      glanced at him to see if he were in earnest, and when he looked at Mr.
      Cave again, he saw that the latter''s face was white. "It''s a lot of
      money," said the clergyman, and, diving into his pocket, began counting
      his resources. He had little more than thirty shillings, and he appealed
      to his companion, with whom he seemed to be on terms of considerable
      intimacy. This gave Mr. Cave an opportunity of collecting his thoughts,
      and he began to explain in an agitated manner that the crystal was not, as
      a matter of fact, entirely free for sale. His two customers were naturally
      surprised at this, and inquired why he had not thought of that before he
      began to bargain. Mr. Cave became confused, but he stuck to his story,
      that the crystal was not in the market that afternoon, that a probable
      purchaser of it had already appeared. The two, treating this as an attempt
      to raise the price still further, made as if they would leave the shop.
      But at this point the parlour door opened, and the owner of the dark
      fringe and the little eyes appeared.

She was a coarse-featured, corpulent woman, younger and very much larger
      than Mr. Cave; she walked heavily, and her face was flushed. "That crystal
      is for sale," she said. "And five pounds is a good enough price for
      it. I can''t think what you''re about, Cave, not to take the gentleman''s
      offer!"

Mr. Cave, greatly perturbed by the irruption, looked angrily at her over
      the rims of his spectacles, and, without excessive assurance, asserted his
      right to manage his business in his own way. An altercation began. The two
      customers watched the scene with interest and some amusement, occasionally
      assisting Mrs. Cave with suggestions. Mr. Cave, hard driven, persisted in
      a confused and impossible story of an inquiry for the crystal that
      morning, and his agitation became painful. But he stuck to his point with
      extraordinary persistence. It was the young Oriental who ended this
      curious controversy. He proposed that they should call again in the course
      of two days—so as to give the alleged inquirer a fair chance. "And
      then we must insist," said the clergyman. "Five pounds." Mrs. Cave took it
      on herself to apologise for her husband, explaining that he was sometimes
      "a little odd," and as the two customers left, the couple prepared for a
      free discussion of the incident in all its bearings.

Mrs. Cave talked to her husband with singular directness. The poor little
      man, quivering with emotion, muddled himself between his stories,
      maintaining on the one hand that he had another customer in view, and on
      the other asserting that the crystal was honestly worth ten guineas. "Why
      did you ask five pounds?" said his wife. "Do let me manage my
      business my own way!" said Mr. Cave.

Mr. Cave had living with him a step-daughter and a step-son, and at supper
      that night the transaction was re-discussed. None of them had a high
      opinion of Mr. Cave''s business methods, and this action seemed a
      culminating folly.

"It''s my opinion he''s refused that crystal before," said the step-son, a
      loose-limbed lout of eighteen.

Mr. Cave''s answers were wretched; he could only mumble weak assertions
      that he knew his own business best. They drove him from his half-eaten
      supper into the shop, to close it for the night, his ears aflame and tears
      of vexation behind his spectacles. Why had he left the crystal in the
      window so long? The folly of it! That was the trouble closest in his mind.
      For a time he could see no way of evading sale.

After supper his step-daughter and step-son smartened themselves up and
      went out and his wife retired upstairs to reflect upon the business
      aspects of the crystal, over a little sugar and lemon and so forth in hot
      water. Mr. Cave went into the shop, and stayed there until late,
      ostensibly to make ornamental rockeries for gold-fish cases, but really
      for a private purpose that will be better explained later. The next day
      Mrs. Cave found that the crystal had been removed from the window, and was
      lying behind some second-hand books on angling. She replaced it in a
      conspicuous position. But she did not argue further about it, as a nervous
      headache disinclined her from debate. Mr. Cave was always disinclined. The
      day passed disagreeably. Mr. Cave was, if anything, more absent-minded
      than usual, and uncommonly irritable withal. In the afternoon, when his
      wife was taking her customary sleep, he removed the crystal from the
      window again.

The next day Mr. Cave had to deliver a consignment of dog-fish at one of
      the hospital schools, where they were needed for dissection. In his
      absence Mrs. Cave''s mind reverted to the topic of the crystal, and the
      methods of expenditure suitable to a windfall of five pounds. She had
      already devised some very agreeable expedients, among others a dress of
      green silk for herself and a trip to Richmond, when a jangling of the
      front door bell summoned her into the shop. The customer was an
      examination coach who came to complain of the non-delivery of certain
      frogs asked for the previous day. Mrs. Cave did not approve of this
      particular branch of Mr. Cave''s business, and the gentleman, who had
      called in a somewhat aggressive mood, retired after a brief exchange of
      words—entirely civil, so far as he was concerned. Mrs. Cave''s eye
      then naturally turned to the window; for the sight of the crystal was an
      assurance of the five pounds and of her dreams. What was her surprise to
      find it gone!

She went to the place behind the locker on the counter, where she had
      discovered it the day before. It was not there; and she immediately began
      an eager search about the shop.

When Mr. Cave returned from his business with the dogfish, about a quarter
      to two in the afternoon, he found the shop in some confusion, and his
      wife, extremely exasperated and on her knees behind the counter, routing
      among his taxidermic material. Her face came up hot and angry over the
      counter, as the jangling bell announced his return, and she forthwith
      accused him of "hiding it."

At that Mr. Cave, apparently much surprised, rushed to the window. "Isn''t
      it here?" he said. "Great Heavens! what has become of it?"

Just then Mr. Cave''s step-son re-entered the shop from, the inner room—he
      had come home a minute or so before Mr. Cave—and he was blaspheming
      freely. He was apprenticed to a second-hand furniture dealer down the
      road, but he had his meals at home, and he was naturally annoyed to find
      no dinner ready.

But when he heard of the loss of the crystal, he forgot his meal, and his
      anger was diverted from his mother to his step-father. Their first idea,
      of course, was that he had hidden it. But Mr. Cave stoutly denied all
      knowledge of its fate, freely offering his bedabbled affidavit in the
      matter—and at last was worked up to the point of accusing, first,
      his wife and then his stepson of having taken it with a view to a private
      sale. So began an exceedingly acrimonious and emotional discussion, which
      ended for Mrs. Cave in a peculiar nervous condition midway between
      hysterics and amuck, and caused the step-son to be half-an-hour late at
      the furniture establishment in the afternoon. Mr. Cave took refuge from
      his wife''s emotions in the shop.

In the evening the matter was resumed, with less passion and in a judicial
      spirit, under the presidency of the step-daughter. The supper passed
      unhappily and culminated in a painful scene. Mr. Cave gave way at last to
      extreme exasperation, and went out banging the front door violently. The
      rest of the family, having discussed him with the freedom his absence
      warranted, hunted the house from garret to cellar, hoping to light upon
      the crystal.

The next day the two customers called again. They were received by Mrs.
      Cave almost in tears. It transpired that no one could imagine all
      that she had stood from Cave at various times in her married pilgrimage.
      ... She also gave a garbled account of the disappearance. The clergyman
      and the Oriental laughed silently at one another, and said it was very
      extraordinary. As Mrs. Cave seemed disposed to give them the complete
      history of her life they made to leave the shop. Thereupon Mrs. Cave,
      still clinging to hope, asked for the clergyman''s address, so that, if she
      could get anything out of Cave, she might communicate it. The address was
      duly given, but apparently was afterwards mislaid. Mrs. Cave can remember
      nothing about it.

In the evening of that day the Caves seem to have exhausted their
      emotions, and Mr. Cave, who had been out in the afternoon, supped in a
      gloomy isolation that contrasted pleasantly with the impassioned
      controversy of the previous days. For some time matters were very badly
      strained in the Cave household, but neither crystal nor customer
      reappeared.

Now, without mincing the matter, we must admit that Mr. Cave was a liar.
      He knew perfectly well where the crystal was. It was in the rooms of Mr.
      Jacoby Wace, Assistant Demonstrator at St. Catherine''s Hospital,
      Westbourne Street. It stood on the sideboard partially covered by a black
      velvet cloth, and beside a decanter of American whisky. It is from Mr.
      Wace, indeed, that the particulars upon which this narrative is based were
      derived. Cave had taken off the thing to the hospital hidden in the
      dog-fish sack, and there had pressed the young investigator to keep it for
      him. Mr. Wace was a little dubious at first. His relationship to Cave was
      peculiar. He had a taste for singular characters, and he had more than
      once invited the old man to smoke and drink in his rooms, and to unfold
      his rather amusing views of life in general and of his wife in particular.
      Mr. Wace had encountered Mrs. Cave, too, on occasions when Mr. Cave was
      not at home to attend to him. He knew the constant interference to which
      Cave was subjected, and having weighed the story judicially, he decided to
      give the crystal a refuge. Mr. Cave promised to explain the reasons for
      his remarkable affection for the crystal more fully on a later occasion,
      but he spoke distinctly of seeing visions therein. He called on Mr. Wace
      the same evening.

He told a complicated story. The crystal he said had come into his
      possession with other oddments at the forced sale of another curiosity
      dealer''s effects, and not knowing what its value might be, he had ticketed
      it at ten shillings. It had hung upon his hands at that price for some
      months, and he was thinking of "reducing the figure," when he made a
      singular discovery.

At that time his health was very bad—and it must be borne in mind
      that, throughout all this experience, his physical condition was one of
      ebb—and he was in considerable distress by reason of the negligence,
      the positive ill-treatment even, he received from his wife and
      step-children. His wife was vain, extravagant, unfeeling, and had a
      growing taste for private drinking; his step-daughter was mean and
      over-reaching; and his step-son had conceived a violent dislike for him,
      and lost no chance of showing it. The requirements of his business pressed
      heavily upon him, and Mr. Wace does not think that he was altogether free
      from occasional intemperance. He had begun life in a comfortable position,
      he was a man of fair education, and he suffered, for weeks at a stretch,
      from melancholia and insomnia. Afraid to disturb his family, he would slip
      quietly from his wife''s side, when his thoughts became intolerable, and
      wander about the house. And about three o''clock one morning, late in
      August, chance directed him into the shop.

The dirty little place was impenetrably black except in one spot, where he
      perceived an unusual glow of light. Approaching this, he discovered it to
      be the crystal egg, which was standing on the corner of the counter
      towards the window. A thin ray smote through a crack in the shutters,
      impinged upon the object, and seemed as it were to fill its entire
      interior.

It occurred to Mr. Cave that this was not in accordance with the laws of
      optics as he had known them in his younger days. He could understand the
      rays being refracted by the crystal and coming to a focus in its interior,
      but this diffusion jarred with his physical conceptions. He approached the
      crystal nearly, peering into it and round it, with a transient revival of
      the scientific curiosity that in his youth had determined his choice of a
      calling. He was surprised to find the light not steady, but writhing
      within the substance of the egg, as though that object was a hollow sphere
      of some luminous vapour. In moving about to get different points of view,
      he suddenly found that he had come between it and the ray, and that the
      crystal none the less remained luminous. Greatly astonished, he lifted it
      out of the light ray and carried it to the darkest part of the shop. It
      remained bright for some four or five minutes, when it slowly faded and
      went out. He placed it in the thin streak of daylight, and its
      luminousness was almost immediately restored.

So far, at least, Mr. Wace was able to verify the remarkable story of Mr.
      Cave. He has himself repeatedly held this crystal in a ray of light (which
      had to be of a less diameter than one millimetre). And in a perfect
      darkness, such as could be produced by velvet wrapping, the crystal did
      undoubtedly appear very faintly phosphorescent. It would seem, however,
      that the luminousness was of some exceptional sort, and not equally
      visible to all eyes; for Mr. Harbinger—whose name will be familiar
      to the scientific reader in connection with the Pasteur Institute—was
      quite unable to see any light whatever. And Mr. Wace''s own capacity for
      its appreciation was out of comparison inferior to that of Mr. Cave''s.
      Even with Mr. Cave the power varied very considerably: his vision was most
      vivid during states of extreme weakness and fatigue.

Now, from the outset, this light in the crystal exercised a curious
      fascination upon Mr. Cave. And it says more for his loneliness of soul
      than a volume of pathetic writing could do, that he told no human being of
      his curious observations. He seems to have been living in such an
      atmosphere of petty spite that to admit the existence of a pleasure would
      have been to risk the loss of it. He found that as the dawn advanced, and
      the amount of diffused light increased, the crystal became to all
      appearance non-luminous. And for some time he was unable to see anything
      in it, except at night-time, in dark corners of the shop.

But the use of an old velvet cloth, which he used as a background for a
      collection of minerals, occurred to him, and by doubling this, and putting
      it over his head and hands, he was able to get a sight of the luminous
      movement within the crystal even in the day-time. He was very cautious
      lest he should be thus discovered by his wife, and he practised this
      occupation only in the afternoons, while she was asleep upstairs, and then
      circumspectly in a hollow under the counter. And one day, turning the
      crystal about in his hands, he saw something. It came and went like a
      flash, but it gave him the impression that the object had for a moment
      opened to him the view of a wide and spacious and strange country; and
      turning it about, he did, just as the light faded, see the same vision
      again.

Now it would be tedious and unnecessary to state all the phases of Mr.
      Cave''s discovery from this point. Suffice that the effect was this: the
      crystal, being peered into at an angle of about 137 degrees from the
      direction of the illuminating ray, gave a clear and consistent picture of
      a wide and peculiar country-side. It was not dream-like at all: it
      produced a definite impression of reality, and the better the light the
      more real and solid it seemed. It was a moving picture: that is to say,
      certain objects moved in it, but slowly in an orderly manner like real
      things, and, according as the direction of the lighting and vision
      changed, the picture changed also. It must, indeed, have been like looking
      through an oval glass at a view, and turning the glass about to get at
      different aspects.

Mr. Cave''s statements, Mr. Wace assures me, were extremely circumstantial,
      and entirely free from any of that emotional quality that taints
      hallucinatory impressions. But it must be remembered that all the efforts
      of Mr. Wace to see any similar clarity in the faint opalescence of the
      crystal were wholly unsuccessful, try as he would. The difference in
      intensity of the impressions received by the two men was very great, and
      it is quite conceivable that what was a view to Mr. Cave was a mere
      blurred nebulosity to Mr. Wace.

The view, as Mr. Cave described it, was invariably of an extensive plain,
      and he seemed always to be looking at it from a considerable height, as if
      from a tower or a mast. To the east and to the west the plain was bounded
      at a remote distance by vast reddish cliffs, which reminded him of those
      he had seen in some picture; but what the picture was Mr. Wace was unable
      to ascertain. These cliffs passed north and south—he could tell the
      points of the compass by the stars that were visible of a night—receding
      in an almost illimitable perspective and fading into the mists of the
      distance before they met. He was nearer the eastern set of cliffs; on the
      occasion of his first vision the sun was rising over them, and black
      against the sunlight and pale against their shadow appeared a multitude of
      soaring forms that Mr. Cave regarded as birds. A vast range of buildings
      spread below him; he seemed to be looking down upon them; and as they
      approached the blurred and refracted edge of the picture they became
      indistinct. There were also trees curious in shape, and in colouring a
      deep mossy green and an exquisite grey, beside a wide and shining canal.
      And something great and brilliantly coloured flew across the picture. But
      the first time Mr. Cave saw these pictures he saw only in flashes, his
      hands shook, his head moved, the vision came and went, and grew foggy and
      indistinct. And at first he had the greatest difficulty in finding the
      picture again once the direction of it was lost.

His next clear vision, which came about a week after the first, the
      interval having yielded nothing but tantalising glimpses and some useful
      experience, showed him the view down the length of the valley. The view
      was different, but he had a curious persuasion, which his subsequent
      observations abundantly confirmed, that he was regarding the strange world
      from exactly the same spot, although he was looking in a different
      direction. The long faÃ§ade of the great building, whose roof he had looked
      down upon before, was now receding in perspective. He recognised the roof.
      In the front of the faÃ§ade was a terrace of massive proportions and
      extraordinary length, and down the middle of the terrace, at certain
      intervals, stood huge but very graceful masts, bearing small shiny objects
      which reflected the setting sun. The import of these small objects did not
      occur to Mr. Cave until some time after, as he was describing the scene to
      Mr. Wace. The terrace overhung a thicket of the most luxuriant and
      graceful vegetation, and beyond this was a wide grassy lawn on which
      certain broad creatures, in form like beetles but enormously larger,
      reposed. Beyond this again was a richly decorated causeway of pinkish
      stone; and beyond that, and lined with dense red weeds, and passing up the
      valley exactly parallel with the distant cliffs, was a broad and
      mirror-like expanse of water. The air seemed full of squadrons of great
      birds, manoeuvring in stately curves; and across the river was a multitude
      of splendid buildings, richly coloured and glittering with metallic
      tracery and facets, among a forest of moss-like and lichenous trees. And
      suddenly something flapped repeatedly across the vision, like the
      fluttering of a jewelled fan or the beating of a wing, and a face, or
      rather the upper part of a face with very large eyes, came as it were
      close to his own and as if on the other side of the crystal. Mr. Cave was
      so startled and so impressed by the absolute reality of these eyes that he
      drew his head back from the crystal to look behind it. He had become so
      absorbed in watching that he was quite surprised to find himself in the
      cool darkness of his little shop, with its familiar odour of methyl,
      mustiness, and decay. And as he blinked about him, the glowing crystal
      faded and went out.

Such were the first general impressions of Mr. Cave. The story is
      curiously direct and circumstantial. From the outset, when the valley
      first flashed momentarily on his senses, his imagination was strangely
      affected, and as he began to appreciate the details of the scene he saw,
      his wonder rose to the point of a passion. He went about his business
      listless and distraught, thinking only of the time when he should be able
      to return to his watching. And then a few weeks after his first sight of
      the valley came the two customers, the stress and excitement of their
      offer, and the narrow escape of the crystal from sale, as I have already
      told.

Now, while the thing was Mr. Cave''s secret, it remained a mere wonder, a
      thing to creep to covertly and peep at, as a child might peep upon a
      forbidden garden. But Mr. Wace has, for a young scientific investigator, a
      particularly lucid and consecutive habit of mind. Directly the crystal and
      its story came to him, and he had satisfied himself, by seeing the
      phosphorescence with his own eyes, that there really was a certain
      evidence for Mr. Cave''s statements, he proceeded to develop the matter
      systematically. Mr. Cave was only too eager to come and feast his eyes on
      this wonderland he saw, and he came every night from half-past eight until
      half-past ten, and sometimes, in Mr. Wace''s absence, during the day. On
      Sunday afternoons, also, he came. From the outset Mr. Wace made copious
      notes, and it was due to his' WHERE id = 'ee364418-59f6-4a5c-b61e-e19060e1944f';
