UPDATE stories SET original_text = original_text || 'd the fat innkeeper himself warded his wife''s
      attacks with all the prudence of which he was capable, that he might not
      also break the five eggs at his other side.

Tome was conquered. He had to hatch eggs, he had to give up his games of
      dominoes and renounce movement of any sort, for the old woman angrily
      deprived him of food whenever he broke an egg.

He lay on his back, with eyes fixed on the ceiling, motionless, his arms
      raised like wings, warming against his body the rudimentary chickens
      enclosed in their white shells.

He spoke now only in hushed tones; as if he feared a noise as much as
      motion, and he took a feverish interest in the yellow hen who was
      accomplishing in the poultry-yard the same task as he.

And the old woman went from her fowls to her husband and from her husband
      to her fowls, devoured by anxiety as to the welfare of the little chickens
      who were maturing in the bed and in the nest.

The country people who knew the story came, agog with curiosity, to ask
      news of Toine. They entered his room on tiptoe, as one enters a
      sick-chamber, and asked:

“Will it soon be over?” he asked, with the anguish of a woman
      who is about to become a mother.

They waited. Friends of Toine who had got wind that his time was drawing
      near arrived, and filled the little room.

Nothing else was talked about in the neighboring cottages. Inquirers asked
      one another for news as they stood at their doors.

About three o''clock Toine fell asleep. He slumbered half his time
      nowadays. He was suddenly awakened by an unaccustomed tickling under his
      right arm. He put his left hand on the spot, and seized a little creature
      covered with yellow down, which fluttered in his hand.

His emotion was so great that he cried out, and let go his hold of the
      chicken, which ran over his chest. The bar was full of people at the time.
      The customers rushed to Toine''s room, and made a circle round him as they
      would round a travelling showman; while Madame Toine picked up the
      chicken, which had taken refuge under her husband''s beard.

No one spoke, so great was the tension. It was a warm April day. Outside
      the window the yellow hen could be heard calling to her newly-fledged
      brood.

His'' wife plunged her great bony hand into the bed, and pulled out a
      second chicken with all the care of a midwife.

The neighbors wanted to see it. It was passed from one to another, and
      examined as if it were a phenomenon.

For twenty minutes no more hatched out, then four emerged at the same
      moment from their shells.

There was a great commotion among the lookers-on. And Toine smiled with
      satisfaction, beginning to take pride in this unusual sort of paternity.
      There were not many like him! Truly, he was a remarkable specimen of
      humanity!

Toine''s wife took this new family to the hen, who clucked loudly, bristled
      her feathers, and spread her wings wide to shelter her growing brood of
      little ones.

He was mistaken. There were three! It was an unalloyed triumph! The last
      chicken broke through its shell at seven o''clock in the evening. All the
      eggs were good! And Toine, beside himself with joy, his brood hatched out,
      exultant, kissed the tiny creature on the back, almost suffocating it. He
      wanted to keep it in his bed until morning, moved by a mother''s tenderness
      toward the tiny being which he had brought to life, but the old woman
      carried it away like the others, turning a deaf ear to her husband''s
      entreaties.

The delighted spectators went off to spread the news of the event, and
      Horslaville, who was the last to go, asked:

We had just left Gisors, where I was awakened to hearing the name of the
      town called out by the guards, and I was dozing off again when a terrific
      shock threw me forward on top of a large lady who sat opposite me.

One of the wheels of the engine had broken, and the engine itself lay
      across the track. The tender and the baggage car were also derailed, and
      lay beside this mutilated engine, which rattled, groaned, hissed, puffed,
      sputtered, and resembled those horses that fall in the street with their
      flanks heaving, their breast palpitating, their nostrils steaming and
      their whole body trembling, but incapable of the slightest effort to rise
      and start off again.

There were no dead or wounded; only a few with bruises, for the train was
      not going at full speed. And we looked with sorrow at the great crippled
      iron creature that could not draw us along any more, and that blocked the
      track, perhaps for some time, for no doubt they would have to send to
      Paris for a special train to come to our aid.

It was then ten o''clock in the morning, and I at once decided to go back
      to Gisors for breakfast.

“Who is it? Gisors? Let me see, I have a friend in this town.”
      A name suddenly came to my mind, “Albert Marambot.” He was an
      old school friend whom I had not seen for at least twelve years, and who
      was practicing medicine in Gisors. He had often written, inviting me to
      come and see him, and I had always promised to do so, without keeping my
      word. But at last I would take advantage of this opportunity.

I presently saw, on the door of the house he pointed out, a large brass
      plate on which was engraved the name of my old chum. I rang the bell, but
      the servant, a yellow-haired girl who moved slowly, said with a Stupid
      air:

A door opened and a large man, with whiskers and a cross look on his face,
      appeared, carrying a dinner napkin in his hand.

I certainly should not have recognized him. One would have said he was
      forty-five at least, and, in a second, all the provincial life which makes
      one grow heavy, dull and old came before me. In a single flash of thought,
      quicker than the act of extending my hand to him, I could see his life,
      his manner of existence, his line of thought and his theories of things in
      general. I guessed at the prolonged meals that had rounded out his
      stomach, his after-dinner naps from the torpor of a slow indigestion aided
      by cognac, and his vague glances cast on the patient while he thought of
      the chicken that was roasting before the fire. His conversations about
      cooking, about cider, brandy and wine, the way of preparing certain dishes
      and of blending certain sauces were revealed to me at sight of his puffy
      red cheeks, his heavy lips and his lustreless eyes.

“Time does not hang heavy; I am busy. I have patients and friends. I
      eat well, have good health, enjoy laughing and shooting. I get along.”

“No, my dear boy, not when one knows how to fill in the time. A
      little town, in fact, is like a large one. The incidents and amusements
      are less varied, but one makes more of them; one has fewer acquaintances,
      but one meets them more frequently. When you know all the windows in a
      street, each one of them interests you and puzzles you more than a whole
      street in Paris.

“A little town is very amusing, you know, very amusing, very
      amusing. Why, take Gisors. I know it at the tips of my fingers, from its
      beginning up to the present time. You have no idea what queer history it
      has.”

“I? No. I come from Gournay, its neighbor and rival. Gournay is to
      Gisors what Lucullus was to Cicero. Here, everything is for glory; they
      say ''the proud people of Gisors.'' At Gournay, everything is for the
      stomach; they say ''the chewers of Gournay.'' Gisors despises Gournay, but
      Gournay laughs at Gisors. It is a very comical country, this.”

I perceived that I was eating something very delicious, hard-boiled eggs
      wrapped in a covering of meat jelly flavored with herbs and put on ice for
      a few moments. I said as I smacked my lips to compliment Marambot:

“Two things are necessary, good jelly, which is hard to get, and
      good eggs. Oh, how rare good eggs are, with the yolks slightly reddish,
      and with a good flavor! I have two poultry yards, one for eggs and the
      other for chickens. I feed my laying hens in a special manner. I have my
      own ideas on the subject. In an egg, as in the meat of a chicken, in beef,
      or in mutton, in milk, in everything, one perceives, and ought to taste,
      the juice, the quintessence of all the food on which the animal has fed.
      How much better food we could have if more attention were paid to this!”

“Parbleu. It is only imbeciles who are not. One is a gourmand as one
      is an artist, as one is learned, as one is a poet. The sense of taste, my
      friend, is very delicate, capable of perfection, and quite as worthy of
      respect as the eye and the ear. A person who lacks this sense is deprived
      of an exquisite faculty, the faculty of discerning the quality of food,
      just as one may lack the faculty of discerning the beauties of a book or
      of a work of art; it means to be deprived of an essential organ, of
      something that belongs to higher humanity; it means to belong to one of
      those innumerable classes of the infirm, the unfortunate, and the fools of
      which our race is composed; it means to have the mouth of an animal, in a
      word, just like the mind of an animal. A man who cannot distinguish one
      kind of lobster from another; a herring—that admirable fish that has
      all the flavors, all the odors of the sea—from a mackerel or a
      whiting; and a Cresane from a Duchess pear, may be compared to a man who
      should mistake Balzac for Eugene Sue; a symphony of Beethoven for a
      military march composed by the bandmaster of a regiment; and the Apollo
      Belvidere for the statue of General de Blaumont.

“Oh, that''s true, you do not know. It is easy to tell that you do
      not belong to Gisors. I told you just now, my dear boy, that they called
      the inhabitants of this town ''the proud people of Gisors,'' and never was
      an epithet better deserved. But let us finish breakfast first, and then I
      will tell you about our town and take you to see it.”

He stopped talking every now and then while he slowly drank a glass of
      wine which he gazed at affectionately as he replaced the glass on the
      table.

It was amusing to see him, with a napkin tied around his neck, his cheeks
      flushed, his eyes eager, and his whiskers spreading round his mouth as it
      kept working.

He made me eat until I was almost choking. Then, as I was about to return
      to the railway station, he seized me by the arm and took me through the
      streets. The town, of a pretty, provincial type, commanded by its citadel,
      the most curious monument of military architecture of the seventh century
      to be found in France, overlooks, in its turn, a long, green valley, where
      the large Norman cows graze and ruminate in the pastures.

“''Gisors, a town of 4,000 inhabitants in the department of Eure,
      mentioned in Caesar''s Commentaries: Caesaris ostium, then Caesartium,
      Caesortium, Gisortium, Gisors.'' I shall not take you to visit the old
      Roman encampment, the remains of which are still in existence.”

“My dear friend, it seems to me that you are affected with a special
      malady that, as a doctor, you ought to study; it is called the spirit of
      provincialism.”

“The spirit of provincialism, my friend, is nothing but natural
      patriotism,” he said. “I love my house, my town and my
      province because I discover in them the customs of my own village; but if
      I love my country, if I become angry when a neighbor sets foot in it, it
      is because I feel that my home is in danger, because the frontier that I
      do not know is the high road to my province. For instance, I am a Norman,
      a true Norman; well, in spite of my hatred of the German and my desire for
      revenge, I do not detest them, I do not hate them by instinct as I hate
      the English, the real, hereditary natural enemy of the Normans; for the
      English traversed this soil inhabited by my ancestors, plundered and
      ravaged it twenty times, and my aversion to this perfidious people was
      transmitted to me at birth by my father. See, here is the statue of the
      general.”

“General Blaumont! We had to have a statue. We are not ''the proud
      people of Gisors'' for nothing! So we discovered General de Blaumont. Look
      in this bookseller''s window.”

He drew me towards the bookstore, where about fifteen red, yellow and blue
      volumes attracted the eye. As I read the titles, I began to laugh
      idiotically. They read:

Gisors, its origin, its future, by M. X. . . ., member of several learned
      societies; History of Gisors, by the Abbe A . . .; Gisors from the time of
      Caesar to the present day, by M. B. . . ., Landowner; Gisors and its
      environs, by Doctor C. D. . . .; The Glories of Gisors, by a Discoverer.

“My friend,” resumed Marambot, “not a year, not a single
      year, you understand, passes without a fresh history of Gisors being
      published here; we now have twenty-three.”

“Oh, I will not mention them all, only the principal ones. We had
      first General de Blaumont, then Baron Davillier, the celebrated ceramist
      who explored Spain and the Balearic Isles, and brought to the notice of
      collectors the wonderful Hispano-Arabic china. In literature we have a
      very clever journalist, now dead, Charles Brainne, and among those who are
      living, the very eminent editor of the Nouvelliste de Rouen, Charles
      Lapierre . . . and many others, many others.”

We were traversing along street with a gentle incline, with a June sun
      beating down on it and driving the residents into their houses.

Suddenly there appeared at the farther end of the street a drunken man who
      was staggering along, with his head forward his arms and legs limp. He
      would walk forward rapidly three, six, or ten steps and then stop. When
      these energetic movements landed him in the middle of the road he stopped
      short and swayed on his feet, hesitating between falling and a fresh
      start. Then he would dart off in any direction, sometimes falling against
      the wall of a house, against which he seemed to be fastened, as though he
      were trying to get in through the wall. Then he would suddenly turn round
      and look ahead of him, his mouth open and his eyes blinking in the
      sunlight, and getting away from the wall by a movement of the hips, he
      started off once more.

A little yellow dog, a half-starved cur, followed him, barking; stopping
      when he stopped, and starting off when he started.

“Oh, that is what we call drunkards round here. The name comes from
      an old story which has now become a legend, although it is true in all
      respects.”

There lived formerly in this town a very upright old lady who was a great
      guardian of morals and was called Mme. Husson. You know, I am telling you
      the real names and not imaginary ones. Mme. Husson took a special interest
      in good works, in helping the poor and encouraging the deserving. She was
      a little woman with a quick walk and wore a black wig. She was
      ceremonious, polite, on very good terms with the Almighty in the person of
      Abby Malon, and had a profound horror, an inborn horror of vice, and, in
      particular, of the vice the Church calls lasciviousness. Any irregularity
      before marriage made her furious, exasperated her till she was beside
      herself.

Now, this was the period when they presented a prize as a reward of virtue
      to any girl in the environs of Paris who was found to be chaste. She was
      called a Rosiere, and Mme. Husson got the idea that she would institute a
      similar ceremony at Gisors. She spoke about it to Abbe Malon, who at once
      made out a list of candidates.

However, Mme. Husson had a servant, an old woman called Francoise, as
      upright as her mistress. As soon as the priest had left, madame called the
      servant and said:

“Here, Francoise, here are the girls whose names M. le cure has
      submitted to me for the prize of virtue; try and find out what reputation
      they bear in the district.”

And Francoise set out. She collected all the scandal, all the stories, all
      the tattle, all the suspicions. That she might omit nothing, she wrote it
      all down together with her memoranda in her housekeeping book, and handed
      it each morning to Mme. Husson, who, after adjusting her spectacles on her
      thin nose, read as follows:

Josephine Durdent, who is not believed to have committed a fault, although
      she corresponds with young Oportun, who is in service in Rouen, and who
      sent her a present of a cap by diligence.

Not one came out unscathed in this rigorous inquisition. Francoise
      inquired of everyone, neighbors, drapers, the principal, the teaching
      sisters at school, and gathered the slightest details.

As there is not a girl in the world about whom gossips have not found
      something to say, there was not found in all the countryside one young
      girl whose name was free from some scandal.

But Mme. Husson desired that the “Rosiere” of Gisors, like
      Caesar''s wife, should be above suspicion, and she was horrified, saddened
      and in despair at the record in her servant''s housekeeping account-book.

They then extended their circle of inquiries to the neighboring villages;
      but with no satisfaction.

They consulted the mayor. His candidates failed. Those of Dr. Barbesol
      were equally unlucky, in spite of the exactness of his scientific
      vouchers.

“You see, madame, that if you wish to give a prize to anyone, there
      is only Isidore in all the country round.”

Mme. Husson remained thoughtful. She knew him well, this Isidore, the son
      of Virginie the greengrocer. His proverbial virtue had been the delight of
      Gisors for several years, and served as an entertaining theme of
      conversation in the town, and of amusement to the young girls who loved to
      tease him. He was past twenty-one, was tall, awkward, slow and timid;
      helped his mother in the business, and spent his days picking over fruit
      and vegetables, seated on a chair outside the door.

He had an abnormal dread of a petticoat and cast down his eyes whenever a
      female customer looked at him smilingly, and this well-known timidity made
      him the butt of all the wags in the country.

Bold words, coarse expressions, indecent allusions, brought the color to
      his cheeks so quickly that Dr. Barbesol had nicknamed him “the
      thermometer of modesty.” Was he as innocent as he looked?
      ill-natured people asked themselves. Was it the mere presentiment of
      unknown and shameful mysteries or else indignation at the relations
      ordained as the concomitant of love that so strongly affected the son of
      Virginie the greengrocer? The urchins of the neighborhood as they ran past
      the shop would fling disgusting remarks at him just to see him cast down
      his eyes. The girls amused themselves by walking up and down before him,
      cracking jokes that made him go into the store. The boldest among them
      teased him to his face just to have a laugh, to amuse themselves, made
      appointments with him and proposed all sorts of things.

Certainly, Isidore was an exceptional case of notorious, unassailable
      virtue. No one, among the most sceptical, most incredulous, would have
      been able, would have dared, to suspect Isidore of the slightest
      infraction of any law of morality. He had never been seen in a cafe, never
      been seen at night on the street. He went to bed at eight o''clock and rose
      at four. He was a perfection, a pearl.

But Mme. Husson still hesitated. The idea of substituting a boy for a
      girl, a “rosier” for a “rosiere,” troubled her,
      worried her a little, and she resolved to consult Abbe Malon.

“What do you desire to reward, madame? It is virtue, is it not, and
      nothing but virtue? What does it matter to you, therefore, if it is
      masculine or feminine? Virtue is eternal; it has neither sex nor country;
      it is ''Virtue.''”

“We will have a fine ceremony,” he said. “And another
      year if we can find a girl as worthy as Isidore we will give the reward to
      her. It will even be a good example that we shall set to Nanterre. Let us
      not be exclusive; let us welcome all merit.”

The ceremony was fixed for the 15th of August, the festival of the Virgin
      Mary and of the Emperor Napoleon. The municipality had decided to make an
      imposing ceremony and had built the platform on the couronneaux, a
      delightful extension of the ramparts of the old citadel where I will take
      you presently.

With the natural revulsion of public feeling, the virtue of Isidore,
      ridiculed hitherto, had suddenly become respected and envied, as it would
      bring him in five hundred francs besides a savings bank book, a mountain
      of consideration, and glory enough and to spare. The girls now regretted
      their frivolity, their ridicule, their bold manners; and Isidore, although
      still modest and timid, had now a little contented air that bespoke his
      internal satisfaction.

The evening before the 15th of August the entire Rue Dauphine was
      decorated with flags. Oh, I forgot to tell you why this street had been
      called Rue Dauphine.

It seems that the wife or mother of the dauphin, I do not remember which
      one, while visiting Gisors had been feted so much by the authorities that
      during a triumphal procession through the town she stopped before one of
      the houses in this street, halting the procession, and exclaimed:

They told her the name of the owner, who was sent for and brought, proud
      and embarrassed, before the princess. She alighted from her carriage, went
      into the house, wishing to go over it from top to bottom, and even shut
      herself in one of the rooms alone for a few seconds.

When she came out, the people, flattered at this honor paid to a citizen
      of Gisors, shouted “Long live the dauphine!” But a rhymester
      wrote some words to a refrain, and the street retained the title of her
      royal highness, for

They had scattered flowers all along the road as they do for processions
      at the Fete-Dieu, and the National Guard was present, acting on the orders
      of their chief, Commandant Desbarres, an old soldier of the Grand Army,
      who pointed with pride to the beard of a Cossack cut with a single sword
      stroke from the chin of its owner by the commandant during the retreat in
      Russia, and which hung beside the frame containing the cross of the Legion
      of Honor presented to him by the emperor himself.

The regiment that he commanded was, besides, a picked regiment celebrated
      all through the province, and the company of grenadiers of Gisors was
      called on to attend all important ceremonies for a distance of fifteen to
      twenty leagues. The story goes that Louis Philippe, while reviewing the
      militia of Eure, stopped in astonishment before the company from Gisors,
      exclaiming:

So Commandant Desbarres came at the head of his men, preceded by the band,
      to get Isidore in his mother''s store.

After a little air had been played by the band beneath the windows, the
      “Rosier” himself appeared—on the threshold. He was
      dressed in white duck from head to foot and wore a straw hat with a little
      bunch of orange blossoms as a cockade.

The question of his clothes had bothered Mme. Husson a good deal, and she
      hesitated some time between the black coat of those who make their first
      communion and an entire white suit. But Francoise, her counsellor, induced
      her to decide on the white suit, pointing out that the Rosier would look
      like a swan.

Behind him came his guardian, his godmother, Mme. Husson, in triumph. She
      took his arm to go out of the store, and the mayor placed himself on the
      other side of the Rosier. The drums beat. Commandant Desbarres gave the
      order “Present arms!” The procession resumed its march towards
      the church amid an immense crowd of people who has gathered from the
      neighboring districts.

After a short mass and an affecting discourse by Abbe Malon, they
      continued on their way to the couronneaux, where the banquet was served in
      a tent.

Before taking their seats at table, the mayor gave an address. This is it,
      word for word. I learned it by heart:

“Young man, a woman of means, beloved by the poor and respected by
      the rich, Mme. Husson, whom the whole country is thanking here, through
      me, had the idea, the happy and benevolent idea, of founding in this town
      a prize for virtue, which should serve as a valuable encouragement to the
      inhabitants of this beautiful country.

“You, young man, are the first to be rewarded in this dynasty of
      goodness and chastity. Your name will remain at the head of this list of
      the most deserving, and your life, understand me, your whole life, must
      correspond to this happy commencement. To-day, in presence of this noble
      woman, of these soldier-citizens who have taken up their arms in your
      honor, in presence of this populace, affected, assembled to applaud you,
      or, rather, to applaud virtue, in your person, you make a solemn contract
      with the town, with all of us, to continue until your death the excellent
      example of your youth.

“Do not forget, young man, that you are the first seed cast into
      this field of hope; give us the fruits that we expect of you.”

The “Rosier” was sobbing without knowing why, from a confused
      emotion, from pride and a vague and happy feeling of tenderness.

Then the mayor placed in one hand a silk purse in which gold tingled
      —five hundred francs in gold!—and in his other hand a savings
      bank book. And he said in a solemn tone:

Mme. Husson wiped her eyes, in her turn. Then they all sat down at the
      table where the banquet was served.

The repast was magnificent and seemed interminable. One course followed
      another; yellow cider and red wine in fraternal contact blended in the
      stomach of the guests. The rattle of plates, the sound of voices, and of
      music softly played, made an incessant deep hum, and was dispersed abroad
      in the clear sky where the swallows were flying. Mme. Husson occasionally
      readjusted her black wig, which would slip over on one side, and chatted
      with Abbe Malon. The mayor, who was excited, talked politics with
      Commandant Desbarres, and Isidore ate, drank, as if he had never eaten or
      drunk before. He helped himself repeatedly to all the dishes, becoming
      aware for the first time of the pleasure of having one''s belly full of
      good things which tickle the palate in the first place. He had let out a
      reef in his belt and, without speaking, and although he was a little
      uneasy at a wine stain on his white waistcoat, he ceased eating in order
      to take up his glass and hold it to his mouth as long as possible, to
      enjoy the taste slowly.

It was time for the toasts. They were many and loudly applauded. Evening
      was approaching and they had been at the table since noon. Fine, milky
      vapors were already floating in the air in the valley, the light
      night-robe of streams and meadows; the sun neared the horizon; the cows
      were lowing in the distance amid the mists of the pasture. The feast was
      over. They returned to Gisors. The procession, now disbanded, walked in
      detachments. Mme. Husson had taken Isidore''s arm and was giving him a
      quantity of urgent, excellent advice.

They stopped at the door of the fruit store, and the “Rosier”
      was left at his mother''s house. She had not come home yet. Having been
      invited by her family to celebrate her son''s triumph, she had taken
      luncheon with her sister after having followed the procession as far as
      the banqueting tent.

So Isidore remained alone in the store, which was growing dark. He sat
      down on a chair, excited by the wine and by pride, and looked about him.
      Carrots, cabbages, and onions gave out their strong odor of vegetables in
      the closed room, that coarse smell of the garden blended with the sweet,
      penetrating odor of strawberries and the delicate, slight, evanescent
      fragrance of a basket of peaches.

The “Rosier” took one of these and ate it, although he was as
      full as an egg. Then, all at once, wild with joy, he began to dance about
      the store, and something rattled in his waistcoat.

He was surprised, and put his hand in his pocket and brought out the purse
      containing the five hundred francs, which he had forgotten in his
      agitation. Five hundred francs! What a fortune! He poured the gold pieces
      out on the counter and spread them out with his big hand with a slow,
      caressing touch so as to see them all at the same time. There were
      twenty-five, twenty-five round gold pieces, all gold! They glistened on
      the wood in the dim light and he counted them over and over, one by one.
      Then he put them back in the purse, which he replaced in his pocket.

Who will ever know or who can tell what a terrible conflict took place in
      the soul of the “Rosier” between good and evil, the tumultuous
      attack of Satan, his artifices, the temptations which he offered to this
      timid virgin heart? What suggestions, what imaginations, what desires were
      not invented by the evil one to excite and destroy this chosen one? He
      seized his hat, Mme. Husson''s saint, his hat, which still bore the little
      bunch of orange blossoms, and going out through the alley at the back of
      the house, he disappeared in the darkness.

Virginie, the fruiterer, on learning that her son had returned, went home
      at once, and found the house empty. She waited, without thinking anything
      about it at first; but at the end of a quarter of an hour she made
      inquiries. The neighbors had seen Isidore come home and had not seen him
      go out again. They began to look for him, but could not find him. His
      mother, in alarm, went to the mayor. The mayor knew nothing, except that
      he had left him at the door of his home. Mme. Husson had just retired when
      they informed her that her protege had disappeared. She immediately put on
      her wig, dressed herself and went to Virginie''s house. Virginie, whose
      plebeian soul was readily moved, was weeping copiously amid her cabbages,
      carrots and onions.

They feared some accident had befallen him. What could it be? Commandant
      Desbarres notified the police, who made a circuit of the town, and on the
      high road to Pontoise they found the little bunch of orange blossoms. It
      was placed on a table around which the authorities were deliberating. The
      “Rosier” must have been the victim of some stratagem, some
      trick, some jealousy; but in what way? What means had been employed to
      kidnap this innocent creature, and with what object?

The following evening, when the coach passed by on its return from Paris,
      Gisors learned with astonishment that its “Rosier” had stopped
      the vehicle at a distance of about two hundred metres from the town, had
      climbed up on it and paid his fare, handing over a gold piece and
      receiving the change, and that he had quietly alighted in the centre of
      the great city.

There was great excitement all through the countryside. Letters passed
      between the mayor and the chief of police in Paris, but brought no result.

Now, one morning, Dr. Barbesol, who had gone out early, perceived, sitting
      on a doorstep, a man dressed in a grimy linen suit, who was sleeping with
      his head leaning against the wall. He approached him and recognized
      Isidore. He tried to rouse him, but did not succeed in doing so. The ex-“Rosier”
      was in that profound, invincible sleep that is alarming, and the doctor,
      in surprise, went to seek assistance to help him in carrying the young man
      to Boncheval''s drugstore. When they lifted him up they found an empty
      bottle under him, and when the doctor sniffed at it, he declared that it
      had contained brandy. That gave a suggestion as to what treatment he would
      require. They succeeded in rousing him.

Isidore was drunk, drunk and degraded by a week of guzzling, drunk and so
      disgusting that a ragman would not have touched him. His beautiful white
      duck suit was a gray rag, greasy, muddy, torn, and destroyed, and he smelt
      of the gutter and of vice.

He was washed, sermonized, shut up, and did not leave the house for four
      days. He seemed ashamed and repentant. They could not find on him either
      his purse, containing the five hundred francs, or the bankbook, or even
      his silver watch, a sacred heirloom left by his father, the fruiterer.

On the fifth day he ventured into the Rue Dauphine, Curious glances
      followed him and he walked along with a furtive expression in his eyes and
      his head bent down. As he got outside the town towards the valley they
      lost sight of him; but two hours later he returned laughing and rolling
      against the walls. He was drunk, absolutely drunk.

Driven from home by his mother, he became a wagon driver, and drove the
      charcoal wagons for the Pougrisel firm, which is still in existence.

His reputation as a drunkard became so well known and spread so far that
      even at Evreux they talked of Mme. Husson''s “Rosier,” and the
      sots of the countryside have been given that nickname.

We had arrived at the old citadel, a pile of ruined walls dominated by the
      enormous tower of St. Thomas of Canterbury and the one called the
      Prisoner''s Tower.

Marambot told me the story of this prisoner, who, with the aid of a nail,
      covered the walls of his dungeon with sculptures, tracing the reflections
      of the sun as it glanced through the narrow slit of a loophole.

I also learned that Clothaire II had given the patrimony of Gisors to his
      cousin, Saint Romain, bishop of Rouen; that Gisors ceased to be the
      capital of the whole of Vexin after the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte;
      that the town is the chief strategic centre of all that portion of France,
      and that in consequence of this advantage she was taken and retaken over
      and over again. At the command of William the Red, the eminent engineer,
      Robert de Bellesme, constructed there a powerful fortress that was
      attacked later by Louis le Gros, then by the Norman barons, was defended
      by Robert de Candos, was finally ceded to Louis le Gros by Geoffry
      Plantagenet, was retaken by the English in consequence of the treachery of
      the Knights-Templars, was contested by Philippe-Augustus and Richard the
      Lionhearted, was set on fire by Edward III of England, who could not take
      the castle, was again taken by the English in 1419, restored later to
      Charles VIII by Richard de Marbury, was taken by the Duke of Calabria
      occupied by the League, inhabited by Henry IV, etc., etc.

“What beggars, those English! And what sots, my boy; they are all
      ''Rosiers,'' those hypocrites!”

Then, after a silence, stretching out his arm towards the tiny river that
      glistened in the meadows, he said:

“Did you know that Henry Monnier was one of the most untiring
      fishermen on the banks of the Epte?”

The two cottages stood beside each other at the foot of a hill near a
      little seashore resort. The two peasants labored hard on the unproductive
      soil to rear their little ones, and each family had four.

Before the adjoining doors a whole troop of urchins played and tumbled
      about from morning till night. The two eldest were six years old, and the
      youngest were about fifteen months; the marriages, and afterward the
      births, having taken place nearly simultaneously in both families.

The two mothers could hardly distinguish their own offspring among the
      lot, and as for the fathers, they were altogether at sea. The eight names
      danced in their heads; they were always getting them mixed up; and when
      they wished to call one child, the men often called three names before
      getting the right one.

The first of the two cottages, as you came up from the bathing beach,
      Rolleport, was occupied by the Tuvaches, who had three girls and one boy;
      the other house sheltered the Vallins, who had one girl and three boys.

They all subsisted frugally on soup, potatoes and fresh air. At seven
      o''clock in the morning, then at noon, then at six o''clock in the evening,
      the housewives got their broods together to give them their food, as the
      gooseherds collect their charges. The children were seated, according to
      age, before the wooden table, varnished by fifty years of use; the mouths
      of the youngest hardly reaching the level of the table. Before them was
      placed a bowl filled with bread, soaked in the water in which the potatoes
      had been boiled, half a cabbage and three onions; and the whole line ate
      until their hunger was appeased. The mother herself fed the smallest.

A small pot roast on Sunday was a feast for all; and the father on this
      day sat longer over the meal, repeating: “I wish we could have this
      every day.”

One afternoon, in the month of August, a phaeton stopped suddenly in front
      of the cottages, and a young woman, who was driving the horses, said to
      the gentleman sitting at her side:

“Oh, look at all those children, Henri! How pretty they are,
      tumbling about in the dust, like that!”

The man did not answer, accustomed to these outbursts of admiration, which
      were a pain and almost a reproach to him. The young woman continued:

“I must hug them! Oh, how I should like to have one of them—that
      one there—the little tiny one!”

Springing down from the carriage, she ran toward the children, took one of
      the two youngest—a Tuvache child—and lifting it up in her
      arms, she kissed him passionately on his dirty cheeks, on his tousled hair
      daubed with earth, and on his little hands, with which he fought
      vigorously, to get away from the caresses which displeased him.

Then she got into the carriage again, and drove off at a lively trot. But
      she returned the following week, and seating herself on the ground, took
      the youngster in her arms, stuffed him with cakes; gave candies to all the
      others, and played with them like a young girl, while the husband waited
      patiently in the carriage.

She returned again; made the acquaintance of the parents, and reappeared
      every day with her pockets full of dainties and pennies.

One morning, on arriving, her husband alighted with her, and without
      stopping to talk to the children, who now knew her well, she entered the
      farmer''s cottage.

They were busy chopping wood for the fire. They rose to their feet in
      surprise, brought forward chairs, and waited expectantly.

“My good people, I have come to see you, because I should like—I
      should like to take—your little boy with me—”

She recovered her breath, and continued: “We are alone, my husband
      and I. We would keep it. Are you willing?”

“My wife has not made her meaning clear. We wish to adopt him, but
      he will come back to see you. If he turns out well, as there is every
      reason to expect, he will be our heir. If we, perchance, should have
      children, he will share equally with them; but if he should not reward our
      care, we should give him, when he comes of age, a sum of twenty thousand
      francs, which shall be deposited immediately in his name, with a lawyer.
      As we have thought also of you, we should pay you, until your death, a
      pension of one hundred francs a month. Do you understand me?”

“You want me to sell you Charlot? Oh, no, that''s not the sort of
      thing to ask of a mother! Oh, no! That would be an abomination!”

The man, grave and deliberate, said nothing; but approved of what his wife
      said by a continued nodding of his head.

Madame d''Hubieres, in dismay, began to weep; turning to her husband, with
      a voice full of tears, the voice of a child used to having all its wishes
      gratified, she stammered:

Then he made a last attempt: “But, my friends, think of the child''s
      future, of his happiness, of—”

“It''s all considered! It''s all understood! Get out of here, and
      don''t let me see you again—the idea of wanting to take away a child
      like that!”

Madame d''Hubieres remembered that there were two children, quite little,
      and she asked, through her tears, with the tenacity of a wilful and
      spoiled woman:

Father Tuvache answered: “No, it is our neighbors''. You can go to
      them if you wish.” And he went back into his house, whence resounded
      the indignant voice of his wife.

The Vallins were at table, slowly eating slices of bread which they
      parsimoniously spread with a little rancid butter on a plate between the
      two.

M. d''Hubieres recommenced his proposals, but with more insinuations, more
      oratorical precautions, more shrewdness.

The two country people shook their heads, in sign of refusal, but when
      they learned that they were to have a hundred francs a month, they
      considered the matter, consulting one another by glances, much disturbed.
      They kept silent for a long time, tortured, hesitating. At last the woman
      asked: “What do you say to it, man?” In a weighty tone he
      said: “I say that it''s not to be despised.”

Madame d''Hubieres, trembling with anguish, spoke of the future of their
      child, of his happiness, and of the money which he could give them later.

The peasant asked: “This pension of twelve hundred francs, will it
      be promised before a lawyer?”

“A hundred francs a month is not enough to pay for depriving us of
      the child. That child would be working in a few years; we must have a
      hundred and twenty francs.”

Tapping her foot with impatience, Madame d''Hubieres granted it at once,
      and, as she wished to carry off the child with her, she gave a hundred
      francs extra, as a present, while her husband drew up a paper. And the
      young woman, radiant, carried off the howling brat, as one carries away a
      wished-for knick-knack from a shop.

The Tuvaches, from their door, watched her departure, silent, serious,
      perhaps regretting their refusal.

Nothing more was heard of little Jean Vallin. The parents went to the
      lawyer every month to collect their hundred and twenty francs. They had
      quarrelled with their neighbors, because Mother Tuvache grossly insulted
      them, continually, repeating from door to door that one must be unnatural
      to sell one''s child; that it was horrible, disgusting, bribery. Sometimes
      she would take her Charlot in her arms, ostentatiously exclaiming, as if
      he understood:

“I didn''t sell you, I didn''t! I didn''t sell you, my little one! I''m
      not rich, but I don''t sell my children!”

The Vallins lived comfortably, thanks to the pension. That was the cause
      of the unappeasable fury of the Tuvaches, who had remained miserably poor.
      Their eldest went away to serve his time in the army; Charlot alone
      remained to labor with his old father, to support the mother and two
      younger sisters.

He had reached twenty-one years when, one morning, a brilliant carriage
      stopped before the two cottages. A young gentleman, with a gold
      watch-chain, got out, giving his hand to an aged, white-haired lady. The
      old lady said to him: “It is there, my child, at the second house.”
      And he entered the house of the Vallins as though at home.

The old mother was washing her aprons; the infirm father slumbered at the
      chimney-corner. Both raised their heads, and the young man said:

They both stood up, frightened! In a flutter, the peasant woman dropped
      her soap into the water, and stammered:

He took her in his arms and hugged her, repeating: “Good-morning,
      mamma,” while the old man, all a-tremble, said, in his calm tone
      which he never lost: “Here you are, back again, Jean,” as if
      he had just seen him a month ago.

When they had got to know one another again, the parents wished to take
      their boy out in the neighborhood, and show him. They took him to the
      mayor, to the deputy, to the cure, and to the schoolmaster.

Charlot, standing on the threshold of his cottage, watched him pass. In
      the evening, at supper, he said to the old people: “You must have
      been stupid to let the Vallins'' boy be taken.”

“Yes, I reproach you for having been such fools. Parents like you
      make the misfortune of their children. You deserve that I should leave
      you.” The old woman wept over her plate. She moaned, as she
      swallowed the spoonfuls of soup, half of which she spilled: “One may
      kill one''s self to bring up children!”

Then the boy said, roughly: “I''d rather not have been born than be
      what I am. When I saw the other, my heart stood still. I said to myself:
      ''See what I should have been now!''” He got up: “See here, I
      feel that I would do better not to stay here, because I would throw it up
      to you from morning till night, and I would make your life miserable. I''ll
      never forgive you for that!”

He continued: “No, the thought of that would be too much. I''d rather
      look for a living somewhere else.”

He opened the door. A sound of voices came in at the door. The Vallins
      were celebrating the return of their child.

In society he was called “Handsome Signoles.” His name was
      Vicomte Gontran-Joseph de Signoles.

An orphan, and possessed of an ample fortune, he cut quite a dash, as it
      is called. He had an attractive appearance and manner, could talk well,
      had a certain inborn elegance, an air of pride and nobility, a good
      mustache, and a tender eye, that always finds favor with women.

He was in great request at receptions, waltzed to perfection, and was
      regarded by his own sex with that smiling hostility accorded to the
      popular society man. He had been suspected of more than one love affair,
      calculated to enhance the reputation of a bachelor. He lived a happy,
      peaceful life—a life of physical and mental well-being. He had won
      considerable fame as a swordsman, and still more as a marksman.

“When the time comes for me to fight a duel,” he said, “I
      shall choose pistols. With such a weapon I am sure to kill my man.”

One evening, having accompanied two women friends of his with their
      husbands to the theatre, he invited them to take some ice cream at
      Tortoni''s after the performance. They had been seated a few minutes in the
      restaurant when Signoles noticed that a man was staring persistently at
      one of the ladies. She seemed annoyed, and lowered her eyes. At last she
      said to her husband:

“Nonsense! Don''t take any notice of him. If we were to bother our
      heads about all the ill-mannered people we should have no time for
      anything else.”

But the vicomte abruptly left his seat. He could not allow this insolent
      fellow to spoil an ice for a guest of his. It was for him to take
      cognizance of the offence, since it was through him that his friends had
      come to the restaurant. He went across to the man and said:

“Sir, you are staring at those ladies in a manner I cannot permit. I
      must ask you to desist from your rudeness.”

“Take care, sir,” said the vicomte between his teeth, “or
      you will force me to extreme measures.”

The man replied with a single word—a foul word, which could be heard
      from one end of the restaurant to the other, and which startled every one
      there. All those whose backs were toward the two disputants turned round;
      all the others raised their heads; three waiters spun round on their heels
      like tops; the two lady cashiers jumped, as if shot, then turned their
      bodies simultaneously, like two automata worked by the same spring.

There was dead silence. Then suddenly a sharp, crisp sound. The vicomte
      had slapped his adversary''s face. Every one rose to interfere. Cards were
      exchanged.

When the vicomte reached home he walked rapidly up and down his room for
      some minutes. He was in a state of too great agitation to think
      connectedly. One idea alone possessed him: a duel. But this idea aroused
      in him as yet no emotion of any kind. He had done what he was bound to do;
      he had proved himself to be what he ought to be. He would be talked about,
      approved, congratulated. He repeated aloud, speaking as one does when
      under the stress of great mental disturbance:

“What a brute of a man!” Then he sat down, and began to
      reflect. He would have to find seconds as soon as morning came. Whom
      should he choose? He bethought himself of the most influential and
      best-known men of his acquaintance. His choice fell at last on the Marquis
      de la Tour-Noire and Colonel Bourdin-a nobleman and a soldier. That would
      be just the thing. Their names would carry weight in the newspapers. He
      was thirsty, and drank three glasses of water, one after another; then he
      walked up and down again. If he showed himself brave, determined, prepared
      to face a duel in deadly earnest, his adversary would probably draw back
      and proffer excuses. He picked up the card he had taken from his pocket
      and thrown on a table. He read it again, as he had already read it, first
      at a glance in the restaurant, and afterward on the way home in the light
      of each gas lamp: “Georges Lamil, 51 Rue Moncey.” That was
      all.

He examined closely this collection of letters, which seemed to him
      mysterious, fraught with many meanings. Georges Lamil! Who was the man?
      What was his profession? Why had he stared so at the woman? Was it not
      monstrous that a stranger, an unknown, should thus all at once upset one''s
      whole life, simply because it had pleased him to stare rudely at a woman?
      And the vicomte once more repeated aloud:

Then he stood motionless, thinking, his eyes still fixed on the card.
      Anger rose in his heart against this scrap of paper—a resentful
      anger, mingled with a strange sense of uneasiness. It was a stupid
      business altogether! He took up a penknife which lay open within reach,
      and deliberately stuck it into the middle of the printed name, as if he
      were stabbing some one.

So he would have to fight! Should he choose swords or pistols?—for
      he considered himself as the insulted party. With the sword he would risk
      less, but with the pistol there was some chance of his adversary backing
      out. A duel with swords is rarely fatal, since mutual prudence prevents
      the combatants from fighting close enough to each other for a point to
      enter very deep. With pistols he would seriously risk his life; but, on
      the other hand, he might come out of the affair with flying colors, and
      without a duel, after all.

The sound of his own voice startled him, and he looked nervously round the
      room. He felt unstrung. He drank another glass of water, and then began
      undressing, preparatory to going to bed.

“I have all day to-morrow,” he reflected, “for setting
      my affairs in order. I must sleep now, in order to be calm when the time
      comes.”

He was very warm in bed, but he could not succeed in losing consciousness.
      He tossed and turned, remained for five minutes lying on his back, then
      changed to his left side, then rolled over to his right. He was thirsty
      again, and rose to drink. Then a qualm seized him:

Why did his heart beat so uncontrollably at every well-known sound in his
      room? When the clock was about to strike, the prefatory grating of its
      spring made him start, and for several seconds he panted for breath, so
      unnerved was he.

He began to reason with himself on the possibility of such a thing:
      “Could I by any chance be afraid?”

No, indeed; he could not be afraid, since he was resolved to proceed to
      the last extremity, since he was irrevocably determined to fight without
      flinching. And yet he was so perturbed in mind and body that he asked
      himself:

And this doubt, this fearful question, took possession of him. If an
      irresistible power, stronger than his own will, were to quell his courage,
      what would happen? He would certainly go to the place appointed; his will
      would force him that far. But supposing, when there, he were to tremble or
      faint? And he thought of his social standing, his reputation, his name.

And he suddenly determined to get up and look at himself in the glass. He
      lighted his candle. When he saw his face reflected in the mirror he
      scarcely recognized it. He seemed to see before him a man whom he did not
      know. His eyes looked disproportionately large, and he was very pale.

He remained standing before the mirror. He put out his tongue, as if to
      examine the state of his health, and all at once the thought flashed into
      his mind:

“At this time the day after to-morrow I may be dead. This person in
      front of me, this ''I'' whom I see in the glass, will perhaps be no more.
      What! Here I am, I look at myself, I feel myself to be alive—and yet
      in twenty-four hours I may be lying on that bed, with closed eyes, dead,
      cold, inanimate.”

He turned round, and could see himself distinctly lying on his back on the
      couch he had just quitted. He had the hollow face and the limp hands of
      death.

Then he became afraid of his bed, and to avoid seeing it went to his
      smoking-room. He mechanically took a cigar, lighted it, and began walking
      back and forth. He was cold; he took a step toward the bell, to wake his
      valet, but stopped with hand raised toward the bell rope.

And, instead of ringing, he made a fire himself. His hands quivered
      nervously as they touched various objects. His head grew dizzy, his
      thoughts confused, disjointed, painful; a numbness seized his spirit, as
      if he had been drinking.

His whole body trembled spasmodically; he rose, and, going to the window,
      drew back the curtains.

The day—a summer day-was breaking. The pink sky cast a glow on the
      city, its roofs, and its walls. A flush of light enveloped the awakened
      world, like a caress from the rising sun, and the glimmer of dawn kindled
      new hope in the breast of the vicomte. What a fool he was to let himself
      succumb to fear before anything was decided—before his seconds had
      interviewed those of Georges Lamil, before he even knew whether he would
      have to fight or not!

His seconds, the marquis and the colonel, placed themselves at his
      disposal, and, having shaken him warmly by the hand, began to discuss
      details.

“Twenty paces—at a given signal—the arm to be raised,
      not lowered—shots to be exchanged until one or other is seriously
      wounded.”

“Excellent conditions,” declared the colonel in a satisfied
      tone. “You are a good shot; all the chances are in your favor.”

And they parted. The vicomte returned home to wait for them. His
      agitation, only temporarily allayed, now increased momentarily. He felt,
      in arms, legs and chest, a sort of trembling—a continuous vibration;
      he could not stay still, either sitting or standing. His mouth was
      parched, and he made every now and then a clicking movement of the tongue,
      as if to detach it from his palate.

He attempted, to take luncheon, but could not eat. Then it occurred to him
      to seek courage in drink, and he sent for a decanter of rum, of which he
      swallowed, one after another, six small glasses.

A burning warmth, followed by a deadening of the mental faculties, ensued.
      He said to himself:

But at the end of an hour he had emptied the decanter, and his agitation
      was worse than ever. A mad longing possessed him to throw himself on the
      ground, to bite, to scream. Night fell.

A ring at the bell so unnerved him that he had not the strength to rise to
      receive his seconds.

He dared not even to speak to them, wish them good-day, utter a single
      word, lest his changed voice should betray him.

“All is arranged as you wished,” said the colonel. “Your
      adversary claimed at first the privilege of the offended part; but he
      yielded almost at once, and accepted your conditions. His seconds are two
      military men.”

“Please excuse us if we do not stay now, for we have a good deal to
      see to yet. We shall want a reliable doctor, since the duel is not to end
      until a serious wound has been inflicted; and you know that bullets are
      not to be trifled with. We must select a spot near some house to which the
      wounded party can be carried if necessary. In fact, the arrangements will
      take us another two or three hours at least.”

When he was once more alone he felt as though he should go mad. His
      servant having lighted the lamps, he sat down at his table to write some
      letters. When he had traced at the top of a sheet of paper the words:
      “This is my last will and testament,” he started from his
      seat, feeling himself incapable of connected thought, of decision in
      regard to anything.

So he was going to fight! He could no longer avoid it. What, then,
      possessed him? He wished to fight, he was fully determined to fight, and
      yet, in spite of all his mental effort, in spite of the exertion of all
      his will power, he felt that he could not even preserve the strength
      necessary to carry him through the ordeal. He tried to conjure up a
      picture of the duel, his own attitude, and that of his enemy.

Every now and then his teeth chattered audibly. He thought he would read,
      and took down Chateauvillard''s Rules of Dueling. Then he said:

He remembered Baron de Vaux''s book on marksmen, and searched it from end
      to end. Georges Lamil was not mentioned. And yet, if he were not an adept,
      would he have accepted without demur such a dangerous weapon and such
      deadly conditions?

He opened a case of Gastinne Renettes which stood on a small table, and
      took from it a pistol. Next he stood in the correct attitude for firing,
      and raised his arm. But he was trembling from head to foot, and the weapon
      shook in his grasp.

He looked at the little black, death-spitting hole at the end of the
      pistol; he thought of dishonor, of the whispers at the clubs, the smiles
      in his friends'' drawing-rooms, the contempt of women, the veiled sneers of
      the newspapers, the insults that would be hurled at him by cowards.

He still looked at the weapon, and raising the hammer, saw the glitter of
      the priming below it. The pistol had been left loaded by some chance, some
      oversight. And the discovery rejoiced him, he knew not why.

If he did not maintain, in presence of his opponent, the steadfast bearing
      which was so necessary to his honor, he would be ruined forever. He would
      be branded, stigmatized as a coward, hounded out of society! And he felt,
      he knew, that he could not maintain that calm, unmoved demeanor. And yet
      he was brave, since the thought that followed was not even rounded to a
      finish in his mind; but, opening his mouth wide, he suddenly plunged the
      barrel of the pistol as far back as his throat, and pressed the trigger.

When the valet, alarmed at the report, rushed into the room he found his
      master lying dead upon his back. A spurt of blood had splashed the white
      paper on the table, and had made a great crimson stain beneath the words:

In the office old Mongilet was considered a type. He was a good old
      employee, who had never been outside Paris but once in his life.

It was the end of July, and each of us, every Sunday, went to roll in the
      grass, or soak in the water in the country near by. Asnieres, Argenteuil,
      Chatou, Borgival, Maisons, Poissy, had their habitues and their ardent
      admirers. We argued about the merits and advantages of all these places,
      celebrated and delightful to all Parsian employees.

“Yes, indeed. I go in an omnibus. When I have had a good luncheon,
      without any hurry, at the wine shop down there, I look up my route with a
      plan of Paris, and the time table of the lines and connections. And then I
      climb up on the box, open my umbrella and off we go. Oh, I see lots of
      things, more than you, I bet! I change my surroundings. It is as though I
      were taking a journey across the world, the people are so different in one
      street and another. I know my Paris better than anyone. And then, there is
      nothing more amusing than the entresols. You would not believe what one
      sees in there at a glance. One guesses at domestic scenes simply at sight
      of the face of a man who is roaring; one is amused on passing by a
      barber''s shop, to see the barber leave his customer whose face is covered
      with lather to look out in the street. One exchanges heartfelt glances
      with the milliners just for fun, as one has no time to alight. Ah, how
      many things one sees!

“It is the drama, the real, the true, the drama of nature, seen as
      the horses trot by. Heavens! I would not give my excursions in the omnibus
      for all your stupid excursions in the woods.”

“He was my office chum. The rascal had a house at Colombes and
      always invited me to spend Sunday with him. He would say:

“''Come along, Maculotte [he called me Maculotte for fun]. You will
      see what a nice excursion we will take.''

“I let myself be entrapped like an animal, and set out, one morning
      by the 8 o''clock train. I arrived at a kind of town, a country town where
      there is nothing to see, and I at length found my way to an old wooden
      door with an iron bell, at the end of an alley between two walls.

“I rang, and waited a long time, and at last the door was opened.
      What was it that opened it? I could not tell at the first glance. A woman
      or an ape? The creature was old, ugly, covered with old clothes that
      looked dirty and wicked. It had chicken''s feathers in its hair and looked
      as though it would devour me.

“It was my friend''s wife. Little Boivin appeared immediately on the
      threshold of a sort of barrack of plaster covered with zinc, that looked
      like a foot stove. He wore white duck trousers covered with stains and a
      dirty Panama hat.

“After shaking my hands warmly, he took me into what he called his
      garden. It was at the end of another alleyway enclosed by high walls and
      was a little square the size of a pocket handkerchief, surrounded by
      houses that were so high that the sun, could reach it only two or three
      hours in the day. Pansies, pinks, wallflowers and a few rose bushes were
      languishing in this well without air, and hot as an oven from the
      refraction of heat from the roofs.

“''I have no trees,'' said Boivin, ''but the neighbors'' walls take
      their place. I have as much shade as in a wood.''

“''You can do me a service. You saw the wife. She is not agreeable,
      eh? To-day, as I had invited you, she gave me clean clothes; but if I spot
      them all is lost. I counted on you to water my plants.''

“I agreed. I took off my coat, rolled up my sleeves, and began to
      work the handle of a kind of pump that wheezed, puffed and rattled like a
      consumptive as it emitted a thread of water like a Wallace drinking
      fountain. It took me ten minutes to water it and I was in a bath of
      perspiration. Boivin directed me:

“The watering pot leaked and my feet got more water than the
      flowers. The bottoms of my trousers were soaking and covered with mud. And
      twenty times running I kept it up, soaking my feet afresh each time, and
      perspiring anew as I worked the handle of the pump. And when I was tired
      out and wanted to stop, Boivin, in a tone of entreaty, said as he put his
      hand on my arm:

“To thank me he gave me a rose, a big rose, but hardly had it
      touched my button-hole than it fell to pieces, leaving only a hard little
      green knot as a decoration. I was surprised, but said nothing.

“We went toward the foot stove. If the garden was in the shade, the
      house, on the other hand, was in the blazing sun, and the sweating room in
      the Turkish bath is not as hot as was my friend''s dining room.

“Three plates at the side of which were some half-washed forks, were
      placed on a table of yellow wood in the middle of which stood an
      earthenware dish containing boiled beef and potatoes. We began to eat.

“A large water bottle full of water lightly colored with wine
      attracted my attention. Boivin, embarrassed, said to his wife:

“''See here, my dear, just on a special occasion, are you not going
      to give us some plain wine?''

“''So that you may both get tipsy, is that it, and stay here gabbing
      all day? A fig for your special occasion!''

“He said no more. After the stew she brought in another dish of
      potatoes cooked with bacon. When this dish was finished, still in silence,
      she announced:

“''Perhaps you have not had enough? Because you bring people here is
      no reason why we should devour all that there is in the house. What is
      there for me to eat this evening?''

“''No, I will not give it to you! As the man has had luncheon here,
      the least he can do is to pay your expenses for the day.''

“Boivin came back to fetch me. As I wished to be polite I bowed to
      the mistress of the house, stammering:

“''That''s all right,'' she replied. ''But do not bring him back drunk,
      for you will have to answer to me, you know!''

“We set out. We had to cross a perfectly bare plain under the
      burning sun. I attempted to gather a flower along the road and gave a cry
      of pain. It had hurt my hand frightfully. They call these plants nettles.
      And, everywhere, there was a smell of manure, enough to turn your stomach.

“We reached the river. Here there was an odor of mud and dirty
      water, and the sun blazed down on the water so that it burned my eyes. I
      begged Boivin to go under cover somewhere. He took me into a kind of
      shanty filled with men, a river boatmen''s tavern.

“I was hungry. I ordered an omelet. But to and behold, at the second
      glass of wine, that beggar, Boivin, lost his head, and I understand why
      his wife gave him water diluted.

“He got up, declaimed, wanted to show his strength, interfered in a
      quarrel between two drunken men who were fighting, and, but for the
      landlord, who came to the rescue, we should both have been killed.

“I dragged him away, holding him up until we reached the first bush
      where I deposited him. I lay down beside him and, it seems, I fell asleep.
      We must certainly have slept a long time, for it was dark when I awoke.
      Boivin was snoring at my side. I shook him; he rose but he was still
      drunk, though a little less so.

“We set out through the darkness across the plain. Boivin said he
      knew the way. He made me turn to the left, then to the right, then to the
      left. We could see neither sky nor earth, and found ourselves lost in the
      midst of a kind of forest of wooden stakes, that came as high as our
      noses. It was a vineyard and these were the supports. There was not a
      single light on the horizon. We wandered about in this vineyard for about
      an hour or two, hesitating, reaching out our arms without finding any
      limit, for we kept retracing our steps.

“At length Boivin fell against a stake that tore his cheek and he
      remained in a sitting posture on the ground, uttering with all his might
      long and resounding hallos, while I screamed ''Help! Help!'' as loud as I
      could, lighting candle-matches to show the way to our rescuers, and also
      to keep up my courage.

“At last a belated peasant heard us and put us on our right road. I
      took Boivin to his home, but as I was leaving him on the threshold of his
      garden, the door opened suddenly and his wife appeared, a candle in her
      hand. She frightened me horribly.

“As soon as she saw her husband, whom she must have been waiting for
      since dark, she screamed, as she darted toward me:

“My, how I made my escape, running all the way to the station, and
      as I thought the fury was pursuing me I shut myself in an inner room as
      the train was not due for half an hour.

Madame Julie Roubere was expecting her elder sister, Madame Henriette
      Letore, who had just returned from a trip to Switzerland.

The Letore household had left nearly five weeks before. Madame Henriette
      had allowed her husband to return alone to their estate in Calvados, where
      some business required his attention, and had come to spend a few days in
      Paris with her sister. Night came on. In the quiet parlor Madame Roubere
      was reading in the twilight in an absent-minded way, raising her, eyes
      whenever she heard a sound.

At last, she heard a ring at the door, and her sister appeared, wrapped in
      a travelling cloak. And without any formal greeting, they clasped each
      other in an affectionate embrace, only desisting for a moment to give each
      other another hug. Then they talked about their health, about their
      respective families, and a thousand other things, gossiping, jerking out
      hurried, broken sentences as they followed each other about, while Madame
      Henriette was removing her hat and veil.

It was now quite dark. Madame Roubere rang for a lamp, and as soon as it
      was brought in, she scanned her sister''s face, and was on the point of
      embracing her once more. But she held back, scared and astonished at the
      other''s appearance.

On her temples Madame Letore had two large locks of white hair. All the
      rest of her hair was of a glossy, raven-black hue; but there alone, at
      each side of her head, ran, as it were, two silvery streams which were
      immediately lost in the black mass surrounding them. She was,
      nevertheless, only twenty-four years old, and this change had come on
      suddenly since her departure for Switzerland.

Without moving, Madame Roubere gazed at her in amazement, tears rising to
      her eyes, as she thought that some mysterious and terrible calamity must
      have befallen her sister. She asked:

But Madame Roubere impetuously seized her by the shoulders, and with a
      searching glance at her, repeated:

“What is the matter with you? Tell me what is the matter with you.
      And if you tell me a falsehood, I''ll soon find it out.”

They remained face to face, and Madame Henriette, who looked as if she
      were about to faint, had two pearly tears in the corners of her drooping
      eyes.

Then, when she had grown a little calmer, when the heaving of her breast
      had subsided, she commenced to unbosom herself, as if to cast forth this
      secret from herself, to empty this sorrow of hers into a sympathetic
      heart.

Thereupon, holding each other''s hands tightly clasped, the two women went
      over to a sofa in a dark corner of the room, into which they sank, and the
      younger sister, passing her arm over the elder one''s neck, and drawing her
      close to her heart, listened.

“Oh! I know that there was no excuse for me; I do not understand
      myself, and since that day I feel as if I were mad. Be careful, my child,
      about yourself—be careful! If you only knew how weak we are, how
      quickly we yield, and fall. It takes so little, so little, so little, a
      moment of tenderness, one of those sudden fits of melancholy which come
      over you, one of those longings to open your arms, to love, to cherish
      something, which we all have at certain moments.

“You know my husband, and you know how fond I am of him; but he is
      mature and sensible, and cannot even comprehend the tender vibrations of a
      woman''s heart. He is always the same, always good, always smiling, always
      kind, always perfect. Oh! how I sometimes have wished that he would clasp
      me roughly in his arms, that he would embrace me with those slow, sweet
      kisses which make two beings intermingle, which are like mute confidences!
      How I have wished that he were foolish, even weak, so that he should have
      need of me, of my caresses, of my tears!

“And yet the thought of deceiving him never entered my mind. Now it
      has happened, without love, without reason, without anything, simply
      because the moon shone one night on the Lake of Lucerne.

“During the month when we were travelling together, my husband, with
      his calm indifference, paralyzed my enthusiasm, extinguished my poetic
      ardor. When we were descending the mountain paths at sunrise, when as the
      four horses galloped along with the diligence, we saw, in the transparent
      morning haze, valleys, woods, streams, and villages, I clasped my hands
      with delight, and said to him: ''How beautiful it is, dear! Give me a kiss!
      Kiss me now!'' He only answered, with a smile of chilling kindliness:
      ''There is no reason why we should kiss each other because you like the
      landscape.''

“And his words froze me to the heart. It seems to me that when
      people love each other, they ought to feel more moved by love than ever,
      in the presence of beautiful scenes.

“In fact, I was brimming over with poetry which he kept me from
      expressing. I was almost like a boiler filled with steam and hermetically
      sealed.

“One evening (we had for four days been staying in a hotel at
      Fluelen) Robert, having one of his sick headaches, went to bed immediately
      after dinner, and I went to take a walk all alone along the edge of the
      lake.

“It was a night such as one reads of in fairy tales. The full moon
      showed itself in the middle of the sky; the tall mountains, with their
      snowy crests, seemed to wear silver crowns; the waters of the lake
      glittered with tiny shining ripples. The air was mild, with that kind of
      penetrating warmth which enervates us till we are ready to faint, to be
      deeply affected without any apparent cause. But how sensitive, how
      vibrating the heart is at such moments! how quickly it beats, and how
      intense is its emotion!

“I sat down on the grass, and gazed at that vast, melancholy, and
      fascinating lake, and a strange feeling arose in me; I was seized with an
      insatiable need of love, a revolt against the gloomy dullness of my life.
      What! would it never be my fate to wander, arm in arm, with a man I loved,
      along a moon-kissed bank like this? Was I never to feel on my lips those
      kisses so deep, delicious, and intoxicating which lovers exchange on
      nights that seem to have been made by God for tenderness? Was I never to
      know ardent, feverish love in the moonlit shadows of a summer''s night?

“And I burst out weeping like a crazy woman. I heard something
      stirring behind me. A man stood there, gazing at me. When I turned my head
      round, he recognized me, and, advancing, said:

“It was a young barrister who was travelling with his mother, and
      whom we had often met. His eyes had frequently followed me.

“I was so confused that I did not know what answer to give or what
      to think of the situation. I told him I felt ill.

“He walked on by my side in a natural and respectful manner, and
      began talking to me about what we had seen during our trip. All that I had
      felt he translated into words; everything that made me thrill he
      understood perfectly, better than I did myself. And all of a sudden he
      repeated some verses of Alfred de Musset. I felt myself choking, seized
      with indescribable emotion. It seemed to me that the mountains themselves,
      the lake, the moonlight, were singing to me about things ineffably sweet.

“You see, sister, very often it is not a man that we love, but love
      itself. And your real lover that night was the moonlight.”

The long promenade of La Croisette winds in a curve along the edge of the
      blue water. Yonder, to the right, Esterel juts out into the sea in the
      distance, obstructing the view and shutting out the horizon with its
      pretty southern outline of pointed summits, numerous and fantastic.

To the left, the isles of Sainte Marguerite and Saint Honorat, almost
      level with the water, display their surface, covered with pine trees.

And all along the great gulf, all along the tall mountains that encircle
      Cannes, the white villa residences seem to be sleeping in the sunlight.
      You can see them from a distance, the white houses, scattered from the top
      to the bottom of the mountains, dotting the dark greenery with specks like
      snow.

Those near the water have gates opening on the wide promenade which is
      washed by the quiet waves. The air is soft and balmy. It is one of those
      warm winter days when there is scarcely a breath of cool air. Above the
      walls of the gardens may be seen orange trees and lemon trees full of
      golden fruit. Ladies are walking slowly across the sand of the avenue,
      followed by children rolling hoops, or chatting with gentlemen.

A young woman has just passed out through the door of her coquettish
      little house facing La Croisette. She stops for a moment to gaze at the
      promenaders, smiles, and with an exhausted air makes her way toward an
      empty bench facing the sea. Fatigued after having gone twenty paces, she
      sits down out of breath. Her pale face seems that of a dead woman. She
      coughs, and raises to her lips her transparent fingers as if to stop those
      paroxysms that exhaust her.

She gazes at the sky full of sunshine and swallows, at the zigzag summits
      of the Esterel over yonder, and at the sea, the blue, calm, beautiful sea,
      close beside her.

She knows, however, that she is going to die, that she will never see the
      springtime, that in a year, along the same promenade, these same people
      who pass before her now will come again to breathe the warm air of this
      charming spot, with their children a little bigger, with their hearts all
      filled with hopes, with tenderness, with happiness, while at the bottom of
      an oak coffin, the poor flesh which is still left to her to-day will have
