      knows nothing of all that is told here to this day. And among other
      things, of course, he still did not believe in miracles.

"I tell you that miracles, properly speaking, can''t possibly happen," he
      said, "whatever you like to hold. And I''m prepared to prove it up to the
      hilt."

"Looky here, Mr. Beamish," said Mr. Fotheringay. "Let us clearly
      understand what a miracle is. It''s something contrariwise to the course of
      nature done by power of Will..."

"It''s enough," said I, "to wake——" and stopped short. Where
      was I. — Ta-rra-rara—louder and louder.

I saw my monument (rather a mean little affair, and I wished I knew who''d
      done it), and the old elm tree and the sea view vanished like a puff of
      steam, and then all about me—a multitude no man could number,
      nations, tongues, kingdoms, peoples—children of all the ages, in an
      amphitheatral space as vast as the sky. And over against us, seated on a
      throne of dazzling white cloud, the Lord God and all the host of his
      angels. I recognised Azrael by his darkness and Michael by his sword, and
      the great angel who had blown the trumpet stood with the trumpet still
      half raised.

III. — "Prompt," said the little man beside me. "Very prompt. Do you
      see the angel with the book?"

He was ducking and craning his head about to see over and under and
      between the souls that crowded round us. "Everybody''s here," he said.
      "Everybody. And now we shall know—

"There''s Darwin," he said, going off at a tangent. "He''ll catch it!
      And there—you see?—that tall, important-looking man trying to
      catch the eye of the Lord God, that''s the Duke. But there''s a lot of
      people one doesn''t know.

"Oh! there''s Priggles, the publisher. I have always wondered about
      printers'' overs. Priggles was a clever man ... But we shall know now—even
      about him.

"Historical characters, too. See? That''s Henry the Eighth. There''ll be a
      good bit of evidence. Oh, damn! He''s Tudor."

He lowered his voice. "Notice this chap, just in front of us, all covered
      with hair. Paleolithic, you know. And there again—"

The angel at the book—it was one of countless volumes, like the
      British Museum Reading-room Catalogue, glanced at us and seemed to count
      us in the instant.

V. — The angel opened the book and read a name. It was a name full
      of A''s, and the echoes of it came back out of the uttermost parts of
      space. I did not catch it clearly, because the little man beside me said,
      in a sharp jerk, "What''s that?" It sounded like "Ahab" to me; but
      it could not have been the Ahab of Scripture.

Instantly a small black figure was lifted up to a puffy cloud at the very
      feet of God. It was a stiff little figure, dressed in rich outlandish
      robes and crowned, and it folded its arms and scowled.

We were privileged to hear the reply, and indeed the acoustic properties
      of the place were marvellous.

"I was a king," said the little figure, "a great king, and I was lustful
      and proud and cruel. I made wars, I devastated countries, I built palaces,
      and the mortar was the blood of men. Hear, O God, the witnesses against
      me, calling to you for vengeance. Hundreds and thousands of witnesses." He
      waved his hands towards us. "And worse! I took a prophet—one of your
      prophets——"

"And because he would not bow to me, I tortured him for four days and
      nights, and in the end he died. I did more, O God, I blasphemed. I robbed
      you of your honours——"

"I caused myself to be worshipped in your stead. No evil was there but I
      practised it; no cruelty wherewith I did not stain my soul. And at last
      you smote me, O God!"

"And I was slain in battle. And so I stand before you, meet for your
      nethermost Hell! Out of your greatness daring no lies, daring no pleas,
      but telling the truth of my iniquities before all mankind."

He ceased. His face I saw distinctly, and it seemed to me white and
      terrible and proud and strangely noble. I thought of Milton''s Satan.

Then suddenly God bent forward and took this man in his hand, and held him
      up on his palm as if to see him better. He was just a little dark stroke
      in the middle of God''s palm.

"In a way," said the Recording Angel, carelessly. Now when I looked again
      at the little man his face had changed in a very curious manner. He was
      looking at the Recording Angel with a strange apprehension in his eyes,
      and one hand fluttered to his mouth. Just the movement of a muscle or so,
      and all that dignity of defiance was gone.

And the angel read, explaining very carefully and fully all the wickedness
      of the Wicked Man. It was quite an intellectual treat.—A little
      "daring" in places, I thought, but of course Heaven has its privileges...

VI. — Everybody was laughing. Even the prophet of the Lord whom the
      Wicked Man had tortured had a smile on his face. The Wicked Man was really
      such a preposterous little fellow.

"And then," read the Recording Angel, with a smile that set us all agog,
      "one day, when he was a little irascible from over-eating, he—"

"It didn''t happen," screamed the Wicked Man. "I was bad—I was really
      bad. Frequently bad, but there was nothing so silly—so absolutely
      silly—"

The Wicked Man on God''s hand began to dance and weep. Suddenly shame
      overcame him. He made a wild rush to jump off the ball of God''s little
      finger, but God stopped him by a dexterous turn of the wrist. Then he made
      a rush for the gap between hand and thumb, but the thumb closed. And all
      the while the angel went on reading—reading. The Wicked Man rushed
      to and fro across God''s palm, and then suddenly turned about and fled up
      the sleeve of God.

"Next," said God, and before the Recording Angel could call the name a
      hairy creature in filthy rags stood upon God''s palm.

"If you notice," he said—he peered between the feet of the great
      angels— "there''s no particular indication of a Celestial City."

VIII. — "He was Lord of the Earth, but I was the prophet of the God
      of Heaven," cried the Saint, "and all the people marvelled at the sign.
      For I, O God, knew of the glories of thy Paradise. No pain, no hardship,
      gashing with knives, splinters thrust under my nails, strips of flesh
      flayed off, all for the glory and honour of God."

"As a perfect nuisance," said the Recording Angel, and began to read,
      heedless of the fact that the saint was still speaking of the gloriously
      unpleasant things he had done that Paradise might be his.

It seemed not ten seconds before the Saint also was rushing to and fro
      over the great palm of God. Not ten seconds! And at last he also shrieked
      beneath that pitiless and cynical exposition, and fled also, even as the
      Wicked Man had fled, into the shadow of the sleeve. And it was permitted
      us to see into the shadow of the sleeve. And the two sat side by side,
      stark of all delusions, in the shadow of the robe of God''s charity, like
      brothers.

IX. — "And now," said God, as he shook us out of his sleeve upon the
      planet he had given us to live upon, the planet that whirled about green
      Sirius for a sun, "now that you understand me and each other a little
      better,...try again."

All about me was a beautiful land, more beautiful than any I had ever seen
      before—waste, austere, and wonderful; and all about me were the
      enlightened souls of men in new clean bodies...

"It isn''t every one who''s been a god," said the sunburnt man. "But it''s
      happened to me—among other things."

"I was one of those men who were saved from the Ocean Pioneer.
      Gummy! how time flies! It''s twenty years ago. I doubt if you''ll remember
      anything of the Ocean Pioneer?"

The name was familiar, and I tried to recall when and where I had read it.
      The Ocean Pioneer? "Something about gold dust," I said vaguely,
      "but the precise—"

"That''s it," he said. "In a beastly little channel she hadn''t no business
      in—dodging pirates. It was before they''d put the kybosh on that
      business. And there''d been volcanoes or something and all the rocks was
      wrong. There''s places about by Soona where you fair have to follow the
      rocks about to see where they''re going next. Down she went in twenty
      fathoms before you could have dealt for whist, with fifty thousand pounds
      worth of gold aboard, it was said, in one form or another."

But at the word salvage the sunburnt man exploded into language so
      extraordinarily horrible that I stopped aghast. He came down to more
      ordinary swearing, and pulled himself up abruptly. "Excuse me," he said,
      "but—salvage!"

He leant over towards me. "I was in that job," he said. "Tried to make
      myself a rich man, and got made a god instead. I''ve got my feelings——

"It ain''t all jam being a god," said the sunburnt man, and for some time
      conversed by means of such pithy but unprogressive axioms. At last he took
      up his tale again.

"There was me," said the sunburnt man, "and a seaman named Jacobs, and
      Always, the mate of the Ocean Pioneer. And him it was that set the
      whole thing going. I remember him now, when we was in the jolly-boat,
      suggesting it all to our minds just by one sentence. He was a wonderful
      hand at suggesting things. ''There was forty thousand pounds,'' he said, ''on
      that ship, and it''s for me to say just where she went down.'' It didn''t
      need much brains to tumble to that. And he was the leader from the first
      to the last. He got hold of the Sanderses and their brig; they were
      brothers, and the brig was the Pride of Banya, and he it was bought
      the diving dress—a second-hand one with a compressed air apparatus
      instead of pumping. He''d have done the diving too, if it hadn''t made him
      sick going down. And the salvage people were mucking about with a chart
      he''d cooked up, as solemn as could be, at Starr Race, a hundred and twenty
      miles away.

"I can tell you we was a happy lot aboard that brig, jokes and drink and
      bright hopes all the time. It all seemed so neat and clean and
      straightforward, and what rough chaps call a ''cert.'' And we used to
      speculate how the other blessed lot, the proper salvagers, who''d started
      two days before us, were getting on, until our sides fairly ached. We all
      messed together in the Sanderses'' cabin—it was a curious crew, all
      officers and no men—and there stood the diving-dress waiting its
      turn. Young Sanders was a humorous sort of chap, and there certainly was
      something funny in the confounded thing''s great fat head and its stare,
      and he made us see it too. ''Jimmy Goggles,'' he used to call it, and talk
      to it like a Christian. Asked if he was married, and how Mrs. Goggles was,
      and all the little Goggleses. Fit to make you split. And every blessed day
      all of us used to drink the health of Jimmy Goggles in rum, and unscrew
      his eye and pour a glass of rum in him, until, instead of that nasty
      mackintosheriness, he smelt as nice in his inside as a cask of rum. It was
      jolly times we had in those days, I can tell you—little suspecting,
      poor chaps! what was a-coming.

"We weren''t going to throw away our chances by any blessed hurry, you
      know, and we spent a whole day sounding our way towards where the Ocean
      Pioneer had gone down, right between two chunks of ropy grey rock—lava
      rocks that rose nearly out of the water. We had to lay off about half a
      mile to get a safe anchorage, and there was a thundering row who should
      stop on board. And there she lay just as she had gone down, so that you
      could see the top of the masts that was still standing perfectly
      distinctly. The row ended in all coming in the boat. I went down in the
      diving-dress on Friday morning directly it was light.

"What a surprise it was! I can see it all now quite distinctly. It was a
      queer-looking place, and the light was just coming. People over here think
      every blessed place in the tropics is a flat shore and palm-trees and
      surf, bless ''em! This place, for instance, wasn''t a bit that way. Not
      common rocks they were, undermined by waves; but great curved banks like
      ironwork cinder heaps, with green slime below, and thorny shrubs and
      things just waving upon them here and there, and the water glassy calm and
      clear, and showing you a kind of dirty gray-black shine, with huge flaring
      red-brown weeds spreading motionless, and crawling and darting things
      going through it. And far away beyond the ditches and pools and the heaps
      was a forest on the mountain flank, growing again after the fires and
      cinder showers of the last eruption. And the other way forest, too, and a
      kind of broken—what is it?—amby-theatre of black and rusty
      cinders rising out of it all, and the sea in a kind of bay in the middle.

"The dawn, I say, was just coming, and there wasn''t much colour about
      things, and not a human being but ourselves anywhere in sight up or down
      the channel. Except the Pride of Banya, lying out beyond a lump of
      rocks towards the line of the sea.

"I don''t know where they came from, not a bit. And we were feeling
      so safe that we were all alone that poor young Sanders was a-singing. I
      was in Jimmy Goggles, all except the helmet. ''Easy,'' says Always, ''there''s
      her mast.'' And after I''d had just one squint over the gunwale, I caught up
      the bogey, and almost tipped out as old Sanders brought the boat round.
      When the windows were screwed and everything was all right, I shut the
      valve from the air-belt in order to help my sinking, and jumped overboard,
      feet foremost—for we hadn''t a ladder. I left the boat pitching, and
      all of them staring down into water after me, as my head sank down into
      the weeds and blackness that lay about the mast. I suppose nobody, not the
      most cautious chap in the world, would have bothered about a look-out at
      such a desolate place. It stunk of solitude.

"Of course you must understand that I was a greenhorn at diving. None of
      us were divers. We''d had to muck about with the thing to get the way of
      it, and this was the first time I''d been deep. It feels damnable. Your
      ears hurt beastly. I don''t know if you''ve ever hurt yourself yawning or
      sneezing, but it takes you like that, only ten times worse. And a pain
      over the eyebrows here—splitting—and a feeling like influenza
      in the head. And it isn''t all heaven in your lungs and things. And going
      down feels like the beginning of a lift, only it keeps on. And you can''t
      turn your head to see what''s above you, and you can''t get a fair squint at
      what''s happening to your feet without bending down something painful. And
      being deep it was dark, let alone the blackness of the ashes and mud that
      formed the bottom. It was like going down out of the dawn back into the
      night, so to speak.

"The mast came up like a ghost out of the black, and then a lot of fishes,
      and then a lot of flapping red seaweed, and then whack I came with a kind
      of dull bang on the deck of the Ocean Pioneer, and the fishes that
      had been feeding on the dead rose about me like a swarm of flies from road
      stuff in summer-time. I turned on the compressed air again—for the
      suit was a bit thick and mackintoshery after all, in spite of the rum—and
      stood recovering myself. It struck coolish down there, and that helped
      take off the stuffiness a bit."

"When I began to feel easier, I started looking about me. It was an
      extraordinary sight. Even the light was extraordinary, a kind of
      reddy-coloured twilight, on account of the streamers of seaweed that
      floated up on either side of the ship. And far overhead just a moony, deep
      green blue. The deck of the ship, except for a slight list to starboard,
      was level, and lay all dark and long between the weeds, clear except where
      the masts had snapped when she rolled, and vanishing into black night
      towards the forecastle. There wasn''t any dead on the decks, most were in
      the weeds alongside, I suppose; but afterwards I found two skeletons lying
      in the passengers'' cabins, where death had come to them. It was curious to
      stand on that deck and recognise it all, bit by bit; a place against the
      rail where I''d been fond of smoking by starlight, and the corner where an
      old chap from Sydney used to flirt with a widow we had aboard. A
      comfortable couple they''d been, only a month ago, and now you couldn''t
      have got a meal for a baby crab off either of them.

"I''ve always had a bit of a philosophical turn, and I daresay I spent the
      best part of five minutes in such thoughts before I went below to find
      where the blessed dust was stored. It was slow work hunting, feeling it
      was for the most part, pitchy dark, with confusing blue gleams down the
      companion. And there were things moving about, a dab at my glass once, and
      once a pinch at my leg. Crabs, I expect. I kicked a lot of loose stuff
      that puzzled me, and stooped and picked up something all knobs and spikes.
      What do you think? Backbone! But I never had any particular feeling for
      bones. We had talked the affair over pretty thoroughly, and Always knew
      just where the stuff was stowed. I found it that trip. I lifted a box one
      end an inch or more."

He broke off in his story. "I''ve lifted it," he said, "as near as that!
      Forty thousand pounds'' worth of pure gold! Gold! I shouted inside my
      helmet as a kind of cheer, and hurt my ears. I was getting confounded
      stuffy and tired by this time—I must have been down twenty-five
      minutes or more—and I thought this was good enough. I went up the
      companion again, and as my eyes came up flush with the deck, a thundering
      great crab gave a kind of hysterical jump and went scuttling off sideways.
      Quite a start it gave me. I stood up clear on deck and shut the valve
      behind the helmet to let the air accumulate to carry me up again—I
      noticed a kind of whacking from above, as though they were hitting the
      water with an oar, but I didn''t look up. I fancied they were signalling me
      to come up.

"And then something shot down by me—something heavy, and stood
      a-quiver in the planks. I looked, and there was a long knife I''d seen
      young Sanders handling. Thinks I, he''s dropped it, and I was still calling
      him this kind of fool and that—-for it might have hurt me serious—when
      I began to lift and drive up towards the daylight. Just about the level of
      the top spars of the Ocean Pioneer, whack! I came against something
      sinking down, and a boot knocked in front of my helmet. Then something
      else, struggling frightful. It was a big weight atop of me, whatever it
      was, and moving and twisting about. I''d have thought it a big octopus, or
      some such thing, if it hadn''t been for the boot. But octopuses don''t wear
      boots. It was all in a moment, of course.

"I felt myself sinking down again, and I threw my arms about to keep
      steady, and the whole lot rolled free of me and shot down as I went up—"

"I saw young Sanders''s face, over a naked black shoulder, and a spear
      driven clean through his neck, and out of his mouth and neck what looked
      like spirts of pink smoke in the water. And down they went clutching one
      another, and turning over, and both too far gone to leave go. And in
      another second my helmet came a whack, fit to split, against the niggers''
      canoe. It was niggers! Two canoes full.

"It was lively times I tell you? Overboard came Always with three spears
      in him. There was the legs of three or four black chaps kicking about me
      in the water. I couldn''t see much, but I saw the game was up at a glance,
      gave my valve a tremendous twist, and went bubbling down again after poor
      Always, in as awful a state of scare and astonishment as you can well
      imagine. I passed young Sanders and the nigger going up again and
      struggling still a bit, and in another moment I was standing in the dim
      again on the deck of the Ocean Pioneer.

"Gummy, thinks I, here''s a fix! Niggers? At first I couldn''t see anything
      for it but Stifle below or Stabs above. I didn''t properly understand how
      much air there was to last me out, but I didn''t feel like standing very
      much more of it down below. I was hot and frightfully heady, quite apart
      from the blue funk I was in. We''d never reckoned with these beastly
      natives, filthy Papuan beasts. It wasn''t any good coming up where I was,
      but I had to do something. On the spur of the moment, I clambered over the
      side of the brig and landed among the weeds, and set off through the
      darkness as fast as I could. I just stopped once and knelt, and twisted
      back my head in the helmet and had a look up. It was a most extraordinary
      bright green-blue above, and the two canoes and the boat floating there
      very small and distant like a kind of twisted H. And it made me feel sick
      to squint up at it, and think what the pitching and swaying of the three
      meant.

"It was just about the most horrible ten minutes I ever had, blundering
      about in that darkness—pressure something awful, like being buried
      in sand, pain across the chest, sick with funk, and breathing nothing as
      it seemed but the smell of rum and mackintosh. Gummy! After a bit, I found
      myself going up a steepish sort of slope. I had another squint to see if
      anything was visible of the canoes and boats, and then kept on. I stopped
      with my head a foot from the surface, and tried to see where I was going,
      but, of course, nothing was to be seen but the reflection of the bottom.
      Then out I dashed, like knocking my head through a mirror. Directly I got
      my eyes out of the water, I saw I''d come up a kind of beach near the
      forest. I had a look round, but the natives and the brig were both hidden
      by a big hummucky heap of twisted lava. The born fool in me suggested a
      run for the woods. I didn''t take the helmet off, but I eased open one of
      the windows, and, after a bit of a pant, went on out of the water. You''d
      hardly imagine how clean and light the air tasted.

"Of course, with four inches of lead in your boot soles, and your head in
      a copper knob the size of a football, and been thirty-five minutes under
      water, you don''t break any records running. I ran like a ploughboy going
      to work. And half-way to the trees I saw a dozen niggers or more, coming
      out in a gaping, astonished sort of way to meet me.

"I just stopped dead, and cursed myself for all the fools out of London. I
      had about as much chance of cutting back to the water as a turned turtle.
      I just screwed up my window again to leave my hands free, and waited for
      them. There wasn''t anything else for me to do.

"But they didn''t come on very much. I began to suspect why. ''Jimmy
      Goggles,'' I says, ''it''s your beauty does it.'' I was inclined to be a
      little lightheaded, I think, with all these dangers about and the change
      in the pressure of the blessed air. ''Who''re ye staring at?'' I said, as if
      the savages could hear me. ''What d''ye take me for? I''m hanged if I don''t
      give you something to stare at,'' I said, and with that I screwed up the
      escape valve and turned on the compressed air from the belt, until I was
      swelled out like a blown frog. Regular imposing it must have been. I''m
      blessed if they''d come on a step; and presently one and then another went
      down on their hands and knees. They didn''t know what to make of me, and
      they was doing the extra polite, which was very wise and reasonable of
      them. I had half a mind to edge back seaward and cut and run, but it
      seemed too hopeless. A step back and they''d have been after me. And out of
      sheer desperation I began to march towards them up the beach, with slow,
      heavy steps, and waving my blown-out arms about, in a dignified manner.
      And inside of me I was singing as small as a tomtit.

"But there''s nothing like a striking appearance to help a man over a
      difficulty,—I''ve found that before and since. People like ourselves,
      who''re up to diving dresses by the time we''re seven, can scarcely imagine
      the effect of one on a simple-minded savage. One or two of these niggers
      cut and run, the others started in a great hurry trying to knock their
      brains out on the ground. And on I went as slow and solemn and
      silly-looking and artful as a jobbing plumber. It was evident they took me
      for something immense.

"Then up jumped one and began pointing, making extraordinary gestures to
      me as he did so, and all the others began sharing their attention between
      me and something out at; sea. ''What''s the matter now?'' I said. I turned
      slowly on account of my dignity, and there I saw, coming round a point,
      the poor old Pride of Banya towed by a couple of canoes. The sight
      fairly made me sick. But they evidently expected some recognition, so I
      waved my arms in a striking sort of non-committal manner. And then I
      turned and stalked on towards the trees again. At that time I was praying
      like mad, I remember, over and over again: ''Lord help me through with it!
      Lord help me through with it!'' It''s only fools who know nothing of danger
      can afford to laugh at praying."

"But these niggers weren''t going to let me walk through and away like
      that. They started a kind of bowing dance about me, and sort of pressed me
      to take a pathway that lay through the trees. It was clear to me they
      didn''t take me for a British citizen, whatever else they thought of me,
      and for my own part I was never less anxious to own up to the old country.

"You''d hardly believe it, perhaps, unless you''re familiar with savages,
      but these poor, misguided, ignorant creatures took me straight to their
      kind of joss place to present me to the blessed old black stone there. By
      this time I was beginning to sort of realise the depth of their ignorance,
      and directly I set eyes on this deity I took my cue. I started a baritone
      howl, ''wow-wow,'' very long on one note, and began waving my arms about a
      lot, and then very slowly and ceremoniously turned their image over on its
      side and sat down on it. I wanted to sit down badly, for diving dresses
      ain''t much wear in the tropics. Or, to put it different like, they''re a
      sight too much. It took away their breath, I could see, my sitting on
      their joss, but in less time than a minute they made up their minds and
      were hard at work worshipping me. And I can tell you I felt a bit relieved
      to see things turning out so well, in spite of the weight on my shoulders
      and feet.

"But what made me anxious was what the chaps in the canoes might think
      when they came back. If they''d seen me in the boat before I went down, and
      without the helmet on—for they might have been spying and hiding
      since over night—they would very likely take a different view from
      the others. I was in a deuce of a stew about that for hours, as it seemed,
      until the shindy of the arrival began.

"But they took it down—the whole blessed village took it down. At
      the cost of sitting up stiff and stern, as much like those sitting
      Egyptian images one sees as I could manage, for pretty nearly twelve
      hours, I should guess at least, on end, I got over it. You''d hardly think
      what it meant in that heat and stink. I don''t think any of them dreamt of
      the man inside. I was just a wonderful leathery great joss that had come
      up with luck out of the water. But the fatigue! the heat! the beastly
      closeness! the mackintosheriness and the rum! and the fuss! They lit a
      stinking fire on a kind of lava slab there was before me, and brought in a
      lot of gory muck—the worst parts of what they were feasting on
      outside, the Beasts— and burnt it all in my honour. I was getting a
      bit hungry, but I understand now how gods manage to do without eating,
      what with the smell of burnt-offerings about them. And they brought in a
      lot of the stuff they''d got off the brig and, among other stuff, what I
      was a bit relieved to see, the kind of pneumatic pump that was used for
      the compressed air affair, and then a lot of chaps and girls came in and
      danced about me something disgraceful. It''s extraordinary the different
      ways different people have of showing respect. If I''d had a hatchet handy
      I''d have gone for the lot of them—they made me feel that wild. All
      this time I sat as stiff as company, not knowing anything better to do.
      And at last, when nightfall came, and the wattle joss-house place got a
      bit too shadowy for their taste—all these here savages are afraid of
      the dark, you know—and I started a sort of ''Moo'' noise, they built
      big bonfires outside and left me alone in peace in the darkness of my hut,
      free to unscrew my windows a bit and think things over, and feel just as
      bad as I liked. And Lord! I was sick.

"I was weak and hungry, and my mind kept on behaving like a beetle on a
      pin, tremendous activity and nothing done at the end of it. Come round
      just where it was before. There was sorrowing for the other chaps, beastly
      drunkards certainly, but not deserving such a fate, and young Sanders with
      the spear through his neck wouldn''t go out of my mind. There was the
      treasure down there in the Ocean Pioneer, and how one might get it
      and hide it somewhere safer, and get away and come back for it. And there
      was the puzzle where to get anything to eat. I tell you I was fair
      rambling. I was afraid to ask by signs for food, for fear of behaving too
      human, and so there I sat and hungered until very near the dawn. Then the
      village got a bit quiet, and I couldn''t stand it any longer, and I went
      out and got some stuff like artichokes in a bowl and some sour milk. What
      was left of these I put away among the other offerings, just to give them
      a hint of my tastes. And in the morning they came to worship, and found me
      sitting up stiff and respectable on their previous god, just as they''d
      left me overnight. I''d got my back against the central pillar of the hut,
      and, practically, I was asleep. And that''s how I became a god among the
      heathen—false god, no doubt, and blasphemous, but one can''t always
      pick and choose.

"Now, I don''t want to crack myself up as a god beyond my merits, but I
      must confess that while I was god to these people they was extraordinary
      successful. I don''t say there''s anything in it, mind you. They won a
      battle with another tribe—I got a lot of offerings I didn''t want
      through it—they had wonderful fishing, and their crop of pourra was
      exceptional fine. And they counted the capture of the brig among the
      benefits I brought ''em. I must say I don''t think that was a poor record
      for a perfectly new hand. And, though perhaps you''d scarcely credit it, I
      was the tribal god of those beastly savages for pretty nearly four
      months...

"What else could I do, man? But I didn''t wear that diving-dress all the
      time. I made ''em rig me up a sort of holy of holies, and a deuce of a time
      I had too, making them understand what it was I wanted them to do. That
      indeed was the great difficulty—making them understand my wishes. I
      couldn''t let myself down by talking their lingo badly, even if I''d been
      able to speak at all, and I couldn''t go flapping a lot of gestures at
      them. So I drew pictures in sand and sat down beside them and hooted like
      one o''clock. Sometimes they did the things I wanted all right, and
      sometimes they did them all wrong. They was always very willing,
      certainly. All the while I was puzzling how I was to get the confounded
      business settled. Every night before the dawn I used to march out in full
      rig and go off to a place where I could see the channel in which the Ocean
      Pioneer lay sunk, and once even, one moonlight night, I tried to walk
      out to her, but the weeds and rocks and dark clean beat me. I didn''t get
      back till full day, and then I found all those silly niggers out on the
      beach praying their sea-god to return to them. I was that vexed and tired,
      messing and tumbling about, and coming up and going down again, I could
      have punched their silly heads all round when they started rejoicing.
      Hanged if I like so much ceremony.

"And then came the missionary. That missionary! What a Guy! Gummy!
      It was in the afternoon, and I was sitting in state in my outer temple
      place, sitting on that old black stone of theirs, when he came. I heard a
      row outside and jabbering, and then his voice speaking to an interpreter.
      ''They worship stocks and stones,'' he said, and I knew what was up, in a
      flash. I had one of my windows out for comfort, and I sang out straight
      away on the spur of the moment. ''Stocks and stones!'' I says. ''You come
      inside,'' I says, ''and I''ll punch your blooming Exeter Hall of a head.''

"There was a kind of silence and more jabbering, and in he came, Bible in
      hand, after the manner of them—a little sandy chap in specks and a
      pith helmet. I flatter myself that me sitting there in the shadows, with
      my copper head and my big goggles, struck him a bit of a heap at first.
      ''Well,'' I says, ''how''s the trade in scissors?'' for I don''t hold with
      missionaries.

"I had a lark with that missionary. He was a raw hand, and quite
      outclassed by a man like me. He gasped out who was I, and I told him to
      read the inscription at my feet if he wanted to know. There wasn''t no
      inscription; why should there be? but down he goes to read, and his
      interpreter, being of course as superstitious as any of them, more so by
      reason of his seeing missionary close to, took it for an act of worship
      and plumped down like a shot. All my people gave a howl of triumph, and
      there wasn''t any more business to be done in my village after that
      journey, not by the likes of him.

"But, of course, I was a fool to choke him off like that. If I''d had any
      sense I should have told him straight away of the treasure and taken him
      into Co. I''ve no doubt he''d have come into Co. A child, with a few hours
      to think it over, could have seen the connection between my diving dress
      and the loss of the Ocean Pioneer. A week after he left I went out
      one morning and saw the Motherhood, the salver''s ship from Starr
      Race, towing up the channel and sounding. The whole blessed game was up,
      and all my trouble thrown away. Gummy! How wild I felt! And guying it in
      that stinking silly dress! Four months!"

The sunburnt man''s story degenerated again. "Think of it," he said, when
      he emerged to linguistic purity once more. "Forty thousand pounds'' worth
      of gold."

"Oh yes! bless him! And he pledged his reputation there was a man inside
      the god, and started out to see as much with tremendous ceremony. But
      wasn''t—he got sold again. I always did hate scenes and explanations,
      and long before he came I was out of it all—going home to Banya
      along the coast, hiding in bushes by day, and thieving food from the
      villages by night. Only weapon, a spear. No clothes, no money. Nothing. My
      face, my fortune, as the saying is. And just a squeak of eight thousand
      pounds of gold—fifth share. But the natives cut up rusty, thank
      goodness, because they thought it was him had driven their luck away."

Miss Winchelsea was going to Rome. The matter had filled her mind for a
      month or more, and had overflowed so abundantly into her conversation that
      quite a number of people who were not going to Rome, and who were not
      likely to go to Rome, had made it a personal grievance against her. Some
      indeed had attempted quite unavailingly to convince her that Rome was not
      nearly such a desirable place as it was reported to be, and others had
      gone so far as to suggest behind her back that she was dreadfully "stuck
      up" about "that Rome of hers." And little Lily Hardhurst had told her
      friend Mr. Binns that so far as she was concerned Miss Winchelsea might
      "go to her old Rome and stop there; she (Miss Lily Hardhurst)
      wouldn''t grieve." And the way in which Miss Winchelsea put herself upon
      terms of personal tenderness with Horace and Benvenuto Cellini and Raphael
      and Shelley and Keats—if she had been Shelley''s widow she could not
      have professed a keener interest in his grave—was a matter of
      universal astonishment. Her dress was a triumph of tactful discretion,
      sensible, but not too "touristy"''—Miss Winchelsea had a great dread
      of being "touristy"—and her Baedeker was carried in a cover of grey
      to hide its glaring red. She made a prim and pleasant little figure on the
      Charing Cross platform, in spite of her swelling pride, when at last the
      great day dawned, and she could start for Rome. The day was bright, the
      Channel passage would be pleasant, and all the omens promised well. There
      was the gayest sense of adventure in this unprecedented departure.

She was going with two friends who had been fellow-students with her at
      the training college, nice honest girls both, though not so good at
      history and literature as Miss Winchelsea. They both looked up to her
      immensely, though physically they had to look down, and she anticipated
      some pleasant times to be spent in "stirring them up" to her own pitch of
      AEsthetic and historical enthusiasm. They had secured seats already, and
      welcomed her effusively at the carriage door. In the instant criticism of
      the encounter she noted that Fanny had a slightly "touristy" leather
      strap, and that Helen had succumbed to a serge jacket with side pockets,
      into which her hands were thrust. But they were much too happy with
      themselves and the expedition for their friend to attempt any hint at the
      moment about these things. As soon as the first ecstasies were over—
      Fanny''s enthusiasm was a little noisy and crude, and consisted mainly in
      emphatic repetitions of "Just fancy! we''re going to Rome, my dear!—Rome!"—they
      gave their attention to their fellow-travellers. Helen was anxious to
      secure a compartment to themselves, and, in order to discourage intruders,
      got out and planted herself firmly on the step. Miss Winchelsea peeped out
      over her shoulder, and made sly little remarks about the accumulating
      people on the platform, at which Fanny laughed gleefully.

They were travelling with one of Mr. Thomas Gunn''s parties—fourteen
      days in Rome for fourteen pounds. They did not belong to the personally
      conducted party, of course—Miss Winchelsea had seen to that—but
      they travelled with it because of the convenience of that arrangement. The
      people were the oddest mixture, and wonderfully amusing. There was a
      vociferous red-faced polyglot personal conductor in a pepper-and-salt
      suit, very long in the arms and legs and very active. He shouted
      proclamations. When he wanted to speak to people he stretched out an arm
      and held them until his purpose was accomplished. One hand was full of
      papers, tickets, counterfoils of tourists. The people of the personally
      conducted party were, it seemed, of two sorts; people the conductor wanted
      and could not find, and people he did not want and who followed him in a
      steadily growing tail up and down the platform. These people seemed,
      indeed, to think that their one chance of reaching Rome lay in keeping
      close to him. Three little old ladies were particularly energetic in his
      pursuit, and at last maddened him to the pitch of clapping them into a
      carriage and daring them to emerge again. For the rest of the time, one,
      two, or three of their heads protruded from the window wailing inquiries
      about "a little wicker-work box" whenever he drew near. There was a very
      stout man with a very stout wife in shiny black; there was a little old
      man like an aged hostler.

"What can such people want in Rome?" asked Miss Winchelsea. "What
      can it mean to them?" There was a very tall curate in a very small straw
      hat, and a very short curate encumbered by a long camera stand. The
      contrast amused Fanny very much. Once they heard some one calling for
      "Snooks." "I always thought that name was invented by novelists," said
      Miss Winchelsea. "Fancy! Snooks. I wonder which is Mr. Snooks."
      Finally they picked out a very stout and resolute little man in a large
      check suit. "If he isn''t Snooks, he ought to be," said Miss Winchelsea.

Presently the conductor discovered Helen''s attempt at a corner in
      carriages. "Room for five," he bawled with a parallel translation on his
      fingers. A party of four together—mother, father, and two daughters—
      blundered in, all greatly excited. "It''s all right, Ma—you let me,"
      said one of the daughters, hitting her mother''s bonnet with a handbag she
      struggled to put in the rack. Miss Winchelsea detested people who banged
      about and called their mother "Ma." A young man travelling alone followed.
      He was not at all "touristy" in his costume, Miss Winchelsea observed; his
      Gladstone bag was of good pleasant leather with labels reminiscent of
      Luxembourg and Ostend, and his boots, though brown, were not vulgar. He
      carried an overcoat on his arm. Before these people had properly settled
      in their places, came an inspection of tickets and a slamming of doors,
      and behold! they were gliding out of Charing Cross Station on their way to
      Rome.

"Fancy!" cried Fanny, "we are going to Rome, my dear! Rome! I don''t seem
      to believe it, even now."

Miss Winchelsea suppressed Fanny''s emotions with a little smile, and the
      lady who was called "Ma" explained to people in general why they had "cut
      it so close" at the station. The two daughters called her "Ma" several
      times, toned her down in a tactless, effective way, and drove her at last
      to the muttered inventory of a basket of travelling requisites. Presently
      she looked up. "Lor!" she said, "I didn''t bring them!" Both the
      daughters said "Oh, Ma!" But what "them" was did not appear.

Presently Fanny produced Hare''s Walks in Rome, a sort of mitigated
      guide-book very popular among Roman visitors; and the father of the two
      daughters began to examine his books of tickets minutely, apparently in a
      search after English words. When he had looked at the tickets for a long
      time right way up, he turned them upside down. Then he produced a fountain
      pen and dated them with considerable care. The young man having completed
      an unostentatious survey of his fellow-travellers produced a book and fell
      to reading. When Helen and Fanny were looking out of the window at
      Chislehurst—the place interested Fanny because the poor dear Empress
      of the French used to live there—Miss Winchelsea took the
      opportunity to observe the book the young man held. It was not a
      guide-book but a little thin volume of poetry—bound. She
      glanced at his face—it seemed a refined, pleasant face to her hasty
      glance. He wore a little gilt pince-nez. "Do you think she lives
      there now?" said Fanny, and Miss Winchelsea''s inspection came to an end.

For the rest of the journey Miss Winchelsea talked little, and what she
      said was as agreeable and as stamped with refinement as she could make it.
      Her voice was always low and clear and pleasant, and she took care that on
      this occasion it was particularly low and clear and pleasant. As they came
      under the white cliffs the young man put his book of poetry away, and when
      at last the train stopped beside the boat, he displayed a graceful
      alacrity with the impedimenta of Miss Winchelsea and her friends. Miss
      Winchelsea "hated nonsense," but she was pleased to see the young man
      perceived at once that they were ladies, and helped them without any
      violent geniality; and how nicely he showed that his civilities were to be
      no excuse for further intrusions. None of her little party had been out of
      England before, and they were all excited and a little nervous at the
      Channel passage. They stood in a little group in a good place near the
      middle of the boat—the young man had taken Miss Winchelsea''s
      carry-all there and had told her it was a good place—and they
      watched the white shores of Albion recede and quoted Shakespeare and made
      quiet fun of their fellow-travellers in the English way.

They were particularly amused at the precautions the bigger-sized people
      had taken against the little waves—cut lemons and flasks prevailed,
      one lady lay full length in a deck chair with a handkerchief over her
      face, and a very broad resolute man in a bright brown "touristy" suit
      walked all the way from England to France along the deck, with his legs as
      widely apart as Providence permitted. These were all excellent
      precautions, and nobody was ill. The personally-conducted party pursued
      the conductor about the deck with inquiries, in a manner that suggested to
      Helen''s mind the rather vulgar image of hens with a piece of bacon rind,
      until at last he went into hiding below. And the young man with the thin
      volume of poetry stood at the stern watching England receding, looking
      rather lonely and sad to Miss Winchelsea''s eye.

And then came Calais and tumultuous novelties, and the young man had not
      forgotten Miss Winchelsea''s hold-all and the other little things. All
      three girls, though they had passed Government examinations in French to
      any extent, were stricken with a dumb shame of their accents, and the
      young man was very useful. And he did not intrude. He put them in a
      comfortable carriage and raised his hat and went away. Miss Winchelsea
      thanked him in her best manner—a pleasing, cultivated manner—and
      Fanny said he was "nice" almost before he was out of earshot. "I wonder
      what he can be," said Helen. "He''s going to Italy, because I noticed green
      tickets in his book." Miss Winchelsea almost told them of the poetry, and
      decided not to do so. And presently the carriage windows seized hold upon
      them and the young man was forgotten. It made them feel that they were
      doing an educated sort of thing to travel through a country whose
      commonest advertisements were in idiomatic French, and Miss Winchelsea
      made unpatriotic comparisons because there were weedy little sign-board
      advertisements by the rail side instead of the broad hoardings that deface
      the landscape in our land. But the north of France is really uninteresting
      country, and after a time Fanny reverted to Hare''s Walks, and Helen
      initiated lunch. Miss Winchelsea awoke out of a happy reverie; she had
      been trying to realise, she said, that she was actually going to Rome, but
      she perceived at Helen''s suggestion that she was hungry, and they lunched
      out of their baskets very cheerfully. In the afternoon they were tired and
      silent until Helen made tea. Miss Winchelsea might have dozed, only she
      knew Fanny slept with her mouth open; and as their fellow-passengers were
      two rather nice, critical-looking ladies of uncertain age—who knew
      French well enough to talk it—she employed herself in keeping Fanny
      awake. The rhythm of the train became insistent, and the streaming
      landscape outside became at last quite painful to the eye. They were
      already dreadfully tired of travelling before their night''s stoppage came.

The stoppage for the night was brightened by the appearance of the young
      man, and his manners were all that could be desired and his French quite
      serviceable.

His coupons availed for the same hotel as theirs, and by chance, as it
      seemed, he sat next Miss Winchelsea at the table d''htte. In spite
      of her enthusiasm for Rome, she had thought out some such possibility very
      thoroughly, and when he ventured to make a remark upon the tediousness of
      travelling—he let the soup and fish go by before he did this—she
      did not simply assent to his proposition, but responded with another. They
      were soon comparing their journeys, and Helen and Fanny were cruelly
      overlooked in the conversation.. It was to be the same journey, they
      found; one day for the galleries at Florence—"from what I hear,"
      said the young man, "it is barely enough,"—and the rest at Rome. He
      talked of Rome very pleasantly; he was evidently quite well read, and he
      quoted Horace about Soracte. Miss Winchelsea had "done" that book of
      Horace for her matriculation, and was delighted to cap his quotation. It
      gave a sort of tone to things, this incident—a touch of refinement
      to mere chatting. Fanny expressed a few emotions, and Helen interpolated a
      few sensible remarks, but the bulk of the talk on the girls'' side
      naturally fell to Miss Winchelsea.

Before they reached Rome this young man was tacitly of their party. They
      did not know his name nor what he was, but it seemed he taught, and Miss
      Winchelsea had a shrewd idea he was an extension lecturer. At any rate he
      was something of that sort, something gentlemanly and refined without
      being opulent and impossible. She tried once or twice to ascertain whether
      he came from Oxford or Cambridge, but he missed her timid opportunities.
      She tried to get him to make remarks about those places to see if he would
      say "come up" to them instead of "go down,"—she knew that was how
      you told a ''Varsity man. He used the word "''Varsity"—not university—in
      quite the proper way.

They saw as much of Mr. Ruskin''s Florence as the brief time permitted; he
      met them in the Pitti Gallery and went round with them, chatting brightly,
      and evidently very grateful for their recognition. He knew a great deal
      about art, and all four enjoyed the morning immensely. It was fine to go
      round recognising old favourites and finding new beauties, especially
      while so many people fumbled helplessly with Baedeker. Nor was he a bit of
      a prig, Miss Winchelsea said, and indeed she detested prigs. He had a
      distinct undertone of humour, and was funny, for example, without being
      vulgar, at the expense of the quaint work of Beato Angelico. He had a
      grave seriousness beneath it all, and was quick to seize the moral lessons
      of the pictures. Fanny went softly among these masterpieces; she admitted
      "she knew so little about them," and she confessed that to her they were
      "all beautiful." Fanny''s "beautiful" inclined to be a little monotonous,
      Miss Winchelsea thought. She had been quite glad when the last sunny Alp
      had vanished, because of the staccato of Fanny''s admiration. Helen said
      little, but Miss Winchelsea had found her a trifle wanting on the
      aesthetic side in the old days and was not surprised; sometimes she
      laughed at the young man''s hesitating, delicate jests and sometimes she
      didn''t, and sometimes she seemed quite lost to the art about them in the
      contemplation of the dresses of the other visitors.

At Rome the young man was with them intermittently. A rather "touristy"
      friend of his took him away at times. He complained comically to Miss
      Winchelsea. "I have only two short weeks in Rome," he said, "and my friend
      Leonard wants to spend a whole day at Tivoli looking at a waterfall."

"He''s the most enthusiastic pedestrian I ever met," the young man replied—amusingly,
      but a little unsatisfactorily, Miss Winchelsea thought.

They had some glorious times, and Fanny could not think what they would
      have done without him. Miss Winchelsea''s interest and Fanny''s enormous
      capacity for admiration were insatiable. They never flagged—through
      pictures and sculpture galleries, immense crowded churches, ruins and
      museums, Judas trees and prickly pears, wine carts and palaces, they
      admired their way unflinchingly. They never saw a stone pine or a
      eucalyptus but they named and admired it; they never glimpsed Soracte but
      they exclaimed. Their common ways were made wonderful by imaginative play.
      "Here Caesar may have walked," they would say. "Raphael may have seen
      Soracte from this very point." They happened on the tomb of Bibulus. "Old
      Bibulus," said the young man. "The oldest monument of Republican Rome!"
      said Miss Winchelsea.

The young man glanced quickly at her and laughed. "That was Balbus," he
      said. Helen reddened, but neither he nor Miss Winchelsea threw any light
      upon Fanny''s ignorance about Bibulus.

Helen was more taciturn than the other three, but then she was always
      taciturn, and usually she took care of the tram tickets and things like
      that, or kept her eye on them if the young man took them, and told him
      where they were when he wanted them. Glorious times they had, these young
      people, in that pale brown cleanly city of memories that was once the
      world. Their only sorrow was the shortness of the time. They said indeed
      that the electric trams and the ''70 buildings, and that criminal
      advertisement that glares upon the Forum, outraged their aesthetic
      feelings unspeakably; but that was only part of the fun. And indeed Rome
      is such a wonderful place that it made Miss Winchelsea forget some of her
      most carefully prepared enthusiasms at times, and Helen, taken unawares,
      would suddenly admit the beauty of unexpected things. Yet Fanny and Helen
      would have liked a shop window or so in the English quarter if Miss
      Winchelsea''s uncompromising hostility to all other English visitors had
      not rendered that district impossible.

The intellectual and aesthetic fellowship of Miss Winchelsea and the
      scholarly young man passed insensibly towards a deeper feeling. The
      exuberant Fanny did her best to keep pace with their recondite admiration
      by playing her "beautiful" with vigour, and saying "Oh! let''s go,"
      with enormous appetite whenever a new place of interest was mentioned. But
      Helen developed a certain want of sympathy towards the end that
      disappointed Miss Winchelsea a little. She refused to see "anything" in
      the face of Beatrice Cenci—Shelley''s Beatrice Cenci!—in the
      Barberini Gallery; and one day, when they were deploring the electric
      trams, she said rather snappishly that "people must get about somehow, and
      it''s better than torturing horses up these horrid little hills." She spoke
      of the Seven Hills of Rome as "horrid little hills "!

And the day they went on the Palatine—though Miss Winchelsea did not
      know of this—she remarked suddenly to Fanny, "Don''t hurry like that,
      my dear; they don''t want us to overtake them. And we don''t say the
      right things for them when we do get near."

"I wasn''t trying to overtake them," said Fanny, slackening her excessive
      pace; "I wasn''t indeed." And for a minute she was short of breath.

But Miss Winchelsea had come upon happiness. It was only when she came to
      look back across an intervening tragedy that she quite realised how happy
      she had been pacing among the cypress-shadowed ruins, and exchanging the
      very highest class of information the human mind can possess, the most
      refined impressions it is possible to convey. Insensibly emotion crept
      into their intercourse, sunning itself openly and pleasantly at last when
      Helen''s modernity was not too near. Insensibly their interest drifted from
      the wonderful associations about them to their more intimate and personal
      feelings. In a tentative way information was supplied; she spoke
      allusively of her school, of her examination successes, of her gladness
      that the days of "Cram" were over. He made it quite clear that he also was
      a teacher. They spoke of the greatness of their calling, of the necessity
      of sympathy to face its irksome details, of a certain loneliness they
      sometimes felt.

That was in the Colosseum, and it was as far as they got that day, because
      Helen returned with Fanny—she had taken her into the upper
      galleries. Yet the private dreams of Miss Winchelsea, already vivid and
      concrete enough, became now realistic in the highest degree. She figured
      that pleasant young man lecturing in the most edifying way to his
      students, herself modestly prominent as his intellectual mate and helper;
      she figured a refined little home, with two bureaus, with white shelves of
      high-class books, and autotypes of the pictures of Rossetti and Burne
      Jones, with Morris''s wall-papers and flowers in pots of beaten copper.
      Indeed she figured many things. On the Pincio the two had a few precious
      moments together, while Helen marched Fanny off to see the muro Torto,
      and he spoke at once plainly. He said he hoped their friendship was only
      beginning, that he already found her company very precious to him, that
      indeed it was more than that.

He became nervous, thrusting at his glasses with trembling fingers as
      though he fancied his emotions made them unstable. "I should of course,"
      he said, "tell you things about myself. I know it is rather unusual my
      speaking to you like this. Only our meeting has been so accidental—or
      providential—and I am snatching at things. I came to Rome expecting
      a lonely tour ... and I have been so very happy, so very happy. Quite
      recently I have found myself in a position—I have dared to think——,
      And——"

He glanced over his shoulder and stopped. He said "Demn!" quite distinctly—and
      she did not condemn him for that manly lapse into profanity. She looked
      and saw his friend Leonard advancing. He drew nearer; he raised his hat to
      Miss Winchelsea, and his smile was almost a grin. "I''ve been looking for
      you everywhere, Snooks," he said. "You promised to be on the Piazza steps
      half-an-hour ago."

Snooks! The name struck Miss Winchelsea like a blow in the face. She did
      not hear his reply. She thought afterwards that Leonard must have
      considered her the vaguest-minded person. To this day she is not sure
      whether she was introduced to Leonard or not, nor what she said to him. A
      sort of mental paralysis was upon her. Of all offensive surnames—Snooks!

Helen and Fanny were returning, there were civilities, and the young men
      were receding. By a great effort she controlled herself to face the
      inquiring eyes of her friends. All that afternoon she lived the life of a
      heroine under the indescribable outrage of that name, chatting, observing,
      with "Snooks" gnawing at her heart. From the moment that it first rang
      upon her ears, the dream of her happiness was prostrate in the dust. All
      the refinement she had figured was ruined and defaced by that cognomen''s
      unavoidable vulgarity.

What was that refined little home to her now, spite of autotypes, Morris
      papers, and bureaus? Athwart it in letters of fire ran an incredible
      inscription: "Mrs. Snooks." That may seem a little thing to the reader,
      but consider the delicate refinement of Miss Winchelsea''s mind. Be as
      refined as you can and then think of writing yourself down:—"Snooks."
      She conceived herself being addressed as Mrs. Snooks by all the people she
      liked least, conceived the patronymic touched with a vague quality of
      insult. She figured a card of grey and silver bearing ''Winchelsea''
      triumphantly effaced by an arrow, Cupid''s arrow, in favour of "Snooks."
      Degrading confession of feminine weakness! She imagined the terrible
      rejoicings of certain girl friends, of certain grocer cousins from whom
      her growing refinement had long since estranged her. How they would make
      it sprawl across the envelope that would bring their sarcastic
      congratulations. Would even his pleasant company compensate her for that?
      "It is impossible," she muttered; "impossible! Snooks!"

She was sorry for him, but not so sorry as she was for herself. For him
      she had a touch of indignation. To be so nice, so refined, while all the
      time he was "Snooks," to hide under a pretentious gentility of demeanour
      the badge sinister of his surname seemed a sort of treachery. To put it in
      the language of sentimental science she felt he had "led her on."

There were, of course, moments of terrible vacillation, a period even when
      something almost like passion bid her throw refinement to the winds. And
      there was something in her, an unexpurgated vestige of vulgarity that made
      a strenuous attempt at proving that Snooks was not so very bad a name
      after all. Any hovering hesitation flew before Fanny''s manner, when Fanny
      came with an air of catastrophe to tell that she also knew the horror.
      Fanny''s voice fell to a whisper when she said Snooks. Miss
      Winchelsea would not give him any answer when at last, in the Borghese,
      she could have a minute with him; but she promised him a note.

She handed him that note in the little book of poetry he had lent her, the
      little book that had first drawn them together. Her refusal was ambiguous,
      allusive. She could no more tell him why she rejected him than she could
      have told a cripple of his hump. He too must feel something of the
      unspeakable quality of his name. Indeed he had avoided a dozen chances of
      telling it, she now perceived. So she spoke of "obstacles she could not
      reveal"—"reasons why the thing he spoke of was impossible." She
      addressed the note with a shiver, "E.K. Snooks."

Things were worse than she had dreaded; he asked her to explain. How could
      she explain? Those last two days in Rome were dreadful. She was haunted by
      his air of astonished perplexity. She knew she had given him intimate
      hopes, she had not the courage to examine her mind thoroughly for the
      extent of her encouragement. She knew he must think her the most
      changeable of beings. Now that she was in full retreat, she would not even
      perceive his hints of a possible correspondence. But in that matter he did
      a thing that seemed to her at once delicate and romantic. He made a
      go-between of Fanny. Fanny could not keep the secret, and came and told
      her that night under a transparent pretext of needed advice. "Mr. Snooks,"
      said Fanny, "wants to write to me. Fancy! I had no idea. But should I let
      him?" They talked it over long and earnestly, and Miss Winchelsea was
      careful to keep the veil over her heart. She was already repenting his
      disregarded hints. Why should she not hear of him sometimes—painful
      though his name must be to her? Miss Winchelsea decided it might be
      permitted, and Fanny kissed her good-night with unusual emotion. After she
      had gone Miss Winchelsea sat for a long time at the window of her little
      room. It was moonlight, and down the street a man sang "Santa Lucia" with
      almost heart-dissolving tenderness... She sat very still.

She breathed a word very softly to herself. The word was "Snooks."
      Then she got up with a profound sigh, and went to bed. The next morning he
      said to her meaningly, "I shall hear of you through your friend."

Mr. Snooks saw them off from Rome with that pathetic interrogative
      perplexity still on his face, and if it had not been for Helen he would
      have retained Miss Winchelsea''s hold-all in his hand as a sort of
      encyclopaedic keepsake. On their way back to England Miss Winchelsea on
      six separate occasions made Fanny promise to write to her the longest of
      long letters. Fanny, it seemed, would be quite near Mr. Snooks. Her new
      school—she was always going to new schools—would be only five
      miles from Steely Bank, and it was in the Steely Bank Polytechnic, and one
      or two first-class schools, that Mr. Snooks did his teaching. He might
      even see her at times. They could not talk much of him—she and Fanny
      always spoke of "him," never of Mr. Snooks—because Helen was apt to
      say unsympathetic things about him. Her nature had coarsened very much,
      Miss Winchelsea perceived, since the old Training College days; she had
      become hard and cynical. She thought he had a weak face, mistaking
      refinement for weakness as people of her stamp are apt to do, and when she
      heard his name was Snooks, she said she had expected something of the
      sort. Miss Winchelsea was careful to spare her own feelings after that,
      but Fanny was less circumspect.

The girls parted in London, and Miss Winchelsea returned, with a new
      interest in life, to the Girls'' High School in which she had been an
      increasingly valuable assistant for the last three years. Her new interest
      in life was Fanny as a correspondent, and to give her a lead she wrote her
      a lengthy descriptive letter within a fortnight of her return. Fanny
      answered, very disappointingly. Fanny indeed had no literary gift, but it
      was new to Miss Winchelsea to find herself deploring the want of gifts in
      a friend. That letter was even criticised aloud in the safe solitude of
      Miss Winchelsea''s study, and her criticism, spoken with great bitterness,
      was "Twaddle!" It was full of just the things Miss Winchelsea''s letter had
      been full of, particulars of the school. And of Mr. Snooks, only this
      much: "I have had a letter from Mr. Snooks, and he has been over to see me
      on two Saturday afternoons running. He talked about Rome and you; we both
      talked about you. Your ears must have burnt, my dear..."

Miss Winchelsea repressed a desire to demand more explicit information,
      and wrote the sweetest, long letter again. "Tell me all about yourself,
      dear. That journey has quite refreshed our ancient friendship, and I do so
      want to keep in touch with you." About Mr. Snooks she simply wrote on the
      fifth page that she was glad Fanny had seen him, and that if he should
      ask after her, she was to be remembered to him very kindly
      (underlined). And Fanny replied most obtusely in the key of that "ancient
      friendship," reminding Miss Winchelsea of a dozen foolish things of those
      old schoolgirl days at the Training College, and saying not a word about
      Mr. Snooks!

For nearly a week Miss Winchelsea was so angry at the failure of Fanny as
      a go-between that she could not write to her. And then she wrote less
      effusively, and in her letter she asked point-blank, "Have you seen Mr.
      Snooks?" Fanny''s letter was unexpectedly satisfactory. "I have seen
      Mr. Snooks," she wrote, and having once named him she kept on about him;
      it was all Snooks—Snooks this and Snooks that. He was to give a
      public lecture, said Fanny, among other things. Yet Miss Winchelsea, after
      the first glow of gratification, still found this letter a little
      unsatisfactory. Fanny did not report Mr. Snooks as saying anything about
      Miss Winchelsea, nor as looking a little white and worn, as he ought to
      have been doing. And behold! before she had replied, came a second letter
      from Fanny on the same theme, quite a gushing letter, and covering six
      sheets with her loose feminine hand.

And about this second letter was a rather odd little thing that Miss
      Winchelsea only noticed as she re-read it the third time. Fanny''s natural
      femininity had prevailed even against the round and clear traditions of
      the Training College; she was one of those she-creatures born to make all
      her m''s and n''s and u''s and r''s and e''s
      alike, and to leave her o''s and a''s open and her i''s
      undotted. So that it was only after an elaborate comparison of word with
      word that Miss Winchelsea felt assured Mr. Snooks was not really "Mr.
      Snooks" at all! In Fanny''s first letter of gush he was Mr. "Snooks," in
      her second the spelling was changed to Mr. "Senoks." Miss Winchelsea''s
      hand positively trembled as she turned the sheet over—it meant so
      much to her. For it had already begun to seem to her that even the name of
      Mrs. Snooks might be avoided at too great a price, and suddenly—this
      possibility! She turned over the six sheets, all dappled with that
      critical name, and everywhere the first letter had the form of an e!
      For a time she walked the room with a hand pressed upon her heart.

She spent a whole day pondering this change, weighing a letter of inquiry
      that should be at once discreet and effectual; weighing, too, what action
      she should take after the answer came. She was resolved that if this
      altered spelling was anything more than a quaint fancy of Fanny''s, she
      would write forthwith to Mr. Snooks. She had now reached a stage when the
      minor refinements of behaviour disappear. Her excuse remained uninvented,
      but she had the subject of her letter clear in her mind, even to the hint
      that "circumstances in my life have changed very greatly since we talked
      together." But she never gave that hint. There came a third letter from
      that fitful correspondent Fanny. The first line proclaimed her "the
      happiest girl alive."

Miss Winchelsea crushed the letter in her hand—the rest unread—and
      sat with her face suddenly very still. She had received it just before
      morning school, and had opened it when the junior mathematicians were well
      under way. Presently she resumed reading with an appearance of great calm.
      But after the first sheet she went on reading the third without
      discovering the error:—"told him frankly I did not like his name,"
      the third sheet began. "He told me he did not like it himself—you
      know that sort of sudden, frank way he has"—Miss Winchelsea did
      know. "So I said, ''couldn''t you change it?'' He didn''t see it at first.
      Well, you know, dear, he had told me what it really meant; it means
      Sevenoaks, only it has got down to Snooks—both Snooks and Noaks,
      dreadfully vulgar surnames though they be, are really worn forms of
      Sevenoaks. So I said—even I have my bright ideas at times—''If
      it got down from Sevenoaks to Snooks, why not get it back from Snooks to
      Sevenoaks?'' And the long and the short of it is, dear, he couldn''t refuse
      me, and he changed his spelling there and then to Senoks for the bills of
      the new lecture. And afterwards, when we are married, we shall put in the
      apostrophe and make it Se''noks. Wasn''t it kind of him to mind that fancy
      of mine, when many men would have taken offence? But it is just like him
      all over; he is as kind as he is clever. Because he knew as well as I did
      that I would have had him in spite of it, had he been ten times Snooks.
      But he did it all the same."

The class was startled by the sound of paper being viciously torn, and
      looked up to see Miss Winchelsea white in the face and with some very
      small pieces of paper clenched in one hand. For a few seconds they stared
      at her stare, and then her expression changed back to a more familiar one.
      "Has any one finished number three?" she asked in an even tone. She
      remained calm after that. But impositions ruled high that day. And she
      spent two laborious evenings writing letters of various sorts to Fanny,
      before she found a decent congratulatory vein. Her reason struggled
      hopelessly against the persuasion that Fanny had behaved in an exceedingly
      treacherous manner.

One may be extremely refined and still capable of a very sore heart.
      Certainly Miss Winchelsea''s heart was very sore. She had moods of sexual
      hostility, in which she generalised uncharitably about mankind. "He forgot
      himself with me," she said. "But Fanny is pink and pretty and soft and a
      fool—a very excellent match for a Man." And by way of a wedding
      present she sent Fanny a gracefully bound volume of poetry by George
      Meredith, and Fanny wrote back a grossly happy letter to say that it was "all
      beautiful." Miss Winchelsea hoped that some day Mr. Senoks might take up
      that slim book and think for a moment of the donor. Fanny wrote several
      times before and about her marriage, pursuing that fond legend of their
      "ancient friendship," and giving her happiness in the fullest detail. And
      Miss Winchelsea wrote to Helen for the first time after the Roman journey,
      saying nothing about the marriage, but expressing very cordial feelings.

They had been in Rome at Easter, and Fanny was married in the August
      vacation. She wrote a garrulous letter to Miss Winchelsea, describing her
      home-coming and the astonishing arrangements of their "teeny, weeny"
      little house. Mr. Se''noks was now beginning to assume a refinement in Miss
      Winchelsea''s memory out of all proportion to the facts of the case, and
      she tried in vain to imagine his cultured greatness in a "teeny weeny"
      little house. "Am busy enamelling a cosy corner," said Fanny, sprawling to
      the end of her third sheet, "so excuse more." Miss Winchelsea answered in
      her best style, gently poking fun at Fanny''s arrangements, and hoping
      intensely that Mr. Se''noks might see the letter. Only this hope enabled
      her to write at all, answering not only that letter but one in November
      and one at Christmas.

The two latter communications contained urgent invitations for her to come
      to Steely Bank on a visit during the Christmas holidays. She tried to
      think that he had told her to ask that, but it was too much like
      Fanny''s opulent good-nature. She could not but believe that he must be
      sick of his blunder by this time; and she had more than a hope that he
      would presently write her a letter beginning "Dear Friend." Something
      subtly tragic in the separation was a great support to her, a sad
      misunderstanding. To have been jilted would have been intolerable. But he
      never wrote that letter beginning "Dear Friend."

For two years Miss Winchelsea could not go to see her friends, in spite of
      the reiterated invitations of Mrs. Sevenoaks—it became full
      Sevenoaks in the second year. Then one day near the Easter rest she felt
      lonely and without a soul to understand her in the world, and her mind ran
      once more on what is called Platonic friendship. Fanny was clearly happy
      and busy in her new sphere of domesticity, but no doubt he had his
      lonely hours. Did he ever think of those days in Rome, gone now beyond
      recalling? No one had understood her as he had done; no one in all the
      world. It would be a sort of melancholy pleasure to talk to him again, and
      what harm could it do? Why should she deny herself? That night she wrote a
      sonnet, all but the last two lines of the octave—which would not
      come; and the next day she composed a graceful little note to tell Fanny
      she was coming down.

Even at the first encounter it was evident he had changed; he seemed
      stouter and less nervous, and it speedily appeared that his conversation
      had already lost much of its old delicacy. There even seemed a
      justification for Helen''s description of weakness in his face—in
      certain lights it was weak. He seemed busy and preoccupied about
      his affairs, and almost under the impression that Miss Winchelsea had come
      for the sake of Fanny. He discussed his dinner with Fanny in an
      intelligent way. They only had one good long talk together, and that came
      to nothing. He did not refer to Rome, and spent some time abusing a man
      who had stolen an idea he had had for a text-book. It did not seem a very
      wonderful idea to Miss Winchelsea. She discovered he had forgotten the
      names of more than half the painters whose work they had rejoiced over in
      Florence.

It was a sadly disappointing week, and Miss Winchelsea was glad when it
      came to an end. Under various excuses she avoided visiting them again.
      After a time the visitor''s room was occupied by their two little boys, and
      Fanny''s invitations ceased. The intimacy of her letters had long since
      faded away.

The man with the white face entered the carriage at Rugby. He moved slowly
      in spite of the urgency of his porter, and even while he was still on the
      platform I noted how ill he seemed. He dropped into the corner over
      against me with a sigh, made an incomplete attempt to arrange his
      travelling shawl, and became motionless, with his eyes staring vacantly.
      Presently he was moved by a sense of my observation, looked up at me, and
      put out a spiritless hand for his newspaper. Then he glanced again in my
      direction.

I feigned to read. I feared I had unwittingly embarrassed him, and in a
      moment I was surprised to find him speaking.

"I beg your pardon?" said I. — "That book," he repeated, pointing a
      lean finger, "is about dreams."

"Obviously," I answered, for it was Fortnum-Roscoe''s Dream States,
      and the title was on the cover.

He hung silent for a space as if he sought words. "Yes," he said, at last,
      "but they tell you nothing."

"There are dreams," he said, "and dreams." That sort of proposition I
      never dispute. "I suppose——" he hesitated. "Do you ever dream?
      I mean vividly."

"Your dreams don''t mix with your memories?" he asked abruptly. "You don''t
      find yourself in doubt: did this happen or did it not?"

"Says it happens at times and gives the usual explanation about intensity
      of impression and the like to account for its not happening as a rule. I
      suppose you know something of these theories——"
