refrain from expressing his surprise to the merchant, told him what he
had heard, how he feared he should scarcely have received anything, and
asked whether after all there was not a mistake about the shipwreck of
the vessels. The merchant replied, It is quite true, I have sustained
heavy loss, by these vessels being wrecked, but that is the very reason,
why I give you so much; for I must make better use than ever of my
stewardship, lest it should be entirely taken from me.

How have we to act if prosperity in our business, our trade, our
profession, etc., should suddenly cease, notwithstanding our having
given a considerable proportion of our means for the Lord''s work? My
reply is this: "In the day of adversity consider." It is the will of
God that we should ponder our ways; that we should see whether there is
any particular reason, why God has allowed this to befall us. In doing
so, we may find, that we have too much looked on our prosperity as a
matter of course, and have not sufficiently owned and recognized
practically the hand of God in our success. Or it may be, while the
Lord has been pleased to prosper us, we have spent too much on
ourselves, and may have thus, though unintentionally, abused the
blessing of God. I do not mean by this remark to bring any children of
God into bondage, so that, with a scrupulous conscience, they should
look at every penny, which they spend on themselves; this is not the
will of God concerning us; and yet, on the other hand, there is verily
such a thing as propriety or impropriety in our dress, our furniture,
our table, our house, our establishment, and in the yearly amount we
spend on ourselves and family.

I have every reason to believe, that, had I begun to lay up, the Lord
would have stopped the supplies, and thus, the ability of doing so was
only apparent. Let no one profess to trust in God, and yet lay up for
future wants, otherwise the Lord will first send him to the hoard he has
amassed, before He can answer the prayer for more.

"There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that
withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty." (Prov. xi.
24.) Notice here the word "more than is meet;" it is not said,
withholdeth all; but "more than is meet" viz., while he gives, it is so
little, in comparison with what it might be, and ought to be, that it
tendeth to poverty.

Believers should seek more and more to enter into the grace and love of
God, in giving His only-begotten Son, and into the grace and love of the
Lord Jesus, in giving Himself in our room, in order that, constrained by
love and gratitude, they may be increasingly led to surrender their
bodily and mental strength, their time, gifts, talents, property,
position in life, rank, and all they have and are to the Lord. By this I
do not mean that they should give up their business, trade, or
profession, and become preachers; nor do I mean that they should take
all their money and give it to the first beggar who asks for it; but
that they should hold all they have and are, for the Lord, not as
owners, but as stewards, and be willing, at His bidding, to use for
Him part or all they have. However short the believer may fall, nothing
less than this should be his aim.

It is the Lord''s order, that in whatever way He is pleased to make us
His stewards, whether as to temporal or spiritual things, if we are
indeed acting as stewards and not as owners, He will make us
stewards over more.

Even in this life, and as to temporal things, the Lord is pleased to
repay those who act for Him as stewards, and who contribute to His work
or to the poor, as He may be pleased to prosper them? But how much
greater is the spiritual blessing we receive, both in this life and in
the world to come, if constrained by the love of Christ, we act as God''s
stewards, respecting that with which He is pleased to intrust us!

Only fix even the smallest amount you purpose to give of your income,
and give this regularly; and as God is pleased to increase your light
and grace, and is pleased to prosper you more, so give more. If you
neglect an habitual giving, a regular giving, a giving from principle
and upon scriptural ground, and leave it only to feeling and impulse,
or particular arousing circumstances, you will certainly be a loser.

A merchant in the United States said in answer to inquiries relative to
his mode of giving, "In consecrating my life anew to God, aware of the
ensnaring influence of riches and the necessity of deciding on a plan of
charity, before wealth should bias my judgment, I adopted the following
system:

"I decided to balance my accounts as nearly as I could every month,
reserving such portion of profits as might appear adequate to cover
probable losses, and to lay aside, by entry on a benevolent account, one
tenth of the remaining profits, great or small, as a fund for benevolent
expenditure, supporting myself and family on the remaining nine tenths.
I further determined that if at any time my net profits, that is profits
from which clerk-hire and store expenses had been deducted, should
exceed five hundred dollars in a month, I would give 12 per cent.; if
over seven hundred dollars, 15 per cent.; if over nine hundred dollars,
17 per cent.; if over thirteen hundred dollars, 22 per cent.—thus
increasing the proportion of the whole as God should prosper me, until
at fifteen hundred dollars I should give 25 per cent, or 375 dollars a
month. As capital was of the utmost importance to my success in
business, I decided not to increase the foregoing scale until I had
acquired a certain capital, after which I would give one quarter of all
net profits, great or small, and, on the acquisition of another certain
amount of capital, I decided to give half, and, on acquiring what I
determined would be a full sufficiency of capital, then to give the
whole of my net profits.

"It is now several years since I adopted this plan, and under it I have
acquired a handsome capital, and have been prospered beyond my most
sanguine expectations. Although constantly giving, I have never yet
touched the bottom of my fund, and have repeatedly been surprised to
find what large drafts it would bear. True, during some months, I have
encountered a salutary trial of faith, when this rule has led me to lay
by the tenth while the remainder proved inadequate to my support; but
the tide has soon turned, and with gratitude I have recognized a
heavenly hand more than making good all past deficiencies."

The following deeply interesting particulars are recorded in the memoir
of Mr. Cobb, a Boston merchant. At the age of twenty-three, Mr. Cobb
drew up and subscribed the following remarkable document:

"By the grace of God I will give one fourth of the net profits of my
business to charitable and religious uses.

"If I am ever worth 20,000 dollars I will give one half of my net
profits; and if ever I am worth 30,000 dollars, I will give three
fourths; and the whole after 50,000 dollars. So help me God, or give to
a more faithful steward, and set me aside."

"To this covenant," says his memoir "he adhered with conscientious
fidelity. He distributed the profits of his business with an increasing
ratio, from year to year, till he reached the point which he had fixed
as a limit to his property, and then gave to the cause of God all the
money which he earned. At one time, finding that his property had
increased beyond 50,000 dollars, he at once devoted the surplus 7,500
dollars.

"On his death-bed he said, ''by the grace of God—nothing else—by the
grace of God I have been enabled, under the influence of these
resolutions to give away more than 40,000 dollars.'' How good the Lord
has been to me!"

Mr. Cobb was also an active, humble, and devoted Christian, seeking the
prosperity of feeble churches; labouring to promote the benevolent
institutions of the day; punctual in his attendance at prayer meetings,
and anxious to aid the inquiring sinner; watchful for the eternal
interests of those under his charge; mild and amiable in his deportment;
and, in the general tenor of his life and character, an example of
consistent piety.

His last sickness and death were peaceful, yea triumphant. "It is a
glorious thing," said he, "to die. I have been active and busy in the
world—I have enjoyed as much as any one—God has prospered me—I have
everything to bind me here—I am happy in my family—I have property
enough—but how small and mean does this world appear on a sick-bed!
Nothing can equal my enjoyment in the near view of heaven. My hope in
Christ is worth infinitely more than all other things. The blood of
Christ—the blood of Christ—none but Christ! Oh! how thankful I feel
that God has provided a way that I, sinful as I am, may look forward
with joy to another world, through His dear Son."

In the whole work we desire to stand with God, and not to depend upon
the favourable or unfavourable judgment of the multitude.

Our Heavenly Father never takes any earthly thing from His children
except He means to give them something better instead.

The Lord, in His very love and faithfulness, will not, and cannot, let
us go on in backsliding, but He will visit us with stripes, to bring us
back to Himself!

The Lord never lays more on us, in the way of chastisement, than our
state of heart makes needful; so that whilst He smites with the one
hand, He supports with the other.

If, as believers in the Lord Jesus, we see that our Heavenly Father, on
account of wrong steps, or a wrong state of heart, is dealing with us in
the way of discipline or correction, we have to be grateful for it; for
He is acting thus towards us according to that selfsame love, which led
Him not to spare His only begotten Son, but to deliver Him up for us;
and our gratitude to Him is to be expressed in words, and even by deeds.
We have to guard against practically despising the chastening of the
Lord, though we may not do so in word, and against fainting under
chastisement: since all is intended for blessing to us.

Perhaps you have said in your heart: "How would it be, suppose the funds
of the orphans were reduced to nothing, and those who are engaged in the
work had nothing of their own to give, and a meal-time were to come, and
you had no food for the children." Thus indeed it may be, for our hearts
are desperately wicked. If ever we should be so left to ourselves, as
that either we depend no more upon the living God, or that "we regard
iniquity in our hearts," then such a state of things, we have reason to
believe, would occur. But so long as we shall be enabled to trust in the
living God, and so long as, though falling short in every way of what we
might be, and ought to be, we are at least kept from living in sin, such
a state of things cannot occur.

The Lord, to show His continued care over us, raises up new helpers.
They that trust in the Lord shall never be confounded! Some who helped
for a while may fall asleep in Jesus; others may grow cold in the
service of the Lord; others may be as desirous as ever to help, but have
no longer the means; others may have both a willing heart to help, and
have also the means, but may see it the Lord''s will to lay them out in
another way;—and thus, from one cause or another, were we to lean upon
man, we should surely be confounded; but, in leaning upon the living God
alone, we are BEYOND disappointment, and BEYOND being forsaken
because of death, or want of means, or want of
love, or because of the claims of other work. How precious
to have learned in any measure to stand with God alone in the world, and
yet to be happy, and to know that surely no good thing shall be withheld
from us whilst we walk uprightly!

A brother, who is in about the same state in which he was eight years
ago, has very little enjoyment, and makes no progress in the things of
God. The reason is that, against his conscience, he remains in a
calling, which is opposed to the profession of a believer. We are
exhorted in Scripture to abide in our calling; but only if we can abide
in it "with God." (1 Cor. vii. 24.)

There is a worldly proverb, dear Christian reader, with which we are all
familiar, it is this, "Where there is a will there is a way." If this is
the proverb of those who know not God, how much more should believers in
the Lord Jesus, who have power with God, say: "Where there is a will
there is a way."

Only let it be trust in God, not in man, not in
circumstances, not in any of your own exertions, but
real trust in God, and you will be helped in your various
necessities.... Not in circumstances, not in natural prospects, not in
former donors, but solely in God. This is just that which
brings the blessing. If we say we trust in Him, but in reality
do not, then God, taking us at our word, lets us see that we do not
really confide in Him; and hence failure arises. On the other hand, if
our trust in the Lord is real, help will surely come, "According
unto thy faith be it unto thee."

It is a source of deep sorrow to me, that, notwithstanding my having so
many times before referred to this point, thereby to encourage believers
in the Lord Jesus, to roll all their cares upon God, and to trust in Him
at all times, it is yet, by so many, put down to mere natural causes,
that I am helped; as if the Living God were no more the Living God, and
as if in former ages answers to prayers might have been expected, but
that in the nineteenth century they must not be looked for.

How important it is to ascertain the will of God, before we undertake
anything, because we are then not only blessed in our own souls, but
also the work of our hands will prosper.

Just in as many points as we are acting according to the mind of God, in
so many are we blessed and made a blessing. Our manner of living is
according to the mind of the Lord, for He delights in seeing His
children thus come to Him (Matt. vi); and therefore, though I am weak
and erring in many points, yet He blesses me in this particular.

First of all, to see well to it, that the work in which he desires to be
engaged is God''s work; secondly, that he is the person to be engaged
in this work; thirdly, that God''s time is come, when he should do this
work; and then to be assured, that, if he seeks God''s help in His own
appointed way, He will not fail him. We have ever found it thus, and
expect to find it thus, on the ground of the promises of God, to the end
of our course.

1. Be slow to take new steps in the Lord''s service, or in your business,
or in your families. Weigh everything well; weigh all in the light of
the Holy Scriptures, and in the fear of God. 2. Seek to have no will of
your own, in order to ascertain the mind of God, regarding any steps you
propose to take, so that you can honestly say, you are willing to do the
will of God, if He will only please to instruct you. 3. But when you
have found out what the will of God is, seek for His help, and seek it
earnestly, perseveringly, patiently, believingly, and expectingly: and
you will surely, in His own time and way, obtain it.

We have not to rush forward in self-will and say, I will do the work,
and I will trust the Lord for means, this cannot be real trust, it is
the counterfeit of faith, it is presumption; and though God, in great
pity and mercy, may even help us finally out of debt; yet does this, on
no account, prove that we were right in going forward before His time
was come. We ought, rather, under such circumstances to say to
ourselves: Am I indeed doing the work of God? And if so, I may not
be the person to do it; or if I am the person, His time may not yet be
come for me to go forward; it may be His good pleasure to exercise my
faith and patience. I ought, therefore, quietly to wait His time; for
when it is come, God will help. Acting on this principle brings
blessing.

To ascertain the Lord''s will we ought to use scriptural means. Prayer,
the word of God, and His Spirit should be united together. We should go
to the Lord repeatedly in prayer, and ask Him to teach us by His Spirit
through His word. I say by His Spirit through His word. For if we should
think that His Spirit led us to do so and so, because certain facts are
so and so, and yet His word is opposed to the step which we are going to
take, we should be deceiving ourselves.... No situation, no business
will be given to me by God, in which I have not time enough to care
about my soul. Therefore, however outward circumstances may appear, it
can only be considered as permitted of God, to prove the genuineness of
my love, faith, and obedience, but by no means as the leading of His
providence to induce me to act contrary to His revealed will.

To enter upon the marriage union is one of the most deeply important
events of life. It cannot be too prayerfully treated. Our happiness, our
usefulness, our living for God or for ourselves after wards, are often
most intimately connected with our choice. Therefore, in the most
prayerful manner, this choice should be made. Neither beauty, nor age,
nor money, nor mental powers, should be that which prompts the decision;
but 1st, Much waiting upon God for guidance should be used; 2nd, A
hearty purpose to be willing to be guided by Him should be aimed after;
3rd, True godliness without a shadow of doubt, should be the first and
absolutely needful qualification, to a Christian, with regard to a
companion for life. In addition to this, however, it ought to be, at the
same time, calmly and patiently weighed, whether, in other respects,
there is a suitableness. For instance, for an educated man to choose an
entirely uneducated woman, is unwise; for however much on his part love
might be willing to cover the defect, it will work very unhappily with
regard to the children.

I myself have for twenty-nine years been waiting for an answer to prayer
concerning a certain spiritual blessing. Day by day have I been enabled
to continue in prayer for this blessing. At home and abroad, in this
country and in foreign lands, in health and in sickness, however much
occupied, I have been enabled, day by day, by God''s help, to bring this
matter before Him; and still I have not the full answer yet.
Nevertheless, I look for it. I expect it confidently. The very fact that
day after day, and year after year, for twenty-nine years, the Lord has
enabled me to continue, patiently, believingly, to wait on Him for the
blessing, still further encourages me to wait on; and so fully am I
assured that God hears me about this matter, that I have often been
enabled to praise Him beforehand for the full answer, which I shall
ultimately receive to my prayers on this subject. Thus, you see, dear
reader, that while I have hundreds, yea, thousands of answers, year by
year, I have also, like yourself and other believers, the trial of faith
concerning certain matters.

Though all believers in the Lord Jesus are not called upon to establish
orphan houses, schools for poor children, etc., and trust in God for
means; yet all believers, according to the will of God concerning them
in Christ Jesus, may cast, and ought to cast, all their care upon Him
who careth for them, and need not be anxiously concerned about anything,
as is plainly to be seen from 1 Peter v. 7; Philippians iv. 6; Matthew
vi. 25-34.

My Lord is not limited; He can again supply; He knows that this present
case has been sent to me; and thus, this way of living, so far from
leading to anxiety, as it regards possible future want, is rather the
means of keeping from it.... This way of living has often been the
means of reviving the work of grace in my heart, when I have been
getting cold; and it also has been the means of bringing me back again
to the Lord, after I have been backsliding. For it will not do,—it is
not possible, to live in sin, and at the same time, by communion with
God, to draw down from heaven everything one needs for the life that now
is.... Answer to prayer, obtained in this way, has been the means of
quickening my soul, and filling me with much joy.

I met at a brother''s house with several believers, when a sister said
that she had often thought about the care and burden I must have on my
mind, as it regards obtaining the necessary supplies for so many
persons. As this may not be a solitary instance, I would state that, by
the grace of God, this is no cause of anxiety to me. The children I have
years ago cast upon the Lord. The whole work is His, and it becomes me
to be without carefulness. In whatever points I am lacking, in this
point I am able, by the grace of God, to roll the burden upon my
heavenly Father. Though now (July 1845) for about seven years our funds
have been so exhausted, that it has been comparatively a rare case
that there have been means in hand to meet the necessities of the
orphans for three days together; yet have I been only once tried in
spirit, and that was on Sept. 18, 1838, when for the first time the Lord
seemed not to regard our prayer. But when He did send help at that time,
and I saw that it was only for the trial of our faith, and not because
He had forsaken the work that we were brought so low, my soul was so
strengthened and encouraged, that I have not only not been allowed to
distrust the Lord since that time, but I have not even been cast down
when in the deepest poverty. Nevertheless, in this respect also am I
now, as much as ever, dependent on the Lord; and I earnestly beseech for
myself and my fellow-labourers the prayers of all those, to whom the
glory of God is dear. How great would be the dishonour to the name of
God, if we, who have so publicly made our boast in Him, should so fall
as to act in these very points as the world does! Help us, then,
brethren, with your prayers, that we may trust in God to the end. We can
expect nothing but that our faith will yet be tried, and it may be more
than ever; and we shall fall, if the Lord does not uphold us.

As regards borrowing money, I have considered that there is no ground to
go away from the door of the Lord to that of a believer, so long as He
is willing to supply our need.

How truly precious it is that every one who rests alone upon the Lord
Jesus for salvation, has in the living God a father, to whom he may
fully unbosom himself concerning the most minute affairs of his life,
and concerning everything that lies upon his heart! Dear reader, do you
know the living God? Is He, in Jesus, your Father? Be assured that
Christianity is something more than forms and creeds and ceremonies:
there is life, and power, and reality, in our holy faith. If you never
yet have known this, then come and taste for yourself. I beseech you
affectionately to meditate and pray over the following verses: John iii.
16; Rom. x. 9, 10; Acts x. 43; 1 John v. 1.

Go for yourself, with all your temporal and spiritual wants, to the
Lord. Bring also the necessities of your friends and relatives to the
Lord. Only make the trial, and you will perceive how able and willing He
is to help you. Should you, however, not at once obtain answers to your
prayers, be not discouraged; but continue patiently, believingly,
perseveringly to wait upon God: and as assuredly as that which you ask
would be for your real good, and therefore for the honour of the Lord;
and as assuredly as you ask it solely on the ground of the worthiness of
our Lord Jesus, so assuredly you will at last obtain the blessing. I
myself have had to wait upon God concerning certain matters for years,
before I obtained answers to my prayers; but at last they came. At this
very time, I have still to renew my requests daily before God,
respecting a certain blessing for which I have besought Him for eleven
years and a half, and which I have as yet obtained only in part, but
concerning which I have no doubt that the full blessing will be granted
in the end.... The great point is that we ask only for that which it
would be for the glory of God to give to us; for that, and that alone,
can be for our real good. But it is not enough that the thing for which
we ask God be for His honour and glory, but we must secondly ask it in
the name of the Lord Jesus, viz., expect it only on the ground of His
merits and worthiness. Thirdly, we should believe that God is able and
willing to give us what we ask Him for. Fourthly, we should continue in
prayer till the blessing is granted; without fixing to God a time when,
or the circumstances under which, He should give the answer. Patience
should be in exercise, in connection with our prayer. Fifthly, we
should, at the same time, look out for and expect an answer till it
comes. If we pray in this way, we shall not only have answers, thousands
of answers to our prayers; but our own souls will be greatly refreshed
and invigorated in connection with these answers.

If the obtaining of your requests were not for your real good, or were
not tending to the honour of God, you might pray for a long time,
without obtaining what you desire. The glory of God should be always
before the children of God, in what they desire at His hands; and their
own spiritual profit, being so intimately connected with the honour of
God, should never be lost sight of, in their petitions. But now, suppose
we are believers in the Lord Jesus, and make our requests unto God,
depending alone on the Lord Jesus as the ground of having them granted;
suppose, also, that, so far as we are able honestly and uprightly to
judge, the obtaining of our requests would be for our real spiritual
good and for the honour of God; we yet need, lastly, to continue in
prayer, until the blessing is granted unto us. It is not enough to begin
to pray, nor to pray aright; nor is it enough to continue for a time
to pray; but we must patiently, believingly continue in prayer, until we
obtain an answer; and further, we have not only to continue in prayer
unto the end, but we have also to believe that God does hear us, and
will answer our prayers. Most frequently we fail in not continuing in
prayer until the blessing is obtained and in not expecting the
blessing.

Prayer and faith, the universal remedies against every want and every
difficulty; and the nourishment of prayer and faith, God''s holy word,
helped me over all the difficulties.—I never remember, in all my
Christian course, a period now (in March 1895) of sixty-nine years and
four months, that I ever SINCERELY and PATIENTLY sought to know the will
of God by the teaching of the Holy Ghost, through the instrumentality
of the word of God, but I have been ALWAYS directed rightly. But if
honesty of heart and uprightness before God were lacking, or if I
did not patiently wait upon God for instruction, or if I preferred
the counsel of my fellow men to the declarations of the word of the
living God, I made great mistakes.

Let none expect to have the mastery over his inward corruption in any
degree, without going in his weakness again and again to the Lord for
strength. Nor will prayer with others, or conversing with the brethren,
make up for secret prayer.

It is a common temptation of Satan to make us give up the reading of the
Word and prayer when our enjoyment is gone; as if it were of no use to
read the Scriptures when we do not enjoy them, and as if it were of no
use to pray when we have no spirit of prayer; whilst the truth is, in
order to enjoy the Word, we ought to continue to read it, and the way to
obtain a spirit of prayer is to continue praying; for the less we read
the word of God, the less we desire to read it, and the less we pray,
the less we desire to pray.

Often the work of the Lord itself may be a temptation to keep us from
that communion with Him which is so essential to the benefit of our own
souls.... Let none think that public prayer will make up for closet
communion.

Here is the great secret of success. Work with all your might; but trust
not in the least in your work. Pray with all your might for the blessing
of God; but work, at the same time, with all diligence, with all
patience, with all perseverance. Pray then, and work. Work and pray. And
still again pray, and then work. And so on all the days of your life.
The result will surely be, abundant blessing. Whether you see much
fruit or little fruit, such kind of service will be blessed.... Speak
also for the Lord, as if everything depended on your exertions; yet
trust not the least in your exertions, but in the Lord, who alone can
cause your efforts to be made effectual, to the benefit of your fellow
men or fellow believers. Remember, also, that God delights to bestow
blessing, but, generally, as the result of earnest, believing prayer.

It came immediately to my mind that such sort of preaching might do for
illiterate country people, but that it would never do before a
well-educated assembly in town. I thought, the truth ought to be
preached at all hazards, but it ought to be given in a different form,
suited to the hearers. Thus I remained unsettled in my mind as it
regards the mode of preaching; and it is not surprising that I did not
then see the truth concerning this matter, for I did not understand the
work of the Spirit, and therefore saw not the powerlessness of human
eloquence. Further, I did not keep in mind that if the most illiterate
persons in the congregation can comprehend the discourse, the most
educated will understand it too; but that the reverse does not hold
true.

Restitution is the revealed will of God. If it is omitted, while we have
it in our power to make it, guilt remains on the conscience, and
spiritual progress is hindered. Even though it should be connected with
difficulty, self-denial, and great loss, it is to be attended to. Should
the persons who have been defrauded be dead, their heirs are to be found
out, if this can be done, and restitution is to be made to them. But
there may be cases when this cannot be done, and then only the money
should be given to the Lord for His work or His poor. One word more.
Sometimes the guilty person may not have grace enough, if the rightful
owners are living, to make known to them the sin; under such
circumstances, though not the best and most scriptural way, rather than
have guilt remaining on the conscience, it is better to make restitution
anonymously than not at all. About fifty years ago, I knew a man under
concern about his soul, who had defrauded his master of two sacks of
flour, and who was urged by me to confess this sin to his late employer,
and to make restitution. He would not do it, however, and the result was
that for twenty years he never obtained real peace of soul till the
thing was done.

Christians do not practically remember that while we are saved by grace,
altogether by grace, so that in the matter of salvation works are
altogether excluded; yet that so far as the rewards of grace are
concerned, in the world to come, there is an intimate connection between
the life of the Christian here and the enjoyment and the glory in the
day of Christ''s appearing.

Rumblings last our whole life. Jesus came not to save painted but
real sinners; but He has saved us, and will surely make it manifest.

At Stuttgart, the dear brethren had been entirely uninstructed about the
truths relating to the power and presence of the Holy Ghost in the
church of God, and to our ministering one to another as fellow members
in the body of Christ; and I had known enough of painful consequences
when brethren began to meet professedly in dependence upon the Holy
Spirit without knowing what was meant by it, and thus meetings had
become opportunities for unprofitable talking rather than for godly
edifying.... All these matters ought to be left to the ordering of the
Holy Ghost, and that if it had been truly good for them, the Lord would
have not only led me to speak at that time, but also on the very
subject on which they desired that I should speak to them.

Whatever parts of truth are made too much of, though they were even the
most precious truths connected with our being risen in Christ, or our
heavenly calling, or prophecy, sooner or later those who lay an undue
stress upon these parts of truth, and thus make them too prominent,
will be losers in their own souls, and, if they be teachers, they will
injure those whom they teach.

In reference to universal salvation, I found that they had been led into
this error because (1) They did not see the difference between the
earthly calling of the Jews, and the heavenly calling of the believers
in the Lord Jesus in the present dispensation, and therefore they said
that, because the words "everlasting," etc., are applied to "the
possession of the land of Canaan" and the "priesthood of Aaron,"
therefore, the punishment of the wicked cannot be without end, seeing
that the possession of Canaan and the priesthood of Aaron are not
without end. My endeavour, therefore, was to show the brethren the
difference between the earthly calling of Israel and our heavenly
one, and to prove from Scripture that, whenever the word "everlasting"
is used with reference to things purely not of the earth, but beyond
time, it denotes a period without end. (2) They had laid exceeding great
stress upon a few passages where, in Luther''s translation of the German
Bible, the word hell occurs, and where it ought to have been translated
either "hades" in some passages, or "grave" in others, and where they
saw a deliverance out of hell, and a being brought up out of hell,
instead of "out of the grave."

Besides the Holy Scriptures, which should be always THE book, THE CHIEF
book to us, not merely in theory, but also in practice, such like books
seem to me the most useful for the growth of the inner man. Yet one has
to be cautious in the choice, and to guard against reading too much.

When He orders something to be done for the glory of His name, He is
both able and willing to find the needed individuals for the work and
the means required. Thus, when the Tabernacle in the Wilderness was to
be erected, He not only fitted men for the work, but He also touched the
hearts of the Israelites to bring the necessary materials and gold,
silver, and precious stones; and all these things were not only brought,
but in such abundance that a proclamation had to be made in the camp,
that no more articles should be brought, because there were more than
enough. And again, when God for the praise of His name would have the
Temple to be built by Solomon, He provided such an amount of gold,
silver, precious stones, brass, iron, etc., for it, that all the palaces
or temples which have been built since have been most insignificant in
comparison.' WHERE id = 'eb428426-4daa-4d37-9423-55ef0a84d874';
