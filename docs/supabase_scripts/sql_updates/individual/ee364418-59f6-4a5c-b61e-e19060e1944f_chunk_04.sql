UPDATE stories SET original_text = original_text || 'there are indications that he was also
      occupied with the philosophy of mathematics. I take it he has transferred
      the whole of his memories, the accumulation that makes up his personality,
      from this old withered brain of his to mine, and, similarly, that he has
      transferred mine to his discarded tenement. Practically, that is, he has
      changed bodies. But how such a change may be possible is without the range
      of my philosophy. I have been a materialist for all my thinking life, but
      here, suddenly, is a clear case of man''s detachability from matter.

One desperate experiment I am about to try. I sit writing here before
      putting the matter to issue. This morning, with the help of a table-knife
      that I had secreted at breakfast, I succeeded in breaking open a fairly
      obvious secret drawer in this wrecked writing-desk. I discovered nothing
      save a little green glass phial containing a white powder. Round the neck
      of the phial was a label, and thereon was written this one word, "Release."
      This may be—is most probably—poison. I can understand Elvesham
      placing poison in my way, and I should be sure that it was his intention
      so to get rid of the only living witness against him, were it not for this
      careful concealment. The man has practically solved the problem of
      immortality. Save for the spite of chance, he will live in my body until
      it has aged, and then, again, throwing that aside, he will assume some
      other victim''s youth and strength. When one remembers his heartlessness,
      it is terrible to think of the ever-growing experience that... How long
      has he been leaping from body to body?... But I tire of writing. The
      powder appears to be soluble in water. The taste is not unpleasant.

There the narrative found upon Mr. Elvesham''s desk ends. His dead body lay
      between the desk and the chair. The latter had been pushed back, probably
      by his last convulsions. The story was written in pencil and in a crazy
      hand, quite unlike his usual minute characters. There remain only two
      curious facts to record. Indisputably there was some connection between
      Eden and Elvesham, since the whole of Elvesham''s property was bequeathed
      to the young man. But he never inherited. When Elvesham committed suicide,
      Eden was, strangely enough, already dead. Twenty-four hours before, he had
      been knocked down by a cab and killed instantly, at the crowded crossing
      at the intersection of Gower Street and Euston Road. So that the only
      human being who could have thrown light upon this fantastic narrative is
      beyond the reach of questions. Without further comment I leave this
      extraordinary matter to the reader''s individual judgment.

"What if I die under it?" The thought recurred again and again, as I
      walked home from Haddon''s. It was a purely personal question. I was spared
      the deep anxieties of a married man, and I knew there were few of my
      intimate friends but would find my death troublesome chiefly on account of
      their duty of regret. I was surprised indeed, and perhaps a little
      humiliated, as I turned the matter over, to think how few could possibly
      exceed the conventional requirement. Things came before me stripped of
      glamour, in a clear dry light, during that walk from Haddon''s house over
      Primrose Hill. There were the friends of my youth: I perceived now that
      our affection was a tradition, which we foregathered rather laboriously to
      maintain. There were the rivals and helpers of my later career: I suppose
      I had been cold-blooded or undemonstrative—one perhaps implies the
      other. It may be that even the capacity for friendship is a question of
      physique. There had been a time in my own life when I had grieved bitterly
      enough at the loss of a friend; but as I walked home that afternoon the
      emotional side of my imagination was dormant. I could not pity myself, nor
      feel sorry for my friends, nor conceive of them as grieving for me.

I was interested in this deadness of my emotional nature—no doubt a
      concomitant of my stagnating physiology; and my thoughts wandered off
      along the line it suggested. Once before, in my hot youth, I had suffered
      a sudden loss of blood, and had been within an ace of death. I remembered
      now that my affections as well as my passions had drained out of me,
      leaving scarce anything but a tranquil resignation, a dreg of self-pity.
      It had been weeks before the old ambitions and tendernesses and all the
      complex moral interplay of a man had reasserted themselves. It occurred to
      me that the real meaning of this numbness might be a gradual slipping away
      from the pleasure-pain guidance of the animal man. It has been proven, I
      take it, as thoroughly as anything can be proven in this world, that the
      higher emotions, the moral feelings, even the subtle unselfishness of
      love, are evolved from the elemental desires and fears of the simple
      animal: they are the harness in which man''s mental freedom goes. And it
      may be that as death overshadows us, as our possibility of acting
      diminishes, this complex growth of balanced impulse, propensity and
      aversion, whose interplay inspires our acts, goes with it. Leaving what?

I was suddenly brought back to reality by an imminent collision with the
      butcher-boy''s tray. I found that I was crossing the bridge over the Regent''s
      Park Canal, which runs parallel with that in the Zoological Gardens. The
      boy in blue had been looking over his shoulder at a black barge advancing
      slowly, towed by a gaunt white horse. In the Gardens a nurse was leading
      three happy little children over the bridge. The trees were bright green;
      the spring hopefulness was still unstained by the dusts of summer; the sky
      in the water was bright and clear, but broken by long waves, by quivering
      bands of black, as the barge drove through. The breeze was stirring; but
      it did not stir me as the spring breeze used to do.

Was this dulness of feeling in itself an anticipation? It was curious that
      I could reason and follow out a network of suggestion as clearly as ever:
      so, at least, it seemed to me. It was calmness rather than dulness that
      was coming upon me. Was there any ground for the relief in the
      presentiment of death? Did a man near to death begin instinctively to
      withdraw himself from the meshes of matter and sense, even before the cold
      hand was laid upon his? I felt strangely isolated—isolated without
      regret—from the life and existence about me. The children playing in
      the sun and gathering strength and experience for the business of life,
      the park-keeper gossiping with a nursemaid, the nursing mother, the young
      couple intent upon each other as they passed me, the trees by the wayside
      spreading new pleading leaves to the sunlight, the stir in their branches—I
      had been part of it all, but I had nearly done with it now.

Some way down the Broad Walk I perceived that I was tired, and that my
      feet were heavy. It was hot that afternoon, and I turned aside and sat
      down on one of the green chairs that line the way. In a minute I had dozed
      into a dream, and the tide of my thoughts washed up a vision of the
      resurrection. I was still sitting in the chair, but I thought myself
      actually dead, withered, tattered, dried, one eye (I saw) pecked out by
      birds. "Awake!" cried a voice; and incontinently the dust of the path and
      the mould under the grass became insurgent. I had never before thought of
      Regent''s Park as a cemetery, but now, through the trees, stretching as far
      as eye could see, I beheld a flat plain of writhing graves and heeling
      tombstones. There seemed to be some trouble: the rising dead appeared to
      stifle as they struggled upward, they bled in their struggles, the red
      flesh was torn away from the white bones. "Awake!" cried a voice; but I
      determined I would not rise to such horrors. "Awake!" They would not let
      me alone. "Wake up!" said an angry voice. A cockney angel! The man who
      sells the tickets was shaking me, demanding my penny.

I paid my penny, pocketed my ticket, yawned, stretched my legs, and,
      feeling now rather less torpid, got up and walked on towards Langham
      Place. I speedily lost myself again in a shifting maze of thoughts about
      death. Going across Marylebone Road into that crescent at the end of
      Langham Place, I had the narrowest escape from the shaft of a cab, and
      went on my way with a palpitating heart and a bruised shoulder. It struck
      me that it would have been curious if my meditations on my death on the
      morrow had led to my death that day.

But I will not weary you with more of my experiences that day and the
      next. I knew more and more certainly that I should die under the
      operation; at times I think I was inclined to pose to myself. The doctors
      were coming at eleven, and I did not get up. It seemed scarce worth while
      to trouble about washing and dressing, and though I read my newspapers and
      the letters that came by the first post, I did not find them very
      interesting. There was a friendly note from Addison, my old school-friend,
      calling my attention to two discrepancies and a printer''s error in my new
      book, with one from Langridge venting some vexation over Minton. The rest
      were business communications. I breakfasted in bed. The glow of pain at my
      side seemed more massive. I knew it was pain, and yet, if you can
      understand, I did not find it very painful. I had been awake and hot and
      thirsty in the night, but in the morning bed felt comfortable. In the
      night-time I had lain thinking of things that were past; in the morning I
      dozed over the question of immortality. Haddon came, punctual to the
      minute, with a neat black bag; and Mowbray soon followed. Their arrival
      stirred me up a little. I began to take a more personal interest in the
      proceedings. Haddon moved the little octagonal table close to the bedside,
      and, with his broad back to me, began taking things out of his bag. I
      heard the light click of steel upon steel. My imagination, I found, was
      not altogether stagnant. "Will you hurt me much?" I said in an off-hand
      tone.

"Not a bit," Haddon answered over his shoulder. "We shall chloroform you.
      Your heart''s as sound as a bell." And as he spoke, I had a whiff of the
      pungent sweetness of the anaesthetic.

They stretched me out, with a convenient exposure of my side, and, almost
      before I realised what was happening, the chloroform was being
      administered. It stings the nostrils, and there is a suffocating sensation
      at first. I knew I should die—that this was the end of consciousness
      for me. And suddenly I felt that I was not prepared for death: I had a
      vague sense of a duty overlooked—I knew not what. What was it I had
      not done? I could think of nothing more to do, nothing desirable left in
      life; and yet I had the strangest disinclination to death. And the
      physical sensation was painfully oppressive. Of course the doctors did not
      know they were going to kill me. Possibly I struggled. Then I fell
      motionless, and a great silence, a monstrous silence, and an impenetrable
      blackness came upon me.

There must have been an interval of absolute unconsciousness, seconds or
      minutes. Then with a chilly, unemotional clearness, I perceived that I was
      not yet dead. I was still in my body; but all the multitudinous sensations
      that come sweeping from it to make up the background of consciousness had
      gone, leaving me free of it all. No, not free of it all; for as yet
      something still held me to the poor stark flesh upon the bed—held
      me, yet not so closely that I did not feel myself external to it,
      independent of it, straining away from it. I do not think I saw, I do not
      think I heard; but I perceived all that was going on, and it was as if I
      both heard and saw. Haddon was bending over me, Mowbray behind me; the
      scalpel—it was a large scalpel—was cutting my flesh at the
      side under the flying ribs. It was interesting to see myself cut like
      cheese, without a pang, without even a qualm. The interest was much of a
      quality with that one might feel in a game of chess between strangers.
      Haddon''s face was firm and his hand steady; but I was surprised to
      perceive (how I know not) that he was feeling the gravest doubt as
      to his own wisdom in the conduct of the operation.

Mowbray''s thoughts, too, I could see. He was thinking that Haddon''s manner
      showed too much of the specialist. New suggestions came up like bubbles
      through a stream of frothing meditation, and burst one after another in
      the little bright spot of his consciousness. He could not help noticing
      and admiring Haddon''s swift dexterity, in spite of his envious quality and
      his disposition to detract. I saw my liver exposed. I was puzzled at my
      own condition. I did not feel that I was dead, but I was different in some
      way from my living self. The grey depression, that had weighed on me for a
      year or more and coloured all my thoughts, was gone. I perceived and
      thought without any emotional tint at all. I wondered if everyone
      perceived things in this way under chloroform, and forgot it again when he
      came out of it. It would be inconvenient to look into some heads, and not
      forget.

Although I did not think that I was dead, I still perceived quite clearly
      that I was soon to die. This brought me back to the consideration of
      Haddon''s proceedings. I looked into his mind, and saw that he was afraid
      of cutting a branch of the portal vein. My attention was distracted from
      details by the curious changes going on in his mind. His consciousness was
      like the quivering little spot of light which is thrown by the mirror of a
      galvanometer. His thoughts ran under it like a stream, some through the
      focus bright and distinct, some shadowy in the half-light of the edge.
      Just now the little glow was steady; but the least movement on Mowbray''s
      part, the slightest sound from outside, even a faint difference in the
      slow movement of the living flesh he was cutting, set the light-spot
      shivering and spinning. A new sense-impression came rushing up through the
      flow of thoughts; and lo! the light-spot jerked away towards it, swifter
      than a frightened fish. It was wonderful to think that upon that unstable,
      fitful thing depended all the complex motions of the man; that for the
      next five minutes, therefore, my life hung upon its movements. And he was
      growing more and more nervous in his work. It was as if a little picture
      of a cut vein grew brighter, and struggled to oust from his brain another
      picture of a cut falling short of the mark. He was afraid: his dread of
      cutting too little was battling with his dread of cutting too far.

Then, suddenly, like an escape of water from under a lock-gate, a great
      uprush of horrible realisation set all his thoughts swirling, and
      simultaneously I perceived that the vein was cut. He started back with a
      hoarse exclamation, and I saw the brown-purple blood gather in a swift
      bead, and run trickling. He was horrified. He pitched the red-stained
      scalpel on to the octagonal table; and instantly both doctors flung
      themselves upon me, making hasty and ill-conceived efforts to remedy the
      disaster. "Ice!" said Mowbray, gasping. But I knew that I was killed,
      though my body still clung to me.

I will not describe their belated endeavours to save me, though I
      perceived every detail. My perceptions were sharper and swifter than they
      had ever been in life; my thoughts rushed through my mind with incredible
      swiftness, but with perfect definition. I can only compare their crowded
      clarity to the effects of a reasonable dose of opium. In a moment it would
      all be over, and I should be free. I knew I was immortal, but what would
      happen I did not know. Should I drift off presently, like a puff of smoke
      from a gun, in some kind of half-material body, an attenuated version of
      my material self? Should I find myself suddenly among the innumerable
      hosts of the dead, and know the world about me for the phantasmagoria it
      had always seemed? Should I drift to some spiritualistic siance,
      and there make foolish, incomprehensible attempts to affect a purblind
      medium? It was a state of unemotional curiosity, of colourless
      expectation. And then I realised a growing stress upon me, a feeling as
      though some huge human magnet was drawing me upward out of my body. The
      stress grew and grew. I seemed an atom for which monstrous forces were
      fighting. For one brief, terrible moment sensation came back to me. That
      feeling of falling headlong which comes in nightmares, that feeling a
      thousand times intensified, that and a black horror swept across my
      thoughts in a torrent. Then the two doctors, the naked body with its cut
      side, the little room, swept away from under me and vanished, as a speck
      of foam vanishes down an eddy.

I was in mid-air. Far below was the West End of London, receding rapidly,—for
      I seemed to be flying swiftly upward,—and as it receded, passing
      westward like a panorama. I could see, through the faint haze of smoke,
      the innumerable roofs chimney-set, the narrow roadways, stippled with
      people and conveyances, the little specks of squares, and the church
      steeples like thorns sticking out of the fabric. But it spun away as the
      earth rotated on its axis, and in a few seconds (as it seemed) I was over
      the scattered clumps of town about Ealing, the little Thames a thread of
      blue to the south, and the Chiltern Hills and the North Downs coming up
      like the rim of a basin, far away and faint with haze. Up I rushed. And at
      first I had not the faintest conception what this headlong rush upward
      could mean.

Every moment the circle of scenery beneath me grew wider and wider, and
      the details of town and field, of hill and valley, got more and more hazy
      and pale and indistinct, a luminous grey was mingled more and more with
      the blue of the hills and the green of the open meadows; and a little
      patch of cloud, low and far to the west, shone ever more dazzlingly white.
      Above, as the veil of atmosphere between myself and outer space grew
      thinner, the sky, which had been a fair springtime blue at first, grew
      deeper and richer in colour, passing steadily through the intervening
      shades, until presently it was as dark as the blue sky of midnight, and
      presently as black as the blackness of a frosty starlight, and at last as
      black as no blackness I had ever beheld. And first one star, and then
      many, and at last an innumerable host broke out upon the sky: more stars
      than anyone has ever seen from the face of the earth. For the blueness of
      the sky in the light of the sun and stars sifted and spread abroad
      blindingly: there is diffused light even in the darkest skies of winter,
      and we do not see the stars by day only because of the dazzling
      irradiation of the sun. But now I saw things—I know not how;
      assuredly with no mortal eyes—and that defect of bedazzlement
      blinded me no longer. The sun was incredibly strange and wonderful. The
      body of it was a disc of blinding white light: not yellowish, as it seems
      to those who live upon the earth, but livid white, all streaked with
      scarlet streaks and rimmed about with a fringe of writhing tongues of red
      fire. And shooting half-way across the heavens from either side of it and
      brighter than the Milky Way, were two pinions of silver white, making it
      look more like those winged globes I have seen in Egyptian sculpture than
      anything else I can remember upon earth. These I knew for the solar
      corona, though I had never seen anything of it but a picture during the
      days of my earthly life.

When my attention came back to the earth again, I saw that it had fallen
      very far away from me. Field and town were long since indistinguishable,
      and all the varied hues of the country were merging into a uniform bright
      grey, broken only by the brilliant white of the clouds that lay scattered
      in flocculent masses over Ireland and the west of England. For now I could
      see the outlines of the north of France and Ireland, and all this Island
      of Britain, save where Scotland passed over the horizon to the north, or
      where the coast was blurred or obliterated by cloud. The sea was a dull
      grey, and darker than the land; and the whole panorama was rotating slowly
      towards the east.

All this had happened so swiftly that until I was some thousand miles or
      so from the earth I had no thought for myself. But now I perceived I had
      neither hands nor feet, neither parts nor organs, and that I felt neither
      alarm nor pain. All about me I perceived that the vacancy (for I had
      already left the air behind) was cold beyond the imagination of man; but
      it troubled me not. The sun''s rays shot through the void, powerless to
      light or heat until they should strike on matter in their course. I saw
      things with a serene self-forgetfulness, even as if I were God. And down
      below there, rushing away from me,—countless miles in a second,—where
      a little dark spot on the grey marked the position of London, two doctors
      were struggling to restore life to the poor hacked and outworn shell I had
      abandoned. I felt then such release, such serenity as I can compare to no
      mortal delight I have ever known.

It was only after I had perceived all these things that the meaning of
      that headlong rush of the earth grew into comprehension. Yet it was so
      simple, so obvious, that I was amazed at my never anticipating the thing
      that was happening to me. I had suddenly been cut adrift from matter: all
      that was material of me was there upon earth, whirling away through space,
      held to the earth by gravitation, partaking of the earth-inertia, moving
      in its wreath of epicycles round the sun, and with the sun and the planets
      on their vast march through space. But the immaterial has no inertia,
      feels nothing of the pull of matter for matter: where it parts from its
      garment of flesh, there it remains (so far as space concerns it any
      longer) immovable in space. I was not leaving the earth: the earth
      was leaving me, and not only the earth but the whole solar system
      was streaming past. And about me in space, invisible to me, scattered in
      the wake of the earth upon its journey, there must be an innumerable
      multitude of souls, stripped like myself of the material, stripped like
      myself of the passions of the individual and the generous emotions of the
      gregarious brute, naked intelligences, things of new-born wonder and
      thought, marvelling at the strange release that had suddenly come on them!

As I receded faster and faster from the strange white sun in the black
      heavens, and from the broad and shining earth upon which my being had
      begun, I seemed to grow in some incredible manner vast: vast as regards
      this world I had left, vast as regards the moments and periods of a human
      life. Very soon I saw the full circle of the earth, slightly gibbous, like
      the moon when she nears her full, but very large; and the silvery shape of
      America was now in the noonday blaze wherein (as it seemed) little England
      had been basking but a few minutes ago. At first the earth was large, and
      shone in the heavens, filling a great part of them; but every moment she
      grew smaller and more distant. As she shrank, the broad moon in its third
      quarter crept into view over the rim of her disc. I looked for the
      constellations. Only that part of Aries directly behind the sun and the
      Lion, which the earth covered, were hidden. I recognised the tortuous,
      tattered band of the Milky Way with Vega very bright between sun and
      earth; and Sirius and Orion shone splendid against the unfathomable
      blackness in the opposite quarter of the heavens. The Pole Star was
      overhead, and the Great Bear hung over the circle of the earth. And away
      beneath and beyond the shining corona of the sun were strange groupings of
      stars I had never seen in my life—notably a dagger-shaped group that
      I knew for the Southern Cross. All these were no larger than when they had
      shone on earth, but the little stars that one scarce sees shone now
      against the setting of black vacancy as brightly as the first-magnitudes
      had done, while the larger worlds were points of indescribable glory and
      colour. Aldebaran was a spot of blood-red fire, and Sirius condensed to
      one point the light of innumerable sapphires. And they shone steadily:
      they did not scintillate, they were calmly glorious. My impressions had an
      adamantine hardness and brightness: there was no blurring softness, no
      atmosphere, nothing but infinite darkness set with the myriads of these
      acute and brilliant points and specks of light. Presently, when I looked
      again, the little earth seemed no bigger than the sun, and it dwindled and
      turned as I looked, until in a second''s space (as it seemed to me), it was
      halved; and so it went on swiftly dwindling. Far away in the opposite
      direction, a little pinkish pin''s head of light, shining steadily, was the
      planet Mars. I swam motionless in vacancy, and, without a trace of terror
      or astonishment, watched the speck of cosmic dust we call the world fall
      away from me.

Presently it dawned upon me that my sense of duration had changed; that my
      mind was moving not faster but infinitely slower, that between each
      separate impression there was a period of many days. The moon spun once
      round the earth as I noted this; and I perceived clearly the motion of
      Mars in his orbit. Moreover, it appeared as if the time between thought
      and thought grew steadily greater, until at last a thousand years was but
      a moment in my perception.

At first the constellations had shone motionless against the black
      background of infinite space; but presently it seemed as though the group
      of stars about Hercules and the Scorpion was contracting, while Orion and
      Aldebaran and their neighbours were scattering apart. Flashing suddenly
      out of the darkness there came a flying multitude of particles of rock,
      glittering like dust-specks in a sunbeam, and encompassed in a faintly
      luminous cloud. They swirled all about me, and vanished again in a
      twinkling far behind. And then I saw that a bright spot of light, that
      shone a little to one side of my path, was growing very rapidly larger,
      and perceived that it was the planet Saturn rushing towards me. Larger and
      larger it grew, swallowing up the heavens behind it, and hiding every
      moment a fresh multitude, of stars. I perceived its flattened, whirling
      body, its disc-like belt, and seven of its little satellites. It grew and
      grew, till it towered enormous; and then I plunged amid a streaming
      multitude of clashing stones and dancing dust-particles and gas-eddies,
      and saw for a moment the mighty triple belt like three concentric arches
      of moonlight above me, its shadow black on the boiling tumult below. These
      things happened in one-tenth of the time it takes to tell them. The planet
      went by like a flash of lightning; for a few seconds it blotted out the
      sun, and there and then became a mere black, dwindling, winged patch
      against the light. The earth, the mother mote of my being, I could no
      longer see.

So with a stately swiftness, in the profoundest silence, the solar system
      fell from me as it had been a garment, until the sun was a mere star amid
      the multitude of stars, with its eddy of planet-specks lost in the
      confused glittering of the remoter light. I was no longer a denizen of the
      solar system: I had come to the outer Universe, I seemed to grasp and
      comprehend the whole world of matter. Ever more swiftly the stars closed
      in about the spot where Antares and Vega had vanished in a phosphorescent
      haze, until that part of the sky had the semblance of a whirling mass of
      nebulae, and ever before me yawned vaster gaps of vacant blackness, and
      the stars shone fewer and fewer. It seemed as if I moved towards a point
      between Orion''s belt and sword; and the void about that region opened
      vaster and vaster every second, an incredible gulf of nothingness into
      which I was falling. Faster and ever faster the universe rushed by, a
      hurry of whirling motes at last, speeding silently into the void. Stars
      glowing brighter and brighter, with their circling planets catching the
      light in a ghostly fashion as I neared them, shone out and vanished again
      into inexistence; faint comets, clusters of meteorites, winking specks of
      matter, eddying light-points, whizzed past, some perhaps a hundred
      millions of miles or so from me at most, few nearer, travelling with
      unimaginable rapidity, shooting constellations, momentary darts of fire,
      through that black, enormous night. More than anything else it was like a
      dusty draught, sunbeam-lit. Broader and wider and deeper grew the starless
      space, the vacant Beyond, into which I was being drawn. At last a quarter
      of the heavens was black and blank, and the whole headlong rush of stellar
      universe closed in behind me like a veil of light that is gathered
      together. It drove away from me like a monstrous jack-o''-lantern driven by
      the wind. I had come out into the wilderness of space. Ever the vacant
      blackness grew broader, until the hosts of the stars seemed only like a
      swarm of fiery specks hurrying away from me, inconceivably remote, and the
      darkness, the nothingness and emptiness, was about me on every side. Soon
      the little universe of matter, the cage of points in which I had begun to
      be, was dwindling, now to a whirling disc of luminous glittering, and now
      to one minute disc of hazy light. In a little while it would shrink to a
      point, and at last would vanish altogether.

Suddenly feeling came back to me—feeling in the shape of
      overwhelming terror; such a dread of those dark vastitudes as no words can
      describe, a passionate resurgence of sympathy and social desire. Were
      there other souls, invisible to me as I to them, about me in the
      blackness? or was I indeed, even as I felt, alone? Had I passed out of
      being into something that was neither being nor not-being? The covering of
      the body, the covering of matter, had been torn from me, and the
      hallucinations of companionship and security. Everything was black and
      silent. I had ceased to be. I was nothing. There was nothing, save only
      that infinitesimal dot of light that dwindled in the gulf. I strained
      myself to hear and see, and for a while there was naught but infinite
      silence, intolerable darkness, horror, and despair.

Then I saw that about the spot of light into which the whole world of
      matter had shrunk there was a faint glow. And in a band on either side of
      that the darkness was not absolute. I watched it for ages, as it seemed to
      me, and through the long waiting the haze grew imperceptibly more
      distinct. And then about the band appeared an irregular cloud of the
      faintest, palest brown. I felt a passionate impatience; but the things
      grew brighter so slowly that they scarce seemed to change. What was
      unfolding itself? What was this strange reddish dawn in the interminable
      night of space?

The cloud''s shape was grotesque. It seemed to be looped along its lower
      side into four projecting masses, and, above, it ended in a straight line.
      What phantom was it? I felt assured I had seen that figure before; but I
      could not think what, nor where, nor when it was. Then the realisation
      rushed upon me. It was a clenched Hand. I was alone in space, alone
      with this huge, shadowy Hand, upon which the whole Universe of Matter lay
      like an unconsidered speck of dust. It seemed as though I watched it
      through vast periods of time. On the forefinger glittered a ring; and the
      universe from which I had come was but a spot of light upon the ring''s
      curvature. And the thing that the hand gripped had the likeness of a black
      rod. Through a long eternity I watched this Hand, with the ring and the
      rod, marvelling and fearing and waiting helplessly on what might follow.
      It seemed as though nothing could follow: that I should watch for ever,
      seeing only the Hand and the thing it held, and understanding nothing of
      its import. Was the whole universe but a refracting speck upon some
      greater Being? Were our worlds but the atoms of another universe, and
      those again of another, and so on through an endless progression? And what
      was I? Was I indeed immaterial? A vague persuasion of a body gathering
      about me came into my suspense. The abysmal darkness about the Hand filled
      with impalpable suggestions, with uncertain, fluctuating shapes.

Then, suddenly, came a sound, like the sound of a tolling bell: faint, as
      if infinitely far; muffled, as though heard through thick swathings of
      darkness: a deep, vibrating resonance, with vast gulfs of silence between
      each stroke. And the Hand appeared to tighten on the rod. And I saw far
      above the Hand, towards the apex of the darkness, a circle of dim
      phosphorescence, a ghostly sphere whence these sounds came throbbing; and
      at the last stroke the Hand vanished, for the hour had come, and I heard a
      noise of many waters. But the black rod remained as a great band across
      the sky. And then a voice, which seemed to run to the uttermost parts of
      space, spoke, saying, "There will be no more pain."

At that an almost intolerable gladness and radiance rushed in upon me, and
      I saw the circle shining white and bright, and the rod black and shining,
      and many things else distinct and clear. And the circle was the face of
      the clock, and the rod the rail of my bed. Haddon was standing at the
      foot, against the rail, with a small pair of scissors on his fingers; and
      the hands of my clock on the mantel over his shoulder were clasped
      together over the hour of twelve. Mowbray was washing something in a basin
      at the octagonal table, and at my side I felt a subdued feeling that could
      scarce be spoken of as pain.

The operation had not killed me. And I perceived, suddenly, that the dull
      melancholy of half a year was lifted from my mind.

I. — Until the extraordinary affair at Sidmouth, the peculiar
      species Haploteuthis ferox was known to science only generically,
      on the strength of a half-digested tentacle obtained near the Azores, and
      a decaying body pecked by birds and nibbled by fish, found early in 1896
      by Mr. Jennings, near Land''s End.

In no department of zoological science, indeed, are we quite so much in
      the dark as with regard to the deep-sea cephalopods. A mere accident, for
      instance, it was that led to the Prince of Monaco''s discovery of nearly a
      dozen new forms in the summer of 1895, a discovery in which the
      before-mentioned tentacle was included. It chanced that a cachalot was
      killed off Terceira by some sperm whalers, and in its last struggles
      charged almost to the Prince''s yacht, missed it, rolled under, and died
      within twenty yards of his rudder. And in its agony it threw up a number
      of large objects, which the Prince, dimly perceiving they were strange and
      important, was, by a happy expedient, able to secure before they sank. He
      set his screws in motion, and kept them circling in the vortices thus
      created until a boat could be lowered. And these specimens were whole
      cephalopods and fragments of cephalopods, some of gigantic proportions,
      and almost all of them unknown to science!

It would seem, indeed, that these large and agile creatures, living in the
      middle depths of the sea, must, to a large extent, for ever remain unknown
      to us, since under water they are too nimble for nets, and it is only by
      such rare, unlooked-for accidents that specimens can be obtained. In the
      case of Haploteuthis ferox, for instance, we are still altogether
      ignorant of its habitat, as ignorant as we are of the breeding-ground of
      the herring or the sea-ways of the salmon. And zoologists are altogether
      at a loss to account for its sudden appearance on our coast. Possibly it
      was the stress of a hunger migration that drove it hither out of the deep.
      But it will be, perhaps, better to avoid necessarily inconclusive
      discussion, and to proceed at once with our narrative.

The first human being to set eyes upon a living Haploteuthis—the
      first human being to survive, that is, for there can be little doubt now
      that the wave of bathing fatalities and boating accidents that travelled
      along the coast of Cornwall and Devon in early May was due to this cause—was
      a retired tea-dealer of the name of Fison, who was stopping at a Sidmouth
      boarding-house. It was in the afternoon, and he was walking along the
      cliff path between Sidmouth and Ladram Bay. The cliffs in this direction
      are very high, but down the red face of them in one place a kind of ladder
      staircase has been made. He was near this when his attention was attracted
      by what at first he thought to be a cluster of birds struggling over a
      fragment of food that caught the sunlight, and glistened pinkish-white.
      The tide was right out, and this object was not only far below him, but
      remote across a broad waste of rock reefs covered with dark seaweed and
      interspersed with silvery shining tidal pools. And he was, moreover,
      dazzled by the brightness of the further water.

In a minute, regarding this again, he perceived that his judgment was in
      fault, for over this struggle circled a number of birds, jackdaws and
      gulls for the most part, the latter gleaming blindingly when the sunlight
      smote their wings, and they seemed minute in comparison with it. And his
      curiosity was, perhaps, aroused all the more strongly because of his first
      insufficient explanations.

As he had nothing better to do than amuse himself, he decided to make this
      object, whatever it was, the goal of his afternoon walk, instead of Ladram
      Bay, conceiving it might perhaps be a great fish of some sort, stranded by
      some chance, and flapping about in its distress. And so he hurried down
      the long steep ladder, stopping at intervals of thirty feet or so to take
      breath and scan the mysterious movement.

At the foot of the cliff he was, of course, nearer his object than he had
      been; but, on the other hand, it now came up against the incandescent sky,
      beneath the sun, so as to seem dark and indistinct. Whatever was pinkish
      of it was now hidden by a skerry of weedy boulders. But he perceived that
      it was made up of seven rounded bodies distinct or connected, and that the
      birds kept up a constant croaking and screaming, but seemed afraid to
      approach it too closely.

Mr. Fison, torn by curiosity, began picking his way across the wave-worn
      rocks, and finding the wet seaweed that covered them thickly rendered them
      extremely slippery, he stopped, removed his shoes and socks, and rolled
      his trousers above his knees. His object was, of course, merely to avoid
      stumbling into the rocky pools about him, and perhaps he was rather glad,
      as all men are, of an excuse to resume, even for a moment, the sensations
      of his boyhood. At any rate, it is to this, no doubt, that he owes his
      life.

He approached his mark with all the assurance which the absolute security
      of this country against all forms of animal life gives its inhabitants.
      The round bodies moved to and fro, but it was only when he surmounted the
      skerry of boulders I have mentioned that he realised the horrible nature
      of the discovery. It came upon him with some suddenness.

The rounded bodies fell apart as he came into sight over the ridge, and
      displayed the pinkish object to be the partially devoured body of a human
      being, but whether of a man or woman he was unable to say. And the rounded
      bodies were new and ghastly-looking creatures, in shape somewhat
      resembling an octopus, with huge and very long and flexible tentacles,
      coiled copiously on the ground. The skin had a glistening texture,
      unpleasant to see, like shiny leather. The downward bend of the
      tentacle-surrounded mouth, the curious excrescence at the bend, the
      tentacles, and the large intelligent eyes, gave the creatures a grotesque
      suggestion of a face. They were the size of a fair-sized swine about the
      body, and the tentacles seemed to him to be many feet in length. There
      were, he thinks, seven or eight at least of the creatures. Twenty yards
      beyond them, amid the surf of the now returning tide, two others were
      emerging from the sea.

Their bodies lay flatly on the rocks, and their eyes regarded him with
      evil interest; but it does not appear that Mr. Fison was afraid, or that
      he realised that he was in any danger. Possibly his confidence is to be
      ascribed to the limpness of their attitudes. But he was horrified, of
      course, and intensely excited and indignant, at such revolting creatures
      preying upon human flesh. He thought they had chanced upon a drowned body.
      He shouted to them, with the idea of driving them off, and finding they
      did not budge, cast about him, picked up a big rounded lump of rock, and
      flung it at one.

And then, slowly uncoiling their tentacles, they all began moving towards
      him—creeping at first deliberately, and making a soft purring sound
      to each other.

In a moment Mr. Fison realised that he was in danger. He shouted again,
      threw both his boots, and started off, with a leap, forthwith. Twenty
      yards off he stopped and faced about, judging them slow, and behold! the
      tentacles of their leader were already pouring over the rocky ridge on
      which he had just been standing!

At that he shouted again, but this time not threatening, but a cry of
      dismay, and began jumping, striding, slipping, wading across the uneven
      expanse between him and the beach. The tall red cliffs seemed suddenly at
      a vast distance, and he saw, as though they were creatures in another
      world, two minute workmen engaged in the repair of the ladder-way, and
      little suspecting the race for life that was beginning below them. At one
      time he could hear the creatures splashing in the pools not a dozen feet
      behind him, and once he slipped and almost fell.

They chased him to the very foot of the cliffs, and desisted only when he
      had been joined by the workmen at the foot of the ladder-way up the cliff.
      All three of the men pelted them with stones for a time, and then hurried
      to the cliff top and along the path towards Sidmouth, to secure assistance
      and a boat, and to rescue the desecrated body from the clutches of these
      abominable creatures.

II. — And, as if he had not already been in sufficient peril that
      day, Mr. Fison went with the boat to point out the exact spot of his
      adventure.

As the tide was down, it required a considerable detour to reach the spot,
      and when at last they came off the ladder-way, the mangled body had
      disappeared. The water was now running in, submerging first one slab of
      slimy rock and then another, and the four men in the boat—the
      workmen, that is, the boatman, and Mr. Fison—now turned their
      attention from the bearings off shore to the water beneath the keel.

At first they could see little below them, save a dark jungle of
      laminaria, with an occasional darting fish. Their minds were set on
      adventure, and they expressed their disappointment freely. But presently
      they saw one of the monsters swimming through the water seaward, with a
      curious rolling motion that suggested to Mr. Fison the spinning roll of a
      captive balloon. Almost immediately after, the waving streamers of
      laminaria were extraordinarily perturbed, parted for a moment, and three
      of these beasts became darkly visible, struggling for what was probably
      some fragment of the drowned man. In a moment the copious olive-green
      ribbons had poured again over this writhing group.

At that all four men, greatly excited, began beating the water with oars
      and shouting, and immediately they saw a tumultuous movement among the
      weeds. They desisted to see more clearly, and as soon as the water was
      smooth, they saw, as it seemed to them, the whole sea bottom among the
      weeds set with eyes.

And forthwith the things began to rise through the water about them. Mr.
      Fison has since described to the writer this startling eruption out of the
      waving laminaria meadows. To him it seemed to occupy a considerable time,
      but it is probable that really it was an affair of a few seconds only. For
      a time nothing but eyes, and then he speaks of tentacles streaming out and
      parting the weed fronds this way and that. Then these things, growing
      larger, until at last the bottom was hidden by their intercoiling forms,
      and the tips of tentacles rose darkly here and there into the air above
      the swell of the waters.

One came up boldly to the side of the boat, and clinging to this with
      three of its sucker-set tentacles, threw four others over the gunwale, as
      if with an intention either of oversetting the boat or of clambering into
      it. Mr. Fison at once caught up the boat-hook, and, jabbing furiously at
      the soft tentacles, forced it to desist. He was struck in the back and
      almost pitched overboard by the boatman, who was using his oar to resist a
      similar attack on the other side of the boat. But the tentacles on either
      side at once relaxed their hold, slid out of sight, and splashed into the
      water.

"We''d better get out of this," said Mr. Fison, who was trembling
      violently. He went to the tiller, while the boatman and one of the workmen
      seated themselves and began rowing. The other workman stood up in the fore
      part of the boat, with the boat-hook, ready to strike any more tentacles
      that might appear. Nothing else seems to have been said. Mr. Fison had
      expressed the common feeling beyond amendment. In a hushed, scared mood,
      with faces white and drawn, they set about escaping from the position into
      which they had so recklessly blundered.

But the oars had scarcely dropped into the water before dark, tapering,
      serpentine ropes had bound them, and were about the rudder; and creeping
      up the sides of the boat with a looping motion came the suckers again. The
      men gripped their oars and pulled, but it was like trying to move a boat
      in a floating raft of weeds. "Help here!" cried the boatman, and Mr. Fison
      and the second workman rushed to help lug at the oar.

Then the man with the boat-hook—his name was Ewan, or Ewen—sprang
      up with a curse and began striking downward over the side, as far as he
      could reach, at the bank of tentacles that now clustered along the boat''s
      bottom. And, at the same time, the two rowers stood up to get a better
      purchase for the recovery of their oars. The boatman handed his to Mr.
      Fison, who lugged desperately, and, meanwhile, the boatman opened a big
      clasp-knife, and leaning over the side of the boat, began hacking at the
      spiring arms upon the oar shaft.

Mr. Fison, staggering with the quivering rocking of the boat, his teeth
      set, his breath coming short, and the veins starting on his hands as he
      pulled at his oar, suddenly cast his eyes seaward. And there, not fifty
      yards off, across the long rollers of the incoming tide, was a large boat
      standing in towards them, with three women and a little child in it. A
      boatman was rowing, and a little man in a pink-ribboned straw hat and
      whites stood in the stern hailing them. For a moment, of course, Mr. Fison
      thought of help, and then he thought of the child. He abandoned his oar
      forthwith, threw up his arms in a frantic gesture, and screamed to the
      party in the boat to keep away "for God''s sake!" It says much for the
      modesty and courage of Mr. Fison that he does not seem to be aware that
      there was any quality of heroism in his action at this juncture. The oar
      he had abandoned was at once drawn under, and presently reappeared
      floating about twenty yards away.

At the same moment Mr. Fison felt the boat under him lurch violently, and
      a hoarse scream, a prolonged cry of terror from Hill, the boatman, caused
      him to forget the party of excursionists altogether. He turned, and saw
      Hill crouching by the forward row-lock, his face convulsed with terror,
      and his right arm over the side and drawn tightly down. He gave now a
      succession of short, sharp cries, "Oh! oh! oh!—oh!" Mr. Fison
      believes that he must have been hacking at the tentacles below the
      water-line, and have been grasped by them, but, of course, it is quite
      impossible to say now certainly what had happened. The boat was heeling
      over, so that the gunwale was within ten inches of the water, and both
      Ewan and the other labourer were striking down into the water, with oar
      and boat-hook, on either side of Hill''s arm. Mr. Fison instinctively
      placed himself to counterpoise them.

Then Hill, who was a burly, powerful man, made a strenuous effort, and
      rose almost to a standing position. He lifted his arm, indeed, clean out
      of the water. Hanging to it was a complicated tangle of brown ropes, and
      the eyes of one of the brutes that had hold of him, glaring straight and
      resolute, showed momentarily above the surface. The boat heeled more and
      more, and the green-brown water came pouring in a cascade over the side.
      Then Hill slipped and fell with his ribs across the side, and his arm and
      the mass of tentacles about it splashed back into the water. He rolled
      over; his boot kicked Mr. Fison''s knee as that gentleman rushed forward to
      seize him, and in another moment fresh tentacles had whipped about his
      waist and neck, and after a brief, convulsive struggle, in which the boat
      was nearly capsized, Hill was lugged overboard. The boat righted with a
      violent jerk that all but sent Mr. Fison over the other side, and hid the
      struggle in the water from his eyes.

He stood staggering to recover his balance for a moment, and as he did so
      he became aware that the struggle and the inflowing tide had carried them
      close upon the weedy rocks again. Not four yards off a table of rock still
      rose in rhythmic movements above the in-wash of the tide. In a moment Mr.
      Fison seized the oar from Ewan, gave one vigorous stroke, then dropping
      it, ran to the bows and leapt. He felt his feet slide over the rock, and,
      by a frantic effort, leapt again towards a further mass. He stumbled over
      this, came to his knees, and rose again.

"Look out!" cried someone, and a large drab body struck him. He was
      knocked flat into a tidal pool by one of the workmen, and as he went down
      he heard smothered, choking cries, that he believed at the time came from
      Hill. Then he found himself marvelling at the shrillness and variety of
      Hill''s voice. Someone jumped over him, and a curving rush of foamy water
      poured over him, and passed. He scrambled to his feet dripping, and
      without looking seaward, ran as fast as his terror would let him
      shoreward. Before him, over the flat space of scattered rocks, stumbled
      the two work-men—one a dozen yards in front of the other.

He looked over his shoulder at last, and seeing that he was not pursued,
      faced about. He was astonished. From the moment of the rising of the
      cephalopods out of the water he had been acting too swiftly to fully
      comprehend his actions. Now it seemed to him as if he had suddenly jumped
      out of an evil dream.

For there were the sky, cloudless and blazing with the afternoon sun, the
      sea weltering under its pitiless brightness, the soft creamy foam of the
      breaking water, and the low, long, dark ridges of rock. The righted boat
      floated, rising and falling gently on the swell about a dozen yards from
      shore. Hill and the monsters, all the stress and tumult of that fierce
      fight for life, had vanished as though they had never been.

Mr. Fison''s heart was beating violently; he was throbbing to the
      finger-tips, and his breath came deep.

There was something missing. For some seconds he could not think clearly
      enough what this might be. Sun, sky, sea, rocks—what was it? Then he
      remembered the boat-load of excursionists. It had vanished. He wondered
      whether he had imagined it. He turned, and saw the two workmen standing
      side by side under the projecting masses of the tall pink cliffs. He
      hesitated whether he should make one last attempt to save the man Hill.
      His physical excitement seemed to desert him suddenly, and leave him
      aimless and helpless. He turned shoreward, stumbling and wading towards
      his two companions.

He looked back again, and there were now two boats floating, and the one
      farthest out at sea pitched clumsily, bottom upward.

III. — So it was Haploteuthis ferox made its appearance upon
      the Devonshire coast. So far, this has been its most serious aggression.
      Mr. Fison''s account, taken together with the wave of boating and bathing
      casualties to which I have already alluded, and the absence of fish from
      the Cornish coasts that year, points clearly to a shoal of these voracious
      deep-sea monsters prowling slowly along the sub-tidal coast-line. Hunger
      migration has, I know, been suggested as the force that drove them hither;
      but, for my own part, I prefer to believe the alternative theory of
      Hemsley. Hemsley holds that a pack or shoal of these creatures may have
      become enamoured of human flesh by the accident of a foundered ship
      sinking among them, and have wandered in search of it out of their
      accustomed zone; first waylaying and following ships, and so coming to our
      shores in the wake of the Atlantic traffic. But to discuss Hemsley''s
      cogent and admirably-stated arguments would be out of place here.

It would seem that the appetites of the shoal were satisfied by the catch
      of eleven people—for, so far as can be ascertained, there were ten
      people in the second boat, and certainly these creatures gave no further
      signs of their presence off Sidmouth that day. The coast between Seaton
      and Budleigh Salterton was patrolled all that evening and night by four
      Preventive Service boats, the men in which were armed with harpoons and
      cutlasses, and as the evening advanced, a number of more or less similarly
      equipped expeditions, organised by private individuals, joined them. Mr.
      Fison took no part in any of these expeditions.

About midnight excited hails were heard from a boat about a couple of
      miles out at sea to the south-east of Sidmouth, and a lantern was seen
      waving in a strange manner to and fro and up and down. The nearer boats at
      once hurried towards the alarm. The venturesome occupants of the boat—a
      seaman, a curate, and two schoolboys—had actually seen the monsters
      passing under their boat. The creatures, it seems, like most deep-sea
      organisms, were phosphorescent, and they had been floating, five fathoms
      deep or so, like creatures of moonshine through the blackness of the
      water, their tentacles retracted and as if asleep, rolling over and over,
      and moving slowly in a wedge-like formation towards the south-east.

These people told their story in gesticulated fragments, as first one boat
      drew alongside and then another. At last there was a little fleet of eight
      or nine boats collected together, and from them a tumult, like the chatter
      of a market-place, rose into the stillness of the night. There was little
      or no disposition to pursue the shoal, the people had neither weapons nor
      experience for such a dubious chase, and presently—even with a
      certain relief, it may be—the boats turned shoreward.

And now to tell what is perhaps the most astonishing fact in this whole
      astonishing raid. We have not the slightest knowledge of the subsequent
      movements of the shoal, although the whole south-west coast was now alert
      for it. But it may, perhaps, be significant that a cachalot was stranded
      off Sark on June 3. Two weeks and three days after this Sidmouth affair, a
      living Haploteuthis came ashore on Calais sands. It was alive,
      because several witnesses saw its tentacles moving in a convulsive way.
      But it is probable that it was dying. A gentleman named Pouchet obtained a
      rifle and shot it.

That was the last appearance of a living Haploteuthis. No others
      were seen on the French coast. On the 15th of June a dead carcass, almost
      complete, was washed ashore near Torquay, and a few days later a boat from
      the Marine Biological station, engaged in dredging off Plymouth, picked up
      a rotting specimen, slashed deeply with a cutlass wound. How the former
      had come by its death it is impossible to say. And on the last day of
      June, Mr. Egbert Caine, an artist, bathing near Newlyn, threw up his arms,
      shrieked, and was drawn under. A friend bathing with him made no attempt
      to save him, but swam at once for the shore. This is the last fact to tell
      of this extraordinary raid from the deeper sea. Whether it is really the
      last of these horrible creatures it is, as yet, premature to say. But it
      is believed, and certainly it is to be hoped, that they have returned now,
      and returned for good, to the sunless depths of the middle seas, out of
      which they have so strangely and so mysteriously arisen.

I was—you shall hear immediately why I am not now—Egbert
      Craddock Cummins. The name remains. I am still (Heaven help me!) Dramatic
      Critic to the Fiery Cross. What I shall be in a little while I do
      not know. I write in great trouble and confusion of mind. I will do what I
      can to make myself clear in the face of terrible difficulties. You must
      bear with me a little. When a man is rapidly losing his own identity, he
      naturally finds a difficulty in expressing himself. I will make it
      perfectly plain in a minute, when once I get my grip upon the story. Let
      me see—where am I? I wish I knew. Ah, I have it! Dead self!
      Egbert Craddock Cummins!

In the past I should have disliked writing anything quite so full of "I"
      as this story must be. It is full of "I''s" before and behind, like the
      beast in Revelation—the one with a head like a calf, I am afraid.
      But my tastes have changed since I became a Dramatic Critic and studied
      the masters—G.A.S., G.B.S., G.R.S., and the others. Everything has
      changed since then. At least the story is about myself—so that there
      is some excuse for me. And it is really not egotism, because, as I say,
      since those days my identity has undergone an entire alteration.

That past!... I was—in those days—rather a nice fellow, rather
      shy— taste for grey in my clothes, weedy little moustache, face
      "interesting," slight stutter which I had caught in my early life from a
      schoolfellow. Engaged to a very nice girl, named Delia. Fairly new, she
      was— cigarettes—liked me because I was human and original.
      Considered I was like Lamb—on the strength of the stutter, I
      believe. Father, an eminent authority on postage stamps. She read a great
      deal in the British Museum. (A perfect pairing ground for literary people,
      that British Museum—you should read George Egerton and Justin Huntly
      M''Carthy and Gissing and the rest of them.) We loved in our intellectual
      way, and shared the brightest hopes. (All gone now.) And her father liked
      me because I seemed honestly eager to hear about stamps. She had no
      mother. Indeed, I had the happiest prospects a young man could have. I
      never went to theatres in those days. My Aunt Charlotte before she died
      had told me not to.

Then Barnaby, the editor of the Fiery Cross, made me—in spite
      of my spasmodic efforts to escape—Dramatic Critic. He is a fine,
      healthy man, Barnaby, with an enormous head of frizzy black hair and a
      convincing manner, and he caught me on the staircase going to see Wembly.
      He had been dining, and was more than usually buoyant. "Hullo, Cummins!"
      he said. "The very man I want!" He caught me by the shoulder or the collar
      or something, ran me up the little passage, and flung me over the
      waste-paper basket into the arm-chair in his office. "Pray be seated," he
      said, as he did so. Then he ran across the room and came back with some
      pink and yellow tickets and pushed them into my hand. "Opera Comique," he
      said, "Thursday; Friday, the Surrey; Saturday, the Frivolity. That''s all,
      I think."

"Eigh?" he said, at the top of his voice, as though he thought I
      had gone and was startled at my remark.

"That''s just it. New view. No habits. No clichis in stock. Ours is
      a live paper, not a bag of tricks. None of your clockwork professional
      journalism in this office. And I can rely on your integrity——"

He caught me up suddenly and put me outside his door. "Go and talk to
      Wembly about that," he said. "He''ll explain."

As I stood perplexed, he opened the door again, said, "I forgot this,"
      thrust a fourth ticket into my hand (it was for that night—in twenty
      minutes'' time) and slammed the door upon me. His expression was quite
      calm, but I caught his eye.

I hate arguments. I decided that I would take his hint and become (to my
      own destruction) a Dramatic Critic. I walked slowly down the passage to
      Wembly. That Barnaby has a remarkable persuasive way. He has made few
      suggestions during our very pleasant intercourse of four years that he has
      not ultimately won me round to adopting. It may be, of course, that I am
      of a yielding disposition; certainly I am too apt to take my colour from
      my circumstances. It is, indeed, to my unfortunate susceptibility to vivid
      impressions that all my misfortunes are due. I have already alluded to the
      slight stammer I had acquired from a schoolfellow in my youth. However,
      this is a digression... I went home in a cab to dress.

I will not trouble the reader with my thoughts about the first-night
      audience, strange assembly as it is,—those I reserve for my Memoirs,—nor
      the humiliating story of how I got lost during the entr''acte in a
      lot of red plush passages, and saw the third act from the gallery. The
      only point upon which I wish to lay stress was the remarkable effect of
      the acting upon me. You must remember I had lived a quiet and retired
      life, and had never been to the theatre before, and that I am extremely
      sensitive to vivid impressions. At the risk of repetition I must insist
      upon these points.

The first effect was a profound amazement, not untinctured by alarm. The
      phenomenal unnaturalness of acting is a thing discounted in the minds of
      most people by early visits to the theatre. They get used to the fantastic
      gestures, the flamboyant emotions, the weird mouthings, melodious
      snortings, agonising yelps, lip-gnawings, glaring horrors, and other
      emotional symbolism of the stage. It becomes at last a mere deaf-and-dumb
      language to them, which they read intelligently pari passu with the
      hearing of the dialogue. But all this was new to me. The thing was called
      a modern comedy, the people were supposed to be English and were dressed
      like fashionable Americans of the current epoch, and I fell into the
      natural error of supposing that the actors were trying to represent human
      beings. I looked round on my first-night audience with a kind of wonder,
      discovered—as all new Dramatic Critics do—that it rested with
      me to reform the Drama, and, after a supper choked with emotion, went off
      to the office to write a column, piebald with "new paragraphs" (as all my
      stuff is—it fills out so) and purple with indignation. Barnaby was
      delighted.

But I could not sleep that night. I dreamt of actors—actors glaring,
      actors smiting their chests, actors flinging out a handful of extended
      fingers, actors smiling bitterly, laughing despairingly, falling
      hopelessly, dying idiotically. I got up at eleven with a slight headache,
      read my notice in the Fiery Cross, breakfasted, and went back to my
      room to shave, (It''s my habit to do so.) Then an odd thing happened. I
      could not find my razor. Suddenly it occurred to me that I had not
      unpacked it the day before.

Quite involuntarily, when I had thought of my portmanteau, I had flung up
      the left arm (fingers fully extended) and clutched at my diaphragm with my
      right hand. I am an acutely self-conscious man at all times. The gesture
      struck me as absolutely novel for me. I repeated it, for my own
      satisfaction. "Odd!" Then (rather puzzled) I turned to my portmanteau.

After shaving, my mind reverted to the acting I had seen, and I
      entertained myself before the cheval glass with some imitations of
      Jafferay''s more exaggerated gestures. "Really, one might think it a
      disease," I said—"Stage-Walkitis!" (There''s many a truth spoken in
      jest.) Then, if I remember rightly, I went off to see Wembly, and
      afterwards lunched at the British Museum with Delia. We actually spoke
      about our prospects, in the light of my new appointment.

But that appointment was the beginning of my downfall. From that day I
      necessarily became a persistent theatre-goer, and almost insensibly I
      began to change. The next thing I noticed after the gesture about the
      razor was to catch myself bowing ineffably when I met Delia, and stooping
      in an old-fashioned, courtly way over her hand. Directly I caught myself,
      I straightened myself up and became very uncomfortable. I remember she
      looked at me curiously. Then, in the office, I found myself doing "nervous
      business," fingers on teeth, when Barnaby asked me a question I could not
      very well answer. Then, in some trifling difference with Delia, I clasped
      my hand to my brow. And I pranced through my social transactions at times
      singularly like an actor! I tried not to—no one could be more keenly
      alive to the arrant absurdity of the histrionic bearing. And I did!

It began to dawn on me what it all meant. The acting, I saw, was too much
      for my delicately-strung nervous system. I have always, I know, been too
      amenable to the suggestions of my circumstances. Night after night of
      concentrated attention to the conventional attitudes and intonation of the
      English stage was gradually affecting my speech and carriage. I was giving
      way to the infection of sympathetic imitation. Night after night my
      plastic nervous system took the print of some new amazing gesture, some
      new emotional exaggeration—and retained it. A kind of theatrical
      veneer threatened to plate over and obliterate my private individuality
      altogether. I saw myself in a kind of vision. Sitting by myself one night,
      my new self seemed to me to glide, posing and gesticulating, across the
      room. He clutched his throat, he opened his fingers, he opened his legs in
      walking like a high-class marionette. He went from attitude to attitude.
      He might have been clockwork. Directly after this I made an ineffectual
      attempt to resign my theatrical work. But Barnaby persisted in talking
      about the Polywhiddle Divorce all the time I was with him, and I could get
      no opportunity of saying what I wished.

And then Delia''s manner began to change towards me. The ease of our
      intercourse vanished. I felt she was learning to dislike me. I grinned,
      and capered, and scowled, and posed at her in a thousand ways, and knew—with
      what a voiceless agony!—that I did it all the time. I tried to
      resign again, and Barnaby talked about "X" and "Z" and "Y" in the New
      Review, and gave me a strong cigar to smoke, and so routed me. And
      then I walked up the Assyrian Gallery in the manner of Irving to meet
      Delia, and so precipitated the crisis.

"Ah!—Dear!" I said, with more sprightliness and emotion in my
      voice than had ever been in all my life before I became (to my own
      undoing) a Dramatic Critic.

She held out her hand rather coldly, scrutinising my face as she did so. I
      prepared, with a new-won grace, to walk by her side. "Egbert," she said,
      standing still, and thought. Then she looked at me.

I said nothing. I felt what was coming. I tried to be the old Egbert
      Craddock Cummins of shambling gait and stammering sincerity, whom she
      loved, but I felt even as I did so that I was a new thing, a thing of
      surging emotions and mysterious fixity—like no human being that ever
      lived, except upon the stage. "Egbert," she said, "you are not yourself."

"What do you mean?" I said, whispering in vocal italics—you
      know how they do it—turning on her, perplexity on face, right hand
      down, left on brow. I knew quite well what she meant. I knew quite well
      the dramatic unreality of my behaviour. But I struggled against it in
      vain. "What do you mean?" I said, and, in a kind of hoarse whisper, "I
      don''t understand!"

She really looked as though she disliked me. "What do you keep on posing
      for?" she said. "I don''t like it. You didn''t use to."

"Didn''t use to!" I said slowly, repeating this twice. I glared up and down
      the gallery with short, sharp glances. "We are alone," I said swiftly. "Listen!"
      I poked my forefinger towards her, and glared at her. "I am under a
      curse."

I saw her hand tighten upon her sunshade. "You are under some bad
      influence or other," said Delia. "You should give it up. I never knew
      anyone change as you have done."

She eyed me critically. "Why you keep playing the fool like this I
      don''t know," she said. "Anyhow, I really cannot go about with a man who
      behaves as you do. You made us both ridiculous on Wednesday. Frankly, I
      dislike you, as you are now. I met you here to tell you so—as it''s
      about the only place where we can be sure of being alone together——"

By a violent effort I controlled myself and touched her hand. I tried to
      say some word of explanation to her. She looked into my working face and
      winced. "I must do it," she said hopelessly. Then she turned from
      me and began walking rapidly down the gallery.

Heavens! How the human agony cried within me! I loved Delia. But nothing
      found expression—I was already too deeply crusted with my acquired
      self.

"Good-baye!" I said at last, watching her retreating figure. How I hated
      myself for doing it! After she had vanished, I repeated in a dreamy way,
      "Good-baye!" looking hopelessly round me. Then, with a kind of
      heart-broken cry, I shook my clenched fists in the air, staggered to the
      pedestal of a winged figure, buried my face in my arms, and made my
      shoulders heave. Something within me said "Ass!" as I did so. (I had the
      greatest difficulty in persuading the Museum policeman, who was attracted
      by my cry of agony, that I was not intoxicated, but merely suffering from
      a transient indisposition.)

But even this great sorrow has not availed to save me from my fate. I see
      it; everyone sees it: I grow more "theatrical" every day. And no one could
      be more painfully aware of the pungent silliness of theatrical ways. The
      quiet, nervous, but pleasing E.C. Cummins vanishes. I cannot save him. I
      am driven like a dead leaf before the winds of March. My tailor even
      enters into the spirit of my disorder. He has a peculiar sense of what is
      fitting. I tried to get a dull grey suit from him this spring, and he
      foisted a brilliant blue upon me, and I see he has put braid down the
      sides of my new dress trousers. My hairdresser insists upon giving me a
      "wave."

I am beginning to associate with actors. I detest them, but it is only in
      their company that I can feel I am not glaringly conspicuous. Their talk
      infects me. I notice a growing tendency to dramatic brevity, to dashes and
      pauses in my style, to a punctuation of bows and attitudes. Barnaby has
      remarked it too. I offended Wembly by calling him "Dear Boy" yesterday. I
      dread the end, but I cannot escape from it.

The fact is, I am being obliterated. Living a grey, retired life all my
      youth, I came to the theatre a delicate sketch of a man, a thing of tints
      and faint lines. Their gorgeous colouring has effaced me altogether.
      People forget how much mode of expression, method of movement, are a
      matter of contagion. I have heard of stage-struck people before, and
      thought it a figure of speech. I spoke of it jestingly, as a disease. It
      is no jest. It is a disease. And I have got it badly! Deep down within me
      I protest against the wrong done to my personality—unavailingly. For
      three hours or more a week I have to go and concentrate my attention on
      some fresh play, and the suggestions of the drama strengthen their awful
      hold upon me. My manners grow so flamboyant, my passions so professional,
      that I doubt, as I said at the outset, whether it is really myself that
      behaves in such a manner. I feel merely the core to this dramatic casing,
      that grows thicker and presses upon me—me and mine. I feel like King
      John''s abbot in his cope of lead.

I doubt, indeed, whether I should not abandon the struggle altogether—
      leave this sad world of ordinary life for which I am so ill fitted,
      abandon the name of Cummins for some professional pseudonym, complete my
      self-effacement, and—a thing of tricks and tatters, of posing and
      pretence—go upon the stage. It seems my only resort—"to hold
      the mirror up to Nature." For in the ordinary life, I will confess, no one
      now seems to regard me as both sane and sober. Only upon the stage, I feel
      convinced, will people take me seriously. That will be the end of it. I know
      that will be the end of it. And yet ... I will frankly confess ... all
      that marks off your actor from your common man ... I detest. I am
      still largely of my Aunt Charlotte''s opinion, that play-acting is unworthy
      of a pure-minded man''s attention, much more participation. Even now I
      would resign my dramatic criticism and try a rest. Only I can''t get hold
      of Barnaby. Letters of resignation he never notices. He says it is against
      the etiquette of journalism to write to your Editor. And when I go to see
      him, he gives me another big cigar and some strong whisky and soda, and
      then something always turns up to prevent my explanation.

Whether the story of Gottfried Plattner is to be credited or not is a
      pretty question in the value of evidence. On the one hand, we have seven
      witnesses—to be perfectly exact, we have six and a half pairs of
      eyes, and one undeniable fact; and on the other we have—what is it?—prejudice,
      common-sense, the inertia of opinion. Never were there seven more
      honest-seeming witnesses; never was there a more undeniable fact than the
      inversion of Gottfried Plattner''s anatomical structure, and—never
      was there a more preposterous story than the one they have to tell! The
      most preposterous part of the story is the worthy Gottfried''s contribution
      (for I count him as one of the seven). Heaven forbid that I should be led
      into giving countenance to superstition by a passion for impartiality, and
      so come to share the fate of Eusapia''s patrons! Frankly, I believe there
      is something crooked about this business of Gottfried Plattner; but what
      that crooked factor is, I will admit as frankly, I do not know. I have
      been surprised at the credit accorded to the story in the most unexpected
      and authoritative quarters. The fairest way to the reader, however, will
      be for me to tell it without further comment.

Gottfried Plattner is, in spite of his name, a freeborn Englishman. His
      father was an Alsatian who came to England in the ''sixties, married a
      respectable English girl of unexceptionable antecedents, and died, after a
      wholesome and uneventful life (devoted, I understand, chiefly to the
      laying of parquet flooring), in 1887. Gottfried''s age is seven-and-twenty.
      He is, by virtue of his heritage of three languages, Modern Languages
      Master in a small private school in the south of England. To the casual
      observer he is singularly like any other Modern Languages Master in any
      other small private school. His costume is neither very costly nor very
      fashionable, but, on the other hand, it is not markedly cheap or shabby;
      his complexion, like his height and his bearing, is inconspicuous. You
      would notice, perhaps, that, li' WHERE id = 'ee364418-59f6-4a5c-b61e-e19060e1944f';
