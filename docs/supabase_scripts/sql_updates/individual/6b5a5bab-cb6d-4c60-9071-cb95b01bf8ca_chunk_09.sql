      ought not to measure more than three hundred litres. So I said: ''That''s
      too dear.''

“You understand, one is not a dealer in hogs for nothing. One
      understands one''s business. But, if he is smart, the seller of bacon, I am
      smarter, seeing that I sell them also. Ha, Ha, Ha! So I said to him: ''If
      she were new, I would not say anything, but she has been married to you
      for some time, so she is not as fresh as she was. I will give you fifteen
      hundred francs a cubic metre, not a sou more. Will that suit you?''

“Then he explained his idea, not without difficulty for he was full.
      He said to me: ''I take a barrel, and fill it with water to the brim. I put
      her in it. All the water that comes out we will measure, that is the way
      to fix it.''

“I said: ''I see, I understand. But this water that overflows will
      run away; how are you going to gather it up?''

“Then he began stuffing me and explained to me that all we should
      have to do would be to refill the barrel with the water his wife had
      displaced as soon as she should have left. All the water we should pour in
      would be the measure. I supposed about ten pails; that would be a cubic
      metre. He isn''t a fool, all the same, when he is drunk, that old horse.

“To be brief, we reached his house and I took a look at its
      mistress. A beautiful woman she certainly was not. Anyone can see her, for
      there she is. I said to myself: ''I am disappointed, but never mind, she
      will be of value; handsome or ugly, it is all the same, is it not,
      monsieur le president?'' And then I saw that she was as thin as a rail. I
      said to myself: ''She will not measure four hundred litres.'' I understand
      the matter, it being in liquids.

“She told you about the proceeding. I even let her keep on her
      chemise and stockings, to my own disadvantage.

“He replied: ''Do not be afraid. I will catch her all right. She will
      have to come back to sleep, I will measure the deficit.''

The witness began to laugh so persistently that a gendarme was obliged to
      punch him in the back. Having quieted down, he resumed:

“In short, Brument exclaimed: ''Nothing doing, that is not enough.'' I
      bawled and bawled, and bawled again, he punched me, I hit back. That would
      have kept on till the Day of judgment, seeing we were both drunk.

Brument confirmed in every particular the statements of his accomplice.
      The jury, in consternation, retired to deliberate.

At the end of an hour they returned a verdict of acquittal for the
      defendants, with some severe strictures on the dignity of marriage, and
      establishing the precise limitations of business transactions.

I am coming to see you without anyone knowing it. I shall be at Les
      Fresnes on the 2d of September, the day before the hunting season opens,
      as I do not want to miss it, so that I may tease these gentlemen. You are
      too good, aunt, and you will allow them, as you usually do when there are
      no strange guests, to come to table, under pretext of fatigue, without
      dressing or shaving for the occasion.

They are delighted, of course, when I am not present. But I shall be there
      and will hold a review, like a general, at dinner time; and, if I find a
      single one of them at all careless in dress, no matter how little, I mean
      to send them down to the kitchen with the servants.

The men of to-day have so little consideration for others and so little
      good manners that one must be always severe with them. We live indeed in
      an age of vulgarity. When they quarrel, they insult each other in terms
      worthy of longshoremen, and, in our presence, they do not conduct
      themselves even as well as our servants. It is at the seaside that you see
      this most clearly. They are to be found there in battalions, and you can
      judge them in the lump. Oh! what coarse beings they are!

Just imagine, in a train, a gentleman who looked well, as I thought at
      first sight, thanks to his tailor, carefully took off his boots in order
      to put on a pair of old shoes! Another, an old man who was probably some
      wealthy upstart (these are the most ill-bred), while sitting opposite to
      me, had the delicacy to place his two feet on the seat quite close to me.
      This is a positive fact.

At the watering-places the vulgarity is unrestrained. I must here make one
      admission—that my indignation is perhaps due to the fact that I am
      not accustomed to associate, as a rule, with the sort of people one comes
      across here, for I should be less shocked by their manners if I had the
      opportunity of observing them oftener. In the office of the hotel I was
      nearly thrown down by a young man who snatched the key over my head.
      Another knocked against me so violently without begging my pardon or
      lifting his hat, coming away from a ball at the Casino, that it gave me a
      pain in the chest. It is the same way with all of them. Watch them
      addressing ladies on the terrace; they scarcely ever bow. They merely
      raise their hands to their headgear. But, indeed, as they are all more or
      less bald, it is the best plan.

But what exasperates and disgusts me particularly is the liberty they take
      of talking in public, without any kind of precaution, about the most
      revolting adventures. When two men are together, they relate to each
      other, in the broadest language and with the most abominable comments
      really horrible stories, without caring in the slightest degree whether a
      woman''s ear is within reach of their voices. Yesterday, on the beach, I
      was forced to leave the place where I was sitting in order not to be any
      longer the involuntary confidante of an obscene anecdote, told in such
      immodest language that I felt just as humiliated as indignant at having
      heard it. Would not the most elementary good-breeding teach them to speak
      in a lower tone about such matters when we are near at hand. Etretat is,
      moreover, the country of gossip and scandal. From five to seven o''clock
      you can see people wandering about in quest of scandal, which they retail
      from group to group. As you remarked to me, my dear aunt, tittle-tattle is
      the mark of petty individuals and petty minds. It is also the consolation
      of women who are no longer loved or sought after. It is enough for me to
      observe the women who are fondest of gossiping to be persuaded that you
      are quite right.

The other day I was present at a musical evening at the Casino, given by a
      remarkable artist, Madame Masson, who sings in a truly delightful manner.
      I took the opportunity of applauding the admirable Coquelin, as well as
      two charming vaudeville performers, M——and Meillet. I met, on
      this occasion, all the bathers who were at the beach. It is no great
      distinction this year.

Next day I went to lunch at Yport. I noticed a tall man with a beard,
      coming out of a large house like a castle. It was the painter, Jean Paul
      Laurens. He is not satisfied apparently with imprisoning the subjects of
      his pictures, he insists on imprisoning himself.

Then I found myself seated on the shingle close to a man still young, of
      gentle and refined appearance, who was reading poetry. But he read it with
      such concentration, with such passion, I may say, that he did not even
      raise his eyes towards me. I was somewhat astonished and asked the
      proprietor of the baths, without appearing to be much concerned, the name
      of this gentleman. I laughed to myself a little at this reader of rhymes;
      he seemed behind the age, for a man. This person, I thought, must be a
      simpleton. Well, aunt, I am now infatuated about this stranger. Just
      fancy, his name is Sully Prudhomme! I went back and sat down beside him
      again so as to get a good look at him. His face has an expression of
      calmness and of penetration. Somebody came to look for him, and I heard
      his voice, which is sweet and almost timid. He would certainly not tell
      obscene stories aloud in public or knock up against ladies without
      apologizing. He is assuredly a man of refinement, but his refinement is of
      an almost morbid, sensitive character, I will try this winter to get an
      introduction to him.

P. S.—I should add, however, by way of justification of French
      politeness, that our fellow-countrymen are, when travelling, models of
      good manners in comparison with the abominable English, who seem to have
      been brought up in a stable, so careful are they not to discommode
      themselves in any way, while they always discommode their neighbors.

Many of the things you have said to me are very sensible, but that does
      not prevent you from being wrong. Like you, I used formerly to feel very
      indignant at the impoliteness of men, who, as I supposed, constantly
      treated me with neglect; but, as I grew older and reflected on everything,
      putting aside coquetry, and observing things without taking any part in
      them myself, I perceived this much—that if men are not always
      polite, women are always indescribably rude.

We imagine that we should be permitted to do anything, my darling, and at
      the same time we consider that we have a right to the utmost respect, and
      in the most flagrant manner we commit actions devoid of that elementary
      good-breeding of which you speak so feelingly.

I find, on the contrary, that men consider us much more than we consider
      them. Besides, darling, men must needs be, and are, what we make them. In
      a state of society, where women are all true gentlewomen, all men would
      become gentlemen.

Look at two women meeting in the street. What an attitude each assumes
      towards the other! What disparaging looks! What contempt they throw into
      each glance! How they toss their heads while they inspect each other to
      find something to condemn! And, if the footpath is narrow, do you think
      one woman would make room for another, or would beg pardon as she sweeps
      by? Never! When two men jostle each other by accident in some narrow lane,
      each of them bows and at the same time gets out of the other''s way, while
      we women press against each other stomach to stomach, face to face,
      insolently staring each other out of countenance.

Look at two women who are acquaintances meeting on a staircase outside the
      door of a friend''s drawing-room, one of them just leaving, the other about
      to go in. They begin to talk to each other and block up all the landing.
      If anyone happens to be coming up behind them, man or woman, do you
      imagine that they will put themselves half an inch out of their way?
      Never! never!

I was waiting myself, with my watch in my hands, one day last winter at a
      certain drawing-room door. And, behind me, two gentlemen were also waiting
      without showing any readiness, as I did, to lose their temper. The reason
      was that they had long grown accustomed to our unconscionable insolence.

The other day, before leaving Paris, I went to dine with no less a person
      than your husband, in the Champs Elysees, in order to enjoy the fresh air.
      Every table was occupied. The waiter asked us to wait and there would soon
      be a vacant table.

At that moment I noticed an elderly lady of noble figure, who, having paid
      for her dinner, seemed on the point of going away. She saw me, scanned me
      from head to foot, and did not budge. For more than a quarter of an hour
      she sat there, immovable, putting on her gloves, and calmly staring at
      those who were waiting like myself. Now, two young men who were just
      finishing their dinner, having seen me in their turn, hastily summoned the
      waiter, paid what they owed, and at once offered me their seats, even
      insisting on standing while waiting for their change. And, bear in mind,
      my fair niece, that I am no longer pretty, like you, but old and
      white-haired.

It is we, you see, who should be taught politeness, and the task would be
      such a difficult one that Hercules himself would not be equal to it. You
      speak to me about Etretat and about the people who indulged in “tittle-tattle”
      along the beach of that delightful watering-place. It is a spot now lost
      to me, a thing of the past, but I found much amusement therein days gone
      by.

There were only a few of us, people in good society, really good society,
      and a few artists, and we all fraternized. We paid little attention to
      gossip in those days.

As we had no monotonous Casino, where people only gather for show, where
      they whisper, where they dance stupidly, where they succeed in thoroughly
      boring one another, we sought some other way of passing our evenings
      pleasantly. Now, just guess what came into the head of one of our
      husbands? Nothing less than to go and dance each night in one of the
      farm-houses in the neighborhood.

We started out in a group with a street-organ, generally played by Le
      Poittevin, the painter, with a cotton nightcap on his head. Two men
      carried lanterns. We followed in procession, laughing and chattering like
      a pack of fools.

We woke up the farmer and his servant-maids and farm hands. We got them to
      make onion soup (horror!), and we danced under the apple trees, to the
      sound of the barrel-organ. The cocks waking up began to crow in the
      darkness of the out-houses; the horses began prancing on the straw of
      their stables. The cool air of the country caressed our cheeks with the
      smell of grass and of new-mown hay.

For a long time Jacques Bourdillere had sworn that he would never marry,
      but he suddenly changed his mind. It happened suddenly, one summer, at the
      seashore.

One morning as he lay stretched out on the sand, watching the women coming
      out of the water, a little foot had struck him by its neatness and
      daintiness. He raised his eyes and was delighted with the whole person,
      although in fact he could see nothing but the ankles and the head emerging
      from a flannel bathrobe carefully held closed. He was supposed to be
      sensual and a fast liver. It was therefore by the mere grace of the form
      that he was at first captured. Then he was held by the charm of the young
      girl''s sweet mind, so simple and good, as fresh as her cheeks and lips.

He was presented to the family and pleased them. He immediately fell madly
      in love. When he saw Berthe Lannis in the distance, on the long yellow
      stretch of sand, he would tingle to the roots of his hair. When he was
      near her he would become silent, unable to speak or even to think, with a
      kind of throbbing at his heart, and a buzzing in his ears, and a
      bewilderment in his mind. Was that love?

Her parents hesitated for a long time, restrained by the young man''s bad
      reputation. It was said that he had an old sweetheart, one of these
      binding attachments which one always believes to be broken off and yet
      which always hold.

Besides, for a shorter or longer period, he loved every woman who came
      within reach of his lips.

Then he settled down and refused, even once, to see the one with whom he
      had lived for so long. A friend took care of this woman''s pension and
      assured her an income. Jacques paid, but he did not even wish to hear of
      her, pretending even to ignore her name. She wrote him letters which he
      never opened. Every week he would recognize the clumsy writing of the
      abandoned woman, and every week a greater anger surged within him against
      her, and he would quickly tear the envelope and the paper, without opening
      it, without reading one single line, knowing in advance the reproaches and
      complaints which it contained.

As no one had much faith in his constancy, the test was prolonged through
      the winter, and Berthe''s hand was not granted him until the spring. The
      wedding took place in Paris at the beginning of May.

The young couple had decided not to take the conventional wedding trip,
      but after a little dance for the younger cousins, which would not be
      prolonged after eleven o''clock, in order that this day of lengthy
      ceremonies might not be too tiresome, the young pair were to spend the
      first night in the parental home and then, on the following morning, to
      leave for the beach so dear to their hearts, where they had first known
      and loved each other.

Night had come, and the dance was going on in the large parlor. ''The two
      had retired into a little Japanese boudoir hung with bright silks and
      dimly lighted by the soft rays of a large colored lantern hanging from the
      ceiling like a gigantic egg. Through the open window the fresh air from
      outside passed over their faces like a caress, for the night was warm and
      calm, full of the odor of spring.

They were silent, holding each other''s hands and from time to time
      squeezing them with all their might. She sat there with a dreamy look,
      feeling a little lost at this great change in her life, but smiling,
      moved, ready to cry, often also almost ready to faint from joy, believing
      the whole world to be changed by what had just happened to her, uneasy,
      she knew not why, and feeling her whole body and soul filled with an
      indefinable and delicious lassitude.

He was looking at her persistently with a fixed smile. He wished to speak,
      but found nothing to say, and so sat there, expressing all his ardor by
      pressures of the hand. From time to time he would murmur: “Berthe!”
      And each time she would raise her eyes to him with a look of tenderness;
      they would look at each other for a second and then her look, pierced and
      fascinated by his, would fall.

They found no thoughts to exchange. They had been left alone, but
      occasionally some of the dancers would cast a rapid glance at them, as
      though they were the discreet and trusty witnesses of a mystery.

A door opened and a servant entered, holding on a tray a letter which a
      messenger had just brought. Jacques, trembling, took this paper,
      overwhelmed by a vague and sudden fear, the mysterious terror of swift
      misfortune.

He looked for a longtime at the envelope, the writing on which he did not
      know, not daring to open it, not wishing to read it, with a wild desire to
      put it in his pocket and say to himself: “I''ll leave that till
      to-morrow, when I''m far away!” But on one corner two big words,
      underlined, “Very urgent,” filled him with terror. Saying,
      “Please excuse me, my dear,” he tore open the envelope. He
      read the paper, grew frightfully pale, looked over it again, and, slowly,
      he seemed to spell it out word for word.

When he raised his head his whole expression showed how upset he was. He
      stammered: “My dear, it''s—it''s from my best friend, who has
      had a very great misfortune. He has need of me immediately—for a
      matter of life or death. Will you excuse me if I leave you for half an
      hour? I''ll be right back.”

Trembling and dazed, she stammered: “Go, my dear!” not having
      been his wife long enough to dare to question him, to demand to know. He
      disappeared. She remained alone, listening to the dancing in the
      neighboring parlor.

He had seized the first hat and coat he came to and rushed downstairs
      three steps at a time. As he was emerging into the street he stopped under
      the gas-jet of the vestibule and reread the letter. This is what it said:

When he reached the sick-room the woman was already on the point of death.
      He did not recognize her at first. The doctor and two nurses were taking
      care of her. And everywhere on the floor were pails full of ice and rags
      covered with blood. Water flooded the carpet; two candles were burning on
      a bureau; behind the bed, in a little wicker crib, the child was crying,
      and each time it would moan the mother, in torture, would try to move,
      shivering under her ice bandages.

She was mortally wounded, killed by this birth. Her life was flowing from
      her, and, notwithstanding the ice and the care, the merciless hemorrhage
      continued, hastening her last hour.

She recognized Jacques and wished to raise her arms. They were so weak
      that she could not do so, but tears coursed down her pallid cheeks. He
      dropped to his knees beside the bed, seized one of her hands and kissed it
      frantically. Then, little by little, he drew close to the thin face, which
      started at the contact. One of the nurses was lighting them with a candle,
      and the doctor was watching them from the back of the room.

Then she said in a voice which sounded as though it came from a distance:
      “I am going to die, dear. Promise to stay to the end. Oh! don''t
      leave me now. Don''t leave me in my last moments!”

It was several minutes before she could speak again, she was so weak. She
      continued: “The little one is yours. I swear it before God and on my
      soul. I swear it as I am dying! I have never loved another man but you
      —promise to take care of the child.”

He was trying to take this poor pain-racked body in his arms. Maddened by
      remorse and sorrow, he stammered: “I swear to you that I will bring
      him up and love him. He shall never leave me.”

Then she tried to kiss Jacques. Powerless to lift her head, she held out
      her white lips in an appeal for a kiss. He approached his lips to respond
      to this piteous entreaty.

As soon as she felt a little calmer, she murmured: “Bring him here
      and let me see if you love him.”

He went and got the child. He placed him gently on the bed between them,
      and the little one stopped crying. She murmured: “Don''t move any
      more!” And he was quiet. And he stayed there, holding in his burning
      hand this other hand shaking in the chill of death, just as, a while ago,
      he had been holding a hand trembling with love. From time to time he would
      cast a quick glance at the clock, which marked midnight, then one o''clock,
      then two.

The physician had returned. The two nurses, after noiselessly moving about
      the room for a while, were now sleeping on chairs. The child was asleep,
      and the mother, with eyes shut, appeared also to be resting.

Suddenly, just as pale daylight was creeping in behind the curtains, she
      stretched out her arms with such a quick and violent motion that she
      almost threw her baby on the floor. A kind of rattle was heard in her
      throat, then she lay on her back motionless, dead.

He looked once more at this woman whom he had so loved, then at the clock,
      which pointed to four, and he ran away, forgetting his overcoat, in the
      evening dress, with the child in his arms.

After he had left her alone the young wife had waited, calmly enough at
      first, in the little Japanese boudoir. Then, as she did not see him
      return, she went back to the parlor with an indifferent and calm
      appearance, but terribly anxious. When her mother saw her alone she asked:
      “Where is your husband?” She answered: “In his room; he
      is coming right back.”

After an hour, when everybody had questioned her, she told about the
      letter, Jacques'' upset appearance and her fears of an accident.

Still they waited. The guests left; only the nearest relatives remained.
      At midnight the bride was put to bed, sobbing bitterly. Her mother and two
      aunts, sitting around the bed, listened to her crying, silent and in
      despair. The father had gone to the commissary of police to see if he
      could obtain some news.

At five o''clock a slight noise was heard in the hall. A door was softly
      opened and closed. Then suddenly a little cry like the mewing of a cat was
      heard throughout the silent house.

All the women started forward and Berthe sprang ahead of them all, pushing
      her way past her aunts, wrapped in a bathrobe.

Jacques stood in the middle of the room, pale and out of breath, holding
      an infant in his arms. The four women looked at him, astonished; but
      Berthe, who had suddenly become courageous, rushed forward with anguish in
      her heart, exclaiming: “What is it? What''s the matter?”

Without saying a word, Berthe seized the child, kissed it and hugged it to
      her. Then she raised her tear-filled eyes to him, asking: “Did you
      say that the mother was dead?” He answered: “Yes—just
      now—in my arms. I had broken with her since summer. I knew nothing.
      The physician sent for me.”

“My marriage with your cousin is broken off in the most stupid way,
      all on account of an idiotic trick which I almost involuntarily played my
      intended. In my perplexity I turn to you, my old school chum, for you may
      be able to help me out of the difficulty. If you can, I shall be grateful
      to you until I die.

“You know Gilberte, or, rather, you think you know her, but do we
      ever understand women? All their opinions, their ideas, their creeds, are
      a surprise to us. They are all full of twists and turns, cf the
      unforeseen, of unintelligible arguments, of defective logic and of
      obstinate ideas, which seem final, but which they alter because a little
      bird came and perched on the window ledge.

“I need not tell you that your cousin is very religious, as she was
      brought up by the White (or was it the Black?) Ladies at Nancy. You know
      that better than I do, but what you perhaps do not know is, that she is
      just as excitable about other matters as she is about religion. Her head
      flies away, just as a leaf is whirled away by the wind; and she is a true
      woman, or, rather, girl, for she is moved or made angry in a moment,
      starting off at a gallop in affection, just as she does in hatred, and
      returning in the same manner; and she is pretty—as you know, and
      more charming than I can say—as you will never know.

“Well, we became engaged, and I adored her, as I adore her still,
      and she appeared to love me.

“One evening, I received a telegram summoning me to Cologne for a
      consultation, which might be followed by a serious and difficult
      operation, and as I had to start the next morning, I went to wish Gilberte
      good-by, and tell her why I could not dine with them on Wednesday, but
      would do so on Friday, the day of my return. Ah! Beware of Fridays, for I
      assure you they are unlucky!

“When I told her that I had to go to Germany, I saw that her eyes
      filled with tears, but when I said I should be back very soon, she clapped
      her hands, and said:

“''I am very glad you are going, then! You must bring me back
      something; a mere trifle, just a souvenir, but a souvenir that you have
      chosen for me. You must guess what I should like best, do you hear? And
      then I shall see whether you have any imagination.''

“''I forbid you to spend more than twenty francs on it. I want it for
      the intention, and for a remembrance of your penetration, and not for its
      intrinsic value:

“''If it costs you nothing in money, but is something very ingenious
      and pretty, I will—I will kiss you.''

“The next day I was in Cologne. It was a case of a terrible
      accident, which had plunged a whole family into despair, and a difficult
      amputation was necessary. They lodged me in the house; I might say, they
      almost locked me up, and I saw nobody but people in tears, who almost
      deafened me with their lamentations; I operated on a man who appeared to
      be in a moribund state, and who nearly died under my hands, and with whom
      I remained two nights; and then, when I saw that there was a chance of his
      recovery, I drove to the station. I had, however, made a mistake in the
      trains, and I had an hour to wait, and so I wandered about the streets,
      still thinking of my poor patient, when a man accosted me. I do not know
      German, and he was totally ignorant of French, but at last I made out that
      he was offering me some relics. I thought of Gilberte, for I knew her
      fanatical devotion, and here was my present ready to hand, so I followed
      the man into a shop where religious objects were for sale, and I bought a
      small piece of a bone of one of the Eleven Thousand Virgins.

“The pretended relic was inclosed in a charming old silver box, and
      that determined my choice, and, putting my purchase into my pocket, I went
      to the railway station, and so on to Paris.

“As soon as I got home, I wished to examine my purchase again, and
      on taking hold of it, I found that the box was open, and the relic
      missing! I searched in vain in my pocket, and turned it inside out; the
      small bit of bone, which was no bigger than half a pin, had disappeared.

“You know, my dear little Abbe, that my faith is not very fervent,
      but, as my friend, you are magnanimous enough to put up with my
      lukewarmness, and to leave me alone, and to wait for the future, so you
      say. But I absolutely disbelieve in the relics of secondhand dealers in
      piety, and you share my doubts in that respect. Therefore, the loss of
      that bit of sheep''s carcass did not grieve me, and I easily procured a
      similar fragment, which I carefully fastened inside my jewel-box, and then
      I went to see my intended.

“I pretended to have forgotten, but she did not believe me, and I
      made her beg, and even beseech me. But when I saw that she was devoured by
      curiosity, I gave her the sacred silver box. She appeared overjoyed.

“And she kissed the box passionately, so that I was ashamed of my
      deception. She was not quite satisfied, however, and her uneasiness soon
      turned to terrible fear, and looking straight into my eyes, she said:

“I was trapped; for to say that I had bought it of a man in the
      streets would be my destruction. What was I to say? A wild idea struck me,
      and I said, in a low, mysterious voice:

“That was the climax; I could not retract what I had said. I made up
      a fanciful story; with precise details: I had given the custodian of the
      building a hundred francs to be allowed to go about the building by
      myself; the shrine was being repaired, but I happened to be there at the
      breakfast hour of the workmen and clergy; by removing a small panel, I had
      been enabled to seize a small piece of bone (oh! so small), among a
      quantity of others (I said a quantity, as I thought of the amount that the
      remains of the skeletons of eleven thousand virgins must produce). Then I
      went to a goldsmith''s and bought a casket worthy of the relic; and I was
      not sorry to let her know that the silver box cost me five hundred francs.

“But she did not think of that; she listened to me, trembling, in an
      ecstasy, and whispering: ''How I love you!'' she threw herself into my arms.

“Just note this: I had committed sacrilege for her sake. I had
      committed a theft; I had violated a church; I had violated a shrine;
      violated and stolen holy relics, and for that she adored me, thought me
      perfect, tender, divine. Such is woman, my dear Abbe, every woman.

“For two months I was the most admirable of lovers. In her room, she
      had made a kind of magnificent chapel in which to keep this bit of mutton
      chop, which, as she thought, had made me commit that divine love-crime,
      and she worked up her religious enthusiasm in front of it every morning
      and evening. I had asked her to keep the matter secret, for fear, as I
      said, that I might be arrested, condemned, and given over to Germany, and
      she kept her promise.

“Well, at the beginning of the summer, she was seized with an
      irresistible desire to see the scene of my exploit, and she teased her
      father so persistently (without telling him her secret reason), that he
      took her to Cologne, but without telling me of their trip, according to
      his daughter''s wish.

“I need not tell you that I had not seen the interior of the
      cathedral. I do not know where the tomb (if there be a tomb) of the Eleven
      Thousand Virgins is; and then, it appears, it is unapproachable, alas!

“A week afterward, I received ten lines, breaking off our
      engagement, and then an explanatory letter from her father, whom she had,
      somewhat late, taken into her confidence.

“At the sight of the shrine, she had suddenly seen through my
      trickery and my lie, and at the same time discovered my real innocence of
      any crime. Having asked the keeper of the relics whether any robbery had
      been committed, the man began to laugh, and pointed out to them how
      impossible such a crime was. But, from the moment that I had not plunged
      my profane hand into venerable relics, I was no longer worthy of my
      fair-haired, sensitive betrothed.

“I was forbidden the house; I begged and prayed in vain; nothing
      could move the fair devotee, and I became ill from grief. Well, last week,
      her cousin, Madame d''Arville, who is your cousin also, sent me word that
      she should like to see me, and when I called, she told me on what
      conditions I might obtain my pardon, and here they are. I must bring her a
      relic, a real, authentic relic of some virgin and martyr, certified to be
      such by our Holy Father, the Pope, and I am going mad from embarrassment
      and anxiety.

“I will go to Rome, if needful, but I cannot call on the Pope
      unexpectedly, to tell him my stupid misadventure; and, besides, I doubt
      whether they allow private individuals to have relics. Could not you give
      me an introduction to some cardinal, or even to some French prelate who
      possesses some remains of a female saint? Or, perhaps, you may have the
      precious object she wants in your collection?

“Help me out of my difficulty, my dear Abbe, and I promise you that
      I will be converted ten years sooner than I otherwise should be!

“My dear old schoolmate, will you allow your cousin to die the
      victim of a stupid piece of subterfuge on my part? Pray prevent her from
      being virgin eleven thousand and one.

The warm autumn sun was beating down on the farmyard. Under the grass,
      which had been cropped close by the cows, the earth soaked by recent
      rains, was soft and sank in under the feet with a soggy noise, and the
      apple trees, loaded with apples, were dropping their pale green fruit in
      the dark green grass.

Four young heifers, tied in a line, were grazing and at times looking
      toward the house and lowing. The fowls made a colored patch on the
      dung-heap before the stable, scratching, moving about and cackling, while
      two roosters crowed continually, digging worms for their hens, whom they
      were calling with a loud clucking.

The wooden gate opened and a man entered. He might have been forty years
      old, but he looked at least sixty, wrinkled, bent, walking slowly, impeded
      by the weight of heavy wooden shoes full of straw. His long arms hung down
      on both sides of his body. When he got near the farm a yellow cur, tied at
      the foot of an enormous pear tree, beside a barrel which served as his
      kennel, began at first to wag his tail and then to bark for joy. The man
      cried:

A peasant woman came out of the house. Her large, flat, bony body was
      outlined under a long woollen jacket drawn in at the waist. A gray skirt,
      too short, fell to the middle of her legs, which were encased in blue
      stockings. She, too, wore wooden shoes, filled with straw. The white cap,
      turned yellow, covered a few hairs which were plastered to the scalp, and
      her brown, thin, ugly, toothless face had that wild, animal expression
      which is often to be found on the faces of the peasants.

After passing through the kitchen, they entered a low, dark room, barely
      lighted by one window, in front of which a piece of calico was hanging.
      The big beams, turned brown with age and smoke, crossed the room from one
      side to the other, supporting the thin floor of the garret, where an army
      of rats ran about day and night.

The moist, lumpy earthen floor looked greasy, and, at the back of the
      room, the bed made an indistinct white spot. A harsh, regular noise, a
      difficult, hoarse, wheezing breathing, like the gurgling of water from a
      broken pump, came from the darkened couch where an old man, the father of
      the peasant woman, was dying.

“He''s been gurglin'' like that ever since midday.” They were
      silent. The father''s eyes were closed, his face was the color of the earth
      and so dry that it looked like wood. Through his open mouth came his
      harsh, rattling breath, and the gray linen sheet rose and fell with each
      respiration.

“There''s nothing more to do; I can''t help him. It''s a nuisance, just
      the same, because the weather is good and we''ve got a lot of work to do.”

“Yes, but to-morrow I''ll have to invite the people to the funeral.
      That means five or six hours to go round to Tourville and Manetot, and to
      see everybody.”

“It isn''t three o''clock yet. You could begin this evening and go all
      round the country to Tourville. You can just as well say that he''s dead,
      seem'' as he''s as good as that now.”

The man stood perplexed for a while, weighing the pros and cons of the
      idea. At last he declared:

“As you haven''t got anythin'' to do you might shake down some apples
      to bake and make four dozen dumplings for those who come to the funeral,
      for one must have something to cheer them. You can light the fire with the
      wood that''s under the shed. It''s dry.”

He left the room, went back into the kitchen, opened the cupboard, took
      out a six-pound loaf of bread, cut off a slice, and carefully gathered the
      crumbs in the palm of his hand and threw them into his mouth, so as not to
      lose anything. Then, with the end of his knife, he scraped out a little
      salt butter from the bottom of an earthen jar, spread it on his bread and
      began to eat slowly, as he did everything.

He recrossed the farmyard, quieted the dog, which had started barking
      again, went out on the road bordering on his ditch, and disappeared in the
      direction of Tourville.

As soon as she was alone, the woman began to work. She uncovered the
      meal-bin and made the dough for the dumplings. She kneaded it a long time,
      turning it over and over again, punching, pressing, crushing it. Finally
      she made a big, round, yellow-white ball, which she placed on the corner
      of the table.

Then she went to get her apples, and, in order not to injure the tree with
      a pole, she climbed up into it by a ladder. She chose the fruit with care,
      only taking the ripe ones, and gathering them in her apron.

She turned round. It was a neighbor, Osime Favet, the mayor, on his way to
      fertilize his fields, seated on the manure-wagon, with his feet hanging
      over the side. She turned round and answered:

“He is as good as dead. The funeral is Saturday at seven, because
      there''s lots of work to be done.”

When she went back to the house, she went over to look at her father,
      expecting to find him dead. But as soon as she reached the door she heard
      his monotonous, noisy rattle, and, thinking it a waste of time to go over
      to him, she began to prepare her dumplings. She wrapped up the fruit, one
      by one, in a thin layer of paste, then she lined them up on the edge of
      the table. When she had made forty-eight dumplings, arranged in dozens,
      one in front of the other, she began to think of preparing supper, and she
      hung her kettle over the fire to cook potatoes, for she judged it useless
      to heat the oven that day, as she had all the next day in which to finish
      the preparations.

They went to look at him. The old man was in exactly the same condition.
      His hoarse rattle, as regular as the ticking of a clock, was neither
      quicker nor slower. It returned every second, the tone varying a little,
      according as the air entered or left his chest.

They returned to the kitchen and started to eat without saying a word.
      When they had swallowed their soup, they ate another piece of bread and
      butter. Then, as soon as the dishes were washed, they returned to the
      dying man.

The woman, carrying a little lamp with a smoky wick, held it in front of
      her father''s face. If he had not been breathing, one would certainly have
      thought him dead.

The couple''s bed was hidden in a little recess at the other end of the
      room. Silently they retired, put out the light, closed their eyes, and
      soon two unequal snores, one deep and the other shriller, accompanied the
      uninterrupted rattle of the dying man.

The husband awoke at the first streaks of dawn. His father-in-law was
      still alive. He shook his wife, worried by the tenacity of the old man.

“You needn''t be afraid; he can''t live through the day. And the mayor
      won''t stop our burying him to-morrow, because he allowed it for Maitre
      Renard''s father, who died just during the planting season.”

At noon the old man was not dead. The people hired for the day''s work came
      by groups to look at him. Each one had his say. Then they left again for
      the fields.

At six o''clock, when the work was over, the father was still breathing. At
      last his son-in-law was frightened.

She no longer knew how to solve the problem. They went to the mayor. He
      promised that he would close his eyes and authorize the funeral for the
      following day. They also went to the health officer, who likewise
      promised, in order to oblige Maitre Chicot, to antedate the death
      certificate. The man and the woman returned, feeling more at ease.

They went to bed and to sleep, just as they did the preceding day, their
      sonorous breathing blending with the feeble breathing of the old man.

Then they began to be frightened. They stood by their father, watching him
      with distrust, as though he had wished to play them a mean trick, to
      deceive them, to annoy them on purpose, and they were vexed at him for the
      time which he was making them lose.

The guests who were expected could not be notified. They decided to wait
      and explain the case to them.

Toward a quarter to seven the first ones arrived. The women in black,
      their heads covered with large veils, looking very sad. Then men, ill at
      ease in their homespun coats, were coming forward more slowly, in couples,
      talking business.

Maitre Chicot and his wife, bewildered, received them sorrowfully, and
      suddenly both of them together began to cry as they approached the first
      group. They explained the matter, related their difficulty, offered
      chairs, bustled about, tried to make excuses, attempting to prove that
      everybody would have done as they did, talking continually and giving
      nobody a chance to answer.

The guests, taken aback, a little disappointed, as though they had missed
      an expected entertainment, did not know what to do, some remaining seated
      others standing. Several wished to leave. Maitre Chicot held them back:

The faces brightened at this idea. The yard was filling little by little;
      the early arrivals were telling the news to those who had arrived later.
      Everybody was whispering. The idea of the dumplings seemed to cheer
      everyone up.

The women went in to take a look at the dying man. They crossed themselves
      beside the bed, muttered a prayer and went out again. The men, less
      anxious for this spectacle, cast a look through the window, which had been
      opened.

“That''s how he''s been for two days, neither better nor worse.
      Doesn''t he sound like a pump that has gone dry?”

When everybody had had a look at the dying man, they thought of the
      refreshments; but as there were too many people for the kitchen to hold,
      the table was moved out in front of the door. The four dozen golden
      dumplings, tempting and appetizing, arranged in two big dishes, attracted
      the eyes of all. Each one reached out to take his, fearing that there
      would not be enough. But four remained over.

This remark, instead of making the guests sad, seemed to cheer them up. It
      was their turn now to eat dumplings.

Madame Chicot, distressed at the expense, kept running down to the cellar
      continually for cider. The pitchers were emptied in quick succession. The
      company was laughing and talking loud now. They were beginning to shout as
      they do at feasts.

Suddenly an old peasant woman who had stayed beside the dying man, held
      there by a morbid fear of what would soon happen to herself, appeared at
      the window and cried in a shrill voice:

Everybody was silent. The women arose quickly to go and see. He was indeed
      dead. The rattle had ceased. The men looked at each other, looking down,
      ill at ease. They hadn''t finished eating the dumplings. Certainly the
      rascal had not chosen a propitious moment. The Chicots were no longer
      weeping. It was over; they were relieved.

“I knew it couldn''t ''last. If he could only have done it last night,
      it would have saved us all this trouble.”

Well, anyhow, it was over. They would bury him on Monday, that was all,
      and they would eat some more dumplings for the occasion.

The guests went away, talking the matter over, pleased at having had the
      chance to see him and of getting something to eat.

And when the husband and wife were alone, face to face, she said, her face
      distorted with grief:

“We''ll have to bake four dozen more dumplings! Why couldn''t he have
      made up his mind last night?”

It was after dinner, and we were talking about adventures and accidents
      which happened while out shooting.

An old friend, known to all of us, M. Boniface, a great sportsman and a
      connoisseur of wine, a man of wonderful physique, witty and gay, and
      endowed with an ironical and resigned philosophy, which manifested itself
      in caustic humor, and never in melancholy, suddenly exclaimed:

“I know a story, or rather a tragedy, which is somewhat peculiar. It
      is not at all like those which one hears of usually, and I have never told
      it, thinking that it would interest no one.

“It is not at all sympathetic. I mean by that, that it does not
      arouse the kind of interest which pleases or which moves one agreeably.

“In those days I owned a lonely bit of property in the neighborhood
      of Jumieges, surrounded by forests and abounding in hares and rabbits. I
      was accustomed to spending four or five days alone there each year, there
      not being room enough to allow of my bringing a friend with me.

“I had placed there as gamekeeper, an old retired gendarme, a good
      man, hot-tempered, a severe disciplinarian, a terror to poachers and
      fearing nothing. He lived all alone, far from the village, in a little
      house, or rather hut, consisting of two rooms downstairs, with kitchen and
      store-room, and two upstairs. One of them, a kind of box just large enough
      to accommodate a bed, a cupboard and a chair, was reserved for my use.

“Old man Cavalier lived in the other one. When I said that he was
      alone in this place, I was wrong. He had taken his nephew with him, a
      young scamp about fourteen years old, who used to go to the village and
      run errands for the old man.

“This young scapegrace was long and lanky, with yellow hair, so
      light that it resembled the fluff of a plucked chicken, so thin that he
      seemed bald. Besides this, he had enormous feet and the hands of a giant.

“He was cross-eyed, and never looked at anyone. He struck me as
      being in the same relation to the human race as ill-smelling beasts are to
      the animal race. He reminded me of a polecat.

“But during my short sojourns at the Pavilion—so I called the
      hut —Marius would give up his nook to an old woman from
      Ecorcheville, called Celeste, who used to come and cook for me, as old man
      Cavalier''s stews were not sufficient for my healthy appetite.

“I left Rouen on horseback, followed by my dog Bock, a big Dalmatian
      hound from Poitou, full-chested and with a heavy jaw, which could retrieve
      among the bushes like a Pont-Andemer spaniel.

“I was carrying my satchel slung across my back and my gun
      diagonally across my chest. It was a cold, windy, gloomy day, with clouds
      scurrying across the sky.

“As I went up the hill at Canteleu, I looked over the broad valley
      of the Seine, the river winding in and out along its course as far as the
      eye could see. To the right the towers of Rouen stood out against the sky,
      and to the left the landscape was bounded by the distant slopes covered
      with trees. Then I crossed the forest of Roumare and, toward five o''clock,
      reached the Pavilion, where Cavalier and Celeste were expecting me.

“For ten years I had appeared there at the same time, in the same
      manner; and for ten years the same faces had greeted me with the same
      words:

“Cavalier had hardly changed. He withstood time like an old tree;
      but Celeste, especially in the past four years, had become unrecognizable.

“She was bent almost double, and, although still active, when she
      walked her body was almost at right angles to her legs.

“The old woman, who was very devoted to me, always seemed affected
      at seeing me again, and each time, as I left, she would say:

“The sad, timid farewell of this old servant, this hopeless
      resignation to the inevitable fate which was not far off for her, moved me
      strangely each year.

“I dismounted, and while Cavalier, whom I had greeted, was leading
      my horse to the little shed which served as a stable, I entered the
      kitchen, which also served as dining-room, followed by Celeste.

“Here the gamekeeper joined us. I saw at first glance that something
      was the matter. He seemed preoccupied, ill at ease, worried.

“''No, not yet, monsieur. I do not wish to bother you with my little
      troubles so soon after your arrival.''

“I insisted, but he absolutely refused to give me any information
      before dinner. From his expression, I could tell that it was something
      very serious.

“He said this with so much seriousness, with such sad solemnity,
      that it was really almost funny. His big gray mustache seemed almost ready
      to drop from his lips.

“Well, monsieur, I had rather tell you the whole business right
      away; it''s on account of him that I am worrying.''

“The gamekeeper, however, hesitated, his voice altered and shaky,
      his face suddenly furrowed by the deep lines of an old man.

“''Well, I found out, last winter, that someone was poaching in the
      woods of Roseraies, but I couldn''t seem to catch the man. I spent night
      after night on the lookout for him. In vain. During that time they began
      poaching over by Ecorcheville. I was growing thin from vexation. But as
      for catching the trespasser, impossible! One might have thought that the
      rascal was forewarned of my plans.

“''But one day, while I was brushing Marius'' Sunday trousers, I found
      forty cents in his pocket. Where did he get it?

“''I thought the matter over for about a week, and I noticed that he
      used to go out; he would leave the house just as I was coming home to go
      to bed—yes, monsieur.

“''Then I started to watch him, without the slightest suspicion of
      the real facts. One morning, just after I had gone to bed before him, I
      got right up again, and followed him. For shadowing a man, there is nobody
      like me, monsieur.

“''The blood rushed to my head, and I almost killed him on the spot,
      I hit him so hard. Oh! yes, I thrashed him all right. And I promised him
      that he would get another beating from my hand, in your presence, as an
      example.

“''There! I have grown thin from sorrow. You know how it is when one
      is worried like that. But tell me, what would you have done? The boy has
      no father or mother, and I am the last one of his blood; I kept him, I
      couldn''t drive him out, could I?

“''I told him that if it happened again I would have no more pity for
      him, all would be over. There! Did I do right, monsieur?''

“''Thank you, monsieur. Now I am going to fetch him. I must give him
      his thrashing, as an example.''

“I knew that it was hopeless to try and turn the old man from his
      idea. I therefore let him have his own way.

“Marius seemed to have grown; he was homelier even than the year
      before, with his evil, sneaking expression.

“Then putting one arm round him, the former gendarme lifted him
      right off the ground, and began to whack him with such force that I rose
      to stop the blows.

“Then his uncle lifted him to his feet, and dismissed him with a
      cuff which almost knocked him down again.

“I was awakened toward midnight by the furious barking of my dog
      Bock. I immediately noticed that my room was full of smoke. I jumped out
      of bed, struck a light, ran to the door and opened it. A cloud of flames
      burst in. The house was on fire.

“I quickly closed the heavy oak door and, drawing on my trousers, I
      first lowered the dog through the window, by means of a rope made of my
      sheets; then, having thrown out the rest of my clothes, my game-bag and my
      gun, I in turn escaped the same way.

“However, I could see through the lower windows that the whole
      ground-floor was nothing but a roaring furnace; I also noticed that it had
      been filled with straw to make it burn readily.

“Then the thought struck me that the smoke might be suffocating him.
      An idea came to me. I slipped two cartridges into my gun, and shot
      straight at his window.

“The six panes of glass shattered into the room in a cloud of glass.
      This time the old man had heard me, and he appeared, dazed, in his
      nightshirt, bewildered by the glare which illumined the whole front of his
      ''house.

“The flames were coming out through all the cracks downstairs, were
      licking along the wall, were creeping toward him and going to surround
      him. He jumped and landed on his feet, like a cat.

“It was none too soon. The thatched roof cracked in the middle,
      right over the staircase, which formed a kind of flue for the fire
      downstairs; and an immense red jet jumped up into the air, spreading like
      a stream of water and sprinkling a shower of sparks around the hut. In a
      few seconds it was nothing but a pool of flames.

“He did not answer. The house caved in before us, forming only an
      enormous, bright, blinding brazier, an awe-inspiring funeral-pile, where
      the poor woman could no longer be anything but a glowing ember, a glowing
      ember of human flesh.

“As the fire crept toward the shed, I suddenly bethought me of my
      horse, and Cavalier ran to free it.

“Hardly had he opened the door of the stable, when a supple, nimble
      body darted between his legs, and threw him on his face. It was Marius,
      running for all he was worth.

“The man was up in a second. He tried to run after the wretch, but,
      seeing that he could not catch him, and maddened by an irresistible anger,
      yielding to one of those thoughtless impulses which we cannot foresee or
      prevent, he picked up my gun, which was lying on the ground. near him, put
      it to his shoulder, and, before I could make a motion, he pulled the
      trigger without even noticing whether or not the weapon was loaded.

“One of the cartridges which I had put in to announce the fire was
      still intact, and the charge caught the fugitive right in the back,—throwing
      him forward on the ground, bleeding profusely. He immediately began to
      claw the earth with his hands and with his knees, as though trying to run
      on all fours like a rabbit who has been mortally wounded, and sees the
      hunter approaching.

“I rushed forward to the boy, but I could already hear the
      death-rattle. He passed away before the fire was extinguished, without
      having said a word.

“I appeared at the trial as witness, and related the facts in
      detail, without changing a thing. Cavalier was acquitted. He disappeared
      that very day, leaving the country.

As the weather was very fine, the people on the farm had hurried through
      their dinner and had returned to the fields.

The servant, Rose, remained alone in the large kitchen, where the fire was
      dying out on the hearth beneath the large boiler of hot water. From time
      to time she dipped out some water and slowly washed her dishes, stopping
      occasionally to look at the two streaks of light which the sun threw
      across the long table through the window, and which showed the defects in
      the glass.

Three venturesome hens were picking up the crumbs under the chairs, while
      the smell of the poultry yard and the warmth from the cow stall came in
      through the half-open door, and a cock was heard crowing in the distance.

When she had finished her work, wiped down the table, dusted the
      mantelpiece and put the plates on the high dresser close to the wooden
      clock with its loud tick-tock, she drew a long breath, as she felt rather
      oppressed, without exactly knowing why. She looked at the black clay
      walls, the rafters that were blackened with smoke and from which hung
      spiders'' webs, smoked herrings and strings of onions, and then she sat
      down, rather overcome by the stale odor from the earthen floor, on which
      so many things had been continually spilled and which the heat brought
      out. With this there was mingled the sour smell of the pans of milk which
      were set out to raise the cream in the adjoining dairy.

She wanted to sew, as usual, but she did not feel strong enough, and so
      she went to the door to get a mouthful of fresh air, which seemed to do
      her good.

The fowls were lying on the steaming dunghill; some of them were
      scratching with one claw in search of worms, while the cock stood up
      proudly in their midst. When he crowed, the cocks in all the neighboring
      farmyards replied to him, as if they were uttering challenges from farm to
      farm.

The girl looked at them without thinking, and then she raised her eyes and
      was almost dazzled at the sight of the apple trees in blossom. Just then a
      colt, full of life and friskiness, jumped over the ditches and then
      stopped suddenly, as if surprised at being alone.

She also felt inclined to run; she felt inclined to move and to stretch
      her limbs and to repose in the warm, breathless air. She took a few
      undecided steps and closed her eyes, for she was seized with a feeling of
      animal comfort, and then she went to look for eggs in the hen loft. There
      were thirteen of them, which she took in and put into the storeroom; but
      the smell from the kitchen annoyed her again, and she went out to sit on
      the grass for a time.

The farmyard, which was surrounded by trees, seemed to be asleep. The tall
      grass, amid which the tall yellow dandelions rose up like streaks of
      yellow light, was of a vivid, fresh spring green. The apple trees cast
      their shade all round them, and the thatched roofs, on which grew blue and
      yellow irises, with their sword-like leaves, steamed as if the moisture of
      the stables and barns were coming through the straw. The girl went to the
      shed, where the carts and buggies were kept. Close to it, in a ditch,
      there was a large patch of violets, whose fragrance was spread abroad,
      while beyond the slope the open country could be seen, where grain was
      growing, with clumps of trees in places, and groups of laborers here and
      there, who looked as small as dolls, and white horses like toys, who were
      drawing a child''s cart, driven by a man as tall as one''s finger.

She took up a bundle of straw, threw it into the ditch and sat down upon
      it. Then, not feeling comfortable, she undid it, spread it out and lay
      down upon it at full length on her back, with both arms under her head and
      her legs stretched out.

Gradually her eyes closed, and she was falling into a state of delightful
      languor. She was, in fact, almost asleep when she felt two hands on her
      bosom, and she sprang up at a bound. It was Jacques, one of the farm
      laborers, a tall fellow from Picardy, who had been making love to her for
      a long time. He had been herding the sheep, and, seeing her lying down in
      the shade, had come up stealthily and holding his breath, with glistening
      eyes and bits of straw in his hair.

He tried to kiss her, but she gave him a smack in the face, for she was as
      strong as he, and he was shrewd enough to beg her pardon; so they sat down
      side by side and talked amicably. They spoke about the favorable weather,
      of their master, who was a good fellow, then of their neighbors, of all
      the people in the country round, of themselves, of their village, of their
      youthful days, of their recollections, of their relations, who had left
      them for a long time, and it might be forever. She grew sad as she thought
      of it, while he, with one fixed idea in his head, drew closer to her.

“I have not seen my mother for a long time,” she said. “It
      is very hard to be separated like that,” and she directed her looks
      into the distance, toward the village in the north which she had left.

Suddenly, however, he seized her by the neck and kissed her again, but she
      struck him so violently in the face with her clenched fist that his nose
      began to bleed, and he got up and laid his head against the stem of a
      tree. When she saw that, she was sorry, and going up to him, she said:
      “Have I hurt you?” He, however, only laughed. “No, it
      was a mere nothing; only she had hit him right on the middle of the nose.
      What a devil!” he said, and he looked at her with admiration, for
      she had inspired him with a feeling of respect and of a very different
      kind of admiration which was the beginning of a real love for that tall,
      strong wench. When the bleeding had stopped, he proposed a walk, as he was
      afraid of his neighbor''s heavy hand, if they remained side by side like
      that much longer; but she took his arm of her own accord, in the avenue,
      as if they had been out for an evening''s walk, and said: “It is not
      nice of you to despise me like that, Jacques.” He protested,
      however. No, he did not despise her. He was in love with her, that was
      all.

He hesitated and then looked at her sideways, while she looked straight
      ahead of her. She had fat, red cheeks, a full bust beneath her cotton
      jacket; thick, red lips; and her neck, which was almost bare, was covered
      with small beads of perspiration. He felt a fresh access of desire, and,
      putting his lips to her ear, he murmured: “Yes, of course I do.”

Then she threw her arms round his neck and kissed him till they were both
      out of breath. From that moment the eternal story of love began between
      them. They plagued one another in corners; they met in the moonlight
      beside the haystack and gave each other bruises on the legs, under the
      table, with their heavy nailed boots. By degrees, however, Jacques seemed
      to grow tired of her; he avoided her, scarcely spoke to her, and did not
      try any longer to meet her alone, which made her sad and anxious; and soon
      she found that she was enceinte.

At first she was in a state of consternation, but then she got angry, and
      her rage increased every day because she could not meet him, as he avoided
      her most carefully. At last, one night, when every one in the farmhouse
      was asleep, she went out noiselessly in her petticoat, with bare feet,
      crossed the yard and opened the door of the stable where Jacques was lying
      in a large box of straw above his horses. He pretended to snore when he
      heard her coming, but she knelt down by his side and shook him until he
      sat up.

“What do you want?” he then asked her. And with clenched
      teeth, and trembling with anger, she replied: “I want—I want
      you to marry me, as you promised.” But he only laughed and replied:
      “Oh! if a man were to marry all the girls with whom he has made a
      slip, he would have more than enough to do.”

Then she seized him by the throat, threw him or his back, so that he could
      not get away from her, and, half strangling him, she shouted into his
      face:

He gasped for breath, as he was almost choked, and so they remained, both
      of them, motionless and without speaking, in the dark silence, which was
      only broken by the noise made by a horse as he, pulled the hay out of the
      manger and then slowly munched it.

When Jacques found that she was the stronger, he stammered out: “Very
      well, I will marry you, as that is the case.” But she did not
      believe his promises. “It must be at once,” she said. “You
      must have the banns put up.” “At once,” he replied.
      “Swear solemnly that you will.” He hesitated for a few moments
      and then said: “I swear it, by Heaven!”

She had no chance of speaking to him for several days; and, as the stable
      was now always locked at night, she was afraid to make any noise, for fear
      of creating a scandal. One morning, however, she saw another man come in
      at dinner time, and she said: “Has Jacques left?” “Yes;”
      the man replied; “I have got his place.”

This made her tremble so violently that she could not take the saucepan
      off the fire; and later, when they were all at work, she went up into her
      room and cried, burying her head in the bolster, so that she might not be
      heard. During the day, however, she tried to obtain some information
      without exciting any suspicion, but she was so overwhelmed by the thoughts
      of her misfortune that she fancied that all the people whom she asked
      laughed maliciously. All she learned, however, was that he had left the
      neighborhood altogether.

Then a cloud of constant misery began for her. She worked mechanically,
      without thinking of what she was doing, with one fixed idea in her head:

This continual feeling made her so incapable of reasoning that she did not
      even try to think of any means of avoiding the disgrace that she knew must
      ensue, which was irreparable and drawing nearer every day, and which was
      as sure as death itself. She got up every morning long before the others
      and persistently tried to look at her figure in a piece of broken
      looking-glass, before which she did her hair, as she was very anxious to
      know whether anybody would notice a change in her, and, during the day,
      she stopped working every few minutes to look at herself from top to toe,
      to see whether her apron did not look too short.

The months went on, and she scarcely spoke now, and when she was asked a
      question, did not appear to understand; but she had a frightened look,
      haggard eyes and trembling hands, which made her master say to her
      occasionally: “My poor girl, how stupid you have grown lately.”

In church she hid behind a pillar, and no longer ventured to go to
      confession, as she feared to face the priest, to whom she attributed
      superhuman powers, which enabled him to read people''s consciences; and at
      meal times the looks of her fellow servants almost made her faint with
      mental agony; and she was always fancying that she had been found out by
      the cowherd, a precocious and cunning little lad, whose bright eyes seemed
      always to be watching her.

One morning the postman brought her a letter, and as she had never
      received one in her life before she was so upset by it that she was
      obliged to sit down. Perhaps it was from him? But, as she could not read,
      she sat anxious and trembling with that piece of paper, covered with ink,
      in her hand. After a time, however, she put it into her pocket, as she did
      not venture to confide her secret to any one. She often stopped in her
      work to look at those lines written at regular intervals, and which
      terminated in a signature, imagining vaguely that she would suddenly
      discover their meaning, until at last, as she felt half mad with
      impatience and anxiety, she went to the schoolmaster, who told her to sit
      down and read to her as follows:

“MY DEAR DAUGHTER: I write to tell you that I am very ill. Our
      neighbor, Monsieur Dentu, begs you to come, if you can.

She did not say a word and went away, but as soon as she was alone her
      legs gave way under her, and she fell down by the roadside and remained
      there till night.

When she got back, she told the farmer her bad news, and he allowed her to
      go home for as long as she liked, and promised to have her work done by a
      charwoman and to take her back when she returned.

Her mother died soon after she got there, and the next day Rose gave birth
      to a seven-months child, a miserable little skeleton, thin enough to make
      anybody shudder, and which seemed to be suffering continually, to judge
      from the painful manner in which it moved its poor little hands, which
      were as thin as a crab''s legs; but it lived for all that. She said she was
      married, but could not be burdened with the child, so she left it with
      some neighbors, who promised to take great care of it, and she went back
      to the farm.

But now in her heart, which had been wounded so long, there arose
      something like brightness, an unknown love for that frail little creature
      which she had left behind her, though there was fresh suffering in that
      very love, suffering which she felt every hour and every minute, because
      she was parted from her child. What pained her most, however, was the mad
      longing to kiss it, to press it in her arms, to feel the warmth of its
      little body against her breast. She could not sleep at night; she thought
      of it the whole day long, and in the evening, when her work was done, she
      would sit in front of the fire and gaze at it intently, as people do whose
      thoughts are far away.

They began to talk about her and to tease her about her lover. They asked
      her whether he was tall, handsome and rich. When was the wedding to be and
      the christening? And often she ran away to cry by herself, for these
      questions seemed to hurt her like the prick of a pin; and, in order to
      forget their jokes, she began to work still more energetically, and, still
      thinking of her child, she sought some way of saving up money for it, and
      determined to work so that her master would be obliged to raise her wages.

By degrees she almost monopolized the work and persuaded him to get rid of
      one servant girl, who had become useless since she had taken to working
      like two; she economized in the bread, oil and candles; in the corn, which
      they gave to the chickens too extravagantly, and in the fodder for the
      horses and cattle, which was rather wasted. She was as miserly about her
      master''s money as if it had been her own; and, by dint of making good
      bargains, of getting high prices for all their produce, and by baffling
      the peasants'' tricks when they offered anything for sale, he, at last,
      entrusted her with buying and selling everything, with the direction of
      all the laborers, and with the purchase of provisions necessary for the
      household; so that, in a short time, she became. indispensable to him. She
      kept such a strict eye on everything about her that, under her direction,
      the farm prospered wonderfully, and for five miles around people talked of
      “Master Vallin''s servant,” and the farmer himself said
      everywhere: “That girl is worth more than her weight in gold.”

But time passed by, and her wages remained the same. Her hard work was
      accepted as something that was due from every good servant, and as a mere
      token of good will; and she began to think rather bitterly that if the
      farmer could put fifty or a hundred crowns extra into the bank every
      month, thanks to her, she was still only earning her two hundred francs a
      year, neither more nor less; and so she made up her mind to ask for an
      increase of wages. She went to see the schoolmaster three times about it,
      but when she got there, she spoke about something else. She felt a kind of
      modesty in asking for money, as if it were something disgraceful; but, at
      last, one day, when the farmer was having breakfast by himself in the
      kitchen, she said to him, with some embarrassment, that she wished to
      speak to him particularly. He raised his head in surprise, with both his
      hands on the table, holding his knife, with its point in the air, in one,
      and a piece of bread in the other, and he looked fixedly at, the girl, who
      felt uncomfortable under his gaze, but asked for a week''s holiday, so that
      she might get away, as she was not very well. He acceded to her request
      immediately, and then added, in some embarrassment himself:

The child was nearly eight months old, and she did not recognize it. It
      had grown rosy and chubby all over, like a little roll of fat. She threw
      herself on it, as if it had been some prey, and kissed it so violently
      that it began to scream with terror; and then she began to cry herself,
      because it did not know her, and stretched out its arms to its nurse as
      soon as it saw her. But the next day it began to know her, and laughed
      when it saw her, and she took it into the fields, and ran about excitedly
      with it, and sat down under the shade of the trees; and then, for the
      first time in her life, she opened her heart to somebody, although he
      could not understand her, and told him her troubles; how hard her work
      was, her anxieties and her hopes, and she quite tired the child with the
      violence of her caresses.

She took the greatest pleasure in handling it, in washing and dressing it,
      for it seemed to her that all this was the confirmation of her maternity;
      and she would look at it, almost feeling surprised ''that it was hers, and
      would say to herself in a low voice as she danced it in her arms: “It
      is my baby, it''s my baby.”

She cried all the way home as she returned to the farm and had scarcely
      got in before her master called her into his room; and she went, feeling
      astonished and nervous, without knowing why.

“Sit down there,” he said. She sat down, and for some moments
      they remained side by side, in some embarrassment, with their arms hanging
      at their sides, as if they did not know what to do with them, and looking
      each other in the face, after the manner of peasants.

The farmer, a stout, jovial, obstinate man of forty-five, who had lost two
      wives, evidently felt embarrassed, which was very unusual with him; but,
      at last, he made up his mind, and began to speak vaguely, hesitating a
      little, and looking out of the window as he talked. “How is it,
      Rose,” he said, “that you have never thought of settling in
      life?” She grew as pale as death, and, seeing that she gave him no
      answer, he went on: “You are a good, steady, active and economical
      girl; and a wife like you would make a man''s fortune.”

She did not move, but looked frightened; she did not even try to
      comprehend his meaning, for her thoughts were in a whirl, as if at the
      approach of some great danger; so, after waiting for a few seconds, he
      went on: “You see, a farm without a mistress can never succeed, even
      with a servant like you.” Then he stopped, for he did not know what
      else to say, and Rose looked at him with the air of a person who thinks
      that he is face to face with a murderer and ready to flee at the slightest
      movement he may make; but, after waiting for about five minutes, he asked
      her: “Well, will it suit you?” “Will what suit me,
      master?” And he said quickly: “Why, to marry me, by Heaven!”

She jumped up, but fell back on her chair, as if she had been struck, and
      there she remained motionless, like a person who is overwhelmed by some
      great misfortune. At last the farmer grew impatient and said: “Come,
      what more do you want?” She looked at him, almost in terror, then
      suddenly the tears came into her eyes and she said twice in a choking
      voice: “I cannot, I cannot!” “Why not?” he asked.
      “Come, don''t be silly; I will give you until tomorrow to think it
      over.”

And he hurried out of the room, very glad to have got through with the
      matter, which had troubled him a good deal, for he had no doubt that she
      would the next morning accept a proposal which she could never have
      expected and which would be a capital bargain for him, as he thus bound a
      woman to his interests who would certainly bring him more than if she had
      the best dowry in the district.

Neither could there be any scruples about an unequal match between them,
      for in the country every one is very nearly equal; the farmer works with
      his laborers, who frequently become masters in their turn, and the female
      servants constantly become the mistresses of the establishments without
      its making any change in their life or habits.

Rose did not go to bed that night. She threw herself, dressed as she was,
      on her bed, and she had not even the strength to cry left in her, she was
      so thoroughly dumfounded. She remained quite inert, scarcely knowing that
      she had a body, and without being at all able to collect her thoughts,
      though, at moments, she remembered something of what had happened, and
      then she was frightened at the idea of what might happen. Her terror
      increased, and every time the great kitchen clock struck the hour she
      broke out in a perspiration from grief. She became bewildered, and had the
      nightmare; her candle went out, and then she began to imagine that some
      one had cast a spell over her, as country people so often imagine, and she
      felt a mad inclination t' WHERE id = '6b5a5bab-cb6d-4c60-9071-cb95b01bf8ca';
