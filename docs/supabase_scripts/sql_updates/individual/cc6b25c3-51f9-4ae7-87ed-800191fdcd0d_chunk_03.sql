“Yes, black slaves and white,” replied Grandfather. “Our ancestors not
      only brought negroes from Africa, but Indians from South America, and
      white people from Ireland. These last were sold, not for life, but for a
      certain number of years, in order to pay the expenses of their voyage
      across the Atlantic. Nothing was more common than to see a lot of likely
      Irish girls advertised for sale in the newspapers. As for the little negro
      babies, they were offered to be giver away like young kittens.”

“Perhaps Alice would have liked one to play with, instead of her doll,”
       said Charley, laughing.

“Now, as for this pretty doll, my little Alice,” said Grandfather, “I wish
      you could have seen what splendid dresses the ladies wore in those times.
      They had silks, and satins, and damasks, and brocades, and high
      head-dresses, and all sorts of fine things. And they used to wear hooped
      petticoats of such enormous size that it was quite a journey to walk round
      them.”

“With full as much magnificence as the ladies,” answered Grandfather. “For
      their holiday suits they had coats of figured velvet, crimson, green,
      blue, and all other gay colors, embroidered with gold or silver lace.
      Their waistcoats, which were five times as large as modern ones, were very
      splendid. Sometimes the whole waistcoat, which came down almost to the
      knees, was made of gold brocade.”

“And then,” continued Grandfather, “they wore various sorts of periwigs,
      such as the tie, the Spencer, the brigadier, the major, the Albemarle, the
      Ramillies, the feather-top, and the full-bottom. Their three-cornered hats
      were laced with gold or silver. They had shining buckles at the knees of
      their small-clothes, and buckles likewise in their shoes. They wore swords
      with beautiful hilts, either of silver, or sometimes of polished steel,
      inlaid with gold.”

“And an embroidered crimson velvet coat,” said Clara, laughing, “and a
      gold brocade waistcoat down to your knees.”

“And a periwig,” added little Alice, soberly, not knowing what was the
      article of dress which she recommended to our friend Charley.

Grandfather smiled at the idea of Charley’s sturdy little figure in such a
      grotesque caparison. He then went on with the history of the chair, and
      told the children that, in 1730, King George II. appointed Jonathan
      Belcher to be governor of Massachusetts in place of the deceased Governor
      Burner. Mr. Belcher was a native of the province, but had spent much of
      his life in Europe.

The new governor found Grandfather’s chair in the Province House. He was
      struck with its noble and stately aspect, but was of opinion that age and
      hard services had made it scarcely so fit for courtly company as when it
      stood in the Earl of Lincoln’s hall. Wherefore, as Governor Belcher was
      fond of splendor, he employed a skilful artist to beautify the chair. This
      was done by polishing and varnishing it, and by gilding the carved work of
      the elbows, and likewise the oaken flowers of the back. The lion’s head
      now shone like a veritable lump of gold. Finally Governor Belcher gave the
      chair a cushion of blue damask, with a rich golden fringe.

“Our good old chair being thus glorified,” proceeded Grandfather, “it
      glittered with a great deal more splendor than it had exhibited just a
      century before, when the Lady Arbella brought it over from England. Most
      people mistook it for a chair of the latest London fashion. And this may
      serve for an example, that there is almost always an old and timeworn
      substance under all the glittering show of new invention.”

“Grandfather, I cannot see any of the gilding,” remarked Charley, who had
      been examining the chair very minutely.

“You will not wonder that it has been rubbed off,” replied Grandfather,
      “when you hear all the adventures that have since befallen the chair.
      Gilded it was; and the handsomest room in the Province House was adorned
      by it.”

There was not much to interest the children in what happened during the
      years that Governor Belcher remained in the chair. At first, like Colonel
      Shute and Governor Burner, he was engaged in disputing with the
      Legislature about his salary. But, as he found it impossible to get a
      fixed sum, he finally obtained the king’s leave to accept whatever the
      Legislature chose to give him. And thus the people triumphed, after this
      long contest for the privilege of expending their own money as they saw
      fit.

The remainder of Governor Belcher’s term of office was principally taken
      up in endeavoring to settle the currency. Honest John Hull’s pine-tree
      shillings had long ago been worn out, or lost, or melted down again; and
      their place was supplied by bills of paper or parchment, which were
      nominally valued at threepence and upwards. The value of these bills kept
      continually sinking, because the real hard money could not be obtained for
      them. They were a great deal worse than the old Indian currency of
      clam-shells. These disorders of the circulating medium were a source of
      endless plague and perplexity to the rulers and legislators, not only in
      Governor Belcher’s days, but for many years before and afterwards.

Finally the people suspected that Governor Belcher was secretly
      endeavoring to establish the Episcopal mode of worship in the provinces.
      There was enough of the old Puritan spirit remaining to cause most of the
      true sons of New England to look with horror upon such an attempt. Great
      exertions were made to induce the king to remove the governor.
      Accordingly, in 1740, he was compelled to resign his office, and
      Grandfather’s chair into the bargain, to Mr. Shirley.

“WILLIAM SHIRLEY,” said Grandfather, “had come from England a few years
      before, and begun to practise law in Boston. You will think, perhaps,
      that, as he had been a lawyer, the new governor used to sit in our great
      chair reading heavy law-books from morning till night. On the contrary, he
      was as stirring and active a governor as Massachusetts ever had. Even Sir
      William Phips hardly equalled him. The first year or two of his
      administration was spent in trying to regulate the currency. But in 1744,
      after a peace of more than thirty years, war broke out between France and
      England.”

“Not exactly, Charley,” said Grandfather; “though you have made a pretty
      shrewd conjecture. He planned, in 1745, an expedition against Louisburg.
      This was a fortified city, on the island of Cape Breton, near Nova Scotia.
      Its walls were of immense height and strength, and were defended by
      hundreds of heavy cannon. It was the strongest fortress which the French
      possessed in America; and if the king of France had guessed Governor
      Shirley’s intentions, he would have sent all the ships he could muster to
      protect it.”

As the siege of Louisburg was one of the most remarkable events that ever
      the inhabitants of New England were engaged in, Grandfather endeavored to
      give his auditors a lively idea of the spirit with which they set about
      it. We shall call his description The Provincial Muster.

The expedition against Louisburg first began to be thought of in the month
      of January. From that time the governor’s chair was continually surrounded
      by councillors, representatives, clergymen, captains, pilots, and all
      manner of people, with whom he consulted about this wonderful project.

First of all, it was necessary to provide men and arms. The Legislature
      immediately sent out a huge quantity of paper-money, with which, as if by
      magic spell, the governor hoped to get possession of all the old cannon,
      powder and balls, rusty swords and muskets, and everything else that would
      be serviceable in killing Frenchmen. Drums were beaten in all the villages
      of Massachusetts to enlist soldiers for the service. Messages were sent to
      the other governors of New England, and to New York and Pennsylvania,
      entreating them to unite in this crusade against the French. All these
      provinces agreed to give what assistance they could.

But there was one very important thing to be decided. Who shall be the
      general of this great army? Peace had continued such an unusual length of
      time that there was now less military experience among the colonists than
      at any former period. The old Puritans had always kept their weapons
      bright, and were never destitute of warlike captains who were skilful in
      assault or defence. But the swords of their descendents had grown rusty by
      disuse. There was nobody in New England that knew anything about sieges or
      any other regular fighting. The only persons at all acquainted with
      warlike business were a few elderly men, who had hunted Indians through
      the underbrush of the forest in old Governor Dummer’s War.

In this dilemma Governor Shirley fixed upon a wealthy merchant, named
      William Pepperell, who was pretty well known and liked among the people.
      As to military skill, he had no more of it than his neighbors. But, as the
      governor urged him very pressingly, Mr. Pepperell consented to shut up his
      ledger, gird on a sword, and assume the title of general.

Meantime, what a hubbub was raised by this scheme! Rub-a-dub-dub!
      rub-a-dub-dub! The rattle of drums, beaten out of all manner of time, was
      heard above every other sound.

Nothing now was so valuable as arms, of whatever style and fashion they
      might be. The bellows blew, and the hammer clanged continually upon the
      anvil, while the blacksmiths were repairing the broken weapons of other
      wars. Doubtless some of the soldiers lugged out those enormous, heavy
      muskets which used to be fired, with rests, in the time of the early
      Puritans. Great horse-pistols, too, were found, which would go off with a
      bang like a cannon. Old cannon, with touchholes almost as big as their
      muzzles, were looked upon as inestimable treasures. Pikes which, perhaps,
      had been handled by Miles Standish’s soldiers, now made their appearance
      again. Many a young man ransacked the garret and brought forth his
      great-grandfather’s sword, corroded with rust and stained with the blood
      of King Philip’s War.

Never had there been such an arming as this, when a people, so long
      peaceful, rose to the war with the best weapons that they could lay their
      hands upon. And still the drums were heard—rub-a-dub-dub!
      rub-a-dub-dub!—in all the towns and villages; and louder and more
      numerous grew the trampling footsteps of the recruits that marched behind.

And now the army began to gather into Boston. Tan, lanky, awkward fellows
      came in squads, and companies, and regiments, swaggering along, dressed in
      their brown homespun clothes and blue yarn stockings. They stooped as if
      they still had hold of the plough-handles, and marched without any time or
      tune. Hither they came, from the cornfields, from the clearing in the
      forest, from the blacksmith’s forge, from the carpenter’s workshop, and
      from the shoemaker’s seat. They were an army of rough faces and sturdy
      frames. A trained officer of Europe would have laughed at them till his
      sides had ached. But there was a spirit in their bosoms which is more
      essential to soldiership than to wear red coats and march in stately ranks
      to the sound of regular music.

Still was heard the beat of the drum,—rub-a-dub-dub! And now a host
      of three or four thousand men had found their way to Boston. Little quiet
      was there then! Forth scampered the school-boys, shouting behind the
      drums. The whole town, the whole land, was on fire with war.

After the arrival of the troops, they were probably reviewed upon the
      Common. We may imagine Governor Shirley and General Pepperell riding
      slowly along the line, while the drummers beat strange old tunes, like
      psalm-tunes, and all the officers and soldiers put on their most warlike
      looks. It would have been a terrible sight for the Frenchmen, could they
      but have witnessed it!

At length, on the 24th of March, 1745, the army gave a parting shout, and
      set sail from Boston in ten or twelve vessels which had been hired by the
      governor. A few days afterwards an English fleet, commanded by Commodore
      Peter Warren, sailed also for Louisburg to assist the provincial army. So
      now, after all this bustle of preparation, the town and province were left
      in stillness and repose.

But stillness and repose, at such a time of anxious expectation, are hard
      to bear. The hearts of the old people and women sunk within them when they
      reflected what perils they had sent their sons, and husbands, and brothers
      to encounter. The boys loitered heavily to School, missing the
      rub-a-dub-dub and the trampling march, in the rear of which they had so
      lately run and shouted. All the ministers prayed earnestly in their
      pulpits for a blessing on the army of New England. In every family, when
      the good man lifted up his heart in domestic worship, the burden of his
      petition was for the safety of those dear ones who were fighting under the
      walls of Louisburg.

Governor Shirley all this time was probably in an ecstasy of impatience.
      He could not sit still a moment. He found no quiet, not even in
      Grandfather’s chair; but hurried to and fro, and up and down the staircase
      of the Province House. Now he mounted to the cupola and looked seaward,
      straining his eyes to discover if there were a sail upon the horizon. Now
      he hastened down the stairs, and stood beneath the portal, on the red
      free-stone steps, to receive some mud-bespattered courier, from whom he
      hoped to hear tidings of the army. A few weeks after the departure of the
      troops, Commodore Warren sent a small vessel to Boston with two French
      prisoners. One of them was Monsieur Bouladrie, who had been commander of a
      battery outside the walls of Louisburg. The other was the Marquis de la
      Maison Forte, captain of a French frigate which had been taken by
      Commodore Warren’s fleet. These prisoners assured Governor Shirley that
      the fortifications of Louisburg were far too strong ever to be stormed by
      the provincial army.

Day after day and week after week went on. The people grew almost
      heart-sick with anxiety; for the flower of the country was at peril in
      this adventurous expedition. It was now daybreak on the morning of the 3d
      of July.

But hark! what sound is this? The hurried clang of a bell! There is the
      Old North pealing suddenly out!—there the Old South strikes in!—now
      the peal comes from the church in Brattle Street!—the bells of nine
      or ten steeples are all flinging their iron voices at once upon the
      morning breeze! Is it joy, or alarm? There goes the roar of a cannon too!
      A royal salute is thundered forth. And now we hear the loud exulting shout
      of a multitude assembled in the street. Huzza! huzza! Louisburg has
      surrendered! Huzza!

“O Grandfather, how glad I should have been to live in those times!” cried
      Charley. “And what reward did the king give to General Pepperell and
      Governor Shirley?”

“He made Pepperell a baronet; so that he was now to be called Sir William
      Pepperell,” replied Grandfather. “He likewise appointed both Pepperell and
      Shirley to be colonels in the royal army. These rewards, and higher ones,
      were well deserved; for this was the greatest triumph that the English met
      with in the whole course of that war. General Pepperell became a man of
      great fame. I have seen a full-length portrait of him, representing him in
      a splendid scarlet uniform, standing before the walls of Louisburg, while
      several bombs are falling through the air.”

“But did the country gain any real good by the conquest of Louisburg?”
       asked Laurence. “Or was all the benefit reaped by Pepperell and Shirley?”

“The English Parliament,” replied Grandfather, “agreed to pay the
      colonists for all the expenses of the siege. Accordingly, in 1749, two
      hundred and fifteen chests of Spanish dollars and one hundred casks of
      copper coin were brought from England to Boston. The whole amount was
      about a million of dollars. Twenty-seven carts and trucks carried this
      money from the wharf to the provincial treasury. Was not this a pretty
      liberal reward?”

“The mothers of the young men who were killed at the siege of Louisburg
      would not have thought it so,” said Laurence.

“No; Laurence,” rejoined Grandfather; “and every warlike achievement
      involves an amount of physical and moral evil, for which all the gold in
      the Spanish mines would not be the slightest recompense. But we are to
      consider that this siege was one of the occasions on which the colonists
      tested their ability for war, and thus were prepared for the great contest
      of the Revolution. In that point of view, the valor of our forefathers was
      its own reward.”

Grandfather went on to say that the success of the expedition against
      Louisburg induced Shirley and Pepperell to form a scheme for conquering
      Canada, This plan, however, was not carried into execution.

In the year 1746 great terror was excited by the arrival of a formidable
      French fleet upon the coast It was commanded by the Duke d’Anville, and
      consisted of forty ships of war, besides vessels with soldiers on board.
      With this force the French intended to retake Louisburg, and afterwards to
      ravage the whole of New England. Many people were ready to give up the
      country for lost.

But the hostile fleet met with so many disasters and losses by storm and
      shipwreck, that the Duke d’Anville is said to have poisoned himself in
      despair. The officer next in command threw himself upon his sword and
      perished. Thus deprived of their commanders, the remainder of the ships
      returned to France. This was as great a deliverance for New England as
      that which Old England had experienced in the days of Queen Elizabeth,
      when the Spanish Armada was wrecked upon her coast.

“In 1747,” proceeded Grandfather, “Governor Shirley was driven from the
      Province House, not by a hostile fleet and army, but by a mob of the
      Boston people. They were so incensed at the conduct of the British
      Commodore Knowles, who had impressed some of their fellow-citizens, that
      several thousands of them surrounded the council chamber and threw stones
      and brickbats into the windows. The governor attempted to pacify them; but
      not succeeding, he thought it necessary to leave the town and take refuge
      within the walls of Castle William. Quiet was not restored until Commodore
      Knowles had sent back the impressed men. This affair was a flash of spirit
      that might have warned the English not to venture upon any oppressive
      measures against their colonial brethren.”

Peace being declared between France and England in 1748, the governor had
      now an opportunity to sit at his ease in Grandfather’s chair. Such repose,
      however, appears not to have suited his disposition; for in the following
      year he went to England, and thence was despatched to France on public
      business. Meanwhile, as Shirley had not resigned his office,
      Lieu-tenant-Governor Phips acted as chief magistrate in his stead.

IN the early twilight of Thanksgiving Eve came Laurence, and Clara, and
      Charley, and little Alice, hand in hand, and stood in a semicircle round
      Grandfather’s chair. They had been joyous throughout that day of
      festivity, mingling together in all kinds of play, so that the house had
      echoed with their airy mirth.

Grandfather, too, had been happy though not mirthful. He felt that this
      was to be set down as one of the good Thanksgivings of his life. In truth,
      all his former Thanksgivings had borne their part in the present one; for
      his years of infancy, and youth, and manhood, with their blessings and
      their griefs, had flitted before him while he sat silently in the great
      chair. Vanished scenes had been pictured in the air. The forms of departed
      friends had visited him. Voices to be heard no more on earth had sent an
      echo from the infinite and the eternal. These shadows, if such they were,
      seemed almost as real to him as what was actually present,—as the
      merry shouts and laughter of the children,—as their figures, dancing
      like sunshine before his eyes.

He felt that the past was not taken from him. The happiness of former days
      was a possession forever. And there was something in the mingled sorrow of
      his lifetime that became akin to happiness, after being long treasured in
      the depths of his heart. There it underwent a change, and grew more
      precious than pure gold.

And now came the children, somewhat aweary with their wild play, and
      sought the quiet enjoyment of Grandfather’s talk. The good old gentleman
      rubbed his eyes and smiled round upon them all. He was glad, as most aged
      people are, to find that he was yet of consequence, and could give
      pleasure to the world. After being so merry all day long, did these
      children desire to hear his sober talk? Oh, then, old Grandfather had yet
      a place to fill among living men,—or at least among boys and girls!

And truly our yellow friend, the cat, lay upon the hearth-rug, basking in
      the warmth of the fire, pricking up her ears, and turning her head from
      the children to Grandfather, and from Grandfather to the children as if
      she felt herself very sympathetic with them all. A loud purr, like the
      singing of a tea-kettle or the hum of a spinning-wheel, testified that she
      was as comfortable and happy as a cat could be. For puss had feasted; and
      therefore, like Grandfather and the children, had kept a good
      Thanksgiving.

“Does pussy want to hear me?” said Grandfathers smiling. “Well, we must
      please pussy, if we can.”

And so he took up the history of the chair from the epoch of the peace of
      1748. By one of the provisions of the treaty, Louisburg, which the
      New-Englanders had been at so much pains to take, was restored to the King
      of France.

The French were afraid that, unless their colonies should be better
      defended than heretofore, another war might deprive them of the whole.
      Almost as soon as peace was declared, therefore, they began to build
      strong fortifications in the interior of North America. It was strange to
      behold these warlike castles on the banks of solitary lakes and far in the
      midst of woods. The Indian, paddling his birch canoe on Lake Champlain,
      looked up at the high ramparts of Ticonderoga, stone piled on stone,
      bristling with cannon, and the white flag of France floating above. There
      were similar fortifications on Lake Ontario, and near the great Falls of
      Niagara, and at the sources of the Ohio River. And all around these forts
      and castles lay the eternal forest, and the roll of the drum died away in
      those deep solitudes.

The truth was, that the French intended to build forts all the way from
      Canada to Louisiana. They would then have had a wall of military strength
      at the back of the English settlements so as completely to hem them in.
      The King of England considered the building of these forts as a sufficient
      cause of war, which was accordingly commenced in 1754.

“Governor Shirley,” said Grandfather, “had returned to Boston in 1753.
      While in Paris he had married a second wife, a young French girl, and now
      brought her to the Province House. But when war was breaking out it was
      impossible for such a bustling man to stay quietly at home, sitting in our
      old chair, with his wife and children, round about him. He therefore
      obtained a command in the English forces.”

“He stayed at home,” said Grandfather, “and was general of the militia.
      The veteran regiments of the English army which were now sent across the
      Atlantic would have scorned to fight under the orders of an old American
      merchant. And now began what aged people call the old French War. It would
      be going too far astray from the history of our chair to tell you one half
      of the battles that were fought. I cannot even allow myself to describe
      the bloody defeat of General Braddock, near the sources of the Ohio River,
      in 1755. But I must not omit to mention that, when the English general was
      mortally wounded and his army routed, the remains of it were preserved by
      the skill and valor of George Washington.”

At the mention of this illustrious name the children started as if a
      sudden sunlight had gleamed upon the history of their country, now that
      the great deliverer had arisen above the horizon.

Among all the events of the old French War, Grandfather thought that there
      was none more interesting than the removal of the inhabitants of Acadia.
      From the first settlement of this ancient province of the French, in 1604,
      until the present time, its people could scarcely ever know what kingdom
      held dominion over them. They were a peaceful race, taking no delight in
      warfare, and caring nothing for military renown. And yet, in every war,
      their region was infested with iron-hearted soldiers, both French and
      English, who fought one another for the privilege of ill-treating these
      poor, harmless Acadians. Sometimes the treaty of peace made them subjects
      of one king, sometimes of another.

At the peace of 1748 Acadia had been ceded to England. But the French
      still claimed a large portion of it, and built forts for its defence. In
      1755 these forts were taken, and the whole of Acadia was conquered by
      three thousand men from Massachusetts, under the command of General
      Winslow. The inhabitants were accused of supplying the French with
      provisions, and of doing other things that violated their neutrality.

“These accusations were probably true,” observed Grandfather; “for the
      Acadians were descended from the French, and had the same friendly
      feelings towards them that the people of Massachusetts had for the
      English. But their punishment was severe. The English determined to tear
      these poor people from their native homes and scatter them abroad.”

The Acadians were about seven thousand in number. A considerable part of
      them were made prisoners, and transported to the English colonies. All
      their dwellings and churches were burned, their cattle were killed, and
      the whole country was laid waste, so that none of them might find shelter
      or food in their old homes after the departure of the English. One
      thousand of the prisoners were sent to Massachusetts; and Grandfather
      allowed his fancy to follow them thither, and tried to give his auditors
      an idea of their situation.

A sad day it was for the poor Acadians when the armed soldiers drove them,
      at the point of the bayonet, down to the sea-shore. Very sad were they,
      likewise, while tossing upon the ocean in the crowded transport vessels.
      But methinks it must have been sadder still when they were landed on the
      Long Wharf in Boston, and left to themselves on a foreign strand.

Then, probably, they huddled together and looked into one another’s faces
      for the comfort which was not there. Hitherto they had been confined on
      board of separate vessels, so that they could not tell whether their
      relatives and friends were prisoners along with them. But now, at least,
      they could tell that many had been left behind or transported to other
      regions.

Now a desolate wife might be heard calling for her husband. He, alas! had
      gone, she knew not whither; or perhaps had fled into the woods of Acadia,
      and had now returned to weep over the ashes of their dwelling.

An aged widow was crying out in a querulous, lamentable tone for her son,
      whose affectionate toil had supported her for many a. year. He was not in
      the crowd of exiles; and what could this aged widow do but sink down and
      die? Young men and maidens, whose hearts had been torn asunder by
      separation, had hoped, during the voyage, to meet their beloved ones at
      its close. Now they began to feel that they were separated forever. And
      perhaps a lonesome little girl, a golden-haired child of five years old,
      the very picture of our little Alice, was weeping and wailing for her
      mother, and found not a soul to give her a kind word.

Oh, how many broken bonds of affection were here! Country lost,—friends
      lost,—their rural wealth of cottage, field, and herds all lost
      together! Every tie between these poor exiles and the world seemed to be
      cut off at once. They must have regretted that they had not died before
      their exile; for even the English would not have been so pitiless as to
      deny them graves in their native soil. The dead were happy; for they were
      not exiles!

While they thus stood upon the wharf, the curiosity and inquisitiveness of
      the New England people would naturally lead them into the midst of the
      poor Acadians. Prying busybodies thrust their heads into the circle
      wherever two or three of the exiles were conversing together. How puzzled
      did they look at the outlandish sound of the French tongue! There were
      seen the New England women, too. They had just come out of their warm,
      safe homes, where everything was regular and comfortable, and where their
      husbands and children would be with them at nightfall. Surely they could
      pity the wretched wives and mothers of Acadia! Or aid the sign of the
      cross which the Acadians continually made upon their breasts, and which
      was abhorred by the descendants of the Puritans,—did that sign
      exclude all pity?

Among the spectators, too, was the noisy brood of Boston school-boys, who
      came running, with laughter and shouts, to gaze at this crowd of oddly
      dressed foreigners. At first they danced and capered around them, full of
      merriment and mischief. But the despair of the Acadians soon had its
      effect upon these thoughtless lads, and melted them into tearful sympathy.

At a little distance from the throng might be seen the wealthy and pompous
      merchants whose warehouses stood on Long Wharf. It was difficult to touch
      these rich men’s hearts; for they had all the comforts of the world at
      their command; and when they walked abroad their feelings were seldom
      moved, except by the roughness of the pavement irritating their gouty
      toes. Leaning upon their gold-headed canes, they watched the scene with an
      aspect of composure. But let us hype they distributed some of their
      superfluous coin among these hapless exiles to purchase food and a night’s
      lodging.

After standing a long time at the end of the wharf, gazing seaward, as if
      to catch a glimpse of their lost Acadia, the strangers began to stray into
      the town.

They went, we will suppose, in parties and groups, here a hundred, there a
      score, there ten, there three or four, who possessed some bond of unity
      among themselves. Here and there was one who, utterly desolate, stole away
      by himself, seeking no companionship.

Whither did they go? I imagine them wandering about the streets, telling
      the townspeople, in outlandish, unintelligible words, that no earthly
      affliction ever equalled what had befallen them. Man’s brotherhood with
      man was sufficient to make the New-Englanders understand this language.
      The strangers wanted food. Some of them sought hospitality at the doors of
      the stately mansions which then stood in the vicinity of Hanover Street
      and the North Square. Others were applicants at the humble wooden
      tenements, where dwelt the petty shopkeepers and mechanics. Pray Heaven
      that no family in Boston turned one of these poor exiles from their door!
      It would be a reproach upon New England,—a crime worthy of heavy
      retribution,—if the aged women and children, or even the strong men,
      were allowed to feel the pinch of hunger.

Perhaps some of the Acadians, in their aimless wanderings through the
      town, found themselves near a large brick edifice, which was fenced in
      from the street by an iron railing, wrought with fantastic figures. They
      saw a flight of red freestone steps ascending to a portal, above which was
      a balcony and balustrade. Misery and desolation give men the right of free
      passage everywhere. Let us suppose, then, that they mounted the flight of
      steps and passed into the Province House. Making their way into one of the
      apartments, they beheld a richly-clad gentleman, seated in a stately
      chair, with gilding upon the carved work of its back, and a gilded lion’s
      head at the summit. This was Governor Shirley, meditating upon matters of
      war and state, in Grandfather’s chair!

If such an incident did happen, Shirley, reflecting what a ruin of
      peaceful and humble hopes had been wrought by the cold policy of the
      statesman and the iron band of the warrior, might have drawn a deep moral
      from it. It should have taught him that the poor man’s hearth is sacred,
      and that armies and nations have no right to violate it. It should have
      made him feel that England’s triumph and increased dominion could not
      compensate to mankind nor atone to Heaven for the ashes of a single
      Acadian cottage. But it is not thus that statesmen and warriors moralize.

“Grandfather,” cried Laurence, with emotion trembling in his voice, “did
      iron-hearted War itself ever do so hard and cruel a thing as this before?”

“You have read in history, Laurence, of whole regions wantonly laid
      waste,” said Grandfather. “In the removal of the Acadians, the troops were
      guilty of no cruelty or outrage, except what was inseparable from the
      measure.”

Little Alice, whose eyes had all along been brimming full of tears, now
      burst forth a-sobbing; for Grandfather had touched her sympathies more
      than he intended.

“To think of a whole people homeless in the world!” said Clara, with
      moistened eyes. “There never was anything so sad!”

“It was their own fault!” cried Charley, energetically. “Why did not they
      fight for the country where they were born? Then, if the worst had
      happened to them, they could only have been killed and buried there. They
      would not have been exiles then.”

“Certainly their lot was as hard as death,” said Grandfather. “All that
      could be done for them in the English provinces was, to send them to the
      almshouses, or bind them out to taskmasters. And this was the fate of
      persons who had possessed a comfortable property in their native country.
      Some of them found means to embark for France; but though it was the land
      of their forefathers, it must have been a foreign land to them. Those who
      remained behind always cherished a belief that the King of France would
      never make peace with England till his poor Acadians were restored to
      their country and their homes.”

“Alas! my dear Clara,” said Grandfather, “it is improbable that the
      slightest whisper of the woes of Acadia ever reached the ears of Louis XV.
      The exiles grew old in the British provinces, and never saw Acadia again.
      Their descendants remain among us to this day. They have forgotten the
      language of their ancestors, and probably retain no tradition of their
      misfortunes. But, methinks, if I were an American poet, I would choose
      Acadia for the subject of my song.”

Since Grandfather first spoke these words, the most famous of American
      poets has drawn sweet tears from all of us by his beautiful poem
      Evangeline.

And now, having thrown a gentle gloom around the Thanksgiving fireside by
      a story that made the children feel the blessing of a secure and peaceful
      hearth, Grandfather put off the other events of the old French War till
      the next evening.

IN the twilight of the succeeding eve, when the red beams of the fire were
      dancing upon the wall, the children besought Grandfather to tell them what
      had next happened to the old chair.

“Our chair,” said Grandfather, “stood all this time in the Province House.
      But Governor Shirley had seldom an opportunity to repose within its arms.
      He was leading his troops through the forest, or sailing in a flat-boat on
      Lake Ontario, or sleeping in his tent, while the awful cataract of Niagara
      sent its roar through his dreams. At one period, in the early part of the
      war, Shirley had the chief command of all the king’s forces in America.”

“I rather imagine,” replied Grandfather, “that she remained in Boston.
      This lady, I suppose, had our chair all to herself, and used to sit in it
      during those brief intervals when a young Frenchwoman can be quiet enough
      to sit in a chair. The people of Massachusetts were never fond of Governor
      Shirley’s young French wife. They had a suspicion that she betrayed the
      military plans of the English to the generals of the French armies.”

“Probably not,” said Grandfather. “But the mere suspicion did Shirley a
      great deal of harm. Partly, perhaps, for this reason, but much more on
      account of his inefficiency as a general, he was deprived of his command
      in 1756, and recalled to England. He never afterwards made any figure in
      public life.”

As Grandfather’s chair had no locomotive properties, and did not even run
      on castors, it cannot be supposed to have marched in person to the old
      French War. But Grandfather delayed its momentous history while he touched
      briefly upon some of the bloody battles, sieges, and onslaughts, the
      tidings of which kept continually coming to the ears of the old
      inhabitants of Boston. The woods of the North were populous with fighting
      men. All the Indian tribes uplifted their tomahawks, and took part either
      with the French or English. The rattle of musketry and roar of cannon
      disturbed the ancient quiet of the forest, and actually drove the bears
      and other wild beasts to the more cultivated portion of the country in the
      vicinity of the seaports. The children felt as if they were transported
      back to those forgotten times, and that the couriers from the army, with
      the news of a battle lost or won, might even now be heard galloping
      through the streets. Grandfather told them about the battle of Lake George
      in 1755, when the gallant Colonel Williams, a Massachusetts officer, was
      slain, with many of his countrymen. But General Johnson and General Lyman,
      with their army, drove back the enemy and mortally wounded the French
      leader, who was called the Baron Dieskau. A gold watch, pilfered from the
      poor baron, is still in existence, and still marks each moment of time
      without complaining of weariness, although its hands have been in motion
      ever since the hour of battle.

In the first years of the war there were many disasters on the English
      side. Among these was the loss of Fort Oswego in 1756, and of Fort William
      Henry in the following year. But the greatest misfortune that befell the
      English during the whole war was the repulse of General Abercrombie, with
      his army, from the ramparts of Ticonderoga in 1758. He attempted to storm
      the walls; but a terrible conflict ensued, in which more than two thousand
      Englishmen and New-Englanders were killed or wounded. The slain soldiers
      now lie buried around that ancient fortress. When the plough passes over
      the soil, it turns up here and there a mouldering bone.

Up to this period, none of the English generals had shown any military
      talent. Shirley, the Earl of Loudon, and General Abercrombie had each held
      the chief command at different times; but not one of them had won a single
      important triumph for the British arms. This ill success was not owing to
      the want of means: for, in 1758, General Abercrombie had fifty thousand
      soldiers under his command. But the French general, the famous Marquis de
      Montcalm, possessed a great genius for war, and had something within him
      that taught him how battles were to be won.

At length, in 1759, Sir Jeffrey Amherst was appointed commander-in-chief
      of all the British forces in America. He was a man of ability and a
      skilful soldier. A plan was now formed for accomplishing that object which
      had so long been the darling wish of the New-Englanders, and which their
      fathers had so many times attempted. This was the conquest of Canada.

Three separate armies were to enter Canada from different quarters. One of
      the three, commanded by General Prideaux, was to embark on Lake Ontario
      and proceed to Montreal. The second, at the head of which was Sir Jeffrey
      Amherst himself, was destined to reach the river St. Lawrence by the way
      of Lake Champlain, and then go down the river to meet the third army. This
      last, led by General Wolfe, was to enter the St. Lawrence from the sea and
      ascend the river to Quebec. It is to Wolfe and his army that England owes
      one of the most splendid triumphs ever written in her history.

Grandfather described the siege of Quebec, and told how Wolfe led his
      soldiers up a rugged and lofty precipice, that rose from the shore of the
      river to the plain on which the city stood. This bold adventure was
      achieved in the darkness of night. At daybreak tidings were carried to the
      Marquis de Montcalm that the English army was waiting to give him battle
      on the Plains of Abraham. This brave French general ordered his drums to
      strike up, and immediately marched to encounter Wolfe.

He marched to his own death. The battle was the most fierce and terrible
      that had ever been fought in America. General Wolfe was at the head of his
      soldiers, and, while encouraging them onward, received a mortal wound. He
      reclined against a stone in the agonies of death; but it seemed as if his
      spirit could not pass away while the fight yet raged so doubtfully.
      Suddenly a shout came pealing across the battle-field. “They flee! they
      flee!” and, for a moment, Wolfe lifted his languid head. “Who flee?” he
      inquired.

“The French,” replied an officer. “Then I die satisfied!” said Wolfe, and
      expired in the arms of victory.

“If ever a warrior’s death were glorious, Wolfe’s was so,” said
      Grandfather; and his eye kindled, though he was a man of peaceful thoughts
      and gentle spirit. “His life-blood streamed to baptize the soil which he
      had added to the dominion of Britain. His dying breath was mingled with
      his army’s shout of victory.”

“Oh, it was a good death to die!” cried Charley, with glistening eyes.
      “Was it not a good death, Laurence?”

Laurence made no reply; for his heart burned within him, as the picture of
      Wolfe, dying on the blood-stained field of victory, arose to his
      imagination; and yet he had a deep inward consciousness that, after all,
      there was a truer glory than could thus be won.

“There were other battles in Canada after Wolfe’s victory,” resumed
      Grandfather; “but we may consider the old French War as having terminated
      with this great event. The treaty of peace, however, was not signed until
      1763. The terms of the treaty were very disadvantageous to the French; for
      all Canada, and all Acadia, and the Island of Cape Breton,—in short,
      all the territories that France and England had been fighting about for
      nearly a hundred years,—were surrendered to the English.”

Grandfather mentioned two other important events. The first was the great
      fire of Boston in 1760, when the glare from nearly three hundred
      buildings, all in flames at once, shone through the windows of the
      Province House, and threw a fierce lustre upon the gilded foliage and
      lion’s head of our old chair. The second event was the proclamation, in
      the same year, of George III. as King of Great Britain. The blast of the
      trumpet sounded from the balcony of the Town House, and awoke the echoes
      far and wide, as if to challenge all mankind to dispute King George’s
      title.

Seven times, as the successive monarchs of Britain ascended the throne,
      the trumpet peal of proclamation had been heard by those who sat in our
      venerable chair. But when the next king put on his father’s crown, no
      trumpet peal proclaimed it to New England. Long before that day America
      had shaken off the royal government.

NOW THAT Grandfather had fought through the old French War, in which our
      chair made no very distinguished figure, he thought it high time to tell
      the children some of the more private history of that praiseworthy old
      piece of furniture.

“In 1757,” said Grandfather, “after Shirley had been summoned to England,
      Thomas Pownall was appointed governor of Massachusetts. He was a gay and
      fashionable English gentleman, who had spent much of his life in London,
      but had a considerable acquaintance with America. The new governor appears
      to have taken no active part in the war that was going on; although, at
      one period, he talked of marching against the enemy at the head of his
      company of cadets. But, on the whole, he probably concluded that it was
      more befitting a governor to remain quietly in our chair, reading the
      newspapers and official documents.”

“They found no fault with him,” replied Grandfather. “It was no time to
      quarrel with the governor when the utmost harmony was required in order to
      defend the country against the French. But Pownall did not remain long in
      Massachusetts. In 1759 he was sent to be governor of South Carolina. In
      thus exchanging one government for another, I suppose he felt no regret,
      except at the necessity of leaving Grandfather’s chair behind him.”

“It appears to me,” said Laurence, giving the rein to his fancy, “that the
      fate of this ancient chair was, somehow or other, mysteriously connected
      with the fortunes of old Massachusetts. If Governor Pownall had put it
      aboard the vessel in which he sailed for South Carolina, she would
      probably have lain wind-bound in Boston Harbor. It was ordained that the
      chair should not be taken away. Don’t you think so, Grandfather?”

“It was kept here for Grandfather and me to sit in together,” said little
      Alice, “and for Grandfather to tell stories about.”

“And Grandfather is very glad of such a companion and such a theme,” said
      the old gentleman, with a smile. “Well, Laurence, if our oaken chair, like
      the wooden palladium of Troy, was connected with the country’s fate, yet
      there appears to have been no supernatural obstacle to its removal from
      the Province House. In 1760 Sir Francis Bernard, who had been’ governor of
      New Jersey, was appointed to the same office in Massachusetts. He looked
      at the old chair, and thought it quite too shabby to keep company with a
      new set of mahogany chairs and an aristocratic sofa which had just arrived
      from London. He therefore ordered it to be put away in the garret.”

The children were loud in their exclamations against this irreverent
      conduct of Sir Francis Bernard. But Grandfather defended him as well as he
      could. He observed that it was then thirty years since the chair had been
      beautified by Governor Belcher. Most of the gilding was worn off by the
      frequent scourings which it had undergone beneath the hands of a black
      slave. The damask cushion, once so splendid, was now squeezed out of all
      shape, and absolutely in tatters, so many were the ponderous gentlemen who
      had deposited their weight upon it during these thirty years.

Moreover, at a council held by the Earl of Loudon with the governors of
      New England in 1757, his lordship, in a moment of passion, had kicked over
      the chair with his military boot. By this unprovoked and unjustifiable
      act, our venerable friend had suffered a fracture of one of its rungs.

“But,” said Grandfather, “our chair, after all, was not destined to spend
      the remainder of its days in the inglorious obscurity of a garret. Thomas
      Hutchinson, Lieutenant-governor of the province, was told of Sir Francis
      Bernard’s design. This gentleman was more familiar with the history of New
      England than any other man alive. He knew all the adventures and
      vicissitudes through which the old chair had passed, and could have told
      as accurately as your own Grandfather who were the personages that had
      occupied it. Often, while visiting at the Province House, he had eyed the
      chair with admiration, and felt a longing desire to become the possessor
      of it. He now waited upon Sir Francis Bernard, and easily obtained leave
      to carry it home.”

“No,” answered Grandfather. “What Mr. Hutchinson desired was, to restore
      the chair as much as possible to its original aspect, such as it had
      appeared when it was first made out of the Earl of Lincoln’s oak-tree. For
      this purpose he ordered it to be well scoured with soap and sand and
      polished with wax, and then provided it with a substantial leather
      cush-ion. When all was completed to his mind he sat down in the old chair,
      and began to write his History of Massachusetts.”

“Oh, that was a bright thought in Mr. Hutchinson,” exclaimed Laurence.
      “And no doubt the dim figures of the former possessors of the chair
      flitted around him as he wrote, and inspired him with a knowledge of all
      that they had done and suffered while on earth.”

“Why, my dear Laurence,” replied Grandfather, smiling, “if Mr. Hutchinson
      was favored with ally such extraordinary inspiration, he made but a poor
      use of it in his history; for a duller piece of composition never came
      from any man’s pen. However, he was accurate, at least, though far from
      possessing the brilliancy or philosophy of Mr. Bancroft.”

“But if Hutchinson knew the history of the chair,” rejoined Laurence, “his
      heart must have been stirred by it.”

“It must, indeed,” said Grandfather. “It would be entertaining and
      instructive, at the present day, to imagine what were Mr. Hutchinson’s
      thoughts as he looked back upon the long vista of events with which this
      chair was so remarkably connected.”

And Grandfather allowed his fancy to shape out an image of
      Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson, sitting in an evening reverie by his
      fireside, and meditating on the changes that had slowly passed around the
      chair.

A devoted Monarchist, Hutchinson would heave no sigh for the subversion of
      the original republican government, the purest that the world had seen,
      with which the colony began its existence. While reverencing the grim and
      stern old Puritans as the founders of his native land, he would not wish
      to recall them from their graves, nor to awaken again that king-resisting
      spirit which he imagined to be laid asleep with them forever. Winthrop,
      Dudley, Bellingham, Endicott, Leverett, and Bradstreet,—all these
      had had their day. Ages might come and go, but never again would the
      people’s suffrages place a republican governor in their ancient chair of
      state.

Coming down to the epoch of the second charter, Hutchinson thought of the
      ship-carpenter Phips springing from the lowest of the people and attaining
      to the loftiest station in the land. But he smiled to perceive that this
      governor’s example would awaken no turbulent ambition in the lower orders;
      for it was a king’s gracious boon alone that made the ship-carpenter a
      ruler. Hutchinson rejoiced to mark the gradual growth of an aristocratic
      class, to whom the common people, as in duty bound, were learning humbly
      to resign the honors, emoluments, and authority of state. He saw—or
      else deceived himself—that, throughout this epoch, the people’s
      disposition to self-government had been growing weaker through long
      disuse, and now existed only as a faint traditionary feeling.

The lieutenant-governor’s reverie had now come down to the period at which
      he himself was sitting in the historic chair. He endeavored to throw his
      glance forward over the coming years. There, probably, he saw visions of
      hereditary rank for himself and other aristocratic colonists. He saw the
      fertile fields of New England proportioned out among a few great
      landholders, and descending by entail from generation to generation. He
      saw the people a race of tenantry, dependent on their lords. He saw stars,
      garters, coronets, and castles.

“But,” added Grandfather, turning to Laurence, “the lieutenant-governor’s
      castles were built nowhere but among the red embers of the fire before
      which he was sitting. And, just as he had constructed a baronial residence
      for himself and his posterity, the fire rolled down upon the hearth and
      crumbled it to ashes!”

Grandfather now looked at his watch, which hung within a beautiful little
      ebony temple, supported by four Ionic columns. He then laid his hand on
      the golden locks of little Alice, whose head had sunk down upon the arm of
      our illustrious chair.

“To bed, to bed, dear child!” said he. “Grandfather has put you to sleep
      already by his stories about these FAMOUS OLD PEOPLE.”

AT a consultation, held between Colonel Winslow and Captain Murray, [of
      the New England forces, charged with the duty of exiling the Acadians,] it
      was agreed that a proclamation should be issued at the different
      settlements, requiring the attendance of the people at the respective
      posts on the same day; which proclamation should be so ambiguous in its
      nature that the object for which they were to assemble could not be
      discerned, and so peremptory in its terms as to ensure implicit obedience.
      This instrument, having been drafted and approved, was distributed
      according to the original plan. That which was addressed to the people
      inhabiting the country now comprised within the limits of King’s County,
      was as follows:—

“To the inhabitants of the District of Grand Pre, Minas, River Canard,
      &c.; as well ancient, as young men and lads:

“Whereas, his Excellency the Governor has instructed us of his late
      resolution, respecting the matter proposed to the inhabitants, and has
      ordered us to communicate the same in person, his Excellency being
      desirous that each of them should be fully satisfied of his Majesty’s
      intentions, which he has also ordered us to communicate to you, such as
      they have been given to him. We, therefore, order and strictly enjoin, by
      these presents, all of the inhabitants, as well of the above-named
      district as of all the other Districts, both old men and young men, as
      well as all the lads of ten years of age, to attend at the Church at Grand
      Pre, on Friday, the fifth instant, at three of the clock in the afternoon,
      that we may impart to them what we are ordered to communicate to them;
      declaring that no excuse will be admitted on any pretence whatever, on
      pain of forfeiting goods and chattels, in default of real estate. Given at
      Grand Pre, 2d September, 1755, and 29th year of his Majesty’s Reign.

In obedience to this summons four hundred and eighteen able-bodied men
      assembled. These being shut into the church (for that, too, had become an
      arsenal), Colonel Winslow placed himself, with his officers, in the
      centre, and addressed them thus:—

“I have received from his Excellency Governor Lawrence, the King’s
      Commission, which I have in my hand; and by his orders you are convened
      together to manifest to you, his Majesty’s final resolution to the French
      inhabitants of this his Province of Nova-Scotia; who, for almost half a
      century, have had more indulgence granted them than any of his subjects in
      any part of his dominions; what use you have made of it you yourselves
      best know. The part of duty I am now upon, though necessary, is very
      disagreeable to my natural make and temper, as I know it must be grievous
      to you, who are of the same species; but it is not my business to
      animadvert but to obey such orders as I receive, and therefore, without
      hesitation, shall deliver you his Majesty’s orders and instructions,
      namely—that your lands and tenements, cattle of all kinds and live
      stock of all sorts, are forfeited to the Crown; with all other your
      effects, saving your money and household goods, and you yourselves to be
      removed from this his Province.

“Thus it is peremptorily his Majesty’s orders that the whole French
      inhabitants of these Districts be removed; and I am, through his Majesty’s
      goodness, directed to allow you liberty to carry off your money and
      household goods, as many as you can without discommoding the vessels you
      go in. I shall do everything in my power that all those goods be secured
      to you, and that you are not molested in carrying them off; also, that
      whole families shall go in the same vessel, and make this remove, which I
      am sensible must give you a great deal of trouble, as easy as his
      Majesty’s service will admit; and hope that, in whatever part of the world
      you may fall, you may be faithful subjects, a peaceable and happy people.
      I must also inform you, that it is his Majesty’s pleasure that you remain
      in security under the inspection and direction of the troops that I have
      the honor to command.”

And he then declared them the King’s prisoners. The whole number of
      persons collected at Grand Pre finally amounted to four hundred and
      eighty-three men, and three hundred and thirty-seven women, heads of
      families; and their sons and daughters, to five hundred and twenty-seven
      of the former, and five hundred and seventy-six of the latter; making in
      the whole one thousand nine hundred and twenty-three souls. Their stock
      consisted of one thousand two hundred and sixty-nine oxen, one thousand
      five hundred and fifty-seven cows, five thousand and seven young cattle,
      four hundred and ninety-three horses, eight thousand six hundred and
      ninety sheep, and four thousand one hundred and ninety-seven hogs. As some
      of these wretched inhabitants escaped to the woods, all possible measures
      were adopted to force them back to captivity. The country was laid waste
      to prevent their subsistence. In the District of Minas alone, there were
      destroyed two hundred and fifty-five houses, two hundred and seventy-six
      barns, one hundred and fifty-five outhouses, eleven mills, and one church;
      and the friends of those who refused to surrender were threatened as the
      victims of their obstinacy.

In short, so operative were the terrors that surrounded them, that of
      twenty-four young men, who deserted from a transport, twenty-two were glad
      to return of themselves, the others being shot by sentinels; and one of
      their friends, who was supposed to have been accessory to their escape,
      was carried on shore to behold the destruction of his house and effects,
      which were burned in his presence, as a punishment for his temerity and
      perfidious aid to his comrades. The prisoners expressed the greatest
      concern at having incurred his Majesty’s displeasure, and in a petition
      addressed to Colonel Winslow intreated him to detain a part of them as
      sureties for the appearance of the rest, who were desirous of visiting
      their families, and consoling them in their distress and misfortunes. To
      comply with this request of holding a few as hostages for the surrender of
      the whole body, was deemed inconsistent with his instructions; but, as
      there could be no objection to allow a small number of them to return to
      their homes, permission was given to them to choose ten for the District
      of Minas (Horton) and ten for the District of Canard (Cornwallis) to whom
      leave of absence was given for one day, and on whose return a similar
      number were indulged in the same manner. They bore their confinement, and
      received their sentence with a fortitude and resignation altogether
      unexpected; but when the hour of embarkation arrived, in which they were
      to leave the land of their nativity forever—to part with their
      friends and relatives, without the hope of ever seeing them again, and to
      be dispersed among strangers, whose language, customs and religion were
      opposed to their own, the weakness of human nature prevailed, and they
      were overpowered with the sense of their miseries. The preparations having
      been all completed, the 10th of September was fixed upon as the day of
      departure. The prisoners were drawn up six deep, and the young men, one
      hundred and sixty-one in number, were ordered to go first on board of the
      vessels. This they instantly and peremptorily refused to do, declaring
      that they would not leave their parents; but expressed a willingness to
      comply with the order, provided they were permitted to embark with their
      families. This request was immediately rejected, and the troops were
      ordered to fix bayonets and advance towards the prisoners, a motion which
      had the effect of producing obedience on the part of the young men, who
      forthwith commenced their march. The road from the chapel to the shore,
      just one mile in length, was crowded with women and children; who, on
      their knees, greeted them as they passed with their tears and their
      blessings, while the prisoners advanced with slow and reluctant steps,
      weeping, praying, and singing hymns. This detachment was followed by the
      seniors, who passed through the same scene of sorrow and distress. In this
      manner was the whole male part of the population of the District of Minas
      put on board the five transports, stationed in the river Gaspereaux, each
      vessel being guarded by six non-commissioned officers, and eighty
      privates. As soon as the other vessels arrived, their wives and children
      followed, and the whole were transported from Nova Scotia. The haste with
      which these measures were carried into execution did not admit of those
      preparations for their comfort, which, if unmerited by their disloyalty,
      were at least due in pity to the severity of their punishment. The hurry,
      confusion, and excitement connected with the embarkation had scarcely
      subsided, when the Provincials were appalled by the work of their own
      hands The novelty and peculiarity of their situation could not but force
      itself upon the attention of even the unreflecting soldiery; stationed in
      the midst of a beautiful and fertile country, they suddenly found
      themselves without a foe to subdue, and without a population to protect.
      The volumes of smoke which the half expiring embers emitted, while they
      marked the site of the peasant’s humble cottage, bore testimony to the
      extent of the work of destruction. For several successive evenings the
      cattle assembled round the smouldering ruins, as if in anxious expectation
      of the return of their masters, while all night long the faithful
      watchdogs of the Neutrals howled over the scene of desolation, and mourned
      alike the hand that had fed, and the house that had sheltered them.

ON THE evening of New-Year’s Day Grandfather was walking to and fro across
      the carpet, listening to the rain which beat hard against the curtained
      windows. The riotous blast shook the casement as if a strong man were
      striving to force his entrance into the comfortable room. With every puff
      of the wind the fire leaped upward from the hearth, laughing and rejoicing
      at the shrieks of the wintry storm.

Meanwhile Grandfather’s chair stood in its customary place by the
      fireside. The bright blaze gleamed upon the fantastic figures of its oaken
      back, and shone through the open work, so that a complete pattern was
      thrown upon the opposite side of the room. Sometimes, for a moment or two,
      the shadow remained immovable, as if it were painted on the wall. Then all
      at once it began to quiver, and leap, and dance with a frisky motion.
      Anon, seeming to remember that these antics were unworthy of such a
      dignified and venerable chair, it suddenly stood still. But soon it began
      to dance anew.

And she ran to the wall and tried to catch hold of the flickering shadow;
      for, to children of five years old, a shadow seems almost as real as a
      substance.

If the children had been looking at Grandfather, they would have noticed
      that he paused in his walk across the room when Clara made this remark.
      The kind old gentleman was ready and willing to resume his stories of
      departed times. But he had resolved to wait till his auditors should
      request him to proceed, in order that they might find the instructive
      history of the chair a pleasure, and not a task.

“Grandfather,” said Charley, “I am tired to death of this dismal rain and
      of hearing the wind roar in the chimney. I have had no good time all day.
      It would be better to hear stories about the chair than to sit doing
      nothing and thinking of nothing.”

To say the truth, our friend Charley was very much out of humor with the
      storm, because it had kept him all day within doors, and hindered him from
      making a trial of a splendid sled, which Grandfather had given him for a
      New-Year’s gift. As all sleds, nowadays, must have a name, the one in
      question had been honored with the title of Grandfather’s chair, which was
      painted in golden letters on each of the sides. Charley greatly admired
      the construction of the new vehicle, and felt certain that it would
      outstrip any other sled that ever dashed adown the long slopes of the
      Common.

As for Laurence, he happened to be thinking, just at this moment, about
      the history of the chair. Kind old Grandfather had made him a present of a
      volume of engraved portraits, representing the features of eminent and
      famous people o f all countries. Among them Laurence found several who had
      formerly occupied our chair or been connected with its adventures. While
      Grandfather walked to and fro across the room, the imaginative boy was
      gazing at the historic chair. He endeavored to summon up the por-traits
      which he had seen in his volume, and to place them, like living figures,
      in the empty seat.

“The old chair has begun another year of its existence, to-day,” said
      Laurence. “We must make haste, or it will have a new history to be told
      before we finish the old one.”

“Yes, my children,” replied Grandfather, with a smile and a sigh, “another
      year has been added to those of the two centuries and upward which have
      passed since the Lady Arbella brought this chair over from England. It is
      three times as old as your Grandfather; but a year makes no impression on
      its oaken frame, while it bends the old man nearer and nearer to the
      earth; so let me go on with my stories while I may.”

Accordingly Grandfather came to the fireside and seated himself in the
      venerable chair. The lion’s head looked down with a grimly good-natured
      aspect as the children clustered around the old gentleman’s knees. It
      almost seemed as if a real lion were peeping over the back of the chair,
      and smiling at the group of auditors with a sort of lion-like
      complaisance. Little Alice, whose fancy often inspired her with singular
      ideas, exclaimed that the lion’s head was nodding at her, and that it
      looked as if it were going to open its wide jaws and tell a story.

But as the lion’s head appeared to be in no haste to speak, and as there
      was no record or tradition of its having spoken during the whole existence
      of the chair, Grandfather did not consider it worth while to wait.

“CHARLEY, my boy,” said Grandfather, “do you remember who was the last
      occupant of the chair?”

“It was Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson,” answered Charley. “Sir Francis
      Bernard, the new governor, had given him the chair, instead of putting it
      away in the garret of the Province House. And when we took leave of
      Hutchinson he was sitting by his fireside, and thinking of the past
      adventures of the chair and of what was to come.”

“Very well,” said Grandfather; “and you recollect that this was in 1763,
      or thereabouts, at the close of the old French War. Now, that you may
      fully comprehend the remaining adventures of the chair, I must make some
      brief remarks on the situation and character of the New England colonies
      at this period.”

So Grandfather spoke of the earnest loyalty of our fathers during the old
      French War, and after the conquest of Canada had brought that war to a
      triumphant close.

The people loved and reverenced the King of England even more than if the
      ocean had not rolled its waves between him and them; for, at the distance
      of three thousand miles, they could not discover his bad qualities and
      imperfections. Their love was increased by the dangers which they had
      encountered in order to heighten his glory and extend his dominion.
      Throughout the war the American colonists had fought side by side with the
      soldiers of Old England; and nearly thirty thousand young men had laid
      down their lives for the honor of King George. And the survivors loved him
      the better because they had done and suffered so much for his sake.

But there were some circumstances that caused America to feel more
      independent of England than at an earlier period. Canada and Acadia had
      now become British provinces; and our fathers were no longer afraid of the
      bands of French and Indians who used to assault them in old times. For a
      century and a half this had been the great terror of New England. Now the
      old French soldier was driven from the North forever. And even had it been
      otherwise, the English colonies were growing so populous and powerful that
      they might have felt fully able to protect themselves without any help
      from England.

There were thoughtful and sagacious men, who began to doubt whether a
      great country like America would always be content to remain under the
      government of an island three thousand miles away. This was the more
      doubtful, because the English Parliament had long ago made laws which were
      intended to be very beneficial to England at the expense of America. By
      these laws the colonists were forbidden to manufacture articles for their
      own use, or to carry on trade with any nation but the English.

“Now,” continued Grandfather, “if King George III. and his counsellors had
      considered these things wisely, they would have taken another course than
      they did. But when they saw how rich and populous the colonies had grown,
      their first thought was how they might make more profit out of them than
      heretofore. England was enormously in debt at the close of the old French
      War; and it was pretended that this debt had been contracted for the
      defence of the American colonies, and that, therefore, a part of it ought
      to be paid by them.”

“Why, this was nonsense!” exclaimed Charley. “Did not our fathers spend
      their lives, and their money too, to get Canada for King George?”

“True, they did,” said Grandfather; “and they told the English rulers so.
      But the king and his ministers would not listen to good advice. In 1765
      the British Parliament passed a Stamp Act.”

“The Stamp Act,” replied Grandfather, “was a law by which all deeds,
      bonds, and other papers of the same kind were ordered to be marked with
      the king’s stamp; and without this mark they were declared illegal and
      void. Now, in order to get a blank sheet of paper with the king’s stamp
      upon it, people were obliged to pay threepence more than the actual value
      of the paper. And this extra sum of threepence was a tax, and was to be
      paid into the king’s treasury.”

“It was not for threepence, nor for any amount of money, that America
      quarrelled with England,” replied Grandfather; “it was for a great
      principle. The colonists were determined not to be taxed except by their
      own representatives. They said that neither the king and Parliament, nor
      any other power on earth, had a right to take their money out of their
      pockets unless they freely gave it. And, rather than pay threepence when
      it was unjustly demanded, they resolved to sacrifice all the wealth of the
      country, and their lives along with it. They therefore made a most
      stubborn resistance to the Stamp Act.”

“That was noble!” exclaimed Laurence. “I understand how it was. If they
      had quietly paid the tax of threepence, they would have ceased to be
      freemen, and would have become tributaries of England. And so they
      contended about a great question of right and wrong, and put everything at
      stake for it.”

“You are right, Laurence,” said Grandfather, “and it was really amazing
      and terrible to see what a change came over the aspect of the people the
      moment the English Parliament had passed this oppressive act. The former
      history of our chair, my children, has given you some idea of what a
      harsh, unyielding, stern set of men the old Puritans were. For a good many
      years back, however, it had seemed as if these characteristics were
      disappearing. But no sooner did England offer wrong to the colonies than
      the descendants of the early settlers proved that they had the same kind
      of temper as their forefathers. The moment before, New England appeared
      like a humble and loyal subject of the crown; the next instant, she showed
      the grim, dark features of an old king-resisting Puritan.”

Grandfather spoke briefly of the public measures that were taken in
      opposition to the Stamp Act. As this law affected all the American
      colonies alike, it naturally led them to think of consulting together is
      order to procure its repeal. For this purpose the Legislature of
      Massachusetts proposed that delegates from every colony should meet in
      Congress. Accordingly nine colonies, both Northern and Southern, sent
      delegates to the city of New York.

“No, Charley,” answered Grandfather; “a great deal of talking was yet to
      be done before England and America could come to blows. The Congress
      stated the rights and grievances of the colonists. They sent a humble
      petition to the king, and a memorial to the Parliament, beseeching that
      the Stamp Act might be repealed. This was all that the delegates had it in
      their power to do.”

“By no means,” replied Grandfather. “It was a most important and memorable
      event, this first coming together of the American people by their
      representatives from the North and South. If England had been wise, she
      would have trembled at the first word that was spoken in such an
      assembly.”

These remonstrances and petitions, as Grandfather observed, were the work
      of grave, thoughtful, and prudent men. Meantime the young and hot-headed
      people went to work in their own way. It is probable that the petitions of
      Congress would have had little or no effect on the British statesmen if
      the violent deeds of the American people had not shown how much excited
      the people were. LIBERTY TREE was soon heard of in England.

“It was an old elm-tree,” answered Grandfather, “which stood near the
      corner of Essex Street, opposite the Boylston Market. Under the spreading
      branches of this great tree the people used to assemble whenever they
      wished to express their feelings and opinions. Thus, after a while, it
      seemed as if the liberty of the country was connected with Liberty Tree.”

“It bore strange fruit, sometimes,” said Grandfather. “One morning in
      August, 1765, two figures were found hanging on the sturdy branches of
      Liberty Tree. They were dressed in square-skirted coats and small-clothes;
      and, as their wigs hung down over their faces, they looked like real men.
      One was intended to represent the Earl of Bute, who was supposed to have
      advised the king to tax America. The other was meant for the effigy of
      Andrew Oliver, a gentleman belonging to one of the most respectable
      families in Massachusetts.”

“The king had appointed him to be distributor of the stamps,” answered
      Grandfather. “Mr. Oliver would have made a great deal of money by this
      business. But the people frightened him so much by hanging him in effigy,
      and afterwards by breaking into his house, that he promised to have
      nothing to do with the stamps. And all the king’s friends throughout
      America were compelled to make the same promise.”

“LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR HUTCHINSON,” continued Grandfather, “now began to be
      unquiet in our old chair. He had formerly been much respected and beloved
      by the people, and had often proved himself a friend to their interests.
      But the time was come when he could not be a friend to the people without
      ceasing to be a friend to the king. It was pretty generally understood
      that Hutchinson would act according to the king’s wishes, right or wrong,
      like most of the other gentlemen who held offices under the crown.
      Besides, as he was brother-in-law of Andrew Oliver, the people now felt a
      particular dislike to him.”

“I should think,” said Laurence, “as Mr. Hutchinson had written the
      history of our Puritan forefathers, he would have' WHERE id = 'cc6b25c3-51f9-4ae7-87ed-800191fdcd0d';
