      misfortune, like a ship scudding before the wind. An owl hooted; she
      shivered, sat up, passed her hands over her face, her hair, and all over
      her body, and then she went downstairs, as if she were walking in her
      sleep. When she got into the yard she stooped down, so as not to be seen
      by any prowling scamp, for the moon, which was setting, shed a bright
      light over the fields. Instead of opening the gate she scrambled over the
      fence, and as soon as she was outside she started off. She went on
      straight before her, with a quick, springy trot, and from time to time she
      unconsciously uttered a piercing cry. Her long shadow accompanied her, and
      now and then some night bird flew over her head, while the dogs in the
      farmyards barked as they heard her pass; one even jumped over the ditch,
      and followed her and tried to bite her, but she turned round and gave such
      a terrible yell that the frightened animal ran back and cowered in silence
      in its kennel.

The stars grew dim, and the birds began to twitter; day was breaking. The
      girl was worn out and panting; and when the sun rose in the purple sky,
      she stopped, for her swollen feet refused to go any farther; but she saw a
      pond in the distance, a large pond whose stagnant water looked like blood
      under the reflection of this new day, and she limped on slowly with her
      hand on her heart, in order to dip both her feet in it. She sat down on a
      tuft of grass, took off her heavy shoes, which were full of dust, pulled
      off her stockings and plunged her legs into the still water, from which
      bubbles were rising here and there.

A feeling of delicious coolness pervaded her from head to foot, and
      suddenly, while she was looking fixedly at the deep pool, she was seized
      with dizziness, and with a mad longing to throw herself into it. All her
      sufferings would be over in there, over forever. She no longer thought of
      her child; she only wanted peace, complete rest, and to sleep forever, and
      she got up with raised arms and took two steps forward. She was in the
      water up to her thighs, and she was just about to throw her self in when
      sharp, pricking pains in her ankles made her jump back, and she uttered a
      cry of despair, for, from her knees to the tips of her feet, long black
      leeches were sucking her lifeblood, and were swelling as they adhered to
      her flesh. She did not dare to touch them, and screamed with horror, so
      that her cries of despair attracted a peasant, who was driving along at
      some distance, to the spot. He pulled off the leeches one by one, applied
      herbs to the wounds, and drove the girl to her master''s farm in his gig.

She was in bed for a fortnight, and as she was sitting outside the door on
      the first morning that she got up, the farmer suddenly came and planted
      himself before her. “Well,” he said, “I suppose the
      affair is settled isn''t it?” She did not reply at first, and then,
      as he remained standing and looking at her intently with his piercing
      eyes, she said with difficulty: “No, master, I cannot.” He
      immediately flew into a rage.

“You cannot, girl; you cannot? I should just like to know the reason
      why?” She began to cry, and repeated: “I cannot.” He
      looked at her, and then exclaimed angrily: “Then I suppose you have
      a lover?” “Perhaps that is it,” she replied, trembling
      with shame.

The man got as red as a poppy, and stammered out in a rage: “Ah! So
      you confess it, you slut! And pray who is the fellow? Some penniless,
      half-starved ragamuffin, without a roof to his head, I suppose? Who is it,
      I say?” And as she gave him no answer, he continued: “Ah! So
      you will not tell me. Then I will tell you; it is Jean Baudu?”—“No,
      not he,” she exclaimed. “Then it is Pierre Martin?”—“Oh!
      no, master.”

And he angrily mentioned all the young fellows in the neighborhood, while
      she denied that he had hit upon the right one, and every moment wiped her
      eyes with the corner of her blue apron. But he still tried to find it out,
      with his brutish obstinacy, and, as it were, scratching at her heart to
      discover her secret, just as a terrier scratches at a hole to try and get
      at the animal which he scents inside it. Suddenly, however, the man
      shouted: “By George! It is Jacques, the man who was here last year.
      They used to say that you were always talking together, and that you
      thought about getting married.”

Rose was choking, and she grew scarlet, while her tears suddenly stopped
      and dried up on her cheeks, like drops of water on hot iron, and she
      exclaimed: “No, it is not he, it is not he!” “Is that
      really a fact?” asked the cunning peasant, who partly guessed the
      truth; and she replied, hastily: “I will swear it; I will swear it
      to you—” She tried to think of something by which to swear, as
      she did not venture to invoke sacred things, but he interrupted her:
      “At any rate, he used to follow you into every corner and devoured
      you with his eyes at meal times. Did you ever give him your promise, eh?”

This time she looked her master straight in the face. “No, never,
      never; I will solemnly swear to you that if he were to come to-day and ask
      me to marry him I would have nothing to do with him.” She spoke with
      such an air of sincerity that the farmer hesitated, and then he continued,
      as if speaking to himself: “What, then? You have not had a
      misfortune, as they call it, or it would have been known, and as it has no
      consequences, no girl would refuse her master on that account. There must
      be something at the bottom of it, however.”

She could say nothing; she had not the strength to speak, and he asked her
      again: “You will not?” “I cannot, master,” she
      said, with a sigh, and he turned on his heel.

She thought she had got rid of him altogether and spent the rest of the
      day almost tranquilly, but was as exhausted as if she had been turning the
      thrashing machine all day in the place of the old white horse, and she
      went to bed as soon as she could and fell asleep immediately. In the
      middle of the night, however, two hands touching the bed woke her. She
      trembled with fear, but immediately recognized the farmer''s voice, when he
      said to her: “Don''t be frightened, Rose; I have come to speak to
      you.” She was surprised at first, but when he tried to take
      liberties with her she understood and began to tremble violently, as she
      felt quite alone in the darkness, still heavy from sleep, and quite
      unprotected, with that man standing near her. She certainly did not
      consent, but she resisted carelessly struggling against that instinct
      which is always strong in simple natures and very imperfectly protected by
      the undecided will of inert and gentle races. She turned her head now to
      the wall, and now toward the room, in order to avoid the attentions which
      the farmer tried to press on her, but she was weakened by fatigue, while
      he became brutal, intoxicated by desire.

They lived together as man and wife, and one morning he said to her:
      “I have put up our banns, and we will get married next month.”

She married him. She felt as if she were in a pit with inaccessible sides
      from which she could never get out, and all kinds of misfortunes were
      hanging over her head, like huge rocks, which would fall on the first
      occasion. Her husband gave her the impression of a man whom she had
      robbed, and who would find it out some day or other. And then she thought
      of her child, who was the cause of her misfortunes, but who was also the
      cause of all her happiness on earth, and whom she went to see twice a
      year, though she came back more unhappy each time.

But she gradually grew accustomed to her life, her fears were allayed, her
      heart was at rest, and she lived with an easier mind, though still with
      some vague fear floating in it. And so years went on, until the child was
      six. She was almost happy now, when suddenly the farmer''s temper grew very
      bad.

For two or three years he seemed to have been nursing some secret anxiety,
      to be troubled by some care, some mental disturbance, which was gradually
      increasing. He remained sitting at table after dinner, with his head in
      his hands, sad and devoured by sorrow. He always spoke hastily, sometimes
      even brutally, and it even seemed as if he had a grudge against his wife,
      for at times he answered her roughly, almost angrily.

One day, when a neighbor''s boy came for some eggs, and she spoke rather
      crossly to him, as she was very busy, her husband suddenly came in and
      said to her in his unpleasant voice: “If that were your own child
      you would not treat him so.” She was hurt and did not reply, and
      then she went back into the house, with all her grief awakened afresh; and
      at dinner the farmer neither spoke to her nor looked at her, and he seemed
      to hate her, to despise her, to know something about the affair at last.
      In consequence she lost her composure, and did not venture to remain alone
      with him after the meal was over, but left the room and hastened to the
      church.

It was getting dusk; the narrow nave was in total darkness, but she heard
      footsteps in the choir, for the sacristan was preparing the tabernacle
      lamp for the night. That spot of trembling light, which was lost in the
      darkness of the arches, looked to Rose like her last hope, and with her
      eyes fixed on it, she fell on her knees. The chain rattled as the little
      lamp swung up into the air, and almost immediately the small bell rang out
      the Angelus through the increasing mist. She went up to him, as he was
      going out.

“Is Monsieur le Cure at home?” she asked. “Of course he
      is; this is his dinnertime.” She trembled as she rang the bell of
      the parsonage. The priest was just sitting down to dinner, and he made her
      sit down also. “Yes, yes, I know all about it; your husband has
      mentioned the matter to me that brings you here.” The poor woman
      nearly fainted, and the priest continued: “What do you want, my
      child?” And he hastily swallowed several spoonfuls of soup, some of
      which dropped on to his greasy cassock. But Rose did not venture to say
      anything more, and she got up to go, but the priest said: “Courage.”

And she went out and returned to the farm without knowing what she was
      doing. The farmer was waiting for her, as the laborers had gone away
      during her absence, and she fell heavily at his feet, and, shedding a
      flood of tears, she said to him: “What have you got against me?”

He began to shout and to swear: “What have I got against you? That I
      have no children, by—-. When a man takes a wife it is not that they
      may live alone together to the end of their days. That is what I have
      against you. When a cow has no calves she is not worth anything, and when
      a woman has no children she is also not worth anything.”

She began to cry, and said: “It is not my fault! It is not my fault!”
      He grew rather more gentle when he heard that, and added: “I do not
      say that it is, but it is very provoking, all the same.”

From that day forward she had only one thought: to have a child another
      child; she confided her wish to everybody, and, in consequence of this, a
      neighbor told her of an infallible method. This was, to make her husband
      drink a glass of water with a pinch of ashes in it every evening. The
      farmer consented to try it, but without success; so they said to each
      other: “Perhaps there are some secret ways?” And they tried to
      find out. They were told of a shepherd who lived ten leagues off, and so
      Vallin one day drove off to consult him. The shepherd gave him a loaf on
      which he had made some marks; it was kneaded up with herbs, and each of
      them was to eat a piece of it, but they ate the whole loaf without
      obtaining any results from it.

Next, a schoolmaster unveiled mysteries and processes of love which were
      unknown in the country, but infallible, so he declared; but none of them
      had the desired effect. Then the priest advised them to make a pilgrimage
      to the shrine at Fecamp. Rose went with the crowd and prostrated herself
      in the abbey, and, mingling her prayers with the coarse desires of the
      peasants around her, she prayed that she might be fruitful a second time;
      but it was in vain, and then she thought that she was being punished for
      her first fault, and she was seized by terrible grief. She was wasting
      away with sorrow; her husband was also aging prematurely, and was wearing
      himself out in useless hopes.

Then war broke out between them; he called her names and beat her. They
      quarrelled all day long, and when they were in their room together at
      night he flung insults and obscenities at her, choking with rage, until
      one night, not being able to think of any means of making her suffer more
      he ordered her to get up and go and stand out of doors in the rain until
      daylight. As she did not obey him, he seized her by the neck and began to
      strike her in the face with his fists, but she said nothing and did not
      move. In his exasperation he knelt on her stomach, and with clenched
      teeth, and mad with rage, he began to beat her. Then in her despair she
      rebelled, and flinging him against the wall with a furious gesture, she
      sat up, and in an altered voice she hissed: “I have had a child, I
      have had one! I had it by Jacques; you know Jacques. He promised to marry
      me, but he left this neighborhood without keeping his word.”

The man was thunderstruck and could hardly speak, but at last he stammered
      out: “What are you saying? What are you saying?” Then she
      began to sob, and amid her tears she continued: “That was the reason
      why I did not want to marry you. I could not tell you, for you would have
      left me without any bread for my child. You have never had any children,
      so you cannot understand, you cannot understand!”

“You took me by force, as I suppose you know? I did not want to
      marry you,” she said, still sobbing.

Then he got up, lit the candle, and began to walk up and down, with his
      arms behind him. She was cowering on the bed and crying, and suddenly he
      stopped in front of her, and said: “Then it is my fault that you
      have no children?” She gave him no answer, and he began to walk up
      and down again, and then, stopping again, he continued: “How old is
      your child?” “Just six,” she whispered. “Why did
      you not tell me about it?” he asked. “How could I?” she
      replied, with a sigh.

He remained standing, motionless. “Come, get up,” he said. She
      got up with some difficulty, and then, when she was standing on the floor,
      he suddenly began to laugh with the hearty laugh of his good days, and,
      seeing how surprised she was, he added: “Very well, we will go and
      fetch the child, as you and I can have none together.”

She was so scared that if she had had the strength she would assuredly
      have run away, but the farmer rubbed his hands and said: “I wanted
      to adopt one, and now we have found one. I asked the cure about an orphan
      some time ago.”

Then, still laughing, he kissed his weeping and agitated wife on both
      cheeks, and shouted out, as though she could not hear him: “Come
      along, mother, we will go and see whether there is any soup left; I should
      not mind a plateful.”

She put on her petticoat and they went downstairs; and while she was
      kneeling in front of the fireplace and lighting the fire under the
      saucepan, he continued to walk up and down the kitchen with long strides,
      repeating:

“Well, I am really glad of this; I am not saying it for form''s sake,
      but I am glad, I am really very glad.”

I had just finished breakfast with my old friend Georges Garin when the
      servant handed him a letter covered with seals and foreign stamps.

And so he began to read the letter, which was written in a large English
      handwriting, crossed and recrossed in every direction. He read them
      slowly, with serious attention and the interest which we only pay to
      things which touch our hearts.

“That was a curious story! I''ve never told you about it, I think.
      Yet it was a sentimental adventure, and it really happened to me. That was
      a strange New Year''s Day, indeed! It must have been twenty years ago, for
      I was then thirty and am now fifty years old.

“I was then an inspector in the Maritime Insurance Company, of which
      I am now director. I had arranged to pass New Year''s Day in Paris—since
      it is customary to make that day a fete—when I received a letter
      from the manager, asking me to proceed at once to the island of Re, where
      a three-masted vessel from Saint-Nazaire, insured by us, had just been
      driven ashore. It was then eight o''clock in the morning. I arrived at the
      office at ten to get my advices, and that evening I took the express,
      which put me down in La Rochelle the next day, the 31st of December.

“I had two hours to wait before going aboard the boat for Re. So I
      made a tour of the town. It is certainly a queer city, La Rochelle, with
      strong characteristics of its own streets tangled like a labyrinth,
      sidewalks running under endless arcaded galleries like those of the Rue de
      Rivoli, but low, mysterious, built as if to form a suitable setting for
      conspirators and making a striking background for those old-time wars, the
      savage heroic wars of religion. It is indeed the typical old Huguenot
      city, conservative, discreet, with no fine art to show, with no wonderful
      monuments, such as make Rouen; but it is remarkable for its severe,
      somewhat sullen look; it is a city of obstinate fighters, a city where
      fanaticism might well blossom, where the faith of the Calvinists became
      enthusiastic and which gave birth to the plot of the ''Four Sergeants.''

“After I had wandered for some time about these curious streets, I
      went aboard the black, rotund little steamboat which was to take me to the
      island of Re. It was called the Jean Guiton. It started with angry
      puffings, passed between the two old towers which guard the harbor,
      crossed the roadstead and issued from the mole built by Richelieu, the
      great stones of which can be seen at the water''s edge, enclosing the town
      like a great necklace. Then the steamboat turned to the right.

“It was one of those sad days which give one the blues, tighten the
      heart and take away all strength and energy and force-a gray, cold day,
      with a heavy mist which was as wet as rain, as cold as frost, as bad to
      breathe as the steam of a wash-tub.

“Under this low sky of dismal fog the shallow, yellow, sandy sea of
      all practically level beaches lay without a wrinkle, without a movement,
      without life, a sea of turbid water, of greasy water, of stagnant water.
      The Jean Guiton passed over it, rolling a little from habit, dividing the
      smooth, dark blue water and leaving behind a few waves, a little
      splashing, a slight swell, which soon calmed down.

“I began to talk to the captain, a little man with small feet, as
      round as his boat and rolling in the same manner. I wanted some details of
      the disaster on which I was to draw up a report. A great square-rigged
      three-master, the Marie Joseph, of Saint-Nazaire, had gone ashore one
      night in a hurricane on the sands of the island of Re.

“The owner wrote us that the storm had thrown the ship so far ashore
      that it was impossible to float her and that they had to remove everything
      which could be detached with the utmost possible haste. Nevertheless I
      must examine the situation of the wreck, estimate what must have been her
      condition before the disaster and decide whether all efforts had been used
      to get her afloat. I came as an agent of the company in order to give
      contradictory testimony, if necessary, at the trial.

“On receipt of my report, the manager would take what measures he
      might think necessary to protect our interests.

“The captain of the Jean Guiton knew all about the affair, having
      been summoned with his boat to assist in the attempts at salvage.

“He told me the story of the disaster. The Marie Joseph, driven by a
      furious gale lost her bearings completely in the night, and steering by
      chance over a heavy foaming sea—''a milk-soup sea,'' said the captain—had
      gone ashore on those immense sand banks which make the coasts of this
      country look like limitless Saharas when the tide is low.

“While talking I looked around and ahead. Between the ocean and the
      lowering sky lay an open space where the eye could see into the distance.
      We were following a coast. I asked:

“And suddenly the captain stretched his right hand out before us,
      pointed to something almost imperceptible in the open sea, and said:

“I was amazed. This black, almost imperceptible speck, which looked
      to me like a rock, seemed at least three miles from land.

“''It''s now nine-forty, just high tide. Go down along the beach with
      your hands in your pockets after you''ve had lunch at the Hotel du Dauphin,
      and I''ll wager that at ten minutes to three, or three o''clock, you''ll
      reach the wreck without wetting your feet, and have from an hour and
      three-quarters to two hours aboard of her; but not more, or you''ll be
      caught. The faster the sea goes out the faster it comes back. This coast
      is as flat as a turtle! But start away at ten minutes to five, as I tell
      you, and at half-past seven you will be again aboard of the Jean Guiton,
      which will put you down this same evening on the quay at La Rochelle.''

“I thanked the captain and I went and sat down in the bow of the
      steamer to get a good look at the little city of Saint-Martin, which we
      were now rapidly approaching.

“It was just like all small seaports which serve as capitals of the
      barren islands scattered along the coast—a large fishing village,
      one foot on sea and one on shore, subsisting on fish and wild fowl,
      vegetables and shell-fish, radishes and mussels. The island is very low
      and little cultivated, yet it seems to be thickly populated. However, I
      did not penetrate into the interior.

“After breakfast I climbed across a little promontory, and then, as
      the tide was rapidly falling, I started out across the sands toward a kind
      of black rock which I could just perceive above the surface of the water,
      out a considerable distance.

“I walked quickly over the yellow plain. It was elastic, like flesh
      and seemed to sweat beneath my tread. The sea had been there very lately.
      Now I perceived it at a distance, escaping out of sight, and I no longer
      could distinguish the line which separated the sands from ocean. I felt as
      though I were looking at a gigantic supernatural work of enchantment. The
      Atlantic had just now been before me, then it had disappeared into the
      sands, just as scenery disappears through a trap; and I was now walking in
      the midst of a desert. Only the feeling, the breath of the salt-water,
      remained in me. I perceived the smell of the wrack, the smell of the sea,
      the good strong smell of sea coasts. I walked fast; I was no longer cold.
      I looked at the stranded wreck, which grew in size as I approached, and
      came now to resemble an enormous shipwrecked whale.

“It seemed fairly to rise out of the ground, and on that great,
      flat, yellow stretch of sand assumed wonderful proportions. After an
      hour''s walk I at last reached it. It lay upon its side, ruined and
      shattered, its broken bones showing as though it were an animal, its bones
      of tarred wood pierced with great bolts. The sand had already invaded it,
      entering it by all the crannies, and held it and refused to let it go. It
      seemed to have taken root in it. The bow had entered deep into this soft,
      treacherous beach, while the stern, high in air, seemed to cast at heaven,
      like a cry of despairing appeal, the two white words on the black
      planking, Marie Joseph.

“I climbed upon this carcass of a ship by the lowest side; then,
      having reached the deck, I went below. The daylight, which entered by the
      stove-in hatches and the cracks in the sides, showed me dimly long dark
      cavities full of demolished woodwork. They contained nothing but sand,
      which served as foot-soil in this cavern of planks.

“I began to take some notes about the condition of the ship. I was
      seated on a broken empty cask, writing by the light of a great crack,
      through which I could perceive the boundless stretch of the strand. A
      strange shivering of cold and loneliness ran over my skin from time to
      time, and I would often stop writing for a moment to listen to the
      mysterious noises in the derelict: the noise of crabs scratching the
      planking with their crooked claws; the noise of a thousand little
      creatures of the sea already crawling over this dead body or else boring
      into the wood.

“Suddenly, very near me, I heard human voices. I started as though I
      had seen a ghost. For a second I really thought I was about to see drowned
      men rise from the sinister depths of the hold, who would tell me about
      their death. At any rate, it did not take me long to swing myself on deck.
      There, standing by the bows, was a tall Englishman with three young
      misses. Certainly they were a good deal more frightened at seeing this
      sudden apparition on the abandoned three-master than I was at seeing them.
      The youngest girl turned and ran, the two others threw their arms round
      their father. As for him, he opened his mouth—that was the only sign
      of emotion which he showed.

“Then he uttered a long sentence in English, in which I only
      distinguished the word ''gracious,'' repeated several times.

“As he was looking for a place to climb up I showed him the easiest
      way, and gave him a hand. He climbed up. Then we helped up the three
      girls, who had now quite recovered their composure. They were charming,
      especially the oldest, a blonde of eighteen, fresh as a flower, and very
      dainty and pretty! Ah, yes! the pretty Englishwomen have indeed the look
      of tender sea fruit. One would have said of this one that she had just
      risen out of the sands and that her hair had kept their tint. They all,
      with their exquisite freshness, make you think of the delicate colors of
      pink sea-shells and of shining pearls hidden in the unknown depths of the
      ocean.

“She spoke French a little better than her father and acted as
      interpreter. I had to tell all about the shipwreck, and I romanced as
      though I had been present at the catastrophe. Then the whole family
      descended into the interior of the wreck. As soon as they had penetrated
      into this sombre, dimly lit cavity they uttered cries of astonishment and
      admiration. Suddenly the father and his three daughters were holding
      sketch-books in their hands, which they had doubtless carried hidden
      somewhere in their heavy weather-proof clothes, and were all beginning at
      once to make pencil sketches of this melancholy and weird place.

“They had seated themselves side by side on a projecting beam, and
      the four sketch-books on the eight knees were being rapidly covered with
      little black lines which were intended to represent the half-opened hulk
      of the Marie Joseph.

“I continued to inspect the skeleton of the ship, and the oldest
      girl talked to me while she worked.

“They had none of the usual English arrogance; they were simple
      honest hearts of that class of continuous travellers with which England
      covers the globe. The father was long and thin, with a red face framed in
      white whiskers, and looking like a living sandwich, a piece of ham carved
      like a face between two wads of hair. The daughters, who had long legs
      like young storks, were also thin-except the oldest. All three were
      pretty, especially the tallest.

“She had such a droll way of speaking, of laughing, of understanding
      and of not understanding, of raising her eyes to ask a question (eyes blue
      as the deep ocean), of stopping her drawing a moment to make a guess at
      what you meant, of returning once more to work, of saying ''yes'' or ''no''—that
      I could have listened and looked indefinitely.

“I listened and I immediately distinguished a low, steady, curious
      sound. I rose and looked out of the crack and gave a scream. The sea had
      come up to us; it would soon surround us!

“We were on deck in an instant. It was too late. The water circled
      us about and was running toward the coast at tremendous speed. No, it did
      not run, it glided, crept, spread like an immense, limitless blot. The
      water was barely a few centimeters deep, but the rising flood had gone so
      far that we no longer saw the vanishing line of the imperceptible tide.

“The Englishman wanted to jump. I held him back. Flight was
      impossible because of the deep places which we had been obliged to go
      round on our way out and into which we should fall on our return.

“There was a minute of horrible anguish in our hearts. Then the
      little English girl began to smile and murmured:

“I tried to laugh, but fear held me, a fear which was cowardly and
      horrid and base and treacherous like the tide. All the danger which we ran
      appeared to me at once. I wanted to shriek: ''Help!'' But to whom?

“The two younger girls were clinging to their father, who looked in
      consternation at the measureless sea which hedged us round about.

“And we waited there a quarter of an hour, half an hour, indeed I
      don''t know how long, watching that creeping water growing deeper as it
      swirled around us, as though it were playing on the beach, which it had
      regained.

“One of the young girls was cold, and we went below to shelter
      ourselves from the light but freezing wind that made our skins tingle.

“I leaned over the hatchway. The ship was full of water. So we had
      to cower against the stern planking, which shielded us a little.

“Darkness was now coming on, and we remained huddled together. I
      felt the shoulder of the little English girl trembling against mine, her
      teeth chattering from time to time. But I also felt the gentle warmth of
      her body through her ulster, and that warmth was as delicious to me as a
      kiss. We no longer spoke; we sat motionless, mute, cowering down like
      animals in a ditch when a hurricane is raging. And, nevertheless, despite
      the night, despite the terrible and increasing danger, I began to feel
      happy that I was there, glad of the cold and the peril, glad of the long
      hours of darkness and anguish that I must pass on this plank so near this
      dainty, pretty little girl.

“Why! Does one know? Because she was there? Who? She, a little
      unknown English girl? I did not love her, I did not even know her. And for
      all that, I was touched and conquered. I wanted to save her, to sacrifice
      myself for her, to commit a thousand follies! Strange thing! How does it
      happen that the presence of a woman overwhelms us so? Is it the power of
      her grace which enfolds us? Is it the seduction of her beauty and youth,
      which intoxicates one like wine?

“Is it not rather the touch of Love, of Love the Mysterious, who
      seeks constantly to unite two beings, who tries his strength the instant
      he has put a man and a woman face to face?

“The silence of the darkness became terrible, the stillness of the
      sky dreadful, because we could hear vaguely about us a slight, continuous
      sound, the sound of the rising tide and the monotonous plashing of the
      water against the ship.

“Suddenly I heard the sound of sobs. The youngest of the girls was
      crying. Her father tried to console her, and they began to talk in their
      own tongue, which I did not understand. I guessed that he was reassuring
      her and that she was still afraid.

“But I had taken it off and I covered her with it against her will.
      In the short struggle her hand touched mine. It made a delicious thrill
      run through my body.

“For some minutes the air had been growing brisker, the dashing of
      the water stronger against the flanks of the ship. I raised myself; a
      great gust of wind blew in my face. The wind was rising!

“Of course it was bad, it was certain death if any breakers, however
      feeble, should attack and shake the wreck, which was already so shattered
      and disconnected that the first big sea would carry it off.

“So our anguish increased momentarily as the squalls grew stronger
      and stronger. Now the sea broke a little, and I saw in the darkness white
      lines appearing and disappearing, lines of foam, while each wave struck
      the Marie Joseph and shook her with a short quiver which went to our
      hearts.

“The English girl was trembling. I felt her shiver against me. And I
      had a wild desire to take her in my arms.

“Down there, before and behind us, to the left and right,
      lighthouses were shining along the shore—lighthouses white, yellow
      and red, revolving like the enormous eyes of giants who were watching us,
      waiting eagerly for us to disappear. One of them in especial irritated me.
      It went out every thirty seconds and it lit up again immediately. It was
      indeed an eye, that one, with its lid incessantly lowered over its fiery
      glance.

“From time to time the Englishman struck a match to see the hour;
      then he put his watch back in his pocket. Suddenly he said to me, over the
      heads of his daughters, with tremendous gravity:

“It was midnight. I held out my hand, which he pressed. Then he said
      something in English, and suddenly he and his daughters began to sing ''God
      Save the Queen,'' which rose through the black and silent air and vanished
      into space.

“It was something sinister and superb, this chant of the
      shipwrecked, the condemned, something like a prayer and also like
      something grander, something comparable to the ancient ''Ave Caesar
      morituri te salutant.''

“When they had finished I asked my neighbor to sing a ballad alone,
      anything she liked, to make us forget our terrors. She consented, and
      immediately her clear young voice rang out into the night. She sang
      something which was doubtless sad, because the notes were long drawn out
      and hovered, like wounded birds, above the waves.

“The sea was rising now and beating upon our wreck. As for me, I
      thought only of that voice. And I thought also of the sirens. If a ship
      had passed near by us what would the sailors have said? My troubled spirit
      lost itself in the dream! A siren! Was she not really a siren, this
      daughter of the sea, who had kept me on this worm-eaten ship and who was
      soon about to go down with me deep into the waters?

“But suddenly we were all five rolling on the deck, because the
      Marie Joseph had sunk on her right side. The English girl had fallen upon
      me, and before I knew what I was doing, thinking that my last moment was
      come, I had caught her in my arms and kissed her cheek, her temple and her
      hair.

“The father said, ''Kate!'' The one whom I was holding answered ''Yes''
      and made a movement to free herself. And at that moment I should have
      wished the ship to split in two and let me fall with her into the sea.

“I rose slowly, and suddenly I made out a light on the sea quite
      close to us. I shouted; they answered. It was a boat sent out in search of
      us by the hotelkeeper, who had guessed at our imprudence.

“We were saved. I was in despair. They picked us up off our raft and
      they brought us back to Saint-Martin.

“We had to separate the next day after much handshaking and many
      promises to write. They departed for Biarritz. I wanted to follow them.

“I was hard hit. I wanted to ask this little girl to marry me. If we
      had passed eight days together, I should have done so! How weak and
      incomprehensible a man sometimes is!

“Two years passed without my hearing a word from them. Then I
      received a letter from New York. She was married and wrote to tell me. And
      since then we write to each other every year, on New Year''s Day. She tells
      me about her life, talks of her children, her sisters, never of her
      husband! Why? Ah! why? And as for me, I only talk of the Marie Joseph.
      That was perhaps the only woman I have ever loved—no—that I
      ever should have loved. Ah, well! who can tell? Circumstances rule one.
      And then—and then—all passes. She must be old now; I should
      not know her. Ah! she of the bygone time, she of the wreck! What a
      creature! Divine! She writes me her hair is white. That caused me terrible
      pain. Ah! her yellow hair. No, my English girl exists no longer. How sad
      it all is!”

When Sabot entered the inn at Martinville it was a signal for laughter.
      What a rogue he was, this Sabot! There was a man who did not like priests,
      for instance! Oh, no, oh, no! He did not spare them, the scamp.

Sabot (Theodule), a master carpenter, represented liberal thought in
      Martinville. He was a tall, thin man, with gray, cunning eyes, and thin
      lips, and wore his hair plastered down on his temples. When he said:
      “Our holy father, the pope” in a certain manner, everyone
      laughed. He made a point of working on Sunday during the hour of mass. He
      killed his pig each year on Monday in Holy Week in order to have enough
      black pudding to last till Easter, and when the priest passed by, he
      always said by way of a joke: “There goes one who has just swallowed
      his God off a salver.”

The priest, a stout man and also very tall, dreaded him on account of his
      boastful talk which attracted followers. The Abbe Maritime was a politic
      man, and believed in being diplomatic. There had been a rivalry between
      them for ten years, a secret, intense, incessant rivalry. Sabot was
      municipal councillor, and they thought he would become mayor, which would
      inevitably mean the final overthrow of the church.

The elections were about to take place. The church party was shaking in
      its shoes in Martinville.

One morning the cure set out for Rouen, telling his servant that he was
      going to see the archbishop. He returned in two days with a joyous,
      triumphant air. And everyone knew the following day that the chancel of
      the church was going to be renovated. A sum of six hundred francs had been
      contributed by the archbishop out of his private fund. All the old pine
      pews were to be removed, and replaced by new pews made of oak. It would be
      a big carpentering job, and they talked about it that very evening in all
      the houses in the village.

When he went through the village the following morning, the neighbors,
      friends and enemies, all asked him, jokingly:

Two days later, they heard that the work of renovation had been entrusted
      to Celestin Chambrelan, the carpenter from Percheville. Then this was
      denied, and it was said that all the pews in the church were going to be
      changed. That would be well worth the two thousand francs that had been
      demanded of the church administration.

Theodule Sabot could not sleep for thinking about it. Never, in all the
      memory of man, had a country carpenter undertaken a similar piece of work.
      Then a rumor spread abroad that the cure felt very grieved that he had to
      give this work to a carpenter who was a stranger in the community, but
      that Sabot''s opinions were a barrier to his being entrusted with the job.

Sabot knew it well. He called at the parsonage just as it was growing
      dark. The servant told him that the cure was at church. He went to the
      church.

Two attendants on the altar of the Virgin, two sour old maids, were
      decorating the altar for the month of Mary, under the direction of the
      priest, who stood in the middle of the chancel with his portly paunch,
      directing the two women who, mounted on chairs, were placing flowers
      around the tabernacle.

Sabot felt ill at ease in there, as though he were in the house of his
      greatest enemy, but the greed of gain was gnawing at his heart. He drew
      nearer, holding his cap in his hand, and not paying any attention to the
      “demoiselles de la Vierge,” who remained standing startled,
      astonished, motionless on their chairs.

“Why, why,” remarked Sabot and then was silent. He would have
      liked to retire now without saying anything, but a glance at the chancel
      held him back. He saw sixteen seats that had to be remade, six to the
      right and eight to the left, the door of the sacristy occupying the place
      of two. Sixteen oak seats, that would be worth at most three hundred
      francs, and by figuring carefully one might certainly make two hundred
      francs on the work if one were not clumsy.

At the tone of the abbe, Theodule Sabot felt a chill run down his back and
      he once more had a longing to take to his heels. However, he replied
      humbly:

Then the abbe folded his arms across his large stomach and, as if filled
      with amazement, said:

“Is it you—you—you, Sabot—who have come to ask me
      for this . . . You—the only irreligious man in my parish! Why, it
      would be a scandal, a public scandal! The archbishop would give me a
      reprimand, perhaps transfer me.”

He stopped a few seconds, for breath, and then resumed in a calmer tone:
      “I can understand that it pains you to see a work of such importance
      entrusted to a carpenter from a neighboring parish. But I cannot do
      otherwise, unless—but no—it is impossible—you would not
      consent, and unless you did, never.”

Sabot now looked at the row of benches in line as far as the entrance
      door. Christopher, if they were going to change all those!

“I do not say, I do not say. I am not calling it off, I am
      consenting to religion, for sure. But what rubs me the wrong way is,
      putting it in practice; but in this case I will not be refractory.”

The attendants of the Virgin, having got off their chairs had concealed
      themselves behind the altar; and they listened pale with emotion.

“That is good, that is good. That was wisely said, and not stupid,
      you understand. You will see, you will see.”

“From the moment that the work is put into your hands, I want to be
      assured of your conversion.”

“You understand perfectly that you must have a general cleaning up,
      a thorough cleansing. So I will expect you to-morrow.”

“Well, then! you shall come to my house and into my parlor. We will
      have it just the two of us, tete-a-tete. Does that suit you?”

“That is understood, that is all right, that is agreed on.
      To-morrow, monsieur le cure. Whoever draws back is a skunk!”

And he held out his great rough hand which the priest grasped heartily
      with a clap that resounded through the church.

Theodule Sabot was not easy in his mind all the following day. He had a
      feeling analogous to the apprehension one experiences when a tooth has to
      be drawn. The thought recurred to him at every moment: “I must go to
      confession this evening.” And his troubled mind, the mind of an
      atheist only half convinced, was bewildered with a confused and
      overwhelming dread of the divine mystery.

As soon as he had finished his work, he betook himself to the parsonage.
      The cure was waiting for him in the garden, reading his breviary as he
      walked along a little path. He appeared radiant and greeted him with a
      good-natured laugh.

The carpenter, so disturbed that he had not two ideas in his head, watched
      him as he put on the white vestment with its pleated folds. The priest
      beckoned to him and said:

“The confiteor. If you do not remember it, repeat after me, one by
      one, the words I am going to say.” And the cure repeated the sacred
      prayer, in a slow tone, emphasizing the words which the carpenter repeated
      after him. Then he said:

“My child, I will ask you questions, since you don''t seem familiar
      with these things. We will take, one by one, the commandments of God.
      Listen to me and do not be disturbed. Speak very frankly and never fear
      that you may say too much.

“Have you ever loved anything, or anybody, as well as you loved God?
      Have you loved him with all your soul, all your heart, all the strength of
      your love?”

“No. Oh, no, m''sieu le cure. I love God as much as I can. That is
      —yes—I love him very much. To say that I do not love my
      children, no—I cannot say that. To say that if I had to choose
      between them and God, I could not be sure. To say that if I had to lose a
      hundred francs for the love of God, I could not say about that. But I love
      him well, for sure, I love him all the same.” The priest said
      gravely “You must love Him more than all besides.” And Sabot,
      meaning well, declared “I will do what I possibly can, m''sieu le
      cure.” The abbe resumed:

“No-oh, that, no! I never swear, never. Sometimes, in a moment of
      anger, I may say sacre nom de Dieu! But then, I never swear.”

“I know, you will do better in future. I will pass over the
      following commandments, certain that you have not transgressed the two
      first. We will take from the sixth to the ninth. I will resume:

“Of course not, of course not! I am an honest man, m''sieu le cure, I
      swear it, for sure. To say that I have not sometimes charged for a few
      more hours of work to customers who had means, I could not say that. To
      say that I never add a few centimes to bills, only a few, I would not say
      that. But to steal, no! Oh, not that, no!”

“No, as to that, no. I am not a liar. That is my quality. To say
      that I have never told a big story, I would not like to say that. To say
      that I have never made people believe things that were not true when it
      was to my own interest, I would not like to say that. But as for lying, I
      am not a liar.”

“As to that, no; oh, as to that, no, m''sieu le Cure. My poor wife,
      deceive her! No, no! Not so much as the tip of a finger, either in thought
      or in act. That is the truth.”

They were silent a few seconds, then, in a lower tone, as though a doubt
      had arisen in his mind, he resumed:

“When I go to town, to say that I never go into a house, you know,
      one of the licensed houses, just to laugh and talk and see something
      different, I could not say that. But I always pay, monsieur le cure, I
      always pay. From the moment you pay, without anyone seeing or knowing you,
      no one can get you into trouble.”

Quartermaster Varajou had obtained a week''s leave to go and visit his
      sister, Madame Padoie. Varajou, who was in garrison at Rennes and was
      leading a pretty gay life, finding himself high and dry, wrote to his
      sister saying that he would devote a week to her. It was not that he cared
      particularly for Mme. Padoie, a little moralist, a devotee, and always
      cross; but he needed money, needed it very badly, and he remembered that,
      of all his relations, the Padoies were the only ones whom he had never
      approached on the subject.

Pere Varajou, formerly a horticulturist at Angers, but now retired from
      business, had closed his purse strings to his scapegrace son and had
      hardly seen him for two years. His daughter had married Padoie, a former
      treasury clerk, who had just been appointed tax collector at Vannes.

Varajou, on leaving the train, had some one direct him to the house of his
      brother-in-law, whom he found in his office arguing with the Breton
      peasants of the neighborhood. Padoie rose from his seat, held out his hand
      across the table littered with papers, murmured, “Take a chair. I
      will be at liberty in a moment,” sat down again and resumed his
      discussion.

The peasants did not understand his explanations, the collector did not
      understand their line of argument. He spoke French, they spoke Breton, and
      the clerk who acted as interpreter appeared not to understand either.

It lasted a long time, a very long time. Varajou looked at his
      brother-in-law and thought: “What a fool!” Padoie must have
      been almost fifty. He was tall, thin, bony, slow, hairy, with heavy arched
      eyebrows. He wore a velvet skull cap with a gold cord vandyke design round
      it. His look was gentle, like his actions. His speech, his gestures, his
      thoughts, all were soft. Varajou said to himself, “What a fool!”

He, himself, was one of those noisy roysterers for whom the greatest
      pleasures in life are the cafe and abandoned women. He understood nothing
      outside of these conditions of existence.

A boisterous braggart, filled with contempt for the rest of the world, he
      despised the entire universe from the height of his ignorance. When he
      said: “Nom d''un chien, what a spree!” he expressed the highest
      degree of admiration of which his mind was capable.

“Oh, I have been thinking of it for some time; but, you know, in the
      military profession one has not much freedom.”

The door opened and Mme. Padoie appeared. She went over to her brother
      without any eagerness, held her cheek for him to kiss, and asked:

They went into the adjoining room, leaving Padoie to his accounts and his
      taxpayers. As soon as they were alone, she said:

He attempted to defend himself, but she gave him such a lecture that he
      could say nothing more.

“We dine at six o''clock, and you can amuse yourself until then. I
      cannot entertain you, as I have so many things to do.”

When he was alone he hesitated as to whether he should sleep or take a
      walk. He looked first at the door leading to his room and then at the hall
      door, and decided to go out. He sauntered slowly through the quiet Breton
      town, so sleepy, so calm, so dead, on the shores of its inland bay that is
      called “le Morbihan.” He looked at the little gray houses, the
      occasional pedestrians, the empty stores, and he murmured:

He reached the harbor, the desolate harbor, walked back along a lonely,
      deserted boulevard, and got home before five o''clock. Then he threw
      himself on his bed to sleep till dinner time. The maid woke him, knocking
      at the door.

He went downstairs. In the damp dining-room with the paper peeling from
      the walls near the floor, he saw a soup tureen on a round table without
      any table cloth, on which were also three melancholy soup-plates.

M. and Mme. Padoie entered the room at the same time as Varajou. They all
      sat down to table, and the husband and wife crossed themselves over the
      pit of their stomachs, after which Padoie helped the soup, a meat soup. It
      was the day for pot-roast.

After the soup, they had the beef, which was done to rags, melted, greasy,
      like pap. The officer ate slowly, with disgust, weariness and rage.

“Do not stay late. You always get so tired when you go out. You are
      not made for society, with your poor health.”

She then talked about society in Vannes, of the excellent social circle in
      which the Padoies moved, thanks to their religious sentiments.

A puree of potatoes and a dish of pork were next served, in honor of the
      guest. Then some cheese, and that was all. No coffee.

When Varajou saw that he would have to spend the evening tete-a-tete with
      his sister, endure her reproaches, listen to her sermons, without even a
      glass of liqueur to help him to swallow these remonstrances, he felt that
      he could not stand the torture, and declared that he was obliged to go to
      the police station to have something attended to regarding his leave of
      absence. And he made his escape at seven o''clock.

He had scarcely reached the street before he gave himself a shake like a
      dog coming out of the water. He muttered:

And he set out to look for a cafe, the best in the town. He found it on a
      public square, behind two gas lamps. Inside the cafe, five or six men,
      semi-gentlemen, and not noisy, were drinking and chatting quietly, leaning
      their elbows on the small tables, while two billiard players walked round
      the green baize, where the balls were hitting each other as they rolled.

“Eighteen-nineteen. No luck. Oh, that''s a good stroke! Well played!
      Eleven. You should have played on the red. Twenty. Froze! Froze! Twelve.
      Ha! Wasn''t I right?”

He was accustomed to spending his evenings off duty with his companions,
      amid noise and the smoke of pipes. This silence, this quiet, exasperated
      him. He began to drink; first the coffee, then the brandy, and asked for
      another decanter. He now wanted to laugh, to shout, to sing, to fight some
      one. He said to himself:

“You take the second street to the left and then the first to the
      right. It is number fifteen.”

And Varajou went out of the cafe, repeating, “Second to the left,
      first to the right, number 15.” But at the end of a few seconds he
      thought, “second to the left yes. But on leaving the cafe must I
      walk to the right or the left? Bah, it cannot be helped, we shall see.”

And he walked on, turned down the second street to the left, then the
      first to the right and looked for number 15. It was a nice looking house,
      and one could see behind the closed blinds that the windows were lighted
      up on the first floor. The hall door was left partly open, and a lamp was
      burning in the vestibule. The non-commissioned officer thought to himself:

He ascended the stairs, opened a door and saw sitting in a room well
      lighted up by two lamps, a chandelier, and two candelabras with candles in
      them, four ladies in evening dress, apparently expecting some one.

Three of them, the younger ones, remained seated, with rather a formal
      air, on some crimson velvet chairs; while the fourth, who was about
      forty-five, was arranging some flowers in a vase. She was very stout, and
      wore a green silk dress with low neck and short sleeves, allowing her red
      neck, covered with powder, to escape as a huge flower might from its
      corolla.

He sat down. But seeing that they did not welcome him eagerly, he thought
      that possibly only commissioned officers were admitted to the house, and
      this made him uneasy. But he said:

He could think of nothing else to say, and they were all silent. But at
      last, being ashamed of his bashfulness, and with an awkward laugh, he
      said:

He had not finished his sentence when the door opened, and in walked
      Padoie dressed in a black suit.

Varajou gave a shout of joy, and rising from his seat, he rushed at his
      brother-in-law, put his arms round him and waltzed him round the room,
      shouting:

“Oh, oh, oh, you scamp, you scamp! You are out for a good time, too.
      Oh, you scamp! And my sister! Are you tired of her, say?”

As he thought of all that he might gain through this unexpected situation,
      the forced loan, the inevitable blackmail, he flung himself on the lounge
      and laughed so heartily that the piece of furniture creaked all over.

The three young ladies, rising simultaneously, made their escape, while
      the older woman retreated to the door looking as though she were about to
      faint.

And then two gentlemen appeared in evening dress, and wearing the ribbon
      of an order. Padoie rushed up to them.

“Oh, judge—he is crazy, he is crazy. He was sent to us as a
      convalescent. You can see that he is crazy.”

Varajou was sitting up now, and not being able to understand it all, he
      guessed that he had committed some monstrous folly. Then he rose, and
      turning to his brother-in-law, said:

“What house—what—what house is this? Wretch—scoundrel—villain—what
      house, indeed? The house of the judge—of the judge of the Supreme
      Court—of the Supreme Court—of the Supreme Court—Oh, oh—rascal!
      —rascal!—rascal!”

The girl was one of those pretty and charming young creatures who
      sometimes are born, as if by a slip of fate, into a family of clerks. She
      had no dowry, no expectations, no way of being known, understood, loved,
      married by any rich and distinguished man; so she let herself be married
      to a little clerk of the Ministry of Public Instruction.

She dressed plainly because she could not dress well, but she was unhappy
      as if she had really fallen from a higher station; since with women there
      is neither caste nor rank, for beauty, grace and charm take the place of
      family and birth. Natural ingenuity, instinct for what is elegant, a
      supple mind are their sole hierarchy, and often make of women of the
      people the equals of the very greatest ladies.

Mathilde suffered ceaselessly, feeling herself born to enjoy all
      delicacies and all luxuries. She was distressed at the poverty of her
      dwelling, at the bareness of the walls, at the shabby chairs, the ugliness
      of the curtains. All those things, of which another woman of her rank
      would never even have been conscious, tortured her and made her angry. The
      sight of the little Breton peasant who did her humble housework aroused in
      her despairing regrets and bewildering dreams. She thought of silent
      antechambers hung with Oriental tapestry, illumined by tall bronze
      candelabra, and of two great footmen in knee breeches who sleep in the big
      armchairs, made drowsy by the oppressive heat of the stove. She thought of
      long reception halls hung with ancient silk, of the dainty cabinets
      containing priceless curiosities and of the little coquettish perfumed
      reception rooms made for chatting at five o''clock with intimate friends,
      with men famous and sought after, whom all women envy and whose attention
      they all desire.

When she sat down to dinner, before the round table covered with a
      tablecloth in use three days, opposite her husband, who uncovered the soup
      tureen and declared with a delighted air, “Ah, the good soup! I
      don''t know anything better than that,” she thought of dainty
      dinners, of shining silverware, of tapestry that peopled the walls with
      ancient personages and with strange birds flying in the midst of a fairy
      forest; and she thought of delicious dishes served on marvellous plates
      and of the whispered gallantries to which you listen with a sphinxlike
      smile while you are eating the pink meat of a trout or the wings of a
      quail.

She had no gowns, no jewels, nothing. And she loved nothing but that. She
      felt made for that. She would have liked so much to please, to be envied,
      to be charming, to be sought after.

She had a friend, a former schoolmate at the convent, who was rich, and
      whom she did not like to go to see any more because she felt so sad when
      she came home.

But one evening her husband reached home with a triumphant air and holding
      a large envelope in his hand.

Instead of being delighted, as her husband had hoped, she threw the
      invitation on the table crossly, muttering:

“Why, my dear, I thought you would be glad. You never go out, and
      this is such a fine opportunity. I had great trouble to get it. Every one
      wants to go; it is very select, and they are not giving many invitations
      to clerks. The whole official world will be there.”

He stopped, distracted, seeing that his wife was weeping. Two great tears
      ran slowly from the corners of her eyes toward the corners of her mouth.

By a violent effort she conquered her grief and replied in a calm voice,
      while she wiped her wet cheeks:

“Nothing. Only I have no gown, and, therefore, I can''t go to this
      ball. Give your card to some colleague whose wife is better equipped than
      I am.”

“Come, let us see, Mathilde. How much would it cost, a suitable
      gown, which you could use on other occasions—something very simple?”

She reflected several seconds, making her calculations and wondering also
      what sum she could ask without drawing on herself an immediate refusal and
      a frightened exclamation from the economical clerk.

He grew a little pale, because he was laying aside just that amount to buy
      a gun and treat himself to a little shooting next summer on the plain of
      Nanterre, with several friends who went to shoot larks there of a Sunday.

The day of the ball drew near and Madame Loisel seemed sad, uneasy,
      anxious. Her frock was ready, however. Her husband said to her one
      evening:

“It annoys me not to have a single piece of jewelry, not a single
      ornament, nothing to put on. I shall look poverty-stricken. I would almost
      rather not go at all.”

“You might wear natural flowers,” said her husband. “They''re
      very stylish at this time of year. For ten francs you can get two or three
      magnificent roses.”

“How stupid you are!” her husband cried. “Go look up
      your friend, Madame Forestier, and ask her to lend you some jewels. You''re
      intimate enough with her to do that.”

Madame Forestier went to a wardrobe with a mirror, took out a large jewel
      box, brought it back, opened it and said to Madame Loisel:

She saw first some bracelets, then a pearl necklace, then a Venetian gold
      cross set with precious stones, of admirable workmanship. She tried on the
      ornaments before the mirror, hesitated and could not make up her mind to
      part with them, to give them back. She kept asking:

Suddenly she discovered, in a black satin box, a superb diamond necklace,
      and her heart throbbed with an immoderate desire. Her hands trembled as
      she took it. She fastened it round her throat, outside her high-necked
      waist, and was lost in ecstasy at her reflection in the mirror.

She threw her arms round her friend''s neck, kissed her passionately, then
      fled with her treasure.

The night of the ball arrived. Madame Loisel was a great success. She was
      prettier than any other woman present, elegant, graceful, smiling and wild
      with joy. All the men looked at her, asked her name, sought to be
      introduced. All the attaches of the Cabinet wished to waltz with her. She
      was remarked by the minister himself.

She danced with rapture, with passion, intoxicated by pleasure, forgetting
      all in the triumph of her beauty, in the glory of her success, in a sort
      of cloud of happiness comprised of all this homage, admiration, these
      awakened desires and of that sense of triumph which is so sweet to woman''s
      heart.

She left the ball about four o''clock in the morning. Her husband had been
      sleeping since midnight in a little deserted anteroom with three other
      gentlemen whose wives were enjoying the ball.

He threw over her shoulders the wraps he had brought, the modest wraps of
      common life, the poverty of which contrasted with the elegance of the ball
      dress. She felt this and wished to escape so as not to be remarked by the
      other women, who were enveloping themselves in costly furs.

But she did not listen to him and rapidly descended the stairs. When they
      reached the street they could not find a carriage and began to look for
      one, shouting after the cabmen passing at a distance.

They went toward the Seine in despair, shivering with cold. At last they
      found on the quay one of those ancient night cabs which, as though they
      were ashamed to show their shabbiness during the day, are never seen round
      Paris until after dark.

It took them to their dwelling in the Rue des Martyrs, and sadly they
      mounted the stairs to their flat. All was ended for her. As to him, he
      reflected that he must be at the ministry at ten o''clock that morning.

She removed her wraps before the glass so as to see herself once more in
      all her glory. But suddenly she uttered a cry. She no longer had the
      necklace around her neck!

They looked among the folds of her skirt, of her cloak, in her pockets,
      everywhere, but did not find it.

He went out. She sat waiting on a chair in her ball dress, without
      strength to go to bed, overwhelmed, without any fire, without a thought.

He went to police headquarters, to the newspaper offices to offer a
      reward; he went to the cab companies—everywhere, in fact, whither he
      was urged by the least spark of hope.

“You must write to your friend,” said he, “that you have
      broken the clasp of her necklace and that you are having it mended. That
      will give us time to turn round.”

The next day they took the box that had contained it and went to the
      jeweler whose name was found within. He consulted his books.

Then they went from jeweler to jeweler, searching for a necklace like the
      other, trying to recall it, both sick with chagrin and grief.

They found, in a shop at the Palais Royal, a string of diamonds that
      seemed to them exactly like the one they had lost. It was worth forty
      thousand francs. They could have it for thirty-six.

So they begged the jeweler not to sell it for three days yet. And they
      made a bargain that he should buy it back for thirty-four thousand francs,
      in case they should find the lost necklace before the end of February.

Loisel possessed eighteen thousand francs which his father had left him.
      He would borrow the rest.

He did borrow, asking a thousand francs of one, five hundred of another,
      five louis here, three louis there. He gave notes, took up ruinous
      obligations, dealt with usurers and all the race of lenders. He
      compromised all the rest of his life, risked signing a note without even
      knowing whether he could meet it; and, frightened by the trouble yet to
      come, by the black misery that was about to fall upon him, by the prospect
      of all the physical privations and moral tortures that he was to suffer,
      he went to get the new necklace, laying upon the jeweler''s counter
      thirty-six thousand francs.

She did not open the case, as her friend had so much feared. If she had
      detected the substitution, what would she have thought, what would she
      have said? Would she not have taken Madame Loisel for a thief?

Thereafter Madame Loisel knew the horrible existence of the needy. She
      bore her part, however, with sudden heroism. That dreadful debt must be
      paid. She would pay it. They dismissed their servant; they changed their
      lodgings; they rented a garret under the roof.

She came to know what heavy housework meant and the odious cares of the
      kitchen. She washed the dishes, using her dainty fingers and rosy nails on
      greasy pots and pans. She washed the soiled linen, the shirts and the
      dishcloths, which she dried upon a line; she carried the slops down to the
      street every morning and carried up the water, stopping for breath at
      every landing. And dressed like a woman of the people, she went to the
      fruiterer, the grocer, the butcher, a basket on her arm, bargaining,
      meeting with impertinence, defending her miserable money, sou by sou.

Her husband worked evenings, making up a tradesman''s accounts, and late at
      night he often copied manuscript for five sous a page.

At the end of ten years they had paid everything, everything, with the
      rates of usury and the accumulations of the compound interest.

Madame Loisel looked old now. She had become the woman of impoverished
      households—strong and hard and rough. With frowsy hair, skirts askew
      and red hands, she talked loud while washing the floor with great swishes
      of water. But sometimes, when her husband was at the office, she sat down
      near the window and she thought of that gay evening of long ago, of that
      ball where she had been so beautiful and so admired.

What would have happened if she had not lost that necklace? Who knows? who
      knows? How strange and changeful is life! How small a thing is needed to
      make or ruin us!

But one Sunday, having gone to take a walk in the Champs Elysees to
      refresh herself after the labors of the week, she suddenly perceived a
      woman who was leading a child. It was Madame Forestier, still young, still
      beautiful, still charming.

Madame Loisel felt moved. Should she speak to her? Yes, certainly. And now
      that she had paid, she would tell her all about it. Why not?

The other, astonished to be familiarly addressed by this plain good-wife,
      did not recognize her at all and stammered:

“Yes, I have had a pretty hard life, since I last saw you, and great
      poverty—and that because of you!”

“I brought you back another exactly like it. And it has taken us ten
      years to pay for it. You can understand that it was not easy for us, for
      us who had nothing. At last it is ended, and I am very glad.”

“Oh, my poor Mathilde! Why, my necklace was paste! It was worth at
      most only five hundred francs!”

Roger de Tourneville was whiffing a cigar and blowing out small clouds of
      smoke every now and then, as he sat astride a chair amid a party of
      friends. He was talking.

“We were at dinner when a letter was brought in which my father
      opened. You know my father, who thinks that he is king of France ad
      interim. I call him Don Quixote, because for twelve years he has been
      running a tilt against the windmill of the Republic, without quite knowing
      whether it was in the cause of the Bourbons or the Orleanists. At present
      he is bearing the lance in the cause of the Orleanists alone, because
      there is no one else left. In any case, he thinks himself the first
      gentleman of France, the best known, the most influential, the head of the
      party; and as he is an irremovable senator, he thinks that the thrones of
      the neighboring kings are very insecure.

“As for my mother, she is my father''s soul, she is the soul of the
      kingdom and of religion, and the scourge of all evil-thinkers.

“Well, a letter was brought in while we were at dinner, and my
      father opened and read it, and then he said to mother: ''Your brother is
      dying.'' She grew very pale. My uncle was scarcely ever mentioned in the
      house, and I did not know him at all; all I knew from public talk was,
      that he had led, and was still leading, a gay life. After having spent his
      fortune in fast living, he was now in small apartments in the Rue des
      Martyrs.

“An ancient peer of France and former colonel of cavalry, it was
      said that he believed in neither God nor devil. Not believing, therefore,
      in a future life he had abused the present life in every way, and had
      become a live wound in my mother''s heart.

“''Give me that letter, Paul,'' she said, and when she read it, I
      asked for it in my turn. Here it is:

“''We must take counsel,'' papa murmured. ''In my position, I ought to
      watch over your brother''s last moments.''

“Mamma continued: ''I will send for Abbe Poivron and ask his advice,
      and then I will go to my brother with the abbe and Roger. Remain here,
      Paul, for you must not compromise yourself; but a woman can, and ought to
      do these things. For a politician in your position, it is another matter.
      It would be a fine thing for one of your opponents to be able to bring one
      of your most laudable actions up against you.'' ''You are right,'' my father
      said. ''Do as you think best, my dear wife.''

“A quarter of an hour, later, the Abbe Poivron came into the
      drawing-room, and the situation was explained to him, analyzed and
      discussed in all its bearings. If the Marquis de Fumerol, one of the
      greatest names in France, were to die without the ministrations of
      religion, it would assuredly be a terrible blow to the nobility in
      general, and to the Count de Tourneville in particular, and the
      freethinkers would be triumphant. The liberal newspapers would sing songs
      of victory for six months; my mother''s name would be dragged through the
      mire and brought into the prose of Socialistic journals, and my father''s
      name would be smirched. It was impossible that such a thing should be.

“A crusade was therefore immediately decided upon, which was to be
      led by the Abbe Poivron, a little, fat, clean, priest with a faint perfume
      about him, a true vicar of a large church in a noble and rich quarter.

“The landau was ordered and we all three set out, my mother, the
      cure and I, to administer the last sacraments to my uncle.

“It had been decided first of all we should see Madame Melanie who
      had written the letter, and who was most likely the porter''s wife, or my
      uncle''s servant, and I dismounted, as an advance guard, in front of a
      seven-story house and went into a dark passage, where I had great
      difficulty in finding the porter''s den. He looked at me distrustfully, and
      I said:

“''Madame Melanie, if you please.'' ''Don''t know her!'' ''But I have
      received a letter from her.'' ''That may be, but I don''t know her. Are you
      asking for a lodger?'' ''No, a servant probably. She wrote me about a
      place.'' ''A servant?—a servant? Perhaps it is the marquis''. Go and
      see, the fifth story on the left.''

“As soon as he found I was not asking for a doubtful character he
      became more friendly and came as far as the corridor with me. He was a
      tall, thin man with white whiskers, the manners of a beadle and majestic
      gestures.

“I climbed up a long spiral staircase, the railing of which I did
      not venture to touch, and I gave three discreet knocks at the left-hand
      door on the fifth story. It opened immediately, and an enormous dirty
      woman appeared before me. She barred the entrance with her extended arms
      which she placed against the two doorposts, and growled:

“''What do you want?'' ''Are you Madame Melanie?'' ''Yes.'' ''I am the
      Visconte de Tourneville.'' ''Ah! All right! Come in.'' ''Well, the fact is, my
      mother is downstairs with a priest.'' ''Oh! All right; go and bring them up;
      but be careful of the porter.''

“I went downstairs and came up again with my mother, who was
      followed by the abbe, and I fancied that I heard other footsteps behind
      us. As soon as we were in the kitchen, Melanie offered us chairs, and we
      all four sat down to deliberate.

“''Is he very ill?'' my mother asked. ''Oh! yes, madame; he will not be
      here long.'' ''Does he seem disposed to receive a visit from a priest?'' ''Oh!
      I do not think so.'' ''Can I see him?'' ''Well—yes madame—only
      —only—those young ladies are with him.'' ''What young ladies?''
      ''Why—why—his lady friends, of course.'' ''Oh!'' Mamma had grown
      scarlet, and the Abbe Poivron had lowered his eyes.

“The affair began to amuse me, and I said: ''Suppose I go in first? I
      shall see how he receives me, and perhaps I shall be able to prepare him
      to receive you.''

“My mother, who did not suspect any trick, replied: ''Yes, go, my
      dear.'' But a woman''s voice cried out: ''Melanie!''

“The servant ran out and said: ''What do you want, Mademoiselle
      Claire?'' ''The omelette; quickly.'' ''In a minute, mademoiselle.'' And coming
      back to us, she explained this summons.

“They had ordered a cheese omelette at two o''clock as a slight
      collation. And she at once began to break the eggs into a salad bowl, and
      to whip them vigorously, while I went out on the landing and pulled the
      bell, so as to formally announce my arrival. Melanie opened the door to
      me, and made me sit down in an ante-room, while she went to tell my uncle
      that I had come; then she came back and asked me to go in, while the abbe
      hid behind the door, so that he might appear at the first signal.

“I was certainly very much surprised at the sight of my uncle, for
      he was very handsome, very solemn and very elegant, the old rake.

“Sitting, almost lying, in a large armchair, his legs wrapped in
      blankets, his hands, his long, white hands, over the arms of the chair, he
      was waiting for death with the dignity of a patriarch. His white beard
      fell on his chest, and his hair, which was also white, mingled with it on
      his cheeks.

“Standing behind his armchair, as if to defend him against me, were
      two young women, who looked at me with bold eyes. In their petticoats and
      morning wrappers, with bare arms, with coal black hair twisted in a knot
      on the nape of their neck, with embroidered, Oriental slippers, which
      showed their ankles and silk stockings, they looked like the figures in
      some symbolical painting, by the side of the dying man. Between the
      easy-chair and the bed, there was a table covered with a white cloth, on
      which two plates, two glasses, two forks and two knives, were waiting for
      the cheese omelette which had been ordered some time before of Melanie.

“''Good-morning, my child; it is rather late in the day to come and
      see me; our acquaintanceship will not last long.'' I stammered out, ''It was
      not my fault, uncle:'' ''No; I know that,'' he replied. ''It is your father
      and mother''s fault more than yours. How are they?'' ''Pretty well, thank
      you. When they heard that you were ill, they sent me to ask after you.''
      ''Ah! Why did they not come themselves?''

“I looked up at the two girls and said gently: ''It is not their
      fault if they could not come, uncle. But it would be difficult for my
      father, and impossible for my mother to come in here.'' The old man did not
      reply, but raised his hand toward mine, and I took the pale, cold hand and
      held it in my own.

“The door opened, Melanie came in with the omelette and put it on
      the table, and the two girls immediately sat down at the table, and began
      to eat without taking their eyes off me. Then I said: ''Uncle, it would
      give great pleasure to my mother to embrace you.'' ''I also,'' he murmure' WHERE id = '47483ce4-df10-44b3-81b8-ab924b78ab8b';
