Alexander Sergueievitch Pushkin came of a noble family, so ancient that
it was traced back to that Alexander Nevsky who, in the thirteenth
century, gained a great victory over the Swedes upon the ice of the
River Neva, in token whereof he was surnamed "Nevsky" of the Neva.

His mother, Nadejda Ossipovna Hannibal, was the grand-daughter of
Abraham Petrovitch Hannibal, Peter the Great''s famous negro. His
father, Surguei Lvovitch Pushkin, was a frivolous man of pleasure.

The poet was born on the 26th of May, 1799, at Moscow. He was an
awkward and a silent child. He was educated by French tutors. A poor
scholar, he read with eagerness whatever he could get in his father''s
library, chiefly the works of French authors. His brother states
that at eleven years old Pushkin knew French literature by heart.
This cannot, of course, be taken[Pg 2] literally; but it shows under what
influence he grew up. In October, 1811, he entered the Lyceum of
Tsarskoe Selo. Among the students a society was soon formed, whose
members were united by friendship and by a taste for literature. They
brought out several periodicals, in which tales and poems formed the
chief features. Of this society (the late Prince Gortchakoff belonged
to it) Pushkin was the leading spirit. His first printed poem appeared
in the Messenger of Europe in 1814. At a public competition in 1815,
at which the veteran poet Derjavin was present, Pushkin read his
"Memories of Tsarskoe Selo." This poem, which contains many beautiful
passages, so delighted Derjavin, that he wished to embrace the young
author; but Pushkin fled in confusion from the hall.

In June, 1817, Pushkin''s free and careless student life ended. After
finishing his course at the Lyceum he went to St. Petersburg, and,
though he entered thoroughly into the dissipated pleasures of its
turbulent youth, he still clung to the intellectual society of such men
as Jukovsky and Karamsin, men occupied in literature, whose friendship
he valued very highly.

At that time society was much disturbed. Political clubs were
everywhere being formed. In every drawing-room new views were freely
and openly advanced; and in these discussions the[Pg 3] satire and brilliant
verse of Pushkin attracted general attention. These at last brought
him into great danger. But Karamsin came to his rescue, and managed
to get him an appointment at Ekaterinoslavl, in the office of the
Chief Inspector of the Southern Settlements. There he remained till
1824, travelling from place to place, first with the Raevskys to the
Caucasus, and thence again with them through the Crimea. This journey
gave him materials for his "Prisoner of the Caucasus," and "Fountain of
Bachtchisarai." Both poems reveal the influence of Byron.

Towards the end of 1820 he went to Bessarabia with his chief, who had
just been appointed viceroy of the province. Once, on account of some
quarrel, this person, Insoff by name, sent Pushkin to Ismail. There the
poet joined a band of gypsies and remained with them for some time in
the Steppes. In 1823 he went to Odessa, having been transferred to the
office of the new governor-general, Count Vorontsoff, who succeeded
Insoff.

Here he wrote part of "Evguenie Onegin," a sort of Russian "Don Juan,"
full of sublime passages and varied by satire and bitter scorn. This
work has lately been formed the subject of a very successful opera
by Tchaikovski, who took from Pushkin''s poems a story now known and
admired by every educated Russian.

The poet, however, did not get on with his new[Pg 4] chief. A scathing
epigram upon Vorontsoff led the count to ask for Pushkin''s removal from
Odessa, "where," he said, "excessive flattery had turned the young
maids head."

Pushkin had to resign; and early in August, 1824, he was sent into
retirement to live under the supervision of the local authorities at
Michailovskoe, a village belonging to his father in the province of
Pskoff. Here the elder Pushkin kept a petty watch over his son, whom he
regarded as a perverted nature and, indeed, a kind of monster.

In October, however, the father left Michailovskoe, and the poet
remained alone with Arina Rodionovna, an old woman who had nursed
him in childhood, and whose tales had first inspired him with a love
of Russian popular poetry. At Michailovskoe, Pushkin continued his
"Evguenie Onegin," finished "The Gypsies," and wrote the drama of
"Boris Godunoff." Here he lived more than two years—years of seclusion
following a long period of town life and dissipation.

These two years spent in the simple, pleasant company of country
neighbours proved a turning point in his career. Now for the first time
he had leisure to look about him, to meditate, and to rest.

He had come into the country with a passionate love for everything
that showed the feeling or fancy of the Russian peasant. His taste
for popular poetry was insatiable. He listened to his[Pg 5] old nurse''s
stories, collected and noted down songs, studied the habits and customs
of Russian villages, and began a serious study of Russian history.
All this helped greatly to develop the popular side of his genius. He
afterwards relinquished his earlier models of the romantic school, and
sought a simpler, truer inspiration in the pages of Shakespeare.

Writing to a friend, Bashkin says that he has brought up from the
country to Moscow the two last cantos of "Evguenie Onegin," ready for
the press, a poem called "The Little House at Kolomna," and several
dramatic scenes, including "The Miser Knight," "Mozart and Salieri,"
"The Beast during the Plague" and "The Commander''s Statue."

"Besides that," he goes on to say, "I have written about thirty short
poems, Nor is that, all, I have also (a great secret) written some
prose—five short tales."

Fortunately for him, Pushkin was living in the country, when, in
December, 1825, the insurrection and military revolt against the
Emperor Nicholas, who had just ascended the throne, broke out at St.
Petersburg.

Pushkin was affiliated to the secret society, with Pestle and Ryleieff
at its head, which had organised the rebellion; and, on receiving
a summons from his confederates, he started for the[Pg 6] capital. So,
at least, says Alexander Herzen in his curious "Development of
Revolutionary Ideas in Russia." On leaving his country house, Pushkin
met three ill omens. First a hare crossed his path, next he saw a
priest, and, finally, he met a funeral. He went on, however, towards
Moscow, and there learned that the insurrection had been crushed. The
five principal leaders were executed, and whole families were exiled to
Siberia.

In September, 1826, the Emperor Nicholas had an interview with Pushkin
at Moscow. Pushkin replied simply and frankly to all the Tsar''s
questions, and the latter at last promised in future to be himself sole
censor of the poet''s works.

Pushkin remained at Moscow till about the end of the winter of 1827,
when he was allowed to go to St. Petersburg. There he afterwards
chiefly resided, returning sometimes to the country to work, usually in
autumn, when his power of production, he said, was strongest.

In the summer of 1829 Pushkin visited the Army of the Caucasus then
operating against the Turks. He describes his experiences in his
"Journey to Erzeroum."

On the 18th of February, 1831, he married Natalia Nikolaevna
Gontcharova, and soon afterwards received a Foreign Office appointment
with a salary of 5,000 roubles.

In August, 1833, meaning to write a novel on[Pg 7] the Pugatcheff
Insurrection, Pushkin paid a short visit to Kazan and Orenburg to
acquaint himself with the locality and collect materials. But his tale,
"The Captain''s Daughter," appeared considerably later.

Pushkin and his wife were invited to the court balls, and the Emperor
was very gracious and attentive to the poet.

This roused the jealousy of the court nobles, though in descent
Pushkin was not inferior to many of them. The studied hauteur of these
personages caused the poet much irritation, and led him to waste much
energy on petty struggles for social precedence. He was, moreover,
constantly in lack of means to meet the expenses attending his
position. Partly on this account he undertook, in 1836, the editorship
of the Contemporary Review, and continued it until his death. In
the four numbers issued under his care, Pushkin published original
articles, besides the translations then so much in vogue.

All the publications of that time were made to serve the personal aims
of their editor. It was useless to seek in them impartiality. Pushkin''s
criticism, however, were independent, and for this reason they made
a deep impression. On starting his Review he had taken great care
to entrust the criticism to a small circle of the most accomplished
writers.

Pushkin''s correspondence throws full light on his character, and
reveals it as frank, sincere, and independent. His letters show that he
had original ideas on literature, on contemporary politics, on social
and domestic relations, and, in short, on every subject. These views
were always clear and independent of party.

During his later years the poet felt a longing for the country. As
early as 1835 he petitioned for some years'' leave in order that he
might retire from the capital. In his last poem, "To my Wife," he says
how weary he is of noisy town existence and how he longs for rest.

At the end of 1836 scandals were circulated at St. Petersburg about
his wife. DantÃ¨s von Heckeeren, an officer in the Horse Guards, began
openly to pay her attention. Pushkin and many of his friends received
anonymous letters maliciously hinting at DantÃ¨s success. DantÃ¨s''s
father, a dissipated old man, threw oil upon the flames. Meeting Madame
Pushkin in society, he did his best to make her quarrel with, and leave
her husband.

All this being repeated to Pushkin, greatly incensed him. He challenged
young Heckeeren, but the latter made an offer to Madame Pushkin''s
sister, and married her. This did little to mend matters. Pushkin
withdrew the challenge, but nursed his hatred for DantÃ¨s, and would not
receive him in his house.

Meanwhile the scandal grew, and the two Heckeerens continued their
persecution of Madame Pushkin. In society, DantÃ¨s was said to have
married the sister-in-law only to pay court to the wife. Pushkin,
always convinced of his wife''s innocence, showed for her the
tenderest consideration. He wrote, however, a very insulting letter
to old Heckeeren after which a duel between Pushkin and the son
became inevitable. It was fought on the banks of the Black Elver,
near the commandant of St. Petersburg''s summer residence. After it
DantÃ¨s Heckeeren, no longer able to remain in Russia, resigned his
commission and went to France, where he took up politics, and, as Baron
d''Heckeeren, was known as a senator in the Second Empire.

Pushkin was already wounded in the body when he fired at DantÃ¨s, and
hit the arm with which DantÃ¨s had guarded his breast.

"At six o''clock in the afternoon," writes Jukovsky, to the poet''s
father, "Alexander was brought home in a hopeless condition by
Lieutenant—Colonel Dansasse, the old schoolfellow who had acted as his
second. The butler carried him from the carriage into the house.

"It grieves you, my friend," said Pushkin, "to see me thus?" Then he
asked for clean linen. While he was undressing, Madame Pushkin, not
knowing what had happened,[Pg 10] wished to come in. But her husband called
out loudly, "N''entrez pas, il y a du monde chez moi." He was afraid
of alarming her. She was not admitted till he was already lying on the
couch.

"How happy I am," were his first words to her; "I am still alive, with
you by my side. Be comforted, you are not to blame. I know it was not
your fault." Meanwhile he did not let her know that his wound was
serious. Doctors were sent for—Scholtz and Sadler came. Pushkin asked
everyone to leave the room.

"I am in a bad way," he said, holding out his hand to Scholtz. After
examining him Sadler went off to fetch the necessary instruments. Left
alone with Scholtz, Pushkin inquired what he thought of his condition.

"It is my duty not to conceal from you even that," replied Scholtz.
"But we shall have the opinion of the other doctors who have been sent
for."

"Je vous remercie; vous avez agi en honnÃªte homme envers moi," said
Pushkin; adding after a pause, "Il faut que j''arrange ma maison."

Whether at that moment he was taking leave of animate or inanimate
friends I know not. After another pause, he said:

He asked for several. When Spaski (another doctor) came near and tried
to give him hope, Pushkin waved his hand in dissent, and from that
moment apparently ceased to think about himself. All his anxiety was
for his wife. By this time Prince and Princess Viasemsky, Turgueneff,
Count Vielgorsky, and myself had come. Princess Viasemsky was with the
wife, who, in terrible distress, glided like a spectre in and out of
the room where her husband lay. He was on a couch with his back to the
window and door, and unable to see her; though every time she entered
or merely stood in the doorway he was conscious of it.

"Is my wife here?" he asked; "take her away." He was afraid to let her
come near him lest she should be pained by his sufferings, though he
bore them with wonderful fortitude.

"What is my wife doing?" he asked once of Spaski. "She, poor thing, is
suffering innocently. Society will devour her!"

"I have been in thirty battles," said Dr. Arendt;[Pg 12] "and I have seen
many men die, but very few like him."

It was strange how in those last hours of his existence he seemed to
have changed. The storm which only a few hours before had raged so
fiercely in him had disappeared, leaving no trace behind. In the midst
of his suffering he recollected that he had the day before received an
invitation to attend the funeral of one of Gretcheff''s sons.

"If you see Gretcheff," he said to Spaski, "give him my kind regards,
and tell him how sincerely I sympathise with him in his affliction."

Asked to confess and to receive the sacrament, Pushkin assented gladly.
It was settled that the priest should be invited to come in the morning.

At midnight, Dr. Arendt came from the palace, where he had been to
inform the Emperor. His Majesty was at the theatre, and Arendt left
instructions that on his return the Emperor should be told what had
occurred. About midnight a mounted messenger arrived for Arendt. The
Emperor desired him to go at once to Pushkin, and read to him an
autograph letter which the messenger brought. He was then to hasten to
the palace and report upon Pushkin''s condition.

"I shall not go to bed; I shall wait up for you," wrote the Emperor
Nicholas. "And bring back my letter."

"If it will be the will of God that we shall not meet again, I send
you my pardon, and advise you to receive the last Christian rites. As
to your wife and children, they need cause you no anxiety. I take them
under my own protection."

The dying man immediately complied with the Emperor''s wish. A priest
was sent for from the nearest church. Pushkin confessed and received
the sacrament with great reverence. When Arendt read the Emperor''s
letter to him, Pushkin took hold of it and kissed it again and again.

"Give me the letter; I wish to die with it. The letter; where is the
letter?" he called out to Arendt, who was unable to leave it with him,
but tried to pacify him by promising to ask the Emperor''s permission to
bring it back again.

At five in the morning the patient''s anguish grew overpowering. The
sufferer began to groan, and Arendt was again sent for. But all efforts
to soothe the pain were futile. Had his wife heard his cries I am
sure she must have gone mad; she could never have borne the agony.
At the first great cry of pain the Princess Viasemsky, who was in
the room, rushed towards her, fearing the effect. But Madame Pushkin
lay motionless on a sofa close to the door which separated her from
her husband''s death-bed.[Pg 14] According to both Spaski and Arendt the
dying man stifled his cries at the moment of supreme anguish, and
only groaned in fear lest his wife might hear him and suffer. To the
last Pushkin''s mind remained clear and his memory fresh. Before the
next great paroxysm he asked for a paper in his own writing and had
it burnt. Then he dictated to Dansasse a list of some debts, but this
exertion prostrated him. When, between the paroxysms, some bread sop
was brought, he said to Spaski:

She entered, dropped on her knees by his side, and after lifting a
couple of spoonfuls to his mouth, leant her cheek against his. He
caressed and patted her head.

His calm expression of face and steady voice deceived the poor wife.
She came out of his room bright with hope. He asked for his children.
They were brought in half asleep: He blessed each one, making the sign
of the cross, and placing his hand on their head; then he motioned to
have them taken away. Afterwards he asked for his friends who were
present. I then approached and took his hand, which was already cold,
and inquired if I should give any message to the Emperor.

On the 29th of January, at three in the afternoon, after two days of
excruciating pain, Pushkin died. His death was regarded throughout
Russia as a public calamity. In St. Petersburg disturbances were
feared. It was thought that the people might lynch Heckeeren and his
son. A secret funeral was arranged. The body was carried into the
church late at night in the presence of some friends and relations;
and in the neighbouring courtyards piquets were stationed. After the
service the corpse was despatched to the province of Pskoff, and
was buried in the monastery of the Assumption at Sviatogorsk, near
Pushkin''s property at Michailovskoe. The Emperor gave about 150,000
roubles to pay his debts and to bring out a complete edition of his
works, besides granting a liberal pension to the widow.

On the 6th of June, 1880, was solemnly unveiled at Moscow a statue of
Pushkin, erected by voluntary subscriptions from all parts of Russia.

Pushkin was slim and of middle height; in childhood his hair was fair
and curly, but afterwards it turned dark brown. His eyes were light
blue, his smile satirical, but good-natured and pleasant; his clever,
expressive face bore evidence of his African descent, as did his quick
and[Pg 16] passionate nature. He was irritable, but kind and full of feeling;
his conversation sparkled with wit and good humour, and his memory was
prodigious. Pushkin, it has already been said, was of ancient lineage,
but no Russian is sufficiently well-born to marry into the Imperial
family, and when quite recently the Grand Duke Michael, grandson of
the Emperor Nicholas, married without permission the granddaughter
of Pushkin, he caused the liveliest dissatisfaction in the highest
quarters. The bride may console herself by the reflection that her
grandfather was, in the words of Gogol, "a rare phenomenon; a writer
who gave to his country poems so admirable that they attracted the
attention of the whole civilised world; a poet who won respect and
love for the language, for the living Russian types, the customs, and
national character of Russia. Such a writer is indeed a rarity."

There was a card party at the rooms of Narumoff, a lieutenant in the
Horse Guards. A long winter night had passed unnoticed, and it was five
o''clock in the morning when supper was served. The winners sat down to
table with an excellent appetite; the losers let their plates remain
empty before them. Little by little, however, with the assistance of
the champagne, the conversation became animated, and was shared by all.

"Oh, I lost, as usual. I really have no luck. I play mirandole. You
know that I keep cool. Nothing moves me; I never change my play, and
yet I always lose."

"Do you mean to say that all the evening you did not once back the red?
Your firmness of character surprises me."

"That fellow never made a bet or touched a card in his life, and yet he
watches us playing until five in the morning."

"It interests me," said Hermann; "but I am not disposed to risk the
necessary in view of the superfluous."

"Hermann is a German, and economical; that is the whole of the secret,"
cried Tomski. "But what is really astonishing is the Countess Anna
Fedotovna!"

"Yes," said Narumoff, "a woman of eighty, who never touches a card;
that is indeed something extraordinary!"

"Just listen. My grandmother, you know, some sixty years ago, went to
Paris, and became the rage there. People ran after her in the streets,
and called her the ''Muscovite Venus.'' Richelieu made love to her, and
my grandmother makes out that, by her rigorous demeanour, she almost
drove him to suicide. In those days women used to play at faro. One
evening at the court she lost, on parole, to the Duke of Orleans,[Pg 19]
a very considerable sum. When she got home, my grandmother removed
her beauty spots, took off her hoops, and in this tragic costume went
to my grandfather, told him of her misfortune, and asked him for the
money she had to pay. My grandfather, now no more, was, so to say, his
wife''s steward. He feared her like fire; but the sum she named made him
leap into the air. He[Pg 20] flew into a rage, made a brief calculation, and
proved to my grandmother that in six months she had got through half a
million rubles. He told her plainly that he had no villages to sell in
Paris, his domains being situated in the neighbourhood of Moscow and
of Saratoff; and finally refused point blank. You may imagine the fury
of my grandmother. She boxed his ears, and passed the night in another
room.

"The next day she returned to the charge. For the first time in her
life, she condescended to arguments and explanations. In vain did she
try to prove to her husband that there were debts and debts, and that
she could not treat a prince of the blood like her coachmaker.

"All this eloquence was lost. My grandfather was inflexible. My
grandmother did not know where to turn. Happily she was acquainted with
a man who was very celebrated at this time. You have heard of the Count
of St. Germain, about whom so many marvellous stories were told. You
know that he passed for a sort of Wandering Jew, and that he was said
to possess an elixir of life and the philosopher''s stone.

"Some people laughed at him as a charlatan. Casanova, in his memoirs,
says that he was a spy. However that may be, in spite of the mystery of
his life, St. Germain was much sought after in good society, and was
really an agreeable man.[Pg 21] Even to this day my grandmother has preserved
a genuine affection for him, and she becomes quite angry when anyone
speaks of him with disrespect.

"It occurred to her that he might be able to advance the sum of which
she was in need, and she wrote a note begging him to call. The old
magician came at once, and found her plunged in the deepest despair.
In two or three words she told him everything; related to him her
misfortune and the cruelty of her husband, adding that she had no hope
except in his friendship and his obliging disposition.

"''Madam,'' said St. Germain, after a few moments'' reflection, ''I could
easily advance you the money you want, but I am sure that you would
have no rest until you had repaid me, and I do not want to get you out
of one trouble in order to place you in another. There is another way
of settling the matter. You must regain the money you have lost.''

"''But, my dear friend,'' answered my grandmother, ''I have already told
you that I have nothing left.''

"He then communicated to her a secret which any of you would, I am
sure, give a good deal to possess."

All the young officers gave their full attention. Tomski stopped to
light his Turkish pipe, swallowed a mouthful of smoke, and then went on.

"That very evening my grandmother went to Versailles to play at the
Queen''s table. The Duke of Orleans held the bank. My grandmother
invented a little story by way of excuse for not having paid her debt,
and then sat down at the table, and began to stake. She took three
cards. She won with the first; doubled her stake on the second, and won
again; doubled on the third, and still won."

"And you mean to say," exclaimed Narumoff, "that you have a grandmother
who knows the names of three winning cards, and you have never made her
tell them to you?"

"That is the very deuce of it," answered Tomski. "She had three sons,
of whom my father was one; all three were determined gamblers, and not
one of them was able to extract her secret from her, though it would
have been of immense advantage to them, and to me also. Listen to what
my uncle told me about it, Count Ivan Ilitch, and he told me on his
word of honour.

"Tchaplitzki—the one you remember who died[Pg 23] in poverty after devouring
millions—lost one day, when he was a young man, to Zoritch about three
hundred thousand roubles. He was in despair. My grandmother, who had no
mercy for the extravagance of young men, made an exception—I do not
know why—in favour of Tchaplitzki. She gave him three cards, telling
him to play them one after the other, and exacting from him at the same
time his word of honour that he would never afterwards touch a card as
long as he lived. Accordingly Tchaplitzki went to Zoritch and asked for
his revenge. On the first card he staked fifty thousands rubles. He
won, doubled the stake, and won again. Continuing his system he ended
by gaining more than he had lost.

The old Countess Anna Fedotovna was in her dressing-room, seated before
her looking-glass. Three maids were in attendance. One held her pot of
rouge, another a box of black pins, a third[Pg 24] an enormous lace cap, with
flaming ribbons. The Countess had no longer the slightest pretence to
beauty, but she preserved all the habits of her[Pg 25] youth. She dressed in
the style of fifty years before, and gave as much time and attention to
her toilet as a fashionable beauty of the last century. Her companion
was working at a frame in a corner of the window.

"Good morning, grandmother," said the young officer, as he entered the
dressing-room. "Good morning, Mademoiselle Lise. Grandmother, I have
come to ask you a favour."

"I want to introduce to you one of my friends, and to ask you to give
him an invitation to your ball."

"Certainly. It was delightful! We danced until five o''clock in the
morning. Mademoiselle Eletzki was charming."

"My dear nephew, you are really not difficult to please. As to beauty,
you should have seen her grandmother, the Princess Daria Petrovna. But
she must be very old the Princess Daria Petrovna!"

The young lady who acted as companion raised her head and made a sign
to the officer, who then remembered that it was an understood thing to
conceal from the Princess the death of any of her contemporaries. He
bit his lips. The Countess,[Pg 26] however, was not in any way disturbed on
hearing that her old friend was no longer in this world.

"Dead!" she said, "and I never knew it! We were maids of honour in
the same year, and when we were presented, the Empress''"—and the
old Countess related for the hundredth time an anecdote of her young
days. "Paul," she said, as she finished her story, "help me to get up.
Lisaveta, where is my snuff-box?"

And, followed by the three maids, she went behind a great screen to
finish her toilet. Tomski was now alone with the companion.

"Paul," cried the Countess from behind the screen, "send me a new
novel; no matter what. Only see that it is not in the style of the
present day."

"A novel in which the hero strangles neither his father nor his mother,
and in which no one[Pg 27][Pg 28] gets drowned. Nothing frightens me so much as the
idea of getting drowned."

"I will not forget, grandmother. I am in a great hurry. Good-bye,
Lisaveta. What made you fancy Narumoff was in the Engineers?" and
Tomski took his departure.

Lisaveta, left alone, took out her embroidery, and sat down close to
the window. Immediately afterwards, in the street, at the corner of a
neighbouring house, appeared a young officer. The sight of him made the
companion blush to her ears. She lowered her head, and almost concealed
it in the canvas. At this moment the Counters returned, fully dressed.

"Louder," said the Countess. "What is the matter with you? Have you a
cold? Wait a moment; bring me that stool. A little closer; that will
do."

"Throw that stupid book away," said the Countess. "What nonsense! Send
it back to Prince Paul, and tell him I am much obliged to him; and the
carriage, is it never coming?

Lisaveta ran to her room. She had scarcely been there two minutes when
the Countess rang with all her might. Her maids rushed in at one door
and her valet at the other.

"You do not seem to hear me when I ring," she cried. "Go and tell
Lisaveta that I am waiting for her."

"At last, miss," cried the Countess. "But what is that you have got on?
and why? For whom are you dressing? What sort of weather is it? Quite
stormy, I believe."

"What do you know about it? Open the ventilator. Just what I told you!
A frightful wind, and as icy as can be. Unharness the horses. Lisaveta,
my child, we will not go out to-day. It was scarcely worth while to
dress so much."

Lisaveta Ivanovna was, in fact, a most unhappy creature. "The bread of
the stranger is bitter," says Dante, "and his staircase hard to climb."
But who can tell the torments of a poor little companion attached to
an old lady of quality? The Countess had all the caprices of a woman
spoilt by the world. She was avaricious and egotistical, and thought
all the more of herself now that she had ceased to play an active part
in society. She never missed a ball, and she dressed and painted in the
style of a bygone age. She remained in a corner of the room, where she
seemed to have been placed expressly[Pg 31] to serve as a scarecrow. Every
one on coming in went to her and made her a low bow, but this ceremony
once at an end no one spoke a word to her. She received the whole city
at her house, observing the strictest etiquette, and never failing to
give to everyone his or her proper name. Her innumerable servants,
growing pale and fat in the ante-chamber, did absolutely as they liked,
so that that the house was pillaged as if its owner were really dead.
Lisaveta passed her life in continual torture. If she made tea she was
reproached with wasting the sugar. If she read a novel to the Countess
she was held responsible for all the absurdities of the author. If she
went out with the noble lady for a walk or drive, it was she who was to
blame if the weather was bad or the pavement muddy. Her salary, more
than modest, was never punctually paid, and she was expected to dress
"like every one else," that is to say, like very few people indeed.
When she went into society her position was sad. Everyone knew her; no
one paid her any attention. At a ball she sometimes danced, but only
when a vis-Ã -vis was wanted. Women would come up to her, take her by
the arm, and lead her out of the room if their dress required attending
to. She had her portion of self-respect, and felt deeply the misery
of her position. She looked with impatience for a liberator to break
her chain. But the young[Pg 32] men, prudent in the midst of their affected
giddiness, took care not to honour her with their attentions, though
Lisaveta Ivanovna was a hundred times prettier than the shameless or
stupid girls whom they surrounded with their homage. More than once
she slunk away from the splendour of the drawing-room to shut herself
up alone in her little bed-room, furnished with an old screen and a
pieced carpet, a chest of drawers, a small looking-glass, and a wooden
bedstead. There she shed tears at her ease by the light of a tallow
candle in a tin candlestick.

One morning—it was two days after the party at Narumoff''s, and a
week before the scene we have just sketched—Lisaveta was sitting at
her embroidery before the window, when, looking carelessly into the
street, she saw an officer, in the uniform of the Engineers, standing
motionless with his eyes fixed upon her. She lowered her head, and
applied herself to her work more attentively than ever. Five minutes
afterwards she locked mechanically into the street, and the officer was
still in the same place. Not being in the habit of exchanging glances
with young men who passed by her window, she remained with her eyes
fixed on her work for nearly two hours, until she was told that lunch
was ready. She got up to put her embroidery away, and[Pg 33] while doing so,
looked into the street, and saw the officer still in the same place.
This seemed to her very strange. After lunch she went to the window
with a certain emotion, but the officer of Engineers was no longer in
the street.

She thought no more of him. But two days afterwards, just as she was
getting into the carriage with the Countess, she saw him once more,
standing straight before the door. His face was half concealed by a fur
collar, but his black eyes sparkled beneath his helmet. Lisaveta was
afraid, without knowing why, and she trembled as she took her seat in
the carriage.

On returning home, she rushed with a beating heart towards the
window. The officer was in his habitual place, with his eyes fixed
ardently upon her. She at once withdrew, burning at the same time with
curiosity, and moved by a strange feeling which she now experienced for
the first time.

No day now passed but the young officer showed himself beneath the
window. Before long a dumb acquaintance was established between them.
Sitting at her work she felt his presence, and when she raised her head
she looked at him for a long time every day. The young man seemed full
of gratitude for these innocent favours.

She observed, with the deep and rapid perceptions of youth, that a
sudden redness covered the officer''s pale cheeks as soon as their eyes
met. After about a week she would smile at seeing him for the first
time.

When Tomski asked his grandmother''s permission to present one of his
friends, the heart of the poor young girl beat strongly, and when she[Pg 35]
heard that it was Narumoff, she bitterly repented having compromised
her secret by letting it out to a giddy young man like Paul.

Hermann was the son of a German settled in Russia, from whom he had
inherited a small sum of money. Firmly resolved to preserve his
independence, he had made it a principle not to touch his private
income. He lived on his pay, and did not allow himself the slightest
luxury. He was not very communicative; and his reserve rendered it
difficult for his comrades to amuse themselves at his expense.

Under an assumed calm he concealed strong passions and a
highly-imaginative disposition. But he was always master of himself,
and kept himself free from the ordinary faults of young men. Thus, a
gambler by temperament, he never touched a card, feeling, as he himself
said, that his position did not allow him to "risk the necessary in
view of the superfluous." Yet he would pass entire nights before a
card-table, watching with feverish anxiety the rapid changes of the
game. The anecdote of Count St. Germaines three cards had struck his
imagination, and he did nothing but think of it all that night.

"If," he said to himself next day as he was walking along the streets
of St. Petersburg, "if she would only tell me her secret—if she would
only name the three winning cards! I must get[Pg 36] presented to her, that I
may pay my court and gain her confidence. Yes! And she is eighty-seven!
She may die this week—to-morrow perhaps. But after all, is there a
word of truth in the story? No! Economy, Temperance, Work; these are
my three winning cards. With them I can double my capital; increase it
tenfold. They alone can ensure my independence and prosperity."

Dreaming in this way as he walked along, his attention was attracted by
a house built in an antiquated style of architecture. The street was
full of carriages, which passed one by one before the old house, now
brilliantly illuminated. As the people stepped out of the carriages
Hermann saw now the little feet of a young woman, now the military boot
of a general. Then came a clocked stocking; then, again, a diplomatic
pump. Fur-lined cloaks and coats passed in procession before a gigantic
porter.

Hermann started. The story of the three cards came once more upon his
imagination. He walked to and fro before the house, thinking of the
woman to whom it belonged, of her wealth and her mysterious power. At
last he returned to his den. But for some time he could not get to
sleep; and[Pg 37] when at last sleep came upon him, he saw, dancing before
his eyes, cards, a green table, and heaps of rubles and bank-notes.
He saw himself doubling stake after stake, always winning, and then
filling his pockets with piles of coin, and stuffing his pocket-book
with countless bank-notes. When he awoke, he sighed to find that his
treasures were but creations of a disordered fancy; and, to drive such
thoughts from him, he went out for a walk. But he had not gone far when
he found himself once more before the house of the Countess. He seemed
to have been attracted there by some irresistible force. He stopped,
and looked up at the windows. There he saw a girl''s head with beautiful
black hair, leaning gracefully over a book or an embroidery-frame. The
head was lifted, and he saw a fresh complexion and black eyes.

Lisaveta was just taking off her shawl and her bonnet, when the
Countess sent for her. She had had the horses put in again.

While two footmen were helping the old lady into the carriage, Lisaveta
saw the young officer[Pg 38] at her side. She felt him take her by the hand,
lost her head, and found, when the young officer had walked away, that
he had left a paper between her fingers. She hastily concealed it in
her glove.

During the whole of the drive she neither saw nor heard. When they were
in the carriage together the Countess was in the habit of questioning
Lisaveta perpetually.

"Who is that man that bowed to us? What is the name of this bridge?
What is there written on that signboard?"

"What is the matter with you, my child?" she asked. "What are you
thinking about? Or do you really not hear me? I speak distinctly
enough, however, and I have not yet lost my head, have I?"

Lisaveta was not listening. When she got back to the house, she ran to
her room, locked the door, and took the scrap of paper from her glove.
It was not sealed, and it was impossible, therefore, not to read it.
The letter contained protestations of love. It was tender, respectful,
and translated word for word from a German novel. But Lisaveta did
not read German, and she was quite delighted. She was, however,
much embarrassed. For the first time in her life she had a secret.[Pg 39]
Correspond with a young man! The idea of such a thing frightened her.
How imprudent she had been! She had reproached herself, but knew not
now what to do.

Cease to do her work at the window, and by persistent coldness try and
disgust the young officer? Send him back his letter? Answer him in
a firm, decided manner? What line of conduct was she to pursue? She
had no friend, no one to advise her. She at last decided to send an
answer. She sat down at her little table, took pen and paper, and began
to think. More than once she wrote a sentence and then tore up the
paper. What she had written seemed too stiff, or else it was wanting in
reserve. At last, after much trouble, she succeeded in composing a few
lines which seemed to meet the case.

"I believe," she wrote, "that your intentions are those of an
honourable man, and that you would not wish to offend me by any
thoughtless conduct. But you must understand that our acquaintance
cannot begin in this way. I return your letter, and trust that you will
not give me cause to regret my imprudence."

Next day, as soon as Hermann made his appearance, Lisaveta left her
embroidery, and went into the drawing-room, opened the ventilator, and
threw her letter into the street, making sure that the young officer
would pick it up.

Hermann, in fact, at once saw it, and picking it up, entered a
confectioner''s shop in order to read it. Finding nothing discouraging
in it, he went home sufficiently pleased with the first step in his
love adventure.

Some days afterwards, a young person with lively eyes called to see
Miss Lisaveta, on the part of a milliner. Lisaveta wondered what she
could want, and suspected, as she received her, some secret intention.
She was much surprised, however, when she recognised, on the letter
that was now handed to her, the writing of Hermann.

"Impossible!" she cried, alarmed both at the boldness of the request,
and at the manner in which it was made. "This letter is not for me,"
she repeated; and she tore it into a hundred pieces.

"If the letter was not for you, why did you tear it up? You should have
given it me back, that I might take it to the person it was meant for."

"But bring me no more letters, and tell the person who gave you this
one that he ought to blush for his conduct."

Hermann, however, was not a man to give up what he had once undertaken.
Every day Lisaveta received a fresh letter from him, sent now in one
way, now in another. They were no longer translated from the German.
Hermann wrote under the influence of a commanding passion, and spoke a
language which was his own. Lisaveta could not hold out against such
torrents of eloquence. She received the letters, kept them, and at last
answered them. Every day her answers were longer and more affectionate,
until at last she threw out of the window a letter couched as follows:—

"This evening there is a ball at the Embassy. The Countess will be
there. We shall remain until two in the morning. You may manage to
see me alone. As soon as the Countess leaves home, that is to say
towards eleven o''clock, the servants are sure to go out, and there
will be no one left but the porter, who will be sure to be asleep in
his box. Enter as soon as it strikes eleven, and go upstairs as fast
as possible. If you find anyone in the ante-chamber, ask whether the
Countess is at home, and you will be told that she is out, and, in
that case, you must resign yourself, and go away. In all probability,
however, you will meet no one. The Countess''s women are together in a
distant room. When you are once in the ante-chamber, turn to the left,
and[Pg 43] walk straight on, until you reach the Countess''s bedroom. There,
behind a large screen, you will see two doors. The one on the right
leads to a dark room. The one on the left leads to a corridor, at the
end of which is a little winding staircase, which leads to my parlour."

At, ten o''clock Hermann was already on duty before the Countess''s door.
It was a frightful night. The winds had been unloosed, and the snow was
falling in large flakes; the lamps gave an uncertain light; the streets
were deserted; from time to time passed a sledge, drawn by a wretched
hack, on the look-out for a fare. Covered by a thick overcoat, Hermann
felt neither the wind nor the snow. At last the Countesses carriage
drew up. He saw two huge footmen come forward and take beneath the arms
a dilapidated spectre, and place it on the cushions well wrapped up in
an enormous fur cloak. Immediately afterwards, in a cloak of lighter
make, her head crowned with natural flowers, came Lisaveta, who sprang
into the carriage like a dart. The door was closed, and the carriage
rolled on softly over the snow.

The porter closed the street door, and soon the windows of the first
floor became dark. Silence reigned throughout the house. Hermann walked
backwards and forwards; then coming to a lamp he looked at his watch.
It was twenty minutes to eleven. Leaning against the lamp-post, his
eyes[Pg 44] fixed on the long hand of his watch, he counted impatiently the
minutes which had yet to pass. At eleven o''clock precisely Hermann
walked up the steps, pushed open the street door, and went into the
vestibule, which was well lighted. As it happened the porter was not
there. With a firm and rapid step he rushed up the staircase and
reached the ante-chamber. There, before a lamp, a footman was sleeping,
stretched out in a dirty greasy dressing-gown. Hermann passed quickly
before him and crossed the dining-room and the drawing-room, where
there was no light. But the lamp of the ante-chamber helped him to see.
At last he reached the Countess''s bedroom. Before a screen covered with
old icons (sacred pictures) a golden lamp was burning. Gilt arm-chairs,
sofas of faded colours, furnished with soft cushions, were arranged
symmetrically along the walls, which were hung with China silk. He
saw two large portraits painted by Madame le Brun. One represented a
man of forty, stout and full coloured, dressed in a light green coat,
with a decoration on his breast. The second portrait was that of an
elegant young woman, with an aquiline nose, powdered hair rolled back
on the temples, and with a rose over her ear. Everywhere might be seen
shepherds and shepherdesses in Dresden china, with vases of all shapes,
clocks by Leroy, work-baskets, fans, and all the thousand playthings[Pg 45]
for the use of ladies of fashion, discovered in the last century, at
the time of Montgolfier''s balloons and Mesmer''s animal magnetism.

Hermann passed behind the screen, which concealed a little iron
bedstead. He saw the two doors; the one on the right leading to the
dark room, the one on the left to the corridor. He opened the latter,
saw the staircase which led to the poor little companion''s parlour, and
then, closing this door, went into the dark room.

The time passed slowly. Everything was quiet in the house. The
drawing-room clock struck midnight, and again there was silence.
Hermann was standing up, leaning against the stove, in which there was
no fire. He was calm; but his heart beat with quick pulsations, like
that of a man determined to brave all dangers he might have to meet,
because he knows them to be inevitable. He heard one o''clock strike;
then two; and soon afterwards the distant roll of a carriage. He now,
in spite of himself, experienced some emotion. The carriage approached
rapidly and stopped. There was at once a great noise of servants
running about the staircases, and a confusion of voices. Suddenly the
rooms were all lit up, and the Countess''s three antiquated maids came
at once into the bed-room. At last appeared the Countess herself.

The walking mummy sank into a large Voltaire arm-chair. Hermann looked
through the crack in the door; he saw Lisaveta pass close to him, and
heard her hurried step as she went up the[Pg 47] little winding staircase.
For a moment he felt something like remorse; but it soon passed off,
and his heart was once more of stone.

The Countess began to undress before a looking-glass. Her head-dress of
roses was taken off, and her powdered wig separated from her own hair,[Pg 48]
which was very short and quite white. Pins fell in showers around
her. At last she was in her dressing-gown and night cap, and in this
costume, more suitable to her age, was less hideous than before.

Like most old people, the Countess was tormented by sleeplessness. She
had her armchair rolled towards one of the windows, and told her maids
to leave her. The lights were put out, and the room was lighted only by
the lamp which burned before the holy images. The Countess, sallow and
wrinkled, balanced herself gently from right to left. In her dull eyes
could be read an utter absence of thought; and as she moved from side
to side, one might have said that she did so not by any action of the
will, but through some secret mechanism.

Suddenly this death''s-head assumed a new expression; the lips ceased to
tremble, and the eyes became alive. A strange man had appeared before
the Countess!

"Do not be alarmed, madam," said Hermann, in a low voice, but very
distinctly. "For the love of Heaven, do not be alarmed. I do not wish
to do you the slightest harm; on the contrary, I come to implore a
favour of you."

The old woman looked at him in silence, as if she did not understand.
Thinking she was deaf,[Pg 49] he leaned towards her ear and repeated what he
had said; but the Countess still remained silent.

"You can ensure the happiness of my whole life, and without its costing
you a farthing. I know that you can name to me three cards——"

"No, madam," replied Hermann in an angry tone. "Remember Tchaplitzki,
and how you enabled him to win."

The Countess was agitated. For a moment her features expressed strong
emotion; but they soon resumed their former dulness.

The Countess remained silent. "Why keep this secret for your
great-grandchildren," he continued. "They are rich enough without;
they do not know the value of money. Of what profit would your three
cards be to them? They are debauchees. The man who cannot keep his
inheritance will die in want, though he had the science of demons at
his command. I am a steady man. I know the value of money. Your three
cards will not be lost upon me. Come!"

He stopped tremblingly, awaiting a reply. The[Pg 50] Countess did not utter a
word. Hermann went upon his knees.

"If your heart has ever known the passion of love; if you can remember
its sweet ecstasies; if you Pave ever been touched by the cry of a
newborn babe; if any human feeling has ever caused your heart to beat,
I entreat you by the love of a husband, a lover, a mother, by all
that is sacred in life, not to reject my prayer. Tell me your secret!
Reflect! You are old; you Pave not long to live! Remember that the
happiness of a man is in your hands; that not only myself, but my
children and my grandchildren will bless your memory as a saint."

At the sight of the pistol the Countess for the second time showed
agitation. Her head shook violently she stretched out her hands as if
to put the weapon aside. Then suddenly she fell back motionless.

"Come, don''t be childish!" said Hermann. "I adjure you for the last
time; will you name the three cards?"

Lisaveta was sitting in her room, still in her ball dress, lost in
the deepest meditation. On her return to the house, she had sent away
her maid, and had gone upstairs to her room, trembling at the idea of
finding Hermann there; desiring, indeed, not to find him. One glance
showed her that he was not there, and she gave thanks to Providence
that he had missed the appointment. She sat down pensively, without
thinking of taking off her cloak, and allowed to pass through her
memory all the circumstances of the intrigue which had begun such a
short time back, and had already advanced so far. Scarcely three weeks
had passed since she had first seen the young officer from her window,
and already she had written to him, and he had succeeded in inducing
her to make an appointment. She knew his name, and that was all. She
had received a quantity of letters from him, but he had never spoken to
her; she did not know the sound of his voice, and until that evening,
strangely enough, she had never heard him spoken of.

But that very evening Tomski, fancying he had noticed that the young
Princess Pauline, to whom he had been paying assiduous court, was
flirting,[Pg 52] contrary to her custom, with, another man, had wished to
revenge himself by making a show of indifference. With this noble
object he had invited Lisaveta to take part in an interminable mazurka;
but he teased her immensely about her partiality for Engineer officers,
and pretending all the time to know much more than he really did,
hazarded purely in fun a few guesses which were so happy that Lisaveta
thought her secret must have been discovered.

"But who tells you all this?" she said with a smile. "A friend of the
very officer you know, a most original man."

"Hermann is a hero of romance," continued Tomski. "He has the profile
of Napoleon, and the soul of Mephistopheles. I believe he has at least
three crimes on his conscience.... But how pale you are!"

"Hermann is very much displeased with his friend, with the Engineer
officer who has made your acquaintance. He says that in his place he
would behave very differently. But I am quite sure that Hermann himself
has designs upon you. At least, he seems to listen with remarkable
interest to all that his friend tells him about you."

At this moment three ladies came forward according to the custom of
the mazurka, and asked Tomski to choose between "forgetfulness and
regret."[1]

The lady who, in virtue of the infidelities permitted by the mazurka,
had just been chosen by Tom ski, was the Princess Pauline. During the
rapid evolutions which the figure obliged them to make, there was a
grand explanation between them, until at last he conducted her to a
chair, and returned to his partner.

But Tomski could now think no more, either of Hermann or Lisaveta, and
he tried in vain to resume the conversation. But the mazurka was coming
to an end, and immediately afterwards the old Countess rose to go.

Tomski''s mysterious phrases were nothing more than the usual platitudes
of the mazurka, but they had made a deep impression upon the heart of
the poor little companion. The portrait sketched by Tomski had struck
her as very exact; and with her romantic ideas, she saw in the rather
ordinary countenance of her adorer something to fear and admire. She
was now sitting down with her cloak off, with bare shoulders; her head,
crowned with flowers, falling forward from fatigue, when suddenly the
door opened and Hermann entered. She shuddered.

Lisaveta looked at him in consternation, and remembered Tomski''s words:
"He has at least three crimes on his conscience."

So those letters so full of passion, those burning expressions, this
daring obstinate pursuit—all this had been inspired by anything but
love! Money alone had inflamed the man''s soul. She, who had nothing
but a heart to offer, how could she make him happy? Poor child! she
had been the blind instrument of a robber, of the murderer of her old
benefactress. She wept bitterly in the agony of her repentance. Hermann
watched her in silence; but neither the tears of the unhappy girl, nor
her beauty, rendered more touching by her grief, could move his heart
of iron. He had no remorse in thinking of the Countess''s death. One
sole thought distressed him—the irreparable loss of the secret which
was to have made his fortune.

They remained for some time without speaking, without looking at one
another. The day was breaking, and Lisaveta put out her candle. She
wiped her eyes, drowned in tears, and raised them towards Hermann. He
was standing close to the window, his arms crossed, with a frown on
his forehead. In this attitude he reminded her involuntarily of the
portrait of Napoleon. The resemblance overwhelmed her.

"How am I to get you away?" she said at last. "I thought you might go
out by the back stairs. But it would be necessary to go through the
Countess''s bedroom, and I am too frightened."

She went to a drawer, took out a key, which she handed to Hermann, and
gave him the necessary instructions. Hermann took her icy hand, kissed
her on the forehead, and departed.

He went down the staircase, and entered the Countess''s bedroom. She was
seated quite stiff in her armchair; but her features were in no way
contracted. He stopped for a moment, and gazed into her face as if to
make sure of the terrible reality. Then he entered the dark room, and,
feeling behind the tapestry, found the little door[Pg 57] which, opened on
to a staircase. As he went down it, strange ideas came into his head.
"Going down this staircase," he said to himself, "some sixty years ago,
at about this time, may have been seen some man in an embroidered coat
with powdered wig, pressing to his breast a cocked hat: some gallant
who has long been buried; and now the heart of his aged mistress has
ceased to beat."

At the end of the staircase he found another door, which his key
opened, and he found himself in the corridor which led to the street.

[1] The figures and fashions of the mazurka are reproduced in
the cotillon of Western Europe.—TRANSLATOR.

Three days after this fatal night, at nine o''clock in the morning,
Hermann entered the convent where the last respects were to be paid
to the mortal remains of the old Countess. He felt no remorse, though
he could not deny to himself that he was the poor woman''s assassin.
Having no religion, he was, as usual in such cases, very superstitious;
believing that the dead Countess might exercise a malignant influence
on his life, he[Pg 58] thought to appease her spirit by attending her funeral.

The church was full of people, and it was difficult to get in. The
body had been placed on a rich catafalque, beneath a canopy of velvet.
The Countess was reposing in an open coffin, her hands joined on her
breast, with a dress of white satin, and head-dress of lace. Around
the catafalque the family was assembled, the servants in black caftans
with a knot of ribbons on the shoulder, exhibiting the colours of
the Countesses coat of arms. Each of them held a wax candle in his
hand. The relations, in deep mourning—children grandchildren, and
great-grandchildren—were all present; but none of them wept.

To have shed tears would have looked like affectation. The Countess was
so old that her death could have taken no one by surprise, and she had
long been looked upon as already out of the world. The funeral sermon
was delivered by a celebrated preacher. In a few simple, touching
phrases he painted the final departure of the just, who had passed
long years of contrite preparation, for a Christian end. The service
concluded in the midst of respectful silence. Then the relations went
towards the defunct to take a last farewell After them, in a long
procession, all who had been, invited to the ceremony bowed, for the
last time, to her who for so many years had been a scarecrow[Pg 59] at their
entertainments. Finally came the Countess''s household; among them was
remarked an old governess, of the same age as the deceased, supported
by two woman. She had not strength enough to kneel down, but tears
flowed from her eyes, as she kissed the hand of her old mistress.

In his turn Hermann advanced towards the coffin. He knelt down for a
moment on the flagstones, which were strewed with branches of yew. Then
he rose, as pale as death, and walked up the steps of the catafalque.
He bowed his head. But suddenly the dead woman seemed to be staring at
him; and with a mocking look she opened and shut one eye. Hermann by
a sudden movement started and fell backwards. Several persons hurried
towards him. At the same moment, close to the church door, Lisaveta
fainted.

Throughout the day Hermann suffered from a strange indisposition. In a
quiet restaurant, where he took his meals, he, contrary to his habit,
drank a great deal of wine, with the object of stupefying himself. But
the wine had no effect but to excite his imagination, and give fresh
activity to the ideas with which he was preoccupied.

He went home earlier than usual, lay down with his clothes on upon
the bed, and fell into a leaden sleep. When he woke up it was night,[Pg 60]
and the room was lighted up by the rays of the moon. He looked at his
watch; it was a quarter to three. He could sleep no more. He sat up on
the bed and thought of the old Countess. At this[Pg 61] moment someone in
the street passed the window, looked into the room, and then went on.
Hermann scarcely noticed it; but in another minute he heard the door of
the ante-chamber open. He thought, that his orderly, drunk as usual,
was returning from some nocturnal excursion; but the step was one to
which he was not accustomed. Somebody seemed to be softly walking over
the floor in slippers.

The door opened, and a woman, dressed entirely in white, entered the
bedroom. Hermann thought it must be his old nurse, and he asked himself
what she could want at that time of night.

But the woman in white, crossing the room with a rapid step, was now at
the foot of his bed, and Hermann recognised the Countess.

"I come to you against my wish," she said in a firm voice. "I am forced
to grant your prayer. Three, seven, ace, will win, if played one after
the other; but you must not play more than one card in twenty-four
hours, and afterwards, as long as you live, you must never touch a
card again. I forgive you my death on condition of your marrying my
companion, Lisaveta Ivanovna."

With these words she walked towards the door, and gliding with her
slippers over the floor, disappeared. Hermann heard the door of the
ante-chamber open, and soon afterwards saw a white figure pass along
the street. It stopped[Pg 62] for a moment before his window, as if to look
at him.

Hermann remained, for some time astounded. Then he got up and went into
the next room. His orderly, drunk as usual, was asleep on the floor. He
had much difficulty in waking him, and then could not obtain from him
the least explanation. The door of the ante-chamber was locked.

Two fixed ideas can no more exist together in the moral world, than in
the physical two bodies can occupy the same place at the same time; and
"Three, seven, ace" soon drove away Hermann''s recollection of the old
Countess''s last moments. "Three, seven, ace" were now in his head to
the exclusion of everything else.

They followed him in his dreams, and appeared to him under strange
forms. Threes seemed to be spread before him like magnolias, sevens
took the form of Gothic doors, and aces became gigantic spiders.

His thoughts concentrated themselves on one single point. How was he
to profit by the secret so dearly purchased? What if he applied for
leave to travel? At Paris, he said to himself, he would find some
gambling-house where, with his three cards, he could at once make his
fortune.

Chance soon came to his assistance. There was at Moscow a society of
rich gamblers, presided over by the celebrated Tchekalinski, who had
passed all his life playing at cards, and had amassed millions. For
while he lost silver only, he gained bank-notes. His magnificent house,
his excellent kitchen, his cordial manners, had brought him numerous
friends and secured for him general esteem.

When he came to St. Petersburg, the young men of the capital filled
his rooms, forsaking balls for his card-parties, and preferring the
emotions of gambling to the fascinations of flirting. Hermann was taken
to Tchekalinski by Narumoff. They passed through a long suite of rooms,
full of the most attentive, obsequious servants. The place was crowded.
Generals and high officials were playing at whist; young men were
stretched out on the sofas, eating ices and smoking long pipes. In the
principal room at the head of a long table, around which were assembled
a score of players, the master of the house held a faro bank.

He was a man of about sixty, with a sweet and noble expression of
face, and hair white as snow. On his full, florid countenance might
be read good humour and benevolence. His eyes shone with a perpetual
smile. Narumoff introduced Hermann. Tchekalinski took him by the hand,
told him that he was glad to see him, that no one stood on ceremony
in his house; and then went on dealing. The deal occupied some time,
and stakes were made on more than thirty cards. Tchekalinski waited
patiently to allow the winners time to double their stakes, paid what
he had lost, listened politely to all observations, and, more politely
still, put straight the corners of cards, when in a fit of absence some
one had taken the liberty of turning them down. At last when the game
was at an end, Tchekalinski collected the cards, shuffled them again,
had them cut, and then dealt anew.

"Will you allow me to take a card?" said Hermann, stretching out his
arm above a fat man who occupied nearly the whole of one side of the
table. Tchekalinski, with a gracious smile, bowed in consent. Naroumoff
complimented Hermann, with a laugh, on the cessation of the austerity
by which his conduct had hitherto been marked, and wished him all kinds
of happiness on the occasion of his first appearance in the character
of a gambler.

"Allow me to point out to you," said Tchekalinski, with his eternal
smile, "that you are playing rather high. We never put down here, as a
first stake, more than a hundred and seventy-five rubles."

Tchekalinski bowed in token of acceptation. "I only wish to point out
to you," he said, "that although I am perfectly sure of my friends,
I can only play against ready money. I am quite convinced that your
word is as good as gold; but to keep up the rules of the game, and to
facilitate calculations, I should be obliged to you if you would put
the money on your card."

Hermann took a bank-note from his pocket and handed it to Tchekalinski,
who, after examining it with a glance, placed it on Hermann''s card.

A murmur of astonishment ran through the assembly. The banker knitted
his eyebrows, but speedily his face resumed its everlasting smile.

Tchekalinski took a bundle of bank-notes from his pocket-book, and
paid. Hermann pocketed His winnings and left the table.

The next evening he returned to the house. Tchekalinski again held the
bank. Hermann went to the table, and this time the players hastened to
make room for him. Tchekalinski received him with a most gracious bow.
Hermann waited, took a card, and staked on it his forty-seven thousand
roubles, together with the like sum which he had gained the evening
before.

There was a general exclamation. Tchekalinski was evidently ill at
ease, but he counted out the ninety-four thousand roubles to Hermann,
who took them in the calmest manner, rose from, the table, and went
away.

The next evening, at the accustomed hour, he[Pg 67][Pg 68] again appeared. Everyone
was expecting him. Generals and high officials had left their whist to
watch this extraordinary play. The young officers had quitted their
sofas, and even the servants of the house pressed round the table.

When Hermann took his seat, the other players ceased to stake, so
impatient were they to see him have it out with the banker, who, still
smiling, watched the approach of his antagonist and prepared to meet
him. Each of them untied at the same time a pack of cards. Tchekalinski
shuffled, and Hermann cut. Then the latter took up a card and covered
it with a heap of banknotes. It was like the preliminaries of a duel. A
deep silence reigned through the room.

Tchekalinski took up the cards with trembling hands and dealt. On one
side he put down a queen and on the other side an ace.

Hermann looked. Instead of ace, he saw a queen of spades before him. He
could not trust his eyes! And now as he gazed, in fascination, on the
fatal card, he fancied that he saw the queen of spades open and then
close her eye, while at the same time she gave a mocking smile. He felt
a thrill of nameless horror. The queen of spades resembled the dead
Countess!

Hermann is now at the Obukhoff Asylum, room No. 17 a hopeless madman!
He answers no questions which we put to him. Only he mumbles to himself
without cessation, "Three, seven, ace; three, seven, queen!"

We were stationed at the little village of Z. The life of an officer
in the army is well known. Drill and the riding school in the morning;
dinner with the colonel or at the Jewish restaurant; and in the evening
punch and cards.

At Z. nobody kept open house, and there was no girl that anyone could
think of marrying. We used to meet at each other''s rooms, where we
never saw anything but one another''s uniforms. There was only one man
among us who did not belong to the regiment. He was about thirty-five,
and, of course, we looked upon him as an old fellow. He had the
advantage of experience, and his habitual gloom, stern features, and
his sharp tongue gave him great influence over his juniors. He was
surrounded by a certain mystery. His looks were Russian, but his name
was foreign. He had served in the Hussars, and with credit.[Pg 71] No one
knew what had induced him to retire and settle in this out of the way
little village, where he lived in mingled poverty and extravagance. He
always went on foot, and wore a shabby black coat. But he was always
ready to receive any of our officers; and though his dinners, cooked by
a retired soldier, never consisted of more than two or three dishes,
champagne flowed at them like water. His income, or how he got it, no
one knew, and no one ventured to ask. He had a few books on military
subjects and a few novels, which he willingly lent and never asked to
have returned. But, on the other hand, he never returned the books he
himself borrowed.

His principal recreation was pistol-shooting. The walls of his room
were riddled with bullets-a perfect honeycomb. A rich collection of
pistols was the only thing luxurious in his modestly furnished villa.
His skill as a shot was quite prodigious. If he had undertaken to
shoot a pear off some one''s cap not a man in our regiment would have
hesitated to act as target. Our conversation often turned on duelling;
Silvio, so I will call him, never joined in it. When asked if he had
ever fought, he answered curtly, "Yes." But he gave no particulars, and
it was evident that he disliked such questions. We concluded that the
memory of some unhappy victim of his terrible skill preyed heavily upon
his conscience.[Pg 72] None of us could ever have suspected him of cowardice.
There are men whose look alone is enough to repel such a suspicion.

An unexpected incident fairly astonished us. One afternoon about ten
officers were dining with Silvio. They drank as usual, that is to say,
a great deal. After dinner we asked our host to make a pool. For a long
time he refused on the ground that he seldom played. At last he ordered
cards to be brought in. With half a hundred gold pieces on the table we
sat round him, and the game began. It was Silvio''s habit not to speak
when playing. He never disputed or explained. If an adversary made a
mistake Silvio without a word chalked it down against him. Knowing his
way we always let him have it.

But among us on this occasion was an officer who had but lately joined.
While playing he absent-mindedly scored a point too much. Silvio took
the chalk and corrected the score in his own fashion. The officer,
supposing him to have made a mistake, began to explain. Silvio went
on dealing in silence. The officer, losing patience, took the brush
and rubbed out what he thought was wrong. Silvio took the chalk and
recorrected it. The officer, heated with wine and play, and irritated
by the laughter of the company, thought himself aggrieved, and, in a
fit of passion, seized[Pg 73] a brass candlestick and threw it at Silvio, who
only just managed to avoid the missile. Great was our confusion. Silvio
got up, white with rage, and said, with sparkling eyes—

"Sir! have the goodness to withdraw, and you[Pg 74] may thank God that this
has happened in my own house."

We could have no doubt as to the consequences, and we already looked
upon our new comrade as a dead man. He withdrew saying that he was
ready to give satisfaction for his offence in any way desired.

The game went on for a few minutes; but feeling that our host was upset
we gradually left off playing and dispersed, each to his own quarters.
At the riding school next day we were already asking one another
whether the young lieutenant was still alive, when he appeared among
us. We asked him the same question, and were told that he had not yet
heard from Silvio. We were astonished. We went to Silvio''s and found
him in the court-yard popping bullet after bullet into an ace which he
had gummed to the gate. He received us as usual, but made no allusion
to what had happened on the previous evening.

Three days passed and the lieutenant was still alive. "Can it be
possible," we asked one another in astonishment, "that Silvio will not
fight?"

Silvio did not fight. He accepted a flimsy apology, and became
reconciled to the man who had insulted him. This lowered him greatly
in the opinion of the young men, who, placing[Pg 75] bravery above all the
other human virtues and regarding it as an excuse for every imaginable
vice, were ready to overlook anything sooner than a lack of courage.
However, little by little, all was forgotten, and Silvio regained his
former influence. I alone could not renew my friendship with him.
Being naturally romantic I had surpassed the rest in my attachment
to the man whose life was an enigma, and who seemed to me a hero of
some mysterious story. He liked me, and with me alone did he drop his
sarcastic tone and converse simply and most agreeably on many subjects.
But after this unlucky evening the thought that his honour was
tarnished, and that it remained so by his own choice, never left me;
and this prevented any renewal of our former intimacy. I was ashamed to
look at him. Silvio was too sharp and experienced not to notice this
and guess the reason. It seemed to vex him, for I observed that once or
twice he hinted at an explanation; but I wanted none, and Silvio gave
me up. Thenceforth I only met him in the presence of other friends, and
our confidential talks were at an end.

The busy occupants of the capital have no idea of the emotions so
frequently experienced by residents in the country and in country
towns; as, for instance, in awaiting the arrival of the post. On
Tuesdays and Fridays the bureau of the[Pg 76] regimental staff was crammed
with officers. Some were expecting money, others letters or newspapers.
The letters were mostly opened on the spot, and the news freely
interchanged, the office meanwhile presenting a most lively appearance.

Silvio''s letters used to be addressed to our regiment, and he usually
called for them himself. On one occasion, a letter having been handed
to him, I saw him break the seal and, with a look of great impatience,
read the contents. His eyes sparkled. The other officers, each engaged
with his own letters, did not notice anything.

"Gentlemen," said Silvio, "circumstances demand my immediate departure.
I leave tonight, and I hope you will not refuse to dine with me for the
last time. I shall expect you, too," he added, "turning towards me,
without fail." With these words he hurriedly left, and we agreed to
meet at Silvio''s.

I went to Silvio''s at the appointed time and found nearly the whole
regiment with him. His things were already packed. Nothing remained
but the bare shot-marked walls. We sat down to table. The host was in
excellent spirits, and his liveliness communicated itself to the rest
of the company. Corks popped every moment. Bottles fizzed and tumblers
foamed incessantly, and we, with much warmth, wished our departing
friend a pleasant journey and every happiness. The[Pg 77] evening was far
advanced when we rose from table. During the search for hats, Silvio
wished everybody goodbye. Then, taking me by the hand, as I was on the
point of leaving, he said in a low voice:

Sitting down opposite one another we lighted our pipes. Silvio was much
agitated, no traces of his former gaiety remained. Deadly pale, with
sparkling eyes, and a thick smoke issuing from his mouth, he looked
like a demon. Several minutes passed before he broke silence.

"Perhaps we shall never meet again," he said. "Before saying goodbye I
want to have a few words with you. You may have remarked that I care
little for the opinion of others. But I like you, and should be sorry
to leave you under a wrong impression."

"You thought it odd," he continued, "that I did not require
satisfaction from that drunken maniac. You will grant, however, that
being entitled to the choice of weapons I had his life more or less in
my hands. I might attribute my tolerance to generosity, but I will not
deceive you; if I could have chastised him without the[Pg 78] least risk to
myself, without the slightest danger to my own life, then I would on no
account have forgiven him."

"Precisely so, I had no right to endanger my life. Six years ago I
received a slap in the face and my enemy still lives."

"My disposition is well known to you. I have been accustomed to be
first in everything. Prom my youth this has been my passion. In my
time dissipation was the fashion, and I was the most dissipated man
in the army. We used to boast of our drunkenness. I beat at drinking
the celebrated Burtsoff, of whom Davidoff has sung in his poems. Duels
in our regiment were of daily occurrence. I took part in all of them,
either as second or as principal. My comrades adored me, while the
commanders of the regiment, who were constantly being changed, looked
upon me as an incurable evil.

"I was calmly, or rather boisterously, enjoying my reputation when
a certain young man joined our regiment. He was rich, and came of
a distinguished family—I will not name him. Never in my life did
I meet with so brilliant, so fortunate a fellow!—young, clever,
handsome, with the wildest spirits, the most reckless bravery, bearing
a celebrated name, possessing funds of which he[Pg 80][Pg 81] did not know the
amount, but which were inexhaustible. You may imagine the effect he
was sure to produce among us. My leadership was shaken. Dazzled by
my reputation he began by seeking my friendship. But I received him
coldly; at which, without the least sign of regret, he kept aloof from
me.

"I took a dislike to him. His success in the regiment and in the
society of women brought me to despair. I tried to pick a quarrel with
him. To my epigrams he replied with epigrams which always seemed to me
more pointed and more piercing than my own, and which were certainly
much livelier; for while he joked I was raving.

"Finally, at a ball at the house of a Polish landed proprietor, seeing
him receive marked attention from all the ladies, and especially from
the lady of the house, who had formerly been on very friendly terms
with me, I whispered some low insult in his ear. He flew into a passion
and gave me a slap on the cheek. We clutched our swords, the ladies
fainted, we were separated, and the same night we drove out to fight.

"It was nearly daybreak. I was standing at the appointed spot with my
three seconds. How impatiently I awaited my opponent! The spring sun
had risen and it was growing hot. At last I saw him in the distance. He
was on foot, accompanied by only one second. We advanced[Pg 82] to meet him.
He approached, holding in his hand his regimental cap filled full of
black cherries.

"The seconds measured twelve paces. It was for me to fire first. But
my excitement was so great that I could not depend upon the certainty
of my hand, and, in order to give myself time to get calm, I ceded the
first shot to my adversary. He would not accept it, and we decided to
cast lots.

"The number fell to him; constant favourite of fortune that he was! He
aimed and put a bullet through my cap.

"It was now my turn. His life at last was in my hands. I looked at him
eagerly, trying to detect if only some faint shadow of uneasiness. But
he stood beneath my pistol picking out ripe cherries from his cap and
spitting out the stones, some of which fell near me. His indifference
