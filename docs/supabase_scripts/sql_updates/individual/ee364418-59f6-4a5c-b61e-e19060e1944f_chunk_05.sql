UPDATE stories SET original_text = original_text || 'ke the majority of people, his face was not
      absolutely symmetrical, his right eye a little larger than the left, and
      his jaw a trifle heavier on the right side. If you, as an ordinary
      careless person, were to bare his chest and feel his heart beating, you
      would probably find it quite like the heart of anyone else. But here you
      and the trained observer would part company. If you found his heart quite
      ordinary, the trained observer would find it quite otherwise. And once the
      thing was pointed out to you, you too would perceive the peculiarity
      easily enough. It is that Gottfried''s heart beats on the right side of his
      body.

Now, that is not the only singularity of Gottfried''s structure, although
      it is the only one that would appeal to the untrained mind. Careful
      sounding of Gottfried''s internal arrangements by a well-known surgeon
      seems to point to the fact that all the other unsymmetrical parts of his
      body are similarly misplaced. The right lobe of his liver is on the left
      side, the left on his right; while his lungs, too, are similarly
      contraposed. What is still more singular, unless Gottfried is a consummate
      actor, we must believe that his right hand has recently become his left.
      Since the occurrences we are about to consider (as impartially as
      possible), he has found the utmost difficulty in writing, except from
      right to left across the paper with his left hand. He cannot throw with
      his right hand, he is perplexed at meal-times between knife and fork, and
      his ideas of the rule of the road—he is a cyclist—are still a
      dangerous confusion. And there is not a scrap of evidence to show that
      before these occurrences Gottfried was at all left-handed.

There is yet another wonderful fact in this preposterous business.
      Gottfried produces three photographs of himself. You have him at the age
      of five or six, thrusting fat legs at you from under a plaid frock, and
      scowling. In that photograph his left eye is a little larger than his
      right, and his jaw is a trifle heavier on the left side. This is the
      reverse of his present living condition. The photograph of Gottfried at
      fourteen seems to contradict these facts, but that is because it is one of
      those cheap "Gem" photographs that were then in vogue, taken direct upon
      metal, and therefore reversing things just as a looking-glass would. The
      third photograph represents him at one-and-twenty, and confirms the record
      of the others. There seems here evidence of the strongest confirmatory
      character that Gottfried has exchanged his left side for his right. Yet
      how a human being can be so changed, short of a fantastic and pointless
      miracle, it is exceedingly hard to suggest.

In one way, of course, these facts might be explicable on the supposition
      that Plattner has undertaken an elaborate mystification, on the strength
      of his heart''s displacement. Photographs may be faked, and left-handedness
      imitated. But the character of the man does not lend itself to any such
      theory. He is quiet, practical, unobtrusive, and thoroughly sane, from the
      Nordau standpoint. He likes beer, and smokes moderately, takes walking
      exercise daily, and has a healthily high estimate of the value of his
      teaching. He has a good but untrained tenor voice, and takes a pleasure in
      singing airs of a popular and cheerful character. He is fond, but not
      morbidly fond, of reading,—chiefly fiction pervaded with a vaguely
      pious optimism,—sleeps well, and rarely dreams. He is, in fact, the
      very last person to evolve a fantastic fable. Indeed, so far from forcing
      this story upon the world, he has been singularly reticent on the matter.
      He meets enquirers with a certain engaging—bashfulness is almost the
      word, that disarms the most suspicious. He seems genuinely ashamed that
      anything so unusual has occurred to him.

It is to be regretted that Plattner''s aversion to the idea of post-mortem
      dissection may postpone, perhaps for ever, the positive proof that his
      entire body has had its left and right sides transposed. Upon that fact
      mainly the credibility of his story hangs. There is no way of taking a man
      and moving him about in space as ordinary people understand space, that
      will result in our changing his sides. Whatever you do, his right is still
      his right, his left his left. You can do that with a perfectly thin and
      flat thing, of course. If you were to cut a figure out of paper, any
      figure with a right and left side, you could change its sides simply by
      lifting it up and turning it over. But with a solid it is different.
      Mathematical theorists tell us that the only way in which the right and
      left sides of a solid body can be changed is by taking that body clean out
      of space as we know it,—taking it out of ordinary existence, that
      is, and turning it somewhere outside space. This is a little abstruse, no
      doubt, but anyone with any knowledge of mathematical theory will assure
      the reader of its truth. To put the thing in technical language, the
      curious inversion of Plattner''s right and left sides is proof that he has
      moved out of our space into what is called the Fourth Dimension, and that
      he has returned again to our world. Unless we choose to consider ourselves
      the victims of an elaborate and motiveless fabrication, we are almost
      bound to believe that this has occurred.

So much for the tangible facts. We come now to the account of the
      phenomena that attended his temporary disappearance from the world. It
      appears that in the Sussexville Proprietary School, Plattner not only
      discharged the duties of Modern Languages Master, but also taught
      chemistry, commercial geography, bookkeeping, shorthand, drawing, and any
      other additional subject to which the changing fancies of the boys''
      parents might direct attention. He knew little or nothing of these various
      subjects, but in secondary as distinguished from Board or elementary
      schools, knowledge in the teacher is, very properly, by no means so
      necessary as high moral character and gentlemanly tone. In chemistry he
      was particularly deficient, knowing, he says, nothing beyond the Three
      Gases (whatever the three gases may be). As, however, his pupils began by
      knowing nothing, and derived all their information from him, this caused
      him (or anyone) but little inconvenience for several terms. Then a little
      boy named Whibble joined the school, who had been educated (it seems) by
      some mischievous relative into an inquiring habit of mind. This little boy
      followed Plattner''s lessons with marked and sustained interest, and in
      order to exhibit his zeal on the subject, brought, at various times,
      substances for Plattner to analyse. Plattner, flattered by this evidence
      of his power of awakening interest, and trusting to the boy''s ignorance,
      analysed these, and even, made general statements as to their composition.
      Indeed, he was so far stimulated by his pupil as to obtain a work upon
      analytical chemistry, and study it during his supervision of the evening''s
      preparation. He was surprised to find chemistry quite an interesting
      subject.

So far the story is absolutely commonplace. But now the greenish powder
      comes upon the scene. The source of that greenish powder seems,
      unfortunately, lost. Master Whibble tells a tortuous story of finding it
      done up in a packet in a disused limekiln near the Downs. It would have
      been an excellent thing for Plattner, and possibly for Master Whibble''s
      family, if a match could have been applied to that powder there and then.
      The young gentleman certainly did not bring it to school in a packet, but
      in a common eight-ounce graduated medicine bottle, plugged with masticated
      newspaper. He gave it to Plattner at the end of the afternoon school. Four
      boys had been detained after school prayers in order to complete some
      neglected tasks, and Plattner was supervising these in the small
      class-room in which the chemical teaching was conducted. The appliances
      for the practical teaching of chemistry in the Sussexville Proprietary
      School, as in most small schools in this country, are characterised by a
      severe simplicity. They are kept in a small cupboard standing in a recess,
      and having about the same capacity as a common travelling trunk. Plattner,
      being bored with his passive superintendence, seems to have welcomed the
      intervention of Whibble with his green powder as an agreeable diversion,
      and, unlocking this cupboard, proceeded at once with his analytical
      experiments. Whibble sat, luckily for himself, at a safe distance,
      regarding him. The four malefactors, feigning a profound absorption in
      their work, watched him furtively with the keenest interest. For even
      within the limits of the Three Gases, Plattner''s practical chemistry was,
      I understand, temerarious.

They are practically unanimous in their account of Plattner''s proceedings.
      He poured a little of the green powder into a test-tube, and tried the
      substance with water, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and sulphuric acid
      in succession. Getting no result, he emptied out a little heap—nearly
      half the bottleful, in fact—upon a slate and tried a match. He held
      the medicine bottle in his left hand. The stuff began to smoke and melt,
      and then exploded with deafening violence and a blinding flash.

The five boys, seeing the flash and being prepared for catastrophes,
      ducked below their desks, and were none of them seriously hurt. The window
      was blown out into the playground, and the blackboard on its easel was
      upset. The slate was smashed to atoms. Some plaster fell from the ceiling.
      No other damage was done to the school edifice or appliances, and the boys
      at first, seeing nothing of Plattner, fancied he was knocked down and
      lying out of their sight below the desks. They jumped out of their places
      to go to his assistance, and were amazed to find the space empty. Being
      still confused by the sudden violence of the report, they hurried to the
      open door, under the impression that he must have been hurt, and have
      rushed out of the room. But Carson, the foremost, nearly collided in the
      doorway with the principal, Mr. Lidgett.

Mr. Lidgett is a corpulent, excitable man with one eye. The boys describe
      him as stumbling into the room mouthing some of those tempered expletives
      irritable schoolmasters accustom themselves to use—lest worse
      befall. "Wretched mumchancer!" he said. "Where''s Mr. Plattner?" The boys
      are agreed on the very words. ("Wobbler," "snivelling puppy," and
      "mumchancer" are, it seems, among the ordinary small change of Mr.
      Lidgett''s scholastic commerce.)

Where''s Mr. Plattner? That was a question that was to be repeated many
      times in the next few days. It really seemed as though that frantic
      hyperbole, "blown to atoms," had for once realised itself. There was not a
      visible particle of Plattner to be seen; not a drop of blood nor a stitch
      of clothing to be found. Apparently he had been blown clean out of
      existence and left not a wrack behind. Not so much as would cover a
      sixpenny piece, to quote a proverbial expression! The evidence of his
      absolute disappearance as a consequence of that explosion is indubitable.

It is not necessary to enlarge here upon the commotion excited in the
      Sussexville Proprietary School, and in Sussexville and elsewhere, by this
      event. It is quite possible, indeed, that some of the readers of these
      pages may recall the hearing of some remote and dying version of that
      excitement during the last summer holidays. Lidgett, it would seem, did
      everything in his power to suppress and minimise the story. He instituted
      a penalty of twenty-five lines for any mention of Plattner''s name among
      the boys, and stated in the schoolroom that he was clearly aware of his
      assistant''s whereabouts. He was afraid, he explains, that the possibility
      of an explosion happening, in spite of the elaborate precautions taken to
      minimise the practical teaching of chemistry, might injure the reputation
      of the school; and so might any mysterious quality in Plattner''s
      departure. Indeed, he did everything in his power to make the occurrence
      seem as ordinary as possible. In particular, he cross-examined the five
      eye-witnesses of the occurrence so searchingly that they began to doubt
      the plain evidence of their senses. But, in spite of these efforts, the
      tale, in a magnified and distorted state, made a nine days'' wonder in the
      district, and several parents withdrew their sons on colourable pretexts.
      Not the least remarkable point in the matter is the fact that a large
      number of people in the neighbourhood dreamed singularly vivid dreams of
      Plattner during the period of excitement before his return, and that these
      dreams had a curious uniformity. In almost all of them Plattner was seen,
      sometimes singly, sometimes in company, wandering about through a
      coruscating iridescence. In all cases his face was pale and distressed,
      and in some he gesticulated towards the dreamer. One or two of the boys,
      evidently under the influence of nightmare, fancied that Plattner
      approached them with remarkable swiftness, and seemed to look closely into
      their very eyes. Others fled with Plattner from the pursuit of vague and
      extraordinary creatures of a globular shape. But all these fancies were
      forgotten in inquiries and speculations when on the Wednesday next but one
      after the Monday of the explosion, Plattner returned.

The circumstances of his return were as singular as those of his
      departure. So far as Mr. Lidgett''s somewhat choleric outline can be filled
      in from Plattner''s hesitating statements, it would appear that on
      Wednesday evening, towards the hour of sunset, the former gentleman,
      having dismissed evening preparation, was engaged in his garden, picking
      and eating strawberries, a fruit of which he is inordinately fond. It is a
      large old-fashioned garden, secured from observation, fortunately, by a
      high and ivy-covered red-brick wall. Just as he was stooping over a
      particularly prolific plant, there was a flash in the air and a heavy
      thud, and before he could look round, some heavy body struck him violently
      from behind. He was pitched forward, crushing the strawberries he held in
      his hand, and that so roughly, that his silk hat—Mr. Lidgett adheres
      to the older ideas of scholastic costume—was driven violently down
      upon his forehead, and almost over one eye. This heavy missile, which slid
      over him sideways and collapsed into a sitting posture among the
      strawberry plants, proved to be our long-lost Mr. Gottfried Plattner, in
      an extremely dishevelled condition. He was collarless and hatless, his
      linen was dirty, and there was blood upon his hands. Mr. Lidgett was so
      indignant and surprised that he remained on all-fours, and with his hat
      jammed down on his eye, while he expostulated vehemently with Plattner for
      his disrespectful and unaccountable conduct.

This scarcely idyllic scene completes what I may call the exterior version
      of the Plattner story—its exoteric aspect. It is quite unnecessary
      to enter here into all the details of his dismissal by Mr. Lidgett. Such
      details, with the full names and dates and references, will be found in
      the larger report of these occurrences that was laid before the Society
      for the Investigation of Abnormal Phenomena. The singular transposition of
      Plattner''s right and left sides was scarcely observed for the first day or
      so, and then first in connection with his disposition to write from right
      to left across the blackboard. He concealed rather than ostended this
      curious confirmatory circumstance, as he considered it would unfavourably
      affect his prospects in a new situation. The displacement of his heart was
      discovered some months after, when he was having a tooth extracted under
      anaesthetics. He then, very unwillingly, allowed a cursory surgical
      examination to be made of himself, with a view to a brief account in the
      Journal of Anatomy. That exhausts the statement of the material
      facts; and we may now go on to consider Plattner''s account of the matter.

But first let us clearly differentiate between the preceding portion of
      this story and what is to follow. All I have told thus far is established
      by such evidence as even a criminal lawyer would approve. Every one of the
      witnesses is still alive; the reader, if he have the leisure, may hunt the
      lads out to-morrow, or even brave the terrors of the redoubtable Lidgett,
      and cross-examine and trap and test to his heart''s content; Gottfried
      Plattner himself, and his twisted heart and his three photographs, are
      producible. It may be taken as proved that he did disappear for nine days
      as the consequence of an explosion; that he returned almost as violently,
      under circumstances in their nature annoying to Mr. Lidgett, whatever the
      details of those circumstances may be; and that he returned inverted, just
      as a reflection returns from a mirror. From the last fact, as I have
      already stated, it follows almost inevitably that Plattner, during those
      nine days, must have been in some state of existence altogether out of
      space. The evidence to these statements is, indeed, far stronger than that
      upon which most murderers are hanged. But for his own particular account
      of where he had been, with its confused explanations and wellnigh
      self-contradictory details, we have only Mr. Gottfried Plattner''s word. I
      do not wish to discredit that, but I must point out—what so many
      writers upon obscure psychic phenomena fail to do—that we are
      passing here from the practically undeniable to that kind of matter which
      any reasonable man is entitled to believe or reject as he thinks proper.
      The previous statements render it plausible; its discordance with common
      experience tilts it towards the incredible. I would prefer not to sway the
      beam of the reader''s judgment either way, but simply to tell the story as
      Plattner told it me.

He gave me his narrative, I may state, at my house at Chislehurst, and so
      soon as he had left me that evening, I went into my study and wrote down
      everything as I remembered it. Subsequently he was good enough to read
      over a type-written copy, so that its substantial correctness is
      undeniable.

He states that at the moment of the explosion he distinctly thought he was
      killed. He felt lifted off his feet and driven forcibly backward. It is a
      curious fact for psychologists that he thought clearly during his backward
      flight, and wondered whether he should hit the chemistry cupboard or the
      blackboard easel. His heels struck ground, and he staggered and fell
      heavily into a sitting position on something soft and firm. For a moment
      the concussion stunned him. He became aware at once of a vivid scent of
      singed hair, and he seemed to hear the voice of Lidgett asking for him.
      You will understand that for a time his mind was greatly confused.

At first he was under the impression that he was still standing in the
      class-room. He perceived quite distinctly the surprise of the boys and the
      entry of Mr. Lidgett. He is quite positive upon that score. He did not
      hear their remarks; but that he ascribed to the deafening effect of the
      experiment. Things about him seemed curiously dark and faint, but his mind
      explained that on the obvious but mistaken idea that the explosion had
      engendered a huge volume of dark smoke. Through the dimness the figures of
      Lidgett and the boys moved, as faint and silent as ghosts. Plattner''s face
      still tingled with the stinging heat of the flash. He, was, he says, "all
      muddled." His first definite thoughts seem to have been of his personal
      safety. He thought he was perhaps blinded and deafened. He felt his limbs
      and face in a gingerly manner. Then his perceptions grew clearer, and he
      was astonished to miss the old familiar desks and other schoolroom
      furniture about him. Only dim, uncertain, grey shapes stood in the place
      of these. Then came a thing that made him shout aloud, and awoke his
      stunned faculties to instant activity. Two of the boys, gesticulating,
      walked one after the other clean through him! Neither manifested the
      slightest consciousness of his presence. It is difficult to imagine the
      sensation he felt. They came against him, he says, with no more force than
      a wisp of mist.

Plattner''s first thought after that was that he was dead. Having been
      brought up with thoroughly sound views in these matters, however, he was a
      little surprised to find his body still about him. His second conclusion
      was that he was not dead, but that the others were: that the explosion had
      destroyed the Sussexville Proprietary School and every soul in it except
      himself. But that, too, was scarcely satisfactory. He was thrown back upon
      astonished observation.

Everything about him was profoundly dark: at first it seemed to have an
      altogether ebony blackness. Overhead was a black firmament. The only touch
      of light in the scene was a faint greenish glow at the edge of the sky in
      one direction, which threw into prominence a horizon of undulating black
      hills. This, I say, was his impression at first. As his eye grew
      accustomed to the darkness, he began to distinguish a faint quality of
      differentiating greenish colour in the circumambient night. Against this
      background the furniture and occupants of the class-room, it seems, stood
      out like phosphorescent spectres, faint and impalpable. He extended his
      hand, and thrust it without an effort through the wall of the room by the
      fireplace.

He describes himself as making a strenuous effort to attract attention. He
      shouted to Lidgett, and tried to seize the boys as they went to and fro.
      He only desisted from these attempts when Mrs. Lidgett, whom he (as an
      Assistant Master) naturally disliked, entered the room. He says the
      sensation of being in the world, and yet not a part of it, was an
      extraordinarily disagreeable one. He compared his feelings, not inaptly,
      to those of a cat watching a mouse through a window. Whenever he made a
      motion to communicate with the dim, familiar world about him, he found an
      invisible, incomprehensible barrier preventing intercourse.

He then turned his attention to his solid environment. He found the
      medicine bottle still unbroken in his hand, with the remainder of the
      green powder therein. He put this in his pocket, and began to feel about
      him. Apparently he was sitting on a boulder of rock covered with a velvety
      moss. The dark country about him he was unable to see, the faint, misty
      picture of the schoolroom blotting it out, but he had a feeling (due
      perhaps to a cold wind) that he was near the crest of a hill, and that a
      steep valley fell away beneath his feet. The green glow along the edge of
      the sky seemed to be growing in extent and intensity. He stood up, rubbing
      his eyes.

It would seem that he made a few steps, going steeply downhill, and then
      stumbled, nearly fell, and sat down again upon a jagged mass of rock to
      watch the dawn. He became aware that the world about him was absolutely
      silent. It was as still as it was dark, and though there was a cold wind
      blowing up the hill-face, the rustle of grass, the soughing of the boughs
      that should have accompanied it, were absent. He could hear, therefore, if
      he could not see, that the hillside upon which he stood was rocky and
      desolate. The green grew brighter every moment, and as it did so a faint,
      transparent blood-red mingled with, but did not mitigate, the blackness of
      the sky overhead and the rocky desolations about him. Having regard to
      what follows, I am inclined to think that that redness may have been an
      optical effect due to contrast. Something black fluttered momentarily
      against the livid yellow-green of the lower sky, and then the thin and
      penetrating voice of a bell rose out of the black gulf below him. An
      oppressive expectation grew with the growing light.

It is probable that an hour or more elapsed while he sat there, the
      strange green light growing brighter every moment, and spreading slowly,
      in flamboyant fingers, upward towards the zenith. As it grew, the spectral
      vision of our world became relatively or absolutely fainter.
      Probably both, for the time must have been about that of our earthly
      sunset. So far as his vision of our world went, Plattner, by his few steps
      downhill, had passed through the floor of the class-room, and was now, it
      seemed, sitting in mid-air in the larger schoolroom downstairs. He saw the
      boarders distinctly, but much more faintly than he had seen Lidgett. They
      were preparing their evening tasks, and he noticed with interest that
      several were cheating with their Euclid riders by means of a crib, a
      compilation whose existence he had hitherto never suspected. As the time
      passed, they faded steadily, as steadily as the light of the green dawn
      increased.

Looking down into the valley, he saw that the light had crept far down its
      rocky sides, and that the profound blackness of the abyss was now broken
      by a minute green glow, like the light of a glow-worm. And almost
      immediately the limb of a huge heavenly body of blazing green rose over
      the basaltic undulations of the distant hills, and the monstrous
      hill-masses about him came out gaunt and desolate, in green light and
      deep, ruddy black shadows. He became aware of a vast number of ball-shaped
      objects drifting as thistledown drifts over the high ground. There were
      none of these nearer to him than the opposite side of the gorge. The bell
      below twanged quicker and quicker, with something like impatient
      insistence, and several lights moved hither and thither. The boys at work
      at their desks were now almost imperceptibly faint.

This extinction of our world, when the green sun of this other universe
      rose, is a curious point upon which Plattner insists. During the
      Other-World night it is difficult to move about, on account of the
      vividness with which the things of this world are visible. It becomes a
      riddle to explain why, if this is the case, we in this world catch no
      glimpse of the Other-World. It is due, perhaps, to the comparatively vivid
      illumination of this world of ours. Plattner describes the midday of the
      Other-World, at its brightest, as not being nearly so bright as this world
      at full moon, while its night is profoundly black. Consequently, the
      amount of light, even in an ordinary dark room, is sufficient to render
      the things of the Other-World invisible, on the same principle that faint
      phosphorescence is only visible in the profoundest darkness. I have tried,
      since he told me his story, to see something of the Other-World by sitting
      for a long space in a photographer''s dark room at night. I have certainly
      seen indistinctly the form of greenish slopes and rocks, but only, I must
      admit, very indistinctly indeed. The reader may possibly be more
      successful. Plattner tells me that since his return he has dreamt and seen
      and recognised places in the Other-World, but this is probably due to his
      memory of these scenes. It seems quite possible that people with unusually
      keen eyesight may occasionally catch a glimpse of this strange Other-World
      about us.

However, this is a digression. As the green sun rose, a long street of
      black buildings became perceptible, though only darkly and indistinctly,
      in the gorge, and after some hesitation, Plattner began to clamber down
      the precipitous descent towards them. The descent was long and exceedingly
      tedious, being so not only by the extraordinary steepness, but also by
      reason of the looseness of the boulders with which the whole face of the
      hill was strewn. The noise of his descent—now and then his heels
      struck fire from the rocks—seemed now the only sound in the
      universe, for the beating of the bell had ceased. As he drew nearer, he
      perceived that the various edifices had a singular resemblance to tombs
      and mausoleums and monuments, saving only that they were all uniformly
      black instead of being white, as most sepulchres are. And then he saw,
      crowding out of the largest building, very much as people disperse from
      church, a number of pallid, rounded, pale-green figures. These dispersed
      in several directions about the broad street of the place, some going
      through side alleys and reappearing upon the steepness of the hill, others
      entering some of the small black buildings which lined the way.

At the sight of these things drifting up towards him, Plattner stopped,
      staring. They were not walking, they were indeed limbless, and they had
      the appearance of human heads, beneath which a tadpole-like body swung. He
      was too astonished at their strangeness, too full, indeed, of strangeness,
      to be seriously alarmed by them. They drove towards him, in front of the
      chill wind that was blowing uphill, much as soap-bubbles drive before a
      draught. And as he looked at the nearest of those approaching, he saw it
      was indeed a human head, albeit with singularly large eyes, and wearing
      such an expression of distress and anguish as he had never seen before
      upon mortal countenance. He was surprised to find that it did not turn to
      regard him, but seemed to be watching and following some unseen moving
      thing. For a moment he was puzzled, and then it occurred to him that this
      creature was watching with its enormous eyes something that was happening
      in the world he had just left. Nearer it came, and nearer, and he was too
      astonished to cry out. It made a very faint fretting sound as it came
      close to him. Then it struck his face with a gentle pat—its touch
      was very cold—and drove past him, and upward towards the crest of
      the hill.

An extraordinary conviction flashed across Plattner''s mind that this head
      had a strong likeness to Lidgett. Then he turned his attention to the
      other heads that were now swarming thickly up the hill-side. None made the
      slightest sign of recognition. One or two, indeed, came close to his head
      and almost followed the example of the first, but he dodged convulsively
      out of the way. Upon most of them he saw the same expression of unavailing
      regret he had seen upon the first, and heard the same faint sounds of
      wretchedness from them. One or two wept, and one rolling swiftly uphill
      wore an expression of diabolical rage. But others were cold, and several
      had a look of gratified interest in their eyes. One, at least, was almost
      in an ecstasy of happiness. Plattner does not remember that he recognised
      any more likenesses in those he saw at this time.

For several hours, perhaps, Plattner watched these strange things
      dispersing themselves over the hills, and not till long after they had
      ceased to issue from the clustering black buildings in the gorge, did he
      resume his downward climb. The darkness about him increased so much that
      he had a difficulty in stepping true. Overhead the sky was now a bright,
      pale green. He felt neither hunger nor thirst. Later, when he did, he
      found a chilly stream running down the centre of the gorge, and the rare
      moss upon the boulders, when he tried it at last in desperation, was good
      to eat.

He groped about among the tombs that ran down the gorge, seeking vaguely
      for some clue to these inexplicable things. After a long time he came to
      the entrance of the big mausoleum-like building from which the heads had
      issued. In this he found a group of green lights burning upon a kind of
      basaltic altar, and a bell-rope from a belfry overhead hanging down into
      the centre of the place. Round the wall ran a lettering of fire in a
      character unknown to him. While he was still wondering at the purport of
      these things, he heard the receding tramp of heavy feet echoing far down
      the street. He ran out into the darkness again, but he could see nothing.
      He had a mind to pull the bell-rope, and finally decided to follow the
      footsteps. But, although he ran far, he never overtook them; and his
      shouting was of no avail. The gorge seemed to extend an interminable
      distance. It was as dark as earthly starlight throughout its length, while
      the ghastly green day lay along the upper edge of its precipices. There
      were none of the heads, now, below. They were all, it seemed, busily
      occupied along the upper slopes. Looking up, he saw them drifting hither
      and thither, some hovering stationary, some flying swiftly through the
      air. It reminded him, he said, of "big snowflakes"; only these were black
      and pale green.

In pursuing the firm, undeviating footsteps that he never overtook, in
      groping into new regions of this endless devil''s dyke, in clambering up
      and down the pitiless heights, in wandering about the summits, and in
      watching the drifting faces, Plattner states that he spent the better part
      of seven or eight days. He did not keep count, he says. Though once or
      twice he found eyes watching him, he had word with no living soul. He
      slept among the rocks on the hillside. In the gorge things earthly were
      invisible, because, from the earthly standpoint, it was far underground.
      On the altitudes, so soon as the earthly day began, the world became
      visible to him. He found himself sometimes stumbling over the dark green
      rocks, or arresting himself on a precipitous brink, while all about him
      the green branches of the Sussexville lanes were swaying; or, again, he
      seemed to be walking through the Sussexville streets, or watching unseen
      the private business of some household. And then it was he discovered,
      that to almost every human being in our world there pertained some of
      these drifting heads; that everyone in the world is watched intermittently
      by these helpless disembodiments.

What are they—these Watchers of the Living? Plattner never learned.
      But two, that presently found and followed him, were like his childhood''s
      memory of his father and mother. Now and then other faces turned their
      eyes upon him: eyes like those of dead people who had swayed him, or
      injured him, or helped him in his youth and manhood. Whenever they looked
      at him, Plattner was overcome with a strange sense of responsibility. To
      his mother he ventured to speak; but she made no answer. She looked sadly,
      steadfastly, and tenderly—a little reproachfully, too, it seemed—into
      his eyes.

He simply tells this story: he does not endeavour to explain. We are left
      to surmise who these Watchers of the Living may be, or, if they are indeed
      the Dead, why they should so closely and passionately watch a world they
      have left for ever. It may be—indeed to my mind it seems just—that,
      when our life has closed, when evil or good is no longer a choice for us,
      we may still have to witness the working out of the train of consequences
      we have laid. If human souls continue after death, then surely human
      interests continue after death. But that is merely my own guess at the
      meaning of the things seen. Plattner offers no interpretation, for none
      was given him. It is well the reader should understand this clearly. Day
      after day, with his head reeling, he wandered about this strange lit world
      outside the world, weary and, towards the end, weak and hungry. By day—by
      our earthly day, that is—the ghostly vision of the old familiar
      scenery of Sussexville, all about him, irked and worried him. He could not
      see where to put his feet, and ever and again with a chilly touch one of
      these Watching Souls would come against his face. And after dark the
      multitude of these Watchers about him, and their intent distress, confused
      his mind beyond describing. A great longing to return to the earthly life
      that was so near and yet so remote consumed him. The unearthliness of
      things about him produced a positively painful mental distress. He was
      worried beyond describing by his own particular followers. He would shout
      at them to desist from staring at him, scold at them, hurry away from
      them. They were always mute and intent. Run as he might over the uneven
      ground, they followed his destinies.

On the ninth day, towards evening, Plattner heard the invisible footsteps
      approaching, far away down the gorge. He was then wandering over the broad
      crest of the same hill upon which he had fallen in his entry into this
      strange Other-World of his. He turned to hurry down into the gorge,
      feeling his way hastily, and was arrested by the sight of the thing that
      was happening in a room in a back street near the school. Both of the
      people in the room he knew by sight. The windows were open, the blinds up,
      and the setting sun shone clearly into it, so that it came out quite
      brightly at first, a vivid oblong of room, lying like a magic-lantern
      picture upon the black landscape and the livid green dawn. In addition to
      the sunlight, a candle had just been lit in the room.

On the bed lay a lank man, his ghastly white face terrible upon the
      tumbled pillow. His clenched hands were raised above his head. A little
      table beside the bed carried a few medicine bottles, some toast and water,
      and an empty glass. Every now and then the lank man''s lips fell apart, to
      indicate a word he could not articulate. But the woman did not notice that
      he wanted anything, because she was busy turning out papers from an
      old-fashioned bureau in the opposite corner of the room. At first the
      picture was very vivid indeed, but as the green dawn behind it grew
      brighter and brighter, so it became fainter and more and more transparent.

As the echoing footsteps paced nearer and nearer, those footsteps that
      sound so loud in that Other-World and come so silently in this, Plattner
      perceived about him a great multitude of dim faces gathering together out
      of the darkness and watching the two people in the room. Never before had
      he seen so many of the Watchers of the Living. A multitude had eyes only
      for the sufferer in the room, another multitude, in infinite anguish,
      watched the woman as she hunted with greedy eyes for something she could
      not find. They crowded about Plattner, they came across his sight and
      buffeted his face, the noise of their unavailing regrets was all about
      him. He saw clearly only now and then. At other times the picture quivered
      dimly, through the veil of green reflections upon their movements. In the
      room it must have been very still, and Plattner says the candle flame
      streamed up into a perfectly vertical line of smoke, but in his ears each
      footfall and its echoes beat like a clap of thunder. And the faces! Two,
      more particularly near the woman''s: one a woman''s also, white and
      clear-featured, a face which might have once been cold and hard, but which
      was now softened by the touch of a wisdom strange to earth. The other
      might have been the woman''s father. Both were evidently absorbed in the
      contemplation of some act of hateful meanness, so it seemed, which they
      could no longer guard against and prevent. Behind were others, teachers,
      it may be, who had taught ill, friends whose influence had failed. And
      over the man, too—a multitude, but none that seemed to be parents or
      teachers! Faces that might once have been coarse, now purged to strength
      by sorrow! And in the forefront one face, a girlish one, neither angry nor
      remorseful, but merely patient and weary, and, as it seemed to Plattner,
      waiting for relief. His powers of description fail him at the memory of
      this multitude of ghastly countenances. They gathered on the stroke of the
      bell. He saw them all in the space of a second. It would seem that he was
      so worked on by his excitement that, quite involuntarily, his restless
      fingers took the bottle of green powder out of his pocket and held it
      before him. But he does not remember that.

Abruptly the footsteps ceased. He waited for the next, and there was
      silence, and then suddenly, cutting through the unexpected stillness like
      a keen, thin blade, came the first stroke of the bell. At that the
      multitudinous faces swayed to and fro, and a louder crying began all about
      him. The woman did not hear; she was burning something now in the candle
      flame. At the second stroke everything grew dim, and a breath of wind, icy
      cold, blew through the host of watchers. They swirled about him like an
      eddy of dead leaves in the spring, and at the third stroke something was
      extended through them to the bed. You have heard of a beam of light. This
      was like a beam of darkness, and looking again at it, Plattner saw that it
      was a shadowy arm and hand.

The green sun was now topping the black desolations of the horizon, and
      the vision of the room was very faint. Plattner could see that the white
      of the bed struggled, and was convulsed; and that the woman looked round
      over her shoulder at it, startled.

The cloud of watchers lifted high like a puff of green dust before the
      wind, and swept swiftly downward towards the temple in the gorge. Then
      suddenly Plattner understood the meaning of the shadowy black arm that
      stretched across his shoulder and clutched its prey. He did not dare turn
      his head to see the Shadow behind the arm. With a violent effort, and
      covering his eyes, he set himself to run, made, perhaps, twenty strides,
      then slipped on a boulder, and fell. He fell forward on his hands; and the
      bottle smashed and exploded as he touched the ground.

In another moment he found himself, stunned and bleeding, sitting face to
      face with Lidgett in the old walled garden behind the school.

There the story of Plattner''s experiences ends. I have resisted, I believe
      successfully, the natural disposition of a writer of fiction to dress up
      incidents of this sort. I have told the thing as far as possible in the
      order in which Plattner told it to me. I have carefully avoided any
      attempt at style, effect, or construction. It would have been easy, for
      instance, to have worked the scene of the death-bed into a kind of plot in
      which Plattner might have been involved. But, quite apart from the
      objectionableness of falsifying a most extraordinary true story, any such
      trite devices would spoil, to my mind, the peculiar effect of this dark
      world, with its livid green illumination and its drifting Watchers of the
      Living, which, unseen and unapproachable to us, is yet lying all about us.

It remains to add that a death did actually occur in Vincent Terrace, just
      beyond the school garden, and, so far as can be proved, at the moment of
      Plattner''s return. Deceased was a rate-collector and insurance agent. His
      widow, who was much younger than himself, married last month a Mr.
      Whymper, a veterinary surgeon of Allbeeding. As the portion of this story
      given here has in various forms circulated orally in Sussexville, she has
      consented to my use of her name, on condition that I make it distinctly
      known that she emphatically contradicts every detail of Plattner''s account
      of her husband''s last moments. She burnt no will, she says, although
      Plattner never accused her of doing so; her husband made but one will, and
      that just after their marriage. Certainly, from a man who had never seen
      it, Plattner''s account of the furniture of the room was curiously
      accurate.

One other thing, even at the risk of an irksome repetition, I must insist
      upon, lest I seem to favour the credulous, superstitious view. Plattner''s
      absence from the world for nine days is, I think, proved. But that does
      not prove his story. It is quite conceivable that even outside space
      hallucinations may be possible. That, at least, the reader must bear
      distinctly in mind.

"I can assure you," said I, "that it will take a very tangible ghost to
      frighten me." And I stood up before the fire with my glass in my hand.

The old woman sat staring hard into the fire, her pale eyes wide open.
      "Ay," she broke in; "and eight-and-twenty years you have lived and never
      seen the likes of this house, I reckon. There''s a many things to see, when
      one''s still but eight-and-twenty." She swayed her head slowly from side to
      side. "A many things to see and sorrow for."

I half suspected the old people were trying to enhance the spiritual
      terrors of their house by their droning insistence. I put down my empty
      glass on the table and looked about the room, and caught a glimpse of
      myself, abbreviated and broadened to an impossible sturdiness, in the
      queer old mirror at the end of the room. "Well," I said, "if I see
      anything to-night, I shall be so much the wiser. For I come to the
      business with an open mind."

I heard the sound of a stick and a shambling step on the flags in the
      passage outside, and the door creaked on its hinges as a second old man
      entered, more bent, more wrinkled, more aged even than the first. He
      supported himself by a single crutch, his eyes were covered by a shade,
      and his lower lip, half averted, hung pale and pink from his decaying
      yellow teeth. He made straight for an arm-chair on the opposite side of
      the table, sat down clumsily, and began to cough. The man with the
      withered arm gave this new-comer a short glance of positive dislike; the
      old woman took no notice of his arrival, but remained with her eyes fixed
      steadily on the fire.

"I said—it''s your own choosing," said the man with the withered arm,
      when the coughing had ceased for a while.

The man with the shade became aware of my presence for the first time, and
      threw his head back for a moment and sideways, to see me. I caught a
      momentary glimpse of his eyes, small and bright and inflamed. Then he
      began to cough and splutter again.

"Why don''t you drink?" said the man with the withered arm, pushing the
      beer towards him. The man with the shade poured out a glassful with a
      shaky hand that splashed half as much again on the deal table. A monstrous
      shadow of him crouched upon the wall and mocked his action as he poured
      and drank. I must confess I had scarce expected these grotesque
      custodians. There is to my mind something inhuman in senility, something
      crouching and atavistic; the human qualities seem to drop from old people
      insensibly day by day. The three of them made me feel uncomfortable, with
      their gaunt silences, their bent carriage, their evident unfriendliness to
      me and to one another.

"If," said I, "you will show me to this haunted room of yours, I will make
      myself comfortable there."

The old man with the cough jerked his head back so suddenly that it
      startled me, and shot another glance of his red eyes at me from under the
      shade; but no one answered me. I waited a minute, glancing from one to the
      other.

"If," I said a little louder, "if you will show me to this haunted room of
      yours, I will relieve you from the task of entertaining me."

"There''s a candle on the slab outside the door," said the man with the
      withered arm, looking at my feet as he addressed me. "But if you go to the
      red room to-night——"

"You go along the passage for a bit," said he, "until you come to a door,
      and through that is a spiral staircase, and half-way up that is a landing
      and another door covered with baize. Go through that and down the long
      corridor to the end, and the red room is on your left up the steps."

"Have I got that right?" I said, and repeated his directions. He corrected
      me in one particular.

"And are you really going?" said the man with the shade, looking at me
      again for the third time, with that queer, unnatural tilting of the face.

"It is what I came for," I said, and moved towards the door. As I did so,
      the old man with the shade rose and staggered round the table, so as to be
      closer to the others and to the fire. At the door I turned and looked at
      them, and saw they were all close together, dark against the firelight,
      staring at me over their shoulders, with an intent expression on their
      ancient faces.

I left the door wide open until the candle was well alight, and then I
      shut them in and walked down the chilly, echoing passage.

I must confess that the oddness of these three old pensioners in whose
      charge her ladyship had left the castle, and the deep-toned, old-fashioned
      furniture of the housekeeper''s room in which they foregathered, affected
      me in spite of my efforts to keep myself at a matter-of-fact phase. They
      seemed to belong to another age, an older age, an age when things
      spiritual were different from this of ours, less certain; an age when
      omens and witches were credible, and ghosts beyond denying. Their very
      existence was spectral; the cut of their clothing, fashions born in dead
      brains. The ornaments and conveniences of the room about them were ghostly—the
      thoughts of vanished men, which still haunted rather than participated in
      the world of to-day. But with an effort I sent such thoughts to the
      right-about. The long, draughty subterranean passage was chilly and dusty,
      and my candle flared and made the shadows cower and quiver. The echoes
      rang up and down the spiral staircase, and a shadow came sweeping up after
      me, and one fled before me into the darkness overhead. I came to the
      landing and stopped there for a moment, listening to a rustling that I
      fancied I heard; then, satisfied of the absolute silence, I pushed open
      the baize-covered door and stood in the corridor.

The effect was scarcely what I expected, for the moonlight, coming in by
      the great window on the grand staircase, picked out everything in vivid
      black shadow or silvery illumination. Everything was in its place: the
      house might have been deserted on the yesterday instead of eighteen months
      ago. There were candles in the sockets of the sconces, and whatever dust
      had gathered on the carpets or upon the polished flooring was distributed
      so evenly as to be invisible in the moonlight. I was about to advance, and
      stopped abruptly. A bronze group stood upon the landing, hidden from me by
      the corner of the wall, but its shadow fell with marvellous distinctness
      upon the white panelling, and gave me the impression of someone crouching
      to waylay me. I stood rigid for half a minute perhaps. Then, with my hand
      in the pocket that held my revolver, I advanced, only to discover a
      Ganymede and Eagle glistening in the moonlight. That incident for a time
      restored my nerve, and a porcelain Chinaman on a buhl table, whose head
      rocked silently as I passed him, scarcely startled me.

The door to the red room and the steps up to it were in a shadowy corner.
      I moved my candle from side to side, in order to see clearly the nature of
      the recess in which I stood before opening the door. Here it was, thought
      I, that my predecessor was found, and the memory of that story gave me a
      sudden twinge of apprehension. I glanced over my shoulder at the Ganymede
      in the moonlight, and opened the door of the red room rather hastily, with
      my face half turned to the pallid silence of the landing.

I entered, closed the door behind me at once, turned the key I found in
      the lock within, and stood with the candle held aloft, surveying the scene
      of my vigil, the great red room of Lorraine Castle, in which the young
      duke had died. Or, rather, in which he had begun his dying, for he had
      opened the door and fallen headlong down the steps I had just ascended.
      That had been the end of his vigil, of his gallant attempt to conquer the
      ghostly tradition of the place, and never, I thought, had apoplexy better
      served the ends of superstition. And there were other and older stories
      that clung to the room, back to the half-credible beginning of it all, the
      tale of a timid wife and the tragic end that came to her husband''s jest of
      frightening her. And looking around that large sombre room, with its
      shadowy window bays, its recesses and alcoves, one could well understand
      the legends that had sprouted in its black corners, its germinating
      darkness. My candle was a little tongue of light in its vastness, that
      failed to pierce the opposite end of the room, and left an ocean of
      mystery and suggestion beyond its island of light.

I resolved to make a systematic examination of the place at once, and
      dispel the fanciful suggestions of its obscurity before they obtained a
      hold upon me. After satisfying myself of the fastening of the door, I
      began to walk about the room, peering round each article of furniture,
      tucking up the valances of the bed, and opening its curtains wide. I
      pulled up the blinds and examined the fastenings of the several windows
      before closing the shutters, leant forward and looked up the blackness of
      the wide chimney, and tapped the dark oak panelling for any secret
      opening. There were two big mirrors in the room, each with a pair of
      sconces bearing candles, and on the mantelshelf, too, were more candles in
      china candlesticks. All these I lit one after the other. The fire was
      laid, an unexpected consideration from the old housekeeper,—and I
      lit it, to keep down any disposition to shiver, and when it was burning
      well, I stood round with my back to it and regarded the room again. I had
      pulled up a chintz-covered arm-chair and a table, to form a kind of
      barricade before me, and on this lay my revolver ready to hand. My precise
      examination had done me good, but I still found the remoter darkness of
      the place, and its perfect stillness, too stimulating for the imagination.
      The echoing of the stir and crackling of the fire was no sort of comfort
      to me. The shadow in the alcove at the end in particular, had that
      undefinable quality of a presence, that odd suggestion of a lurking,
      living thing, that comes so easily in silence and solitude. At last, to
      reassure myself, I walked with a candle into it, and satisfied myself that
      there was nothing tangible there. I stood that candle upon the floor of
      the alcove, and left it in that position.

By this time I was in a state of considerable nervous tension, although to
      my reason there was no adequate cause for the condition. My mind, however,
      was perfectly clear. I postulated quite unreservedly that nothing
      supernatural could happen, and to pass the time I began to string some
      rhymes together, Ingoldsby fashion, of the original legend of the place. A
      few I spoke aloud, but the echoes were not pleasant. For the same reason I
      also abandoned, after a time, a conversation with myself upon the
      impossibility of ghosts and haunting. My mind reverted to the three old
      and distorted people downstairs, and I tried to keep it upon that topic.
      The sombre reds and blacks of the room troubled, me; even with seven
      candles the place was merely dim. The one in the alcove flared in a
      draught, and the fire-flickering kept the shadows and penumbra perpetually
      shifting and stirring. Casting about for a remedy, I recalled the candles
      I had seen in the passage, and, with a slight effort, walked out into the
      moonlight, carrying a candle and leaving the door open, and presently
      returned with as many as ten. These I put in various knick-knacks of china
      with which the room was sparsely adorned, lit and placed where the shadows
      had lain deepest, some on the floor, some in the window recesses, until at
      last my seventeen candles were so arranged that not an inch of the room
      but had the direct light of at least one of them. It occurred to me that
      when the ghost came, I could warn him not to trip over them. The room was
      now quite brightly illuminated. There was something very cheery and
      reassuring in these little streaming flames, and snuffing them gave me an
      occupation, and afforded a helpful sense of the passage of time. Even with
      that, however, the brooding expectation of the vigil weighed heavily upon
      me. It was after midnight that the candle in the alcove suddenly went out,
      and the black shadow sprang back to its place there. I did not see the
      candle go out; I simply turned and saw that the darkness was there, as one
      might start and see the unexpected presence of a stranger. "By Jove!" said
      I aloud; "that draught''s a strong one!" and, taking the matches from the
      table, I walked across the room in a leisurely manner, to relight the
      corner again. My first match would not strike, and as I succeeded with the
      second, something seemed to blink on the wall before me. I turned my head
      involuntarily, and saw that the two candles on the little table by the
      fireplace were extinguished. I rose at once to my feet.

I walked back, relit one, and as I did so, I saw the candle in the right
      sconce of one of the mirrors wink and go right out, and almost immediately
      its companion followed it. There was no mistake about it. The flame
      vanished, as if the wicks had been suddenly nipped between a finger and a
      thumb, leaving the wick neither glowing nor smoking, but black. While I
      stood gaping, the candle at the foot of the bed went out, and the shadows
      seemed to take another step towards me.

"What''s up?" I cried, with a queer high note getting into my voice
      somehow. At that the candle on the wardrobe went out, and the one I had
      relit in the alcove followed.

"Steady on!" I said. "These candles are wanted," speaking with a
      half-hysterical facetiousness, and scratching away at a match the while
      for the mantel candlesticks. My hands trembled so much that twice I missed
      the rough paper of the matchbox. As the mantel emerged from darkness
      again, two candles in the remoter end of the window were eclipsed. But
      with the same match I also relit the larger mirror candles, and those on
      the floor near the doorway, so that for the moment I seemed to gain on the
      extinctions. But then in a volley there vanished four lights at once in
      different corners of the room, and I struck another match in quivering
      haste, and stood hesitating whither to take it.

As I stood undecided, an invisible hand seemed to sweep out the two
      candles on the table. With a cry of terror, I dashed at the alcove, then
      into the corner, and then into the window, relighting three, as two more
      vanished by the fireplace; then, perceiving a better way, I dropped the
      matches on the iron-bound deed-box in the corner, and caught up the
      bedroom candlestick. With this I avoided the delay of striking matches;
      but for all that the steady process of extinction went on, and the shadows
      I feared and fought against returned, and crept in upon me, first a step
      gained on this side of me and then on that. It was like a ragged
      storm-cloud sweeping out the stars. Now and then one returned for a
      minute, and was lost again. I was now almost frantic with the horror of
      the coming darkness, and my self-possession deserted me. I leaped panting
      and dishevelled from candle to candle, in a vain struggle against that
      remorseless advance.

I bruised myself on the thigh against the table, I sent a chair headlong,
      I stumbled and fell and whisked the cloth from the table in my fall. My
      candle rolled away from me, and I snatched another as I rose. Abruptly
      this was blown out, as I swung it off the table by the wind of my sudden
      movement, and immediately the two remaining candles followed. But there
      was light still in the room, a red light that staved off the shadows from
      me. The fire! Of course I could still thrust my candle between the bars
      and relight it!

I turned to where the flames were still dancing between the glowing coals,
      and splashing red reflections upon the furniture, made two steps towards
      the grate, and incontinently the flames dwindled and vanished, the glow
      vanished, the reflections rushed together and vanished, and as I thrust
      the candle between the bars darkness closed upon me like the shutting of
      an eye, wrapped about me in a stifling embrace, sealed my vision, and
      crushed the last vestiges of reason from my brain. The candle fell from my
      hand. I flung out my arms in a vain effort to thrust that ponderous
      blackness away from me, and, lifting up my voice, screamed with all my
      might—once, twice, thrice. Then I think I must have staggered to my
      feet. I know I thought suddenly of the moonlit corridor, and, with my head
      bowed and my arms over my face, made a run for the door.

But I had forgotten the exact position of the door, and struck myself
      heavily against the corner of the bed. I staggered back, turned, and was
      either struck or struck myself against some other bulky furniture. I have
      a vague memory of battering myself thus, to and fro in the darkness, of a
      cramped struggle, and of my own wild crying as I darted to and fro, of a
      heavy blow at last upon my forehead, a horrible sensation of falling that
      lasted an age, of my last frantic effort to keep my footing, and then I
      remember no more.

I opened my eyes in daylight. My head was roughly bandaged, and the man
      with the withered arm was watching my face. I looked about me, trying to
      remember what had happened, and for a space I could not recollect. I
      rolled my eyes into the corner, and saw the old woman, no longer
      abstracted, pouring out some drops of medicine from a little blue phial
      into a glass. "Where am I?" I asked; "I seem to remember you, and yet I
      cannot remember who you are."

They told me then, and I heard of the haunted Red Room as one who hears a
      tale. "We found you at dawn," said he, "and there was blood on your
      forehead and lips."

It was very slowly I recovered my memory of my experience. "You believe
      now," said the old man, "that the room is haunted?" He spoke no longer as
      one who greets an intruder, but as one who grieves for a broken friend.

"And you have seen it. And we, who have lived here all our lives, have
      never set eyes upon it. Because we have never dared... Tell us, is it
      truly the old earl who——"

"I told you so," said the old lady, with the glass in her hand. "It is his
      poor young countess who was frightened——"

"It is not," I said. "There is neither ghost of earl nor ghost of countess
      in that room, there is no ghost there at all; but worse, far worse——"

"The worst of all the things that haunt poor mortal man," said I; "and
      that is, in all its nakedness—Fear that will not have light nor
      sound, that will not bear with reason, that deafens and darkens and
      overwhelms. It followed me through the corridor, it fought against me in
      the room——"

Then the man with the shade sighed and spoke. "That is it," said he. "I
      knew that was it. A power of darkness. To put such a curse upon a woman!
      It lurks there always. You can feel it even in the daytime, even of a
      bright summer''s day, in the hangings, in the curtains, keeping behind you
      however you face about. In the dusk it creeps along the corridor and
      follows you, so that you dare not turn. There is Fear in that room of hers—black
      Fear, and there will be—so long as this house of sin endures."

Mr. Coombes was sick of life. He walked away from his unhappy home, and,
      sick not only of his own existence but of everybody else''s, turned aside
      down Gaswork Lane to avoid the town, and, crossing the wooden bridge that
      goes over the canal to Starling''s Cottages, was presently alone in the
      damp pine woods and out of sight and sound of human habitation. He would
      stand it no longer. He repeated aloud with blasphemies unusual to him that
      he would stand it no longer.

He was a pale-faced little man, with dark eyes and a fine and very black
      moustache. He had a very stiff, upright collar slightly frayed, that gave
      him an illusory double chin, and his overcoat (albeit shabby) was trimmed
      with astrachan. His gloves were a bright brown with black stripes over the
      knuckles, and split at the finger ends. His appearance, his wife had said
      once in the dear, dead days beyond recall—before he married her,
      that is—was military. But now she called him—it seems a
      dreadful thing to tell of between husband and wife, but she called him "a
      little grub." It wasn''t the only thing she had called him, either.

The row had arisen about that beastly Jennie again. Jennie was his wife''s
      friend, and, by no invitation of Mr. Coombes, she came in every blessed
      Sunday to dinner, and made a shindy all the afternoon. She was a big,
      noisy girl, with a taste for loud colours and a strident laugh; and this
      Sunday she had outdone all her previous intrusions by bringing in a fellow
      with her, a chap as showy as herself. And Mr. Coombes, in a starchy, clean
      collar and his Sunday frock-coat, had sat dumb and wrathful at his own
      table, while his wife and her guests talked foolishly and undesirably, and
      laughed aloud. Well, he stood that, and after dinner (which, "as usual,"
      was late), what must Miss Jennie do but go to the piano and play banjo
      tunes, for all the world as if it were a week-day! Flesh and blood could
      not endure such goings on. They would hear next door, they would hear in
      the road, it was a public announcement of their disrepute. He had to
      speak.

He had felt himself go pale, and a kind of rigour had affected his
      respiration as he delivered himself. He had been sitting on one of the
      chairs by the window—the new guest had taken possession of the
      arm-chair. He turned his head. "Sun Day!" he said over the collar, in the
      voice of one who warns. "Sun Day!" What people call a "nasty" tone, it
      was.

Jennie had kept on playing, but his wife, who was looking through some
      music that was piled on the top of the piano, had stared at him. "What''s
      wrong now?" she said; "can''t people enjoy themselves?"

"I don''t mind rational ''njoyment, at all," said little Coombes, "but I
      ain''t a-going to have week-day tunes playing on a Sunday in this house."

"What''s wrong with my playing now?" said Jennie, stopping and twirling
      round on the music-stool with a monstrous rustle of flounces.

Coombes saw it was going to be a row, and opened too vigorously, as is
      common with your timid, nervous men all the world over. "Steady on with
      that music-stool!" said he; "it ain''t made for ''eavy-weights."

"Never you mind about weights," said Jennie, incensed. "What was you
      saying behind my back about my playing?"

"Surely you don''t ''old with not having a bit of music on a Sunday, Mr.
      Coombes?" said the new guest, leaning back in the arm-chair, blowing a
      cloud of cigarette smoke and smiling in a kind of pitying way. And
      simultaneously his wife said something to Jennie about "Never mind ''im.
      You go on, Jinny."

"May I arst why?" said the new guest, evidently enjoying both his
      cigarette and the prospect of an argument. He was, by-the-by, a lank young
      man, very stylishly dressed in bright drab, with a white cravat and a
      pearl and silver pin. It had been better taste to come in a black coat,
      Mr. Coombes thought.

"Because," began Mr. Coombes, "it don''t suit me. I''m a business man. I
      ''ave to study my connection. Rational ''njoyment—"

"His connection!" said Mrs. Coombes scornfully. "That''s what he''s always
      a-saying. We got to do this, and we got to do that—"

"Look here!" said Mr. Coombes, driven at last to revolt, standing up and
      raising his voice. "I tell you I won''t have that." The frock-coat heaved
      with his indignation.

Whereupon they all began talking at once. The new guest said he was
      Jennie''s "intended," and meant to protect her, and Mr. Coombes said he was
      welcome to do so anywhere but in his (Mr. Coombes'') house; and Mrs.
      Coombes said he ought to be ashamed of insulting his guests, and (as I
      have already mentioned) that he was getting a regular little grub; and the
      end was, that Mr. Coombes ordered his visitors out of the house, and they
      wouldn''t go, and so he said he would go himself. With his face burning and
      tears of excitement in his eyes, he went into the passage, and as he
      struggled with his overcoat—his frock-coat sleeves got concertinaed
      up his arm—and gave a brush at his silk hat, Jennie began again at
      the piano, and strummed him insultingly out of the house. Turn, turn,
      turn. He slammed the shop door so that the house quivered. That, briefly,
      was the immediate making of his mood. You will perhaps begin to understand
      his disgust with existence.

As he walked along the muddy path under the firs,—it was late
      October, and the ditches and heaps of fir needles were gorgeous with
      clumps of fungi,—he recapitulated the melancholy history of his
      marriage. It was brief and commonplace enough. He now perceived with
      sufficient clearness that his wife had married him out of a natural
      curiosity and in order to escape from her worrying, laborious, and
      uncertain life in the workroom; and, like the majority of her class, she
      was far too stupid to realise that it was her duty to co-operate with him
      in his business. She was greedy of enjoyment, loquacious, and
      socially-minded, and evidently disappointed to find the restraints of
      poverty still hanging about her. His worries exasperated her, and the
      slightest attempt to control her proceedings resulted in a charge of
      "grumbling." Why couldn''t he be nice— as he used to be? And Coombes
      was such a harmless little man, too, nourished mentally on Self-Help,
      and with a meagre ambition of self-denial and competition, that was to end
      in a "sufficiency." Then Jennie came in as a female Mephistopheles, a
      gabbling chronicle of "fellers," and was always wanting his wife to go to
      theatres, and "all that." And in addition were aunts of his wife, and
      cousins (male and female) to eat up capital, insult him personally, upset
      business arrangements, annoy good customers, and generally blight his
      life. It was not the first occasion by many that Mr. Coombes had fled his
      home in wrath and indignation, and something like fear, vowing furiously
      and even aloud that he wouldn''t stand it, and so frothing away his energy
      along the line of least resistance. But never before had he been quite so
      sick of life as on this particular Sunday afternoon. The Sunday dinner may
      have had its share in his despair—and the greyness of the sky.
      Perhaps, too, he was beginning to realise his unendurable frustration as a
      business man as the consequence of his marriage. Presently bankruptcy, and
      after that—— Perhaps she might have reason to repent when it
      was too late. And destiny, as I have already intimated, had planted the
      path through the wood with evil-smelling fungi, thickly and variously
      planted it, not only on the right side, but on the left.

A small shopman is in such a melancholy position, if his wife turns out a
      disloyal partner. His capital is all tied up in his business, and to leave
      her means to join the unemployed in some strange part of the earth. The
      luxuries of divorce are beyond him altogether. So that the good old
      tradition of marriage for better or worse holds inexorably for him, and
      things work up to tragic culminations. Bricklayers kick their wives to
      death, and dukes betray theirs; but it is among the small clerks and
      shopkeepers nowadays that it comes most often to a cutting of throats.
      Under the circumstances it is not so very remarkable—and you must
      take it as charitably as you can—that the mind of Mr. Coombes ran
      for a while on some such glorious close to his disappointed hopes, and
      that he thought of razors, pistols, bread-knives, and touching letters to
      the coroner denouncing his enemies by name, and praying piously for
      forgiveness. After a time his fierceness gave way to melancholia. He had
      been married in this very overcoat, in his first and only frock-coat that
      was buttoned up beneath it. He began to recall their courting along this
      very walk, his years of penurious saving to get capital, and the bright
      hopefulness of his marrying days. For it all to work out like this! Was
      there no sympathetic ruler anywhere in the world? He reverted to death as
      a topic.

He thought of the canal he had just crossed, and doubted whether he
      shouldn''t stand with his head out, even in the middle, and it was while
      drowning was in his mind that the purple pileus caught his eye. He looked
      at it mechanically for a moment, and stopped and stooped towards it to
      pick it up, under the impression that it was some such small leather
      object as a purse. Then he saw that it was the purple top of a fungus, a
      peculiarly poisonous-looking purple: slimy, shiny, and emitting a sour
      odour. He hesitated with his hand an inch or so from it, and the thought
      of poison crossed his mind. With that he picked the thing, and stood up
      again with it in his hand.

The odour was certainly strong—acrid, but by no means disgusting. He
      broke off a piece, and the fresh surface was a creamy white, that changed
      like magic in the space of ten seconds to a yellowish-green colour. It was
      even an inviting-looking change. He broke off two other pieces to see it
      repeated. They were wonderful things these fungi, thought Mr. Coombes, and
      all of them the deadliest poisons, as his father had often told him.
      Deadly poisons!

There is no time like the present for a rash resolve. Why not here and
      now? thought Mr. Coombes. He tasted a little piece, a very little piece
      indeed—a mere crumb. It was so pungent that he almost spat it out
      again, then merely hot and full-flavoured: a kind of German mustard with a
      touch of horse-radish and—well, mushroom. He swallowed it in the
      excitement of the moment. Did he like it or did he not? His mind was
      curiously careless. He would try another bit. It really wasn''t bad—it
      was good. He forgot his troubles in the interest of the immediate moment.
      Playing with death it was. He took another bite, and then deliberately
      finished a mouthful. A curious, tingling sensation began in his
      finger-tips and toes. His pulse began to move faster. The blood in his
      ears sounded like a mill-race. "Try bi'' more," said Mr. Coombes. He turned
      and looked about him, and found his feet unsteady. He saw, and struggled
      towards, a little patch of purple a dozen yards away. "Jol'' goo'' stuff,"
      said Mr. Coombes. "E—lomore ye''." He pitched forward and fell on his
      face, his hands outstretched towards the cluster of pilei. But he did not
      eat any more of them. He forgot forthwith.

He rolled over and sat up with a look of astonishment on his face. His
      carefully brushed silk hat had rolled away towards the ditch. He pressed
      his hand to his brow. Something had happened, but he could not rightly
      determine what it was. Anyhow, he was no longer dull—he felt bright,
      cheerful. And his throat was afire. He laughed in the sudden gaiety of his
      heart. Had he been dull? He did not know; but at any rate he would be dull
      no longer. He got up and stood unsteadily, regarding the universe with an
      agreeable smile. He began to remember. He could not remember very well,
      because of a steam roundabout that was beginning in his head. And he knew
      he had been disagreeable at home, just because they wanted to be happy.
      They were quite right; life should be as gay as possible. He would go home
      and make it up, and reassure them. And why not take some of this
      delightful toadstool with him, for them to eat? A hatful, no less. Some of
      those red ones with white spots as well, and a few yellow. He had been a
      dull dog, an enemy to merriment; he would make up for it. It would be gay
      to turn his coat-sleeves inside out, and stick some yellow gorse into his
      waistcoat pockets. Then home—singing—-for a jolly evening.

After the departure of Mr. Coombes, Jennie discontinued playing, and
      turned round on the music-stool again. "What a fuss about nothing!" said
      Jennie.
