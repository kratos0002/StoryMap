He intended to lose it somewhere—either at
somebody''s door, or in a public square, or in a
narrow alley; but just then, in order to complete
his bad luck, he was met by an acquaintance,
who showered inquiries upon him. “Hullo,
Ivan Jakovlevitch! Whom are you going to
shave so early in the morning?” etc., so that
he could find no suitable opportunity to do what
he wanted. Later on he did let the nose drop,
but a sentry bore down upon him with his
halberd, and said, “Look out! You have let
something drop!” and Ivan Jakovlevitch was
obliged to pick it up and put it in his pocket.

A feeling of despair began to take possession
of him; all the more as the streets became more
thronged and the merchants began to open their
shops. At last he resolved to go to the Isaac
Bridge, where perhaps he might succeed in
throwing it into the Neva.

But my conscience is a little uneasy that I have
not yet given any detailed information about
Ivan Jakovlevitch, an estimable man in many
ways.

Like every honest Russian tradesman, Ivan
 
Jakovlevitch was a terrible drunkard, and
although he shaved other people''s faces every
day, his own was always unshaved. His coat
(he never wore an overcoat) was quite mottled,
i.e. it had been black, but become brownish-yellow;
the collar was quite shiny, and instead
of the three buttons, only the threads by which
they had been fastened were to be seen.

Ivan Jakovlevitch was a great cynic, and when
Kovaloff, the member of the Municipal Committee,
said to him, as was his custom while being
shaved, “Your hands always smell, Ivan Jakovlevitch!”
the latter answered, “What do they
smell of?” “I don''t know, my friend, but
they smell very strong.” Ivan Jakovlevitch
after taking a pinch of snuff would then, by way
of reprisals, set to work to soap him on the cheek,
the upper lip, behind the ears, on the chin, and
everywhere.

This worthy man now stood on the Isaac
Bridge. At first he looked round him, then he
leant on the railings of the bridge, as though he
wished to look down and see how many fish were
swimming past, and secretly threw the nose,
wrapped in a little piece of cloth, into the
water. He felt as though a ton weight had been
lifted off him, and laughed cheerfully. Instead,
however, of going to shave any officials, he
turned his steps to a building, the sign-board of
which bore the legend “Teas served here,” in
 
order to have a glass of punch, when suddenly
he perceived at the other end of the bridge a
police inspector of imposing exterior, with long
whiskers, three-cornered hat, and sword hanging
at his side. He nearly fainted; but the police
inspector beckoned to him with his hand and
said, “Come here, my dear sir.”

Ivan Jakovlevitch, knowing how a gentleman
should behave, took his hat off quickly, went
towards the police inspector and said, “I hope
you are in the best of health.”

“By heaven, gracious sir, I was on the way
to my customers, and only looked down to see if
the river was flowing quickly.”

“I am willing to shave Your Grace two or
even three times a week gratis,” answered Ivan
Jakovlevitch.

“No, my friend, don''t put yourself out!
Three barbers are busy with me already, and
reckon it a high honour that I let them show me
their skill. Now then, out with it! What were
you doing there?”

Ivan Jakovlevitch grew pale. But here the
strange episode vanishes in mist, and what
further happened is not known.

Kovaloff, the member of the Municipal Committee,
awoke fairly early that morning, and
made a droning noise—“Brr! Brr!”—through
his lips, as he always did, though he could not
say why. He stretched himself, and told his
valet to give him a little mirror which was on the
table. He wished to look at the heat-boil which
had appeared on his nose the previous evening;
but to his great astonishment, he saw that instead
of his nose he had a perfectly smooth vacancy in
his face. Thoroughly alarmed, he ordered some
water to be brought, and rubbed his eyes with a
towel. Sure enough, he had no longer a nose!
Then he sprang out of bed, and shook himself
violently! No, no nose any more! He dressed
himself and went at once to the police superintendent.

But before proceeding further, we must certainly
give the reader some information about
Kovaloff, so that he may know what sort of a man
this member of the Municipal Committee really
was. These committee-men, who obtain that
title by means of certificates of learning, must
not be compared with the committee-men appointed
for the Caucasus district, who are of
quite a different kind. The learned committee-man—but
 
Russia is such a wonderful country
that when one committee-man is spoken of all
the others from Riga to Kamschatka refer it to
themselves. The same is also true of all other
titled officials. Kovaloff had been a Caucasian
committee-man two years previously, and could
not forget that he had occupied that position;
but in order to enhance his own importance,
he never called himself “committee-man” but
“Major.”

“Listen, my dear,” he used to say when he
met an old woman in the street who sold shirt-fronts;
“go to my house in Sadovaia Street and
ask ‘Does Major Kovaloff live here?’ Any
child can tell you where it is.”

Accordingly we will call him for the future
Major Kovaloff. It was his custom to take a daily
walk on the Neffsky Avenue. The collar of his
shirt was always remarkably clean and stiff. He
wore the same style of whiskers as those that are
worn by governors of districts, architects, and
regimental doctors; in short, all those who have
full red cheeks and play a good game of whist.
These whiskers grow straight across the cheek
towards the nose.

Major Kovaloff wore a number of seals, on
some of which were engraved armorial bearings,
and others the names of the days of the week.
He had come to St Petersburg with the view of
obtaining some position corresponding to his
 
rank, if possible that of vice-governor of a
province; but he was prepared to be content with
that of a bailiff in some department or other.
He was, moreover, not disinclined to marry, but
only such a lady who could bring with her a
dowry of two hundred thousand roubles. Accordingly,
the reader can judge for himself what
his sensations were when he found in his face,
instead of a fairly symmetrical nose, a broad,
flat vacancy.

To increase his misfortune, not a single
droshky was to be seen in the street, and so he
was obliged to proceed on foot. He wrapped
himself up in his cloak, and held his handkerchief
to his face as though his nose bled. “But
perhaps it is all only my imagination; it is impossible
that a nose should drop off in such a
silly way,” he thought, and stepped into a
confectioner''s shop in order to look into the
mirror.

Fortunately no customer was in the shop; only
small shop-boys were cleaning it out, and putting
chairs and tables straight. Others with sleepy
faces were carrying fresh cakes on trays, and
yesterday''s newspapers stained with coffee were
still lying about. “Thank God no one is
here!” he said to himself. “Now I can look
at myself leisurely.”

“What an infernal face!” he exclaimed, and
 
spat with disgust. “If there were only something
there instead of the nose, but there is
absolutely nothing.”

He bit his lips with vexation, left the confectioner''s,
and resolved, quite contrary to his habit,
neither to look nor smile at anyone on the street.
Suddenly he halted as if rooted to the spot before
a door, where something extraordinary happened.
A carriage drew up at the entrance; the
carriage door was opened, and a gentleman in
uniform came out and hurried up the steps.
How great was Kovaloff''s terror and astonishment
when he saw that it was his own nose!

At this extraordinary sight, everything seemed
to turn round with him. He felt as though he
could hardly keep upright on his legs; but,
though trembling all over as though with fever,
he resolved to wait till the nose should return
to the carriage. After about two minutes the
nose actually came out again. It wore a gold-embroidered
uniform with a stiff, high collar,
trousers of chamois leather, and a sword hung
at its side. The hat, adorned with a plume,
showed that it held the rank of a state-councillor.
It was obvious that it was paying “duty-calls.”
It looked round on both sides, called to the
coachman “Drive on,” and got into the carriage,
which drove away.

Poor Kovaloff nearly lost his reason. He did
not know what to think of this extraordinary
 
procedure. And indeed how was it possible
that the nose, which only yesterday he had on
his face, and which could neither walk nor drive,
should wear a uniform. He ran after the carriage,
which fortunately had stopped a short way
off before the Grand Bazar of Moscow. He
hurried towards it and pressed through a crowd
of beggar-women with their faces bound up,
leaving only two openings for the eyes, over
whom he had formerly so often made merry.

There were only a few people in front of the
Bazar. Kovaloff was so agitated that he could
decide on nothing, and looked for the nose
everywhere. At last he saw it standing before
a shop. It seemed half buried in its stiff collar,
and was attentively inspecting the wares displayed.

“How can I get at it?” thought Kovaloff.
“Everything—the uniform, the hat, and so on—show
that it is a state-councillor. How the
deuce has that happened?”

“It seems to me strange, most respected sir—you
should know where you belong—and I find
you all of a sudden—where? Judge yourself.”

“How shall I make my meaning plainer to
him?” Then plucking up fresh courage, he
continued, “Naturally—besides I am a Major.
You must admit it is not befitting that I should
go about without a nose. An old apple-woman
on the Ascension Bridge may carry on her business
without one, but since I am on the look out
for a post; besides in many houses I am acquainted
with ladies of high position—Madame
Tchektyriev, wife of a state-councillor, and
many others. So you see—I do not know,
honourable sir, what you——” (here the Major
shrugged his shoulders). “Pardon me; if one
regards the matter from the point of view of
duty and honour—you will yourself understand——”

“Honourable sir,” said Kovaloff with
dignity, “I do not know how I am to understand
your words. It seems to me the matter is as
clear as possible. Or do you wish—but you are
after all my own nose!”

The nose looked at the Major and wrinkled its
forehead. “There you are wrong, respected
sir; I am myself. Besides, there can be no close
 
relations between us. To judge by the buttons
of your uniform, you must be in quite a different
department to mine.” So saying, the nose
turned away.

Kovaloff was completely puzzled; he did not
know what to do, and still less what to think.
At this moment he heard the pleasant rustling of
a lady''s dress, and there approached an elderly
lady wearing a quantity of lace, and by her side
her graceful daughter in a white dress which set
off her slender figure to advantage, and wearing
a light straw hat. Behind the ladies marched a
tall lackey with long whiskers.

Kovaloff advanced a few steps, adjusted his
cambric collar, arranged his seals which hung
by a little gold chain, and with smiling face fixed
his eyes on the graceful lady, who bowed lightly
like a spring flower, and raised to her brow
her little white hand with transparent fingers.
He smiled still more when he spied under the
brim of her hat her little round chin, and part
of her cheek faintly tinted with rose-colour.
But suddenly he sprang back as though he had
been scorched. He remembered that he had
nothing but an absolute blank in place of a nose,
and tears started to his eyes. He turned round
in order to tell the gentleman in uniform that he
was only a state-councillor in appearance, but
really a scoundrel and a rascal, and nothing else
but his own nose; but the nose was no longer
 
there. He had had time to go, doubtless in
order to continue his visits.

His disappearance plunged Kovaloff into
despair. He went back and stood for a moment
under a colonnade, looking round him on all
sides in hope of perceiving the nose somewhere.
He remembered very well that it wore a hat with
a plume in it and a gold-embroidered uniform;
but he had not noticed the shape of the cloak,
nor the colour of the carriages and the horses,
nor even whether a lackey stood behind it, and,
if so, what sort of livery he wore. Moreover,
so many carriages were passing that it would
have been difficult to recognise one, and even if
he had done so, there would have been no means
of stopping it.

The day was fine and sunny. An immense
crowd was passing to and fro in the Neffsky
Avenue; a variegated stream of ladies flowed
along the pavement. There was his acquaintance,
the Privy Councillor, whom he was accustomed
to style “General,” especially when
strangers were present. There was Iarygin, his
intimate friend who always lost in the evenings
at whist; and there another Major, who had
obtained the rank of committee-man in the
Caucasus, beckoned to him.

“Go to the deuce!” said Kovaloff sotto voce.
“Hi! coachman, drive me straight to the superintendent
of police.” So saying, he got into a
 
droshky and continued to shout all the time to
the coachman “Drive hard!”

“Yes,” continued the porter, “he has only
just gone out; if you had been a moment
earlier you would perhaps have caught
him.”

Kovaloff, still holding his handkerchief to his
face, re-entered the droshky and cried in a
despairing voice “Drive on!”

This question made Kovaloff reflect. In his
situation it was necessary to have recourse to the
police; not because the affair had anything to do
with them directly but because they acted more
promptly than other authorities. As for demanding
any explanation from the department
to which the nose claimed to belong, it would,
he felt, be useless, for the answers of that
gentleman showed that he regarded nothing as
sacred, and he might just as likely have lied in
this matter as in saying that he had never seen
Kovaloff.

But just as he was about to order the coachman
to drive to the police-station, the idea
occurred to him that this rascally scoundrel who,
at their first meeting, had behaved so disloyally
towards him, might, profiting by the delay, quit
the city secretly; and then all his searching would
be in vain, or might last over a whole month.
Finally, as though visited with a heavenly inspiration,
he resolved to go directly to an advertisement
office, and to advertise the loss of his
nose, giving all its distinctive characteristics in
detail, so that anyone who found it might bring
it at once to him, or at any rate inform him
where it lived. Having decided on this course,
he ordered the coachman to drive to the advertisement
office, and all the way he continued to
punch him in the back—“Quick, scoundrel!
quick!”

At last they arrived, and Kovaloff, out of
breath, rushed into a little room where a grey-haired
official, in an old coat and with spectacles
on his nose, sat at a table holding his pen
between his teeth, counting a heap of copper
coins.

“At your service, sir,” answered the grey-haired
functionary, looking up and then fastening
 
his eyes again on the heap of coins before
him.

“Have the kindness to wait a minute,”
answered the official, putting down figures on
paper with one hand, and with the other moving
two balls on his calculating-frame.

A lackey, whose silver-laced coat showed that
he served in one of the houses of the nobility,
was standing by the table with a note in his hand,
and speaking in a lively tone, by way of showing
himself sociable. “Would you believe it, sir,
this little dog is really not worth twenty-four
kopecks, and for my own part I would not give a
farthing for it; but the countess is quite gone
upon it, and offers a hundred roubles'' reward to
anyone who finds it. To tell you the truth, the
tastes of these people are very different from
ours; they don''t mind giving five hundred or a
thousand roubles for a poodle or a pointer,
provided it be a good one.”

The official listened with a serious air while
counting the number of letters contained in the
note. At either side of the table stood a number
of housekeepers, clerks and porters, carrying
notes. The writer of one wished to sell a
barouche, which had been brought from Paris
in 1814 and had been very little used; others
wanted to dispose of a strong droshky which
 
wanted one spring, a spirited horse seventeen
years old, and so on. The room where these
people were collected was very small, and the air
was very close; but Kovaloff was not affected by
it, for he had covered his face with a handkerchief,
and because his nose itself was heaven
knew where.

“In a moment! In a moment! Two roubles,
twenty-four kopecks—one minute! One rouble,
sixty-four kopecks!” said the grey-haired
official, throwing their notes back to the housekeepers
and porters. “What do you wish?” he
said, turning to Kovaloff.

“I wish—” answered the latter, “I have just
been swindled and cheated, and I cannot get hold
of the perpetrator. I only want you to insert
an advertisement to say that whoever brings this
scoundrel to me will be well rewarded.”

“Why do you want my name? I have many
lady friends—Madame Tchektyriev, wife of a
state-councillor, Madame Podtotchina, wife of a
Colonel. Heaven forbid that they should get to
hear of it. You can simply write ‘committee-man,’
or, better, ‘Major.’”

“Mr Nose! Ah, you don''t understand me!
It is my own nose which has gone, I don''t know
where. The devil has played a trick on me.”

“I can''t tell you how, but the important point
is that now it walks about the city itself a state-councillor.
That is why I want you to advertise
that whoever gets hold of it should bring it as
soon as possible to me. Consider; how can I
live without such a prominent part of my body?
It is not as if it were merely a little toe; I would
only have to put my foot in my boot and no one
would notice its absence. Every Thursday I
call on the wife of M. Tchektyriev, the state-councillor;
Madame Podtotchina, a Colonel''s
wife who has a very pretty daughter, is one of
my acquaintances; and what am I to do now?
I cannot appear before them like this.”

The official compressed his lips and reflected.
“No, I cannot insert an advertisement like
that,” he said after a long pause.

“Because it might compromise the paper.
Suppose everyone could advertise that his nose
 
was lost. People already say that all sorts of
nonsense and lies are inserted.”

“You think so? Listen a minute. Last
week there was a case very like it. An official
came, just as you have done, bringing an advertisement
for the insertion of which he paid two
roubles, sixty-three kopecks; and this advertisement
simply announced the loss of a black-haired
poodle. There did not seem to be anything out
of the way in it, but it was really a satire; by the
poodle was meant the cashier of some establishment
or other.”

“That is a matter for a doctor. There are
said to be people who can provide you with any
kind of nose you like. But I see that you are a
witty man, and like to have your little joke.”

“Why put yourself out?” continued the
official, taking a pinch of snuff. “All the same,
if you don''t mind,” he added with a touch of
curiosity, “I should like to have a look at it.”

“It certainly does look odd,” said the official.
“It is perfectly flat like a freshly fried pancake.
It is hardly credible.”

“Very well. Are you going to hesitate
any more? You see it is impossible to refuse
to advertise my loss. I shall be particularly
obliged to you, and I shall be glad that this
incident has procured me the pleasure of making
your acquaintance.” The Major, we see, did
not even shrink from a slight humiliation.

“It certainly is not difficult to advertise it,”
replied the official; “but I don''t see what good
it would do you. However, if you lay so much
stress on it, you should apply to someone who
has a skilful pen, so that he may describe it as a
curious, natural freak, and publish the article in
the Northern Bee” (here he took another pinch)
“for the benefit of youthful readers” (he wiped
his nose), “or simply as a matter worthy of
arousing public curiosity.”

The committee-man felt completely discouraged.
He let his eyes fall absent-mindedly on
a daily paper in which theatrical performances
were advertised. Reading there the name of
an actress whom he knew to be pretty, he involuntarily
smiled, and his hand sought his pocket
to see if he had a blue ticket—for in Kovaloff''s
opinion superior officers like himself should not
take a lesser-priced seat; but the thought of his
lost nose suddenly spoilt everything.

The official himself seemed touched at his
difficult position. Desiring to console him, he
tried to express his sympathy by a few polite
words. “I much regret,” he said, “your
extraordinary mishap. Will you not try a
pinch of snuff? It clears the head, banishes
depression, and is a good preventive against
hÃ¦morrhoids.”

So saying, he reached his snuff-box out to
Kovaloff, skilfully concealing at the same time
the cover, which was adorned with the portrait of
some lady or other.

This act, quite innocent in itself, exasperated
Kovaloff. “I don''t understand what you find to
joke about in the matter,” he exclaimed angrily.
“Don''t you see that I lack precisely the essential
feature for taking snuff? The devil take
your snuff-box. I don''t want to look at snuff
now, not even the best, certainly not your vile
stuff!”

So saying, he left the advertisement office in
a state of profound irritation, and went to the
commissary of police. He arrived just as this
dignitary was reclining on his couch, and saying
to himself with a sigh of satisfaction, “Yes, I
shall make a nice little sum out of that.”

This police commissary was a great patron of
 
all the arts and industries; but what he liked
above everything else was a cheque. “It is a
thing,” he used to say, “to which it is not easy
to find an equivalent; it requires no food, it does
not take up much room, it stays in one''s pocket,
and if it falls, it is not broken.”

The commissary accorded Kovaloff a fairly
frigid reception, saying that the afternoon was
not the best time to come with a case, that nature
required one to rest a little after eating (this
showed the committee-man that the commissary
was acquainted with the aphorisms of the ancient
sages), and that respectable people did not have
their noses stolen.

The last allusion was too direct. We must
remember that Kovaloff was a very sensitive
man. He did not mind anything said against
him as an individual, but he could not endure
any reflection on his rank or social position. He
even believed that in comedies one might allow
attacks on junior officers, but never on their
seniors.

The commissary''s reception of him hurt his
feelings so much that he raised his head proudly,
and said with dignity, “After such insulting
expressions on your part, I have nothing more
to say.” And he left the place.

He reached his house quite wearied out. It
was already growing dark. After all his fruitless
search, his room seemed to him melancholy
 
and even ugly. In the vestibule he saw his
valet Ivan stretched on the leather couch and
amusing himself by spitting at the ceiling, which
he did very cleverly, hitting every time the same
spot. His servant''s equanimity enraged him;
he struck him on the forehead with his hat, and
said, “You good-for-nothing, you are always
playing the fool!”

Once in his room, the Major, tired and depressed,
threw himself in an armchair and, after
sighing a while, began to soliloquise:

“In heaven''s name, why should such a misfortune
befall me? If I had lost an arm or a
leg, it would be less insupportable; but a man
without a nose! Devil take it!—what is he good
for? He is only fit to be thrown out of the
window. If it had been taken from me in war or
in a duel, or if I had lost it by my own fault!
But it has disappeared inexplicably. But no! it
is impossible,” he continued after reflecting a few
moments, “it is incredible that a nose can disappear
like that—quite incredible. I must be
dreaming, or suffering from some hallucination;
perhaps I swallowed, by mistake instead of
water, the brandy with which I rub my chin after
being shaved. That fool of an Ivan must have
forgotten to take it away, and I must have
swallowed it.”

In order to find out whether he were really
drunk, the Major pinched himself so hard that
he unvoluntarily uttered a cry. The pain convinced
him that he was quite wide awake. He
walked slowly to the looking-glass and at first
closed his eyes, hoping to see his nose suddenly
in its proper place; but on opening them, he
started back. “What a hideous sight!” he
exclaimed.

It was really incomprehensible. One might
easily lose a button, a silver spoon, a watch, or
something similar; but a loss like this, and in
one''s own dwelling!

After considering all the circumstances, Major
Kovaloff felt inclined to suppose that the cause
of all his trouble should be laid at the door of
Madame Podtotchina, the Colonel''s wife, who
wished him to marry her daughter. He himself
paid her court readily, but always avoided
coming to the point. And when the lady one
day told him point-blank that she wished him
to marry her daughter, he gently drew back,
declaring that he was still too young, and that he
had to serve five years more before he would be
forty-two. This must be the reason why the
lady, in revenge, had resolved to bring him into
disgrace, and had hired two sorceresses for that
object. One thing was certain—his nose had
not been cut off; no one had entered his room,
and as for Ivan Jakovlevitch—he had been
 
shaved by him on Wednesday, and during that
day and the whole of Thursday his nose had
been there, as he knew and well remembered.
Moreover, if his nose had been cut off he
would naturally have felt pain, and doubtless
the wound would not have healed so quickly,
nor would the surface have been as flat as a
pancake.

All kinds of plans passed through his head:
should he bring a legal action against the wife
of a superior officer, or should he go to her and
charge her openly with her treachery?

His reflections were interrupted by a sudden
light, which shone through all the chinks of the
door, showing that Ivan had lit the wax-candles
in the vestibule. Soon Ivan himself came in
with the lights. Kovaloff quickly seized a handkerchief
and covered the place where his nose
had been the evening before, so that his blockhead
of a servant might not gape with his mouth
wide open when he saw his master''s extraordinary
appearance.

He saw a police official of pleasant appearance,
with grey whiskers and fairly full cheeks—the
same who at the commencement of this story was
 
standing at the end of the Isaac Bridge. “You
have lost your nose?” he asked.

Joy had suddenly paralysed his tongue. He
stared at the police commissary on whose cheeks
and full lips fell the flickering light of the candle.

“By a very singular chance. It has been
arrested just as it was getting into a carriage for
Riga. Its passport had been made out some
time ago in the name of an official; and what is
still more strange, I myself took it at first for a
gentleman. Fortunately I had my glasses with
me, and then I saw at once that it was a nose.
I am shortsighted, you know, and as you stand
before me I cannot distinguish your nose, your
beard, or anything else. My mother-in-law can
hardly see at all.”

“Don''t put yourself out. Knowing that you
need it, I have brought it with me. Another
singular thing is that the principal culprit in the
matter is a scoundrel of a barber living in the
Ascension Avenue, who is now safely locked up.
I had long suspected him of drunkenness and
 
theft; only the day before yesterday he stole
some buttons in a shop. Your nose is quite
uninjured.” So saying, the police commissary
put his hand in his pocket and brought out the
nose wrapped up in paper.

“I should like to very much, but I cannot.
I must go at once to the House of Correction.
The cost of living is very high nowadays. My
mother-in-law lives with me, and there are
several children; the eldest is very hopeful and
intelligent, but I have no means for their
education.”

After the commissary''s departure, Kovaloff
remained for some time plunged in a kind of
vague reverie, and did not recover full consciousness
for several moments, so great was the
effect of this unexpected good news. He placed
the recovered nose carefully in the palm of his
hand, and examined it again with the greatest
attention.

“Yes, this is it!” he said to himself. “Here
is the heat-boil on the left side, which came out
yesterday.” And he nearly laughed aloud with
delight.

But nothing is permanent in this world. Joy
in the second moment of its arrival is already
less keen than in the first, is still fainter in the
 
third, and finishes by coalescing with our normal
mental state, just as the circles which the fall of
a pebble forms on the surface of water, gradually
die away. Kovaloff began to meditate, and saw
that his difficulties were not yet over; his nose
had been recovered, but it had to be joined on
again in its proper place.

And suppose it could not? As he put this
question to himself, Kovaloff grew pale. With
a feeling of indescribable dread, he rushed
towards his dressing-table, and stood before the
mirror in order that he might not place his nose
crookedly. His hands trembled.

Very carefully he placed it where it had been
before. Horror! It did not remain there.
He held it to his mouth and warmed it a little
with his breath, and then placed it there again;
but it would not hold.

But the nose seemed to be made of wood, and
fell back on the table with a strange noise, as
though it had been a cork. The Major''s face
began to twitch feverishly. “Is it possible that
it won''t stick?” he asked himself, full of alarm.
But however often he tried, all his efforts were
in vain.

He called Ivan, and sent him to fetch the
doctor who occupied the finest flat in the
mansion. This doctor was a man of imposing
appearance, who had magnificent black whiskers
 
and a healthy wife. He ate fresh apples every
morning, and cleaned his teeth with extreme
care, using five different tooth-brushes for three-quarters
of an hour daily.

The doctor came immediately. After having
asked the Major when this misfortune had happened,
he raised his chin and gave him a fillip
with his finger just where the nose had been, in
such a way that the Major suddenly threw back
his head and struck the wall with it. The doctor
said that did not matter; then, making him turn
his face to the right, he felt the vacant place and
said “H''m!” then he made him turn it to the
left and did the same; finally he again gave him
a fillip with his finger, so that the Major started
like a horse whose teeth are being examined.
After this experiment, the doctor shook his head
and said, “No, it cannot be done. Rather
remain as you are, lest something worse happen.
Certainly one could replace it at once, but I
assure you the remedy would be worse than the
disease.”

“All very fine, but how am I to go on without
a nose?” answered Kovaloff. “There is
nothing worse than that. How can I show
myself with such a villainous appearance? I go
into good society, and this evening I am invited
to two parties. I know several ladies, Madame
Tchektyriev, the wife of a state-councillor,
Madame Podtotchina—although after what she
 
has done, I don''t want to have anything to do
with her except through the agency of the police.
I beg you,” continued Kovaloff in a supplicating
tone, “find some way or other of replacing it;
even if it is not quite firm, as long as it holds at
all; I can keep it in place sometimes with my
hand, whenever there is any risk. Besides, I
do not even dance, so that it is not likely to be
injured by any sudden movement. As to your
fee, be in no anxiety about that; I can well
afford it.”

“Believe me,” answered the doctor in a voice
which was neither too high nor too low, but soft
and almost magnetic, “I do not treat patients
from love of gain. That would be contrary to
my principles and to my art. It is true that I
accept fees, but that is only not to hurt my
patients'' feelings by refusing them. I could
certainly replace your nose, but I assure you on
my word of honour, it would only make matters
worse. Rather let Nature do her own work.
Wash the place often with cold water, and I
assure you that even without a nose, you will be
just as well as if you had one. As to the nose
itself, I advise you to have it preserved in a
bottle of spirits, or, still better, of warm vinegar
mixed with two spoonfuls of brandy, and then
you can sell it at a good price. I would be
willing to take it myself, provided you do not
ask too much.”

“Excuse me,” said the doctor, taking his
leave. “I hoped to be useful to you, but I can
do nothing more; you are at any rate convinced
of my good-will.” So saying, the doctor left
the room with a dignified air.

Kovaloff did not even notice his departure.
Absorbed in a profound reverie, he only saw the
edge of his snow-white cuffs emerging from the
sleeves of his black coat.

The next day he resolved, before bringing a
formal action, to write to the Colonel''s wife and
see whether she would not return to him, without
further dispute, that of which she had deprived
him.

“I hardly understand your method of action.
Be sure that by adopting such a course you will
gain nothing, and will certainly not succeed in
making me marry your daughter. Believe me,
the story of my nose has become well known; it
is you and no one else who have taken the principal
part in it. Its unexpected separation from
the place which it occupied, its flight and its
appearances sometimes in the disguise of an
official, sometimes in proper person, are nothing
but the consequence of unholy spells employed
 by you or by persons who, like you, are addicted
to such honourable pursuits. On my part, I wish
to inform you, that if the above-mentioned nose
is not restored to-day to its proper place, I shall
be obliged to have recourse to legal procedure.

“Your letter has profoundly astonished me.
I must confess that I had not expected such
unjust reproaches on your part. I assure you
that the official of whom you speak has not been
at my house, either disguised or in his proper
person. It is true that Philippe Ivanovitch
Potantchikoff has paid visits at my house, and
though he has actually asked for my daughter''s
hand, and was a man of good breeding, respectable
and intelligent, I never gave him any hope.

“Again, you say something about a nose.
If you intend to imply by that that I wished to
snub you, i.e. to meet you with a refusal, I am
very astonished because, as you well know, I was
quite of the opposite mind. If after this you
wish to ask for my daughter''s hand, I should be
glad to gratify you, for such has also been the
object of my most fervent desire, in the hope of
 the accomplishment of which, I remain, yours
most sincerely,

“No,” said Kovaloff, after having reperused
the letter, “she is certainly not guilty. It is
impossible. Such a letter could not be written
by a criminal.” The committee-man was experienced
in such matters, for he had been often
officially deputed to conduct criminal investigations
while in the Caucasus. “But then how
and by what trick of fate has the thing happened?”
he said to himself with a gesture of
discouragement. “The devil must be at the
bottom of it.”

Meanwhile the rumour of this extraordinary
event had spread all over the city, and, as is
generally the case, not without numerous additions.
At that period there was a general disposition
to believe in the miraculous; the public
had recently been impressed by experiments in
magnetism. The story of the floating chairs in
Koniouchennaia Street was still quite recent,
and there was nothing astonishing in hearing
soon afterwards that Major Kovaloff''s nose was
to be seen walking every day at three o''clock
on the Neffsky Avenue. The crowd of curious
spectators which gathered there daily was enormous.
On one occasion someone spread a report
that the nose was in Junker''s stores and immediately
 
the place was besieged by such a crowd
that the police had to interfere and establish
order. A certain speculator with a grave, whiskered
face, who sold cakes at a theatre door,
had some strong wooden benches made which
he placed before the window of the stores, and
obligingly invited the public to stand on them
and look in, at the modest charge of twenty-four
kopecks. A veteran colonel, leaving his house
earlier than usual expressly for the purpose, had
the greatest difficulty in elbowing his way through
the crowd, but to his great indignation he saw
nothing in the store window but an ordinary
flannel waistcoat and a coloured lithograph
representing a young girl darning a stocking,
while an elegant youth in a waistcoat with large
lappels watched her from behind a tree. The
picture had hung in the same place for more
than ten years. The colonel went off, growling
savagely to himself, “How can the fools let
themselves be excited by such idiotic stories?”

Then another rumour got abroad, to the effect
that the nose of Major Kovaloff was in the habit
of walking not on the Neffsky Avenue but in the
Tauris Gardens. Some students of the Academy
of Surgery went there on purpose to see it. A
high-born lady wrote to the keeper of the gardens
asking him to show her children this rare phenomenon,
and to give them some suitable instruction
on the occasion.

All these incidents were eagerly collected by
the town wits, who just then were very short
of anecdotes adapted to amuse ladies. On the
other hand, the minority of solid, sober people
were very much displeased. One gentleman
asserted with great indignation that he could not
understand how in our enlightened age such
absurdities could spread abroad, and he was
astonished that the Government did not direct
their attention to the matter. This gentleman
evidently belonged to the category of those
people who wish the Government to interfere in
everything, even in their daily quarrels with their
wives.

Strange events happen in this world, events
which are sometimes entirely improbable. The
same nose which had masqueraded as a state-councillor,
and caused so much sensation in the
town, was found one morning in its proper place,
i.e. between the cheeks of Major Kovaloff, as if
nothing had happened.

This occurred on 7th April. On awaking, the
Major looked by chance into a mirror and perceived
a nose. He quickly put his hand to it; it
was there beyond a doubt!

“Oh!” exclaimed Kovaloff. For sheer joy
 
he was on the point of performing a dance barefooted
across his room, but the entrance of Ivan
prevented him. He told him to bring water,
and after washing himself, he looked again in
the glass. The nose was there! Then he dried
his face with a towel and looked again. Yes,
there was no mistake about it!

And he thought to himself at the same time,
“That will be a nice business if Ivan says to
me ‘No, sir, not only is there no boil, but your
nose itself is not there!’”

At this moment the barber, Ivan Jakovlevitch,
put his head in at the door, but as timidly as a
cat which has just been beaten for stealing lard.

Kovaloff seated himself. Jakovlevitch tied a
napkin under his chin, and in the twinkling of an
eye covered his beard and part of his cheeks with
a copious creamy lather.

“There it is!” said the barber to himself, as
he glanced at the nose. Then he bent his head
a little and examined it from one side. “Yes,
it actually is the nose—really, when one
thinks——” he continued, pursuing his mental
soliloquy and still looking at it. Then quite
gently, with infinite precaution, he raised two
fingers in the air in order to take hold of it by
the extremity, as he was accustomed to do.

Ivan Jakovlevitch let his arm fall and felt more
embarrassed than he had ever done in his life.
At last he began to pass the razor very lightly
over the Major''s chin, and although it was very
difficult to shave him without using the olfactory
organ as a point of support, he succeeded, however,
by placing his wrinkled thumb against the
Major''s lower jaw and cheek, thus overcoming
all obstacles and bringing his task to a safe
conclusion.

When the barber had finished, Kovaloff hastened
to dress himself, took a droshky, and drove
straight to the confectioner''s. As he entered it,
he ordered a cup of chocolate. He then stepped
straight to the mirror; the nose was there!

He returned joyfully, and regarded with a
satirical expression two officers who were in the
shop, one of whom possessed a nose not much
larger than a waistcoat button.

After that he went to the office of the department
 
where he had applied for the post of vice-governor
of a province or Government bailiff.
As he passed through the hall of reception, he
cast a glance at the mirror; the nose was there!
Then he went to pay a visit to another committee-man,
a very sarcastic personage, to whom he was
accustomed to say in answer to his raillery,
“Yes, I know, you are the funniest fellow in
St Petersburg.”

On the way he said to himself, “If the Major
does not burst into laughter at the sight of me,
that is a most certain sign that everything is in
its accustomed place.”

As he returned, he met Madame Podtotchina
with her daughter. He accosted them, and they
responded very graciously. The conversation
lasted a long time, during which he took more
than one pinch of snuff, saying to himself, “No,
you haven''t caught me yet, coquettes that you
are! And as to the daughter, I shan''t marry
her at all.”

After that, the Major resumed his walks on
the Neffsky Avenue and his visits to the theatre
as if nothing had happened. His nose also
remained in its place as if it had never quitted it.
From that time he was always to be seen smiling,
in a good humour, and paying attentions to pretty
girls.

Such was the occurrence which took place in
the northern capital of our vast empire. On
considering the account carefully we see that
there is a good deal which looks improbable about
it. Not to speak of the strange disappearance of
the nose, and its appearance in different places
under the disguise of a councillor of state, how
was it that Kovaloff did not understand that one
cannot decently advertise for a lost nose? I do
not mean to say that he would have had to pay
too much for the advertisement—that is a mere
trifle, and I am not one of those who attach too
much importance to money; but to advertise in
such a case is not proper nor befitting.

Another difficulty is—how was the nose found
in the baked loaf, and how did Ivan Jakovlevitch
himself—no, I don''t understand it at all!

But the most incomprehensible thing of all is,
how authors can choose such subjects for their
stories. That really surpasses my understanding.
In the first place, no advantage results
from it for the country; and in the second place,
no harm results either.

All the same, when one reflects well, there
really is something in the matter. Whatever
may be said to the contrary, such cases do occur—rarely,
it is true, but now and then actually.

October 3rd.—A strange occurrence has taken
place to-day. I got up fairly late, and when
Mawra brought me my clean boots, I asked her
how late it was. When I heard it had long
struck ten, I dressed as quickly as possible.

To tell the truth, I would rather not have gone
to the office at all to-day, for I know beforehand
that our department-chief will look as sour as
vinegar. For some time past he has been in the
habit of saying to me, “Look here, my friend;
there is something wrong with your head. You
often rush about as though you were possessed.
Then you make such confused abstracts of the
documents that the devil himself cannot make
them out; you write the title without any capital
letters, and add neither the date nor the docket-number.”
The long-legged scoundrel! He is
certainly envious of me, because I sit in the
director''s work-room, and mend His Excellency''s
pens. In a word, I should not have gone
to the office if I had not hoped to meet the
accountant, and perhaps squeeze a little advance
out of this skinflint.

A terrible man, this accountant! As for his
advancing one''s salary once in a way—you might
sooner expect the skies to fall. You may beg
and beseech him, and be on the very verge of
ruin—this grey devil won''t budge an inch. At
the same time, his own cook at home, as all the
world knows, boxes his ears.

I really don''t see what good one gets by
serving in our department. There are no plums
there. In the fiscal and judicial offices it is quite
different. There some ungainly fellow sits in a
corner and writes and writes; he has such a
shabby coat and such an ugly mug that one would
like to spit on both of them. But you should see
what a splendid country-house he has rented.
He would not condescend to accept a gilt porcelain
cup as a present. “You can give that to
your family doctor,” he would say. Nothing
less than a pair of chestnut horses, a fine carriage,
or a beaver-fur coat worth three hundred
roubles would be good enough for him. And
yet he seems so mild and quiet, and asks so
amiably, “Please lend me your penknife; I wish
to mend my pen.” Nevertheless, he knows how
to scarify a petitioner till he has hardly a whole
stitch left on his body.

In our office it must be admitted everything is
done in a proper and gentlemanly way; there
is more cleanness and elegance than one will
ever find in Government offices. The tables
 
are mahogany, and everyone is addressed as
“sir.” And truly, were it not for this official
propriety, I should long ago have sent in my
resignation.

I put on my old cloak, and took my umbrella,
as a light rain was falling. No one was to be
seen on the streets except some women, who had
flung their skirts over their heads. Here and
there one saw a cabman or a shopman with his
umbrella up. Of the higher classes one only
saw an official here and there. One I saw at the
street-crossing, and thought to myself, “Ah!
my friend, you are not going to the office, but
after that young lady who walks in front of you.
You are just like the officers who run after every
petticoat they see.”

As I was thus following the train of my
thoughts, I saw a carriage stop before a shop just
as I was passing it. I recognised it at once; it
was our director''s carriage. “He has nothing
to do in the shop,” I said to myself; “it must be
his daughter.”

I pressed myself close against the wall. A
lackey opened the carriage door, and, as I had
expected, she fluttered like a bird out of it.
How proudly she looked right and left; how she
drew her eyebrows together, and shot lightnings
from her eyes—good heavens! I am lost, hopelessly
lost!

But why must she come out in such abominable
 
weather? And yet they say women are so mad
on their finery!

She did not recognise me. I had wrapped
myself as closely as possible in my cloak. It
was dirty and old-fashioned, and I would not
have liked to have been seen by her wearing it.
Now they wear cloaks with long collars, but
mine has only a short double collar, and the
cloth is of inferior quality.

Her little dog could not get into the shop, and
remained outside. I know this dog; its name is
“Meggy.”

Who the deuce was that? I looked round
and saw two ladies hurrying by under an umbrella—one
old, the other fairly young. They
had already passed me when I heard the same
voice say again, “For shame, Meggy!”

What was that? I saw Meggy sniffing at a
dog which ran behind the ladies. The deuce!
I thought to myself, “I am not drunk? That
happens pretty seldom.”

“No, Fidel, you are wrong,” I heard Meggy
say quite distinctly. “I was—bow—wow!—I
was—bow! wow! wow!—very ill.”

What an extraordinary dog! I was, to tell
the truth, quite amazed to hear it talk human
language. But when I considered the matter
well, I ceased to be astonished. In fact, such
 
things have already happened in the world. It
is said that in England a fish put its head out of
water and said a word or two in such an extraordinary
language that learned men have been
puzzling over them for three years, and have not
succeeded in interpreting them yet. I also read
in the paper of two cows who entered a shop and
asked for a pound of tea.

Meanwhile what Meggy went on to say seemed
to me still more remarkable. She added, “I
wrote to you lately, Fidel; perhaps Polkan did
not bring you the letter.”

Now I am willing to forfeit a whole month''s
salary if I ever heard of dogs writing before.
This has certainly astonished me. For some
little time past I hear and see things which no
other man has heard and seen.

“I will,” I thought, “follow that dog in
order to get to the bottom of the matter.
Accordingly, I opened my umbrella and went
after the two ladies. They went down Bean
Street, turned through Citizen Street and Carpenter
Street, and finally halted on the Cuckoo
Bridge before a large house. I know this house;
it is Sverkoff''s. What a monster he is! What
sort of people live there! How many cooks,
how many bagmen! There are brother officials
of mine also there packed on each other like
herrings. And I have a friend there, a fine
player on the cornet.”

The ladies mounted to the fifth story. “Very
good,” thought I; “I will make a note of the
number, in order to follow up the matter at the
first opportunity.”

October 4th.—To-day is Wednesday, and I
was as usual in the office. I came early on
purpose, sat down, and mended all the pens.

Our director must be a very clever man.
The whole room is full of bookcases. I read the
titles of some of the books; they were very
learned, beyond the comprehension of people
of my class, and all in French and German. I
look at his face; see! how much dignity there is
in his eyes. I never hear a single superfluous
word from his mouth, except that when he hands
over the documents, he asks “What sort of
weather is it?”

No, he is not a man of our class; he is a real
statesman. I have already noticed that I am a
special favourite of his. If now his daughter
also—ah! what folly—let me say no more about
it!

I have read the Northern Bee. What foolish
people the French are! By heavens! I should
like to tackle them all, and give them a thrashing.
I have also read a fine description of a
ball given by a landowner of Kursk. The landowners
of Kursk write a fine style.

Then I noticed that it was already half-past
 
twelve, and the director had not yet left his
bedroom. But about half-past one something
happened which no pen can describe.

The door opened. I thought it was the
director; I jumped up with my documents from
the seat, and—then—she—herself—came into
the room. Ye saints! how beautifully she was
dressed. Her garments were whiter than a
swan''s plumage—oh how splendid! A sun,
indeed, a real sun!

“Your Excellency,” I wanted to exclaim,
“don''t have me executed, but if it must be
done, then kill me rather with your own angelic
hand.” But, God knows why, I could not bring
it out, so I only said, “No, he has not come yet.”

She glanced at me, looked at the books, and
let her handkerchief fall. Instantly I started
up, but slipped on the infernal polished floor,
and nearly broke my nose. Still I succeeded
in picking up the handkerchief. Ye heavenly
choirs, what a handkerchief! So tender and
soft, of the finest cambric. It had the scent of
a general''s rank!

After I had sat there about an hour, a flunkey
came in and said, “You can go home, Mr
Ivanovitch; the director has already gone out!”

I cannot stand these lackeys! They hang
about the vestibules, and scarcely vouchsafe to
greet one with a nod. Yes, sometimes it is even
worse; once one of these rascals offered me his
snuff-box without even getting up from his chair.
“Don''t you know then, you country-bumpkin,
that I am an official and of aristocratic birth?”

This time, however, I took my hat and overcoat
quietly; these people naturally never think
of helping one on with it. I went home, lay a
good while on the bed, and wrote some verses
in my note:

In the evening I wrapped myself in my cloak,
hastened to the director''s house, and waited
there a long time to see if she would come out
and get into the carriage. I only wanted to see
her once, but she did not come.

November 6th.—Our chief clerk has gone
mad. When I came to the office to-day he called
me to his room and began as follows: “Look
here, my friend, what wild ideas have got into
your head?”

“Consider well. You are already past forty;
it is quite time to be reasonable. What do you
imagine? Do you think I don''t know all your
tricks? Are you trying to pay court to the
director''s daughter? Look at yourself and
realise what you are! A nonentity, nothing else.
I would not give a kopeck for you. Look well
in the glass. How can you have such thoughts
with such a caricature of a face?”

May the devil take him! Because his own
face has a certain resemblance to a medicine-bottle,
because he has a curly bush of hair on
his head, and sometimes combs it upwards, and
sometimes plasters it down in all kinds of queer
ways, he thinks that he can do everything. I
know well, I know why he is angry with me.
He is envious; perhaps he has noticed the tokens
of favour which have been graciously shown me.
But why should I bother about him? A councillor!
What sort of important animal is that?
He wears a gold chain with his watch, buys
himself boots at thirty roubles a pair; may the
deuce take him! Am I a tailor''s son or some
other obscure cabbage? I am a nobleman! I
can also work my way up. I am just forty-two—an
age when a man''s real career generally
begins. Wait a bit, my friend! I too may get
to a superior''s rank; or perhaps, if God is
gracious, even to a higher one. I shall make a
 
name which will far outstrip yours. You think
there are no able men except yourself? I only
need to order a fashionable coat and wear a tie
like yours, and you would be quite eclipsed.

November 8th.—I was at the theatre. “The
Russian House-Fool” was performed. I laughed
heartily. There was also a kind of musical
comedy which contained amusing hits at barristers.
The language was very broad; I wonder
the censor passed it. In the comedy lines occur
which accuse the merchants of cheating; their
sons are said to lead immoral lives, and to
behave very disrespectfully towards the nobility.

The critics also are criticised; they are said
only to be able to find fault, so that authors have
to beg the public for protection.

Our modern dramatists certainly write amusing
things. I am very fond of the theatre. If
I have only a kopeck in my pocket, I always
go there. Most of my fellow-officials are uneducated
boors, and never enter a theatre unless
one throws free tickets at their head.

November 9th.—About eight o''clock I went to
the office. The chief clerk pretended not to
notice my arrival. I for my part also behaved
 
as though he were not in existence. I read
through and collated documents. About four
o''clock I left. I passed by the director''s house,
but no one was to be seen. After dinner I lay
for a good while on the bed.

November 11th.—To-day I sat in the director''s
room, mended twenty-three pens for
him, and for Her—for Her Excellence, his
daughter, four more.

The director likes to see many pens lying on
his table. What a head he must have! He
continually wraps himself in silence, but I don''t
think the smallest trifle escapes his eye. I should
like to know what he is generally thinking of,
what is really going on in this brain; I should like
to get acquainted with the whole manner of life
of these gentlemen, and get a closer view of their
cunning courtiers'' arts, and all the activities of
these circles. I have often thought of asking His
Excellence about them; but—the deuce knows
why!—every time my tongue failed me and I
could get nothing out but my meteorological
report.

I wish I could get a look into the spare-room
whose door I so often see open. And a second
small room behind the spare-room excites my
curiosity. How splendidly it is fitted up; what a
quantity of mirrors and choice china it contains!
I should also like to cast a glance into those
 
regions where Her Excellency, the daughter,
wields the sceptre. I should like to see how all
the scent-bottles and boxes are arranged in her
boudoir, and the flowers which exhale so delicious
a scent that one is half afraid to breathe.
And her clothes lying about which are too
ethereal to be called clothes—but silence!

To-day there came to me what seemed a
heavenly inspiration. I remembered the conversation
between the two dogs which I had overheard
on the Nevski Prospect. “Very good,”
I thought; “now I see my way clear. I must
get hold of the correspondence which these two
silly dogs have carried on with each other. In
it I shall probably find many things explained.”

I had already once called Meggy to me and
said to her, “Listen, Meggy! Now we are
alone together; if you like, I will also shut the
door so that no one can see us. Tell me now
all that you know about your mistress. I swear
to you that I will tell no one.”

But the cunning dog drew in its tail, ruffled up
its hair, and went quite quietly out of the door,
as though it had heard nothing.

I had long been of the opinion that dogs are
much cleverer than men. I also believed that
they could talk, and that only a certain obstinacy
kept them from doing so. They are especially
watchful animals, and nothing escapes their
observation. Now, cost what it may, I will go
 
to-morrow to Sverkoff''s house in order to ask
after Fidel, and if I have luck, to get hold of all
the letters which Meggy has written to her.

November 12th.—To-day about two o''clock
in the afternoon I started in order, by some
means or other, to see Fidel and question her.

I cannot stand this smell of Sauerkraut which
assails one''s olfactory nerves from all the shops
in Citizen Street. There also exhales such an
odour from under each house door, that one
must hold one''s nose and pass by quickly.
There ascends also so much smoke and soot from
the artisans'' shops that it is almost impossible to
get through it.

When I had climbed up to the sixth story,
and had rung the bell, a rather pretty girl with a
freckled face came out. I recognised her as the
companion of the old lady. She blushed a little
and asked “What do you want?”

She was a simple-minded girl, as I saw at once.
The dog came running and barking loudly. I
wanted to take hold of it, but the abominable
beast nearly caught hold of my nose with its
teeth. But in a corner of the room I saw its
sleeping-basket. Ah! that was what I wanted.
I went to it, rummaged in the straw, and to my
great satisfaction drew out a little packet of small
 
pieces of paper. When the hideous little dog
saw this, it first bit me in the calf of the leg, and
then, as soon as it had become aware of my theft,
it began to whimper and to fawn on me; but I
said, “No, you little beast; good-bye!” and
hastened away.

When I reached my room I wished to get to
work at once, and read through the letters by
daylight, since I do not see well by candle-light;
but the wretched Mawra had got the idea of
sweeping the floor. These blockheads of Finnish
women are always clean where there is no
need to be.

I then went for a little walk and began to think
over what had happened. Now at last I could
get to the bottom of all facts, ideas and motives!
These letters would explain everything. Dogs
are clever fellows; they know all about politics,
and I will certainly find in the letters all I want,
especially the character of the director and all
his relationships. And through these letters I
will get information about her who—but silence!

November 13th.—Now let us see! The letter
is fairly legible but the handwriting is somewhat
doggish.

“Dear Fidel!—I cannot get accustomed to
your ordinary name, as if they could not have
found a better one for you! Fidel! How tasteless!
How ordinary! But this is not the time
to discuss it. I am very glad that we thought of
corresponding with each other.”

(The letter is quite correctly written. The
punctuation and spelling are perfectly right.
Even our head clerk does not write so simply
and clearly, though he declares he has been at
the University. Let us go on.)

“I think that it is one of the most refined joys
of this world to interchange thoughts, feelings,
and impressions.”

(H''m! This idea comes from some book
which has been translated from German. I
can''t remember the title.)

“I speak from experience, although I have
not gone farther into the world than just before
our front door. Does not my life pass happily
and comfortably? My mistress, whom her
father calls Sophie, is quite in love with me.”

“Her father also often strokes me. I drink
tea and coffee with cream. Yes, my dear, I must
confess to you that I find no satisfaction in those
large, gnawed-at bones which Polkan devours in
the kitchen. Only the bones of wild fowl are
good, and that only when the marrow has not
been sucked out of them. They taste very nice
 
with a little sauce, but there should be no green
stuff in it. But I know nothing worse than the
habit of giving dogs balls of bread kneaded up.
Someone sits at table, kneads a bread-ball with
dirty fingers, calls you and sticks it in your mouth.
Good manners forbid your refusing it, and you
eat it—with disgust it is true, but you eat it.”

(The deuce! What is this? What rubbish!
As if she could find nothing more suitable to
write about! I will see if there is anything more
reasonable on the second page.)

“I am quite willing to inform you of everything
that goes on here. I have already mentioned
the most important person in the house,
whom Sophie calls ‘Papa.’ He is a very strange
man.”

(Ah! Here we are at last! Yes, I knew it;
they have a politician''s penetrating eye for all
things. Let us see what she says about “Papa.”)

“… a strange man. Generally he is silent;
he only speaks seldom, but about a week ago he
kept on repeating to himself, ‘Shall I get it or
not?’ In one hand he took a sheet of paper;
the other he stretched out as though to receive
something, and repeated, ‘Shall I get it or not?’
Once he turned to me with the question, ‘What
do you think, Meggy?’ I did not understand in
the least what he meant, sniffed at his boots, and
went away. A week later he came home with
his face beaming. That morning he was visited
 
by several officers in uniform who congratulated
him. At the dinner-table he was in a better
humour than I have ever seen him before.”

“… was in an unusually excited state.
She went to a ball, and I was glad that I could
write to you in her absence. She likes going to
balls, although she gets dreadfully irritated while
dressing. I cannot understand, my dear, what
is the pleasure in going to a ball. She comes
home from the ball at six o''clock in the early
morning, and to judge by her pale and emaciated
face, she has had nothing to eat. I could,
frankly speaking, not endure such an existence.
If I could not get partridge with sauce, or the
wing of a roast chicken, I don''t know what I
should do. Porridge with sauce is also tolerable,
but I can get up no enthusiasm for carrots,
turnips, and artichokes.”

The style is very unequal! One sees at once
that it has not been written by a man. The
 
beginning is quite intelligent, but at the end the
canine nature breaks out. I will read another
letter; it is rather long and there is no date.

“Ah, my dear, how delightful is the arrival of
spring! My heart beats as though it expected
something. There is a perpetual ringing in my
ears, so that I often stand with my foot raised,
for several minutes at a time, and listen towards
the door. In confidence I will tell you that I
have many admirers. I often sit on the window-sill
and let them pass in review. Ah! if you
knew what miscreations there are among them;
one, a clumsy house-dog, with stupidity written
on his face, walks the street with an important
air and imagines that he is an extremely important
person, and that the eyes of all the world
are fastened on him. I don''t pay him the least
attention, and pretend not to see him at all.

“And what a hideous bulldog has taken up
his post opposite my window! If he stood on
his hind-legs, as the monster probably cannot,
he would be taller by a head than my mistress''s
papa, who himself has a stately figure. This lout
seems, moreover, to be very impudent. I growl
at him, but he does not seem to mind that at all.
If he at least would only wrinkle his forehead!
Instead of that, he stretches out his tongue,
droops his big ears, and stares in at the window—this
rustic boor! But do you think, my dear,
 
that my heart remains proof against all temptations?
Alas no! If you had only seen that
gentlemanly dog who crept through the fence
of the neighbouring house. ‘Treasure’ is his
name. Ah, my dear, what a delightful snout he
has!”

(To the deuce with the stuff! What rubbish
it is! How can one blacken paper with such
absurdities. Give me a man. I want to see a
man! I need some food to nourish and refresh
my mind, and get this silliness instead. I will
turn the page to see if there is anything better
on the other side.)

“Sophie sat at the table and sewed something.
I looked out of the window and amused myself
by watching the passers-by. Suddenly a flunkey
entered and announced a visitor—‘Mr Teploff.’

“‘Show him in!’ said Sophie, and began to
embrace me. ‘Ah! Meggy, Meggy, do you
know who that is? He is dark, and belongs to
the Royal Household; and what eyes he has!
Dark and brilliant as fire.’

“Sophie hastened into her room. A minute
later a young gentleman with black whiskers
entered. He went to the mirror, smoothed his
hair, and looked round the room. I turned away
and sat down in my place.

“I pretended to observe nothing, and continued
 
to look out of the window. But I leant
my head a little on one side to hear what they
were talking about. Ah, my dear! what silly
things they discussed—how a lady executed the
wrong figure in dancing; how a certain Boboff,
with his expansive shirt-frill, had looked like a
stork and nearly fallen down; how a certain
Lidina imagined she had blue eyes when they
were really green, etc.

“I do not know, my dear, what special charm
she finds in her Mr Teploff, and why she is so
delighted with him.”

(It seems to me myself that there is something
wrong here. It is impossible that this Teploff
should bewitch her. We will see further.)

“If this gentleman of the Household pleases
her, then she must also be pleased, according to
my view, with that official who sits in her papa''s
writing-room. Ah, my dear, if you know what
a figure he is! A regular tortoise!”

“He has an extraordinary name. He always
sits there and mends the pens. His hair looks
like a truss of hay. Her papa always employs
him instead of a servant.”

(I believe this abominable little beast is referring
to me. But what has my hair got to do with
hay?)

You lie, cursed dog! What a scandalous
tongue! As if I did not know that it is envy
which prompts you, and that here there is
treachery at work—yes, the treachery of the
chief clerk. This man hates me implacably; he
has plotted against me, he is always seeking to
injure me. I''ll look through one more letter;
perhaps it will make the matter clearer.

“Fidel, my dear, pardon me that I have not
written for so long. I was floating in a dream
of delight. In truth, some author remarks,
‘Love is a second life.’ Besides, great changes
are going on in the house. The young chamberlain
is always here. Sophie is wildly in love with
him. Her papa is quite contented. I heard
from Gregor, who sweeps the floor, and is in
the habit of talking to himself, that the marriage
will soon be celebrated. Her papa will at any
rate get his daughter married to a general, a
colonel, or a chamberlain.”

Deuce take it! I can read no more. It is
all about chamberlains and generals. I should
like myself to be a general—not in order to sue
for her hand and all that—no, not at all; I
should like to be a general merely in order to
see people wriggling, squirming, and hatching
plots before me.

And then I should like to tell them that they
are both of them not worth spitting on. But it is
 
vexatious! I tear the foolish dog''s letters up in
a thousand pieces.

December 3rd.—It is not possible that the
marriage should take place; it is only idle gossip.
What does it signify if he is a chamberlain!
That is only a dignity, not a substantial thing
which one can see or handle. His chamberlain''s
office will not procure him a third eye in his
forehead. Neither is his nose made of gold; it
is just like mine or anyone else''s nose. He does
not eat and cough, but smells and sneezes with
it. I should like to get to the bottom of the
mystery—whence do all these distinctions come?
Why am I only a titular councillor?

Perhaps I am really a count or a general, and
only appear to be a titular councillor. Perhaps
I don''t even know who and what I am. How
many cases there are in history of a simple
gentleman, or even a burgher or peasant, suddenly
turning out to be a great lord or
baron? Well, suppose that I appear suddenly
in a general''s uniform, on the right shoulder an
epaulette, on the left an epaulette, and a blue
sash across my breast, what sort of a tune would
my beloved sing then? What would her papa,
our director, say? Oh, he is ambitious! He is
a freemason, certainly a freemason; however
much he may conceal it, I have found it out.
When he gives anyone his hand, he only reaches
 
out two fingers. Well, could not I this minute
be nominated a general or a superintendent? I
should like to know why I am a titular councillor—why
just that, and nothing more?

December 5th.—To-day I have been reading
papers the whole morning. Very strange things
are happening in Spain. I have not understood
them all. It is said that the throne is vacant,
the representatives of the people are in difficulties
about finding an occupant, and riots are
taking place.

All this appears to me very strange. How can
the throne be vacant? It is said that it will be
occupied by a woman. A woman cannot sit on
a throne. That is impossible. Only a king can
sit on a throne. They say that there is no king
there, but that is not possible. There cannot be
a kingdom without a king. There must be a
king, but he is hidden away somewhere. Perhaps
he is actually on the spot, and only some
domestic complications, or fears of the neighbouring
Powers, France and other countries,
compel him to remain in concealment; there
might also be other reasons.

December 8th.—I was nearly going to the
office, but various considerations kept me from
doing so. I keep on thinking about these
Spanish affairs. How is it possible that a woman
should reign? It would not be allowed, especially
 
by England. In the rest of Europe the
political situation is also critical; the Emperor of
Austria——

These events, to tell the truth, have so shaken
and shattered me, that I could really do nothing
all day. Mawra told me that I was very absent-minded
at table. In fact, in my absent-mindedness
I threw two plates on the ground so that
they broke in pieces.

After dinner I felt weak, and did not feel up
to making abstracts of reports. I lay most of
the time on my bed, and thought of the Spanish
affairs.

The year 2000: April 43rd.—To-day is a day
of splendid triumph. Spain has a king; he has
been found, and I am he. I discovered it to-day;
all of a sudden it came upon me like a flash
of lightning.

I do not understand how I could imagine that
I am a titular councillor. How could such a
foolish idea enter my head? It was fortunate
that it occurred to no one to shut me up in an
asylum. Now it is all clear, and as plain as
a pikestaff. Formerly—I don''t know why—everything
seemed veiled in a kind of mist.
That is, I believe, because people think that the
human brain is in the head. Nothing of the
sort; it is carried by the wind from the Caspian
Sea.

For the first time I told Mawra who I am.
When she learned that the king of Spain stood
before her, she struck her hands together
over her head, and nearly died of alarm. The
stupid thing had never seen the king of Spain
before!

I comforted her, however, at once by assuring
her that I was not angry with her for having
hitherto cleaned my boots badly. Women are
stupid things; one cannot interest them in
lofty subjects. She was frightened because she
thought all kings of Spain were like Philip II.
But I explained to her that there was a great
difference between me and him. I did not go
to the office. Why the deuce should I? No, my
dear friends, you won''t get me there again! I
am not going to worry myself with your infernal
documents any more.

Marchember 86. Between day and night.—To-day
the office-messenger came and summoned
me, as I had not been there for three weeks. I
went just for the fun of the thing. The chief
clerk thought I would bow humbly before him,
and make excuses; but I looked at him quite
indifferently, neither angrily nor mildly, and sat
down quietly at my place as though I noticed no
one. I looked at all this rabble of scribblers,
and thought, “If you only knew who is sitting
among you! Good heavens! what a to-do you
 
would make. Even the chief clerk would bow
himself to the earth before me as he does now
before the director.”

A pile of reports was laid before me, of which
to make abstracts, but I did not touch them with
one finger.

After a little time there was a commotion in
the office, and there a report went round that the
director was coming. Many of the clerks vied
with each other to attract his notice; but I did not
stir. As he came through our room, each one
hastily buttoned up his coat; but I had no idea
of doing anything of the sort. What is the
director to me? Should I stand up before him?
Never. What sort of a director is he? He is a
bottle-stopper, and no director. A quite ordinary,
simple bottle-stopper—nothing more. I
felt quite amused as they gave me a document
to sign.

They thought I would simply put down my
name—“So-and-so, Clerk.” Why not? But
at the top of the sheet, where the director generally
writes his name, I inscribed “Ferdinand VIII.”
in bold characters. You should have
seen what a reverential silence ensued. But
I made a gesture with my hand, and said,
“Gentlemen, no ceremony please!” Then I
went out, and took my way straight to the
director''s house.

He was not at home. The flunkey wanted not
 
to let me in, but I talked to him in such a way
that he soon dropped his arms.

I went straight to Sophie''s dressing-room.
She sat before the mirror. When she saw me,
she sprang up and took a step backwards; but I
did not tell her that I was the king of Spain.

But I told her that a happiness awaited her,
beyond her power to imagine; and that in spite
of all our enemies'' devices we should be united.
That was all which I wished to say to her, and I
went out. Oh, what cunning creatures these
women are! Now I have found out what woman
really is. Hitherto no one knew whom a woman
really loves; I am the first to discover it—she
loves the devil. Yes, joking apart, learned men
write nonsense when they pronounce that she is
this and that; she loves the devil—that is all.
You see a woman looking through her lorgnette
from a box in the front row. One thinks she is
watching that stout gentleman who wears an
order. Not a bit of it! She is watching the
devil who stands behind his back. He has
hidden himself there, and beckons to her with
his finger. And she marries him—actually—she
marries him!

That is all ambition, and the reason is that
there is under the tongue a little blister in which
there is a little worm of the size of a pin''s head.
And this is constructed by a barber in Bean
Street; I don''t remember his name at the
 
moment, but so much is certain that, in conjunction
with a midwife, he wants to spread
Mohammedanism all over the world, and that in
consequence of this a large number of people in
France have already adopted the faith of Islam.

No date. The day had no date.—I went for
a walk incognito on the Nevski Prospect. I
avoided every appearance of being the king of
Spain. I felt it below my dignity to let myself
be recognised by the whole world, since I must
first present myself at court. And I was also
restrained by the fact that I have at present no
Spanish national costume. If I could only get
a cloak! I tried to have a consultation with a
tailor, but these people are real asses! Moreover,
they neglect their business, dabble in
speculation, and have become loafers. I will
have a cloak made out of my new official uniform
which I have only worn twice. But to prevent
this botcher of a tailor spoiling it, I will make it
myself with closed doors, so that no one sees
me. Since the cut must be altogether altered,
I have used the scissors myself.

I don''t remember the date. The devil knows
what month it was. The cloak is quite ready.
Mawra exclaimed aloud when I put it on. I
will, however, not present myself at court yet;
the Spanish deputation has not yet arrived. It
would not be befitting if I appeared without
 
them. My appearance would be less imposing.
From hour to hour I expect them.

The 1st.—The extraordinary long delay of the
deputies in coming astonishes me. What can
possibly keep them? Perhaps France has a hand
in the matter; it is certainly hostilely inclined.
I went to the post office to inquire whether the
Spanish deputation had come. The postmaster
is an extraordinary blockhead who knows
nothing. “No,” he said to me, “there is no
Spanish deputation here; but if you want to send
them a letter, we will forward it at the fixed
rate.” The deuce! What do I want with a
letter? Letters are nonsense. Letters are
written by apothecaries….

Madrid, February 30th.—So I am in Spain
after all! It has happened so quickly that I
could hardly take it in. The Spanish deputies
came early this morning, and I got with them
into the carriage. This unexpected promptness
seemed to me strange. We drove so quickly
that in half an hour we were at the Spanish
frontier. Over all Europe now there are cast-iron
roads, and the steamers go very fast. A
wonderful country, this Spain!

As we entered the first room, I saw numerous
persons with shorn heads. I guessed at once
that they must be either grandees or soldiers, at
least to judge by their shorn heads.

The Chancellor of the State, who led me by
the hand, seemed to me to behave in a very
strange way; he pushed me into a little room
and said, “Stay here, and if you call yourself
‘King Ferdinand’ again, I will drive the wish
to do so out of you.”

I knew, however, that that was only a test,
and I reasserted my conviction; on which the
Chancellor gave me two such severe blows with
a stick on the back, that I could have cried out
with the pain. But I restrained myself, remembering
that this was a usual ceremony of old-time
chivalry when one was inducted into a high
position, and in Spain the laws of chivalry
prevail up to the present day. When I was
alone, I determined to study State affairs; I
discovered that Spain and China are one and the
same country, and it is only through ignorance
that people regard them as separate kingdoms.
I advise everyone urgently to write down the
word “Spain” on a sheet of paper; he will see
that it is quite the same as China.

But I feel much annoyed by an event which is
about to take place to-morrow; at seven o''clock
the earth is going to sit on the moon. This is
foretold by the famous English chemist, Wellington.
To tell the truth, I often felt uneasy
when I thought of the excessive brittleness and
fragility of the moon. The moon is generally
repaired in Hamburg, and very imperfectly. It
 
is done by a lame cooper, an obvious blockhead
who has no idea how to do it. He took waxed
thread and olive-oil—hence that pungent smell
over all the earth which compels people to hold
their noses. And this makes the moon so fragile
that no men can live on it, but only noses.
Therefore we cannot see our noses, because they
