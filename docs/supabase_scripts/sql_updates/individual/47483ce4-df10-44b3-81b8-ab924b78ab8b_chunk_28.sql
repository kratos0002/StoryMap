      likely young fellows in the district, for they all thought her handsome
      and they knew that she would have a good dowry. But she had chosen Patu;
      partly, perhaps, because she liked him better than she did the others, but
      still more, like a careful Normandy girl, because he had more crown
      pieces.

As they entered the white gateway of the husband''s farm, forty shots
      resounded without their seeing those who fired, as they were hidden in the
      ditches. The noise seemed to please the men, who were slouching along
      heavily in their best clothes, and Patu left his wife, and running up to a
      farm servant whom he perceived behind a tree, took his gun and fired a
      shot himself, as frisky as a young colt. Then they went on, beneath the
      apple trees which were heavy with fruit, through the high grass and
      through the midst of the calves, who looked at them with their great eyes,
      got up slowly and remained standing, with their muzzles turned toward the
      wedding party.

The men became serious when they came within measurable distance of the
      wedding dinner. Some of them, the rich ones, had on tall, shining silk
      hats, which seemed altogether out of place there; others had old
      head-coverings with a long nap, which might have been taken for moleskin,
      while the humblest among them wore caps. All the women had on shawls,
      which they wore loosely on their back, holding the tips ceremoniously
      under their arms. They were red, parti-colored, flaming shawls, and their
      brightness seemed to astonish the black fowls on the dung-heap, the ducks
      on the side of the pond and the pigeons on the thatched roofs.

The extensive farm buildings seemed to be waiting there at the end of that
      archway of apple trees, and a sort of vapor came out of open door and
      windows and an almost overpowering odor of eatables was exhaled from the
      vast building, from all its openings and from its very walls. The string
      of guests extended through the yard; but when the foremost of them reached
      the house, they broke the chain and dispersed, while those behind were
      still coming in at the open gate. The ditches were now lined with urchins
      and curious poor people, and the firing did not cease, but came from every
      side at once, and a cloud of smoke, and that odor which has the same
      intoxicating effect as absinthe, blended with the atmosphere. The women
      were shaking their dresses outside the door, to get rid of the dust, were
      undoing their cap-strings and pulling their shawls over their arms, and
      then they went into the house to lay them aside altogether for the time.
      The table was laid in the great kitchen that would hold a hundred persons;
      they sat down to dinner at two o''clock; and at eight o''clock they were
      still eating, and the men, in their shirt-sleeves, with their waistcoats
      unbuttoned and with red faces, were swallowing down the food and drink as
      if they had been whirlpools. The cider sparkled merrily, clear and golden
      in the large glasses, by the side of the dark, blood-colored wine, and
      between every dish they made a “hole,” the Normandy hole, with
      a glass of brandy which inflamed the body and put foolish notions into the
      head. Low jokes were exchanged across the table until the whole arsenal of
      peasant wit was exhausted. For the last hundred years the same broad
      stories had served for similar occasions, and, although every one knew
      them, they still hit the mark and made both rows of guests roar with
      laughter.

At one end of the table four young fellows, who were neighbors, were
      preparing some practical jokes for the newly married couple, and they
      seemed to have got hold of a good one by the way they whispered and
      laughed, and suddenly one of them, profiting by a moment of silence,
      exclaimed: “The poachers will have a good time to-night, with this
      moon! I say, Jean, you will not be looking at the moon, will you?”
      The bridegroom turned to him quickly and replied: “Only let them
      come, that''s all!” But the other young fellow began to laugh, and
      said: “I do not think you will pay much attention to them!”

The whole table was convulsed with laughter, so that the glasses shook,
      but the bridegroom became furious at the thought that anybody would profit
      by his wedding to come and poach on his land, and repeated: “I only
      say-just let them come!”

Then there was a flood of talk with a double meaning which made the bride
      blush somewhat, although she was trembling with expectation; and when they
      had emptied the kegs of brandy they all went to bed. The young couple went
      into their own room, which was on the ground floor, as most rooms in
      farmhouses are. As it was very warm, they opened the window and closed the
      shutters. A small lamp in bad taste, a present from the bride''s father,
      was burning on the chest of drawers, and the bed stood ready to receive
      the young people.

The young woman had already taken off her wreath and her dress, and she
      was in her petticoat, unlacing her boots, while Jean was finishing his
      cigar and looking at her out of the corners of his eyes. Suddenly, with a
      brusque movement, like a man who is about to set to work, he took off his
      coat. She had already taken off her boots, and was now pulling off her
      stockings, and then she said to him: “Go and hide yourself behind
      the curtains while I get into bed.”

He seemed as if he were about to refuse; but at last he did as she asked
      him, and in a moment she unfastened her petticoat, which slipped down,
      fell at her feet and lay on the ground. She left it there, stepped over it
      in her loose chemise and slipped into the bed, whose springs creaked
      beneath her weight. He immediately went up to the bed, and, stooping over
      his wife, he sought her lips, which she hid beneath the pillow, when a
      shot was heard in the distance, in the direction of the forest of Rapees,
      as he thought.

He raised himself anxiously, with his heart beating, and running to the
      window, he opened the shutters. The full moon flooded the yard with yellow
      light, and the reflection of the apple trees made black shadows at their
      feet, while in the distance the fields gleamed, covered with the ripe
      corn. But as he was leaning out, listening to every sound in the still
      night, two bare arms were put round his neck, and his wife whispered,
      trying to pull him back: “Do leave them alone; it has nothing to do
      with you. Come to bed.”

He turned round, put his arms round her, and drew her toward him, but just
      as he was laying her on the bed, which yielded beneath her weight, they
      heard another report, considerably nearer this time, and Jean, giving way
      to his tumultuous rage, swore aloud: “Damn it! They will think I do
      not go out and see what it is because of you! Wait, wait a few minutes!”
      He put on his shoes again, took down his gun, which was always hanging
      within reach against the wall, and, as his wife threw herself on her knees
      in her terror, imploring him not to go, he hastily freed himself, ran to
      the window and jumped into the yard.

She waited one hour, two hours, until daybreak, but her husband did not
      return. Then she lost her head, aroused the house, related how angry Jean
      was, and said that he had gone after the poachers, and immediately all the
      male farm-servants, even the boys, went in search of their master. They
      found him two leagues from the farm, tied hand and foot, half dead with
      rage, his gun broken, his trousers turned inside out, and with three dead
      hares hanging round his neck, and a placard on his chest with these words:
      “Who goes on the chase loses his place.”

In later years, when he used to tell this story of his wedding night, he
      usually added: “Ah! as far as a joke went it was a good joke. They
      caught me in a snare, as if I had been a rabbit, the dirty brutes, and
      they shoved my head into a bag. But if I can only catch them some day they
      had better look out for themselves!”

We had just left Rouen and were galloping along the road to Jumieges. The
      light carriage flew along across the level country. Presently the horse
      slackened his pace to walk up the hill of Cantelen.

One sees there one of the most magnificent views in the world. Behind us
      lay Rouen, the city of churches, with its Gothic belfries, sculptured like
      ivory trinkets; before us Saint Sever, the manufacturing suburb, whose
      thousands of smoking chimneys rise amid the expanse of sky, opposite the
      thousand sacred steeples of the old city.

On the one hand the spire of the cathedral, the highest of human
      monuments, on the other the engine of the power-house, its rival, and
      almost as high, and a metre higher than the tallest pyramid in Egypt.

Before us wound the Seine, with its scattered islands and bordered by
      white banks, covered with a forest on the right and on the left immense
      meadows, bounded by another forest yonder in the distance.

Here and there large ships lay at anchor along the banks of the wide
      river. Three enormous steam boats were starting out, one behind the other,
      for Havre, and a chain of boats, a bark, two schooners and a brig, were
      going upstream to Rouen, drawn by a little tug that emitted a cloud of
      black smoke.

My companion, a native of the country, did not glance at this wonderful
      landscape, but he smiled continually; he seemed to be amused at his
      thoughts. Suddenly he cried:

“Ah, you will soon see something comical—Father Matthew''s
      chapel. That is a sweet morsel, my boy.”

“I will give you a whiff of Normandy that will stay by you. Father
      Matthew is the handsomest Norman in the province and his chapel is one of
      the wonders of the world, nothing more nor less. But I will first give you
      a few words of explanation.

“Father Matthew, who is also called Father ''La Boisson,'' is an old
      sergeant-major who has come back to his native land. He combines in
      admirable proportions, making a perfect whole, the humbug of the old
      soldier and the sly roguery of the Norman. On his return to Normandy,
      thanks to influence and incredible cleverness, he was made doorkeeper of a
      votive chapel, a chapel dedicated to the Virgin and frequented chiefly by
      young women who have gone astray . . . . He composed and had painted a
      special prayer to his ''Good Virgin.'' This prayer is a masterpiece of
      unintentional irony, of Norman wit, in which jest is blended with fear of
      the saint and with the superstitious fear of the secret influence of
      something. He has not much faith in his protectress, but he believes in
      her a little through prudence, and he is considerate of her through
      policy.

“''Our good Madame Virgin Mary, natural protectress of girl mothers
      in this land and all over the world, protect your servant who erred in a
      moment of forgetfulness . . .''

“''Do not forget me, especially when you are with your holy spouse,
      and intercede with God the Father that he may grant me a good husband,
      like your own.''

“This prayer, which was suppressed by the clergy of the district, is
      sold by him privately, and is said to be very efficacious for those who
      recite it with unction.

“In fact he talks of the good Virgin as the valet de chambre of a
      redoubted prince might talk of his master who confided in him all his
      little private secrets. He knows a number of amusing anecdotes at his
      expense which he tells confidentially among friends as they sit over their
      glasses.

“As the fees coming from the Virgin did not appear sufficient to
      him, he added to the main figure a little business in saints. He has them
      all, or nearly all. There was not room enough in the chapel, so he stored
      them in the wood-shed and brings them forth as soon as the faithful ask
      for them. He carved these little wooden statues himself—they are
      comical in the extreme—and painted them all bright green one year
      when they were painting his house. You know that saints cure diseases, but
      each saint has his specialty, and you must not confound them or make any
      blunders. They are as jealous of each other as mountebanks.

“As Matthew has some time to spare, he drinks; but he drinks like a
      professional, with conviction, so much so that he is intoxicated regularly
      every evening. He is drunk, but he is aware of it. He is so well aware of
      it that he notices each day his exact degree of intoxication. That is his
      chief occupation; the chapel is a secondary matter.

“There is no such instrument, but Matthew''s observations are as
      precise as those of a mathematician. You may hear him repeating
      incessantly: ''Since Monday I have had more than forty-five,'' or else ''I
      was between fifty-two and fifty-eight,'' or else ''I had at least sixty-six
      to seventy,'' or ''Hullo, cheat, I thought I was in the fifties and here I
      find I had had seventy-five!''

“He declares that he never reached his limit, but as he acknowledges
      that his observations cease to be exact when he has passed ninety, one
      cannot depend absolutely on the truth of that statement.

“When Matthew acknowledges that he has passed ninety, you may rest
      assured that he is blind drunk.

“On these occasions his wife, Melie, another marvel, flies into a
      fury. She waits for him at the door of the house, and as he enters she
      roars at him:

“Then Matthew, who is not laughing any longer, plants himself
      opposite her and says in a severe tone:

“''Don''t bawl any more. I have had about ninety; I am not counting
      any more. Look out, I am going to hit you!''

“''Come, come! We have said enough. It is past. As long as I have not
      reached my limit there is no harm done. But if I go past that, I will
      allow you to correct me, my word on it!''”

Autumn, marvellous autumn, blended its gold and purple with the remaining
      traces of verdure. We passed through Duclair. Then, instead of going on to
      Jumieges, my friend turned to the left and, taking a crosscut, drove in
      among the trees.

And presently from the top of a high hill we saw again the magnificent
      valley of the Seine and the winding river beneath us.

At our right a very small slate-covered building, with a bell tower as
      large as a sunshade, adjoined a pretty house with green Venetian blinds,
      and all covered with honeysuckle and roses.

“Here are some friends!” cried a big voice, and Matthew
      appeared on the threshold. He was a man about sixty, thin and with a
      goatee and long, white mustache.

My friend shook him by the hand and introduced me, and Matthew took us
      into a clean kitchen, which served also as a dining-room. He said:

“I have no elegant apartment, monsieur. I do not like to get too far
      away from the food. The saucepans, you see, keep me company.” Then,
      turning to my friend:

“Why did you come on Thursday? You know quite well that this is the
      day I consult my Guardian Saint. I cannot go out this afternoon.”

And running to the door, he uttered a terrific roar: “Melie!”
      which must have startled the sailors in the ships along the stream in the
      valley below.

“I will tell you,” said Matthew. “Last year I found only
      twenty rasieres (an old dry measure) of apricots. There are no more, but
      those are the only things to make cider of. So I made some, and yesterday
      I tapped the barrel. Talk of nectar! That was nectar. You shall tell me
      what you think of it. Polyte was here, and we sat down and drank a glass
      and another without being satisfied (one could go on drinking it until
      to-morrow), and at last, with glass after glass, I felt a chill at my
      stomach. I said to Polyte: ''Supposing we drink a glass of cognac to warm
      ourselves?'' He agreed. But this cognac, it sets you on fire, so that we
      had to go back to the cider. But by going from chills to heat and heat to
      chills, I saw that I was in the nineties. Polyte was not far from his
      limit.”

“Don''t say that, Melie; don''t say that,” said Matthew, getting
      angry. “I have never reached my limit.”

They gave us a delicious luncheon outside beneath two lime trees, beside
      the little chapel and overlooking the vast landscape. And Matthew told us,
      with a mixture of humor and unexpected credulity, incredible stories of
      miracles.

We had drunk a good deal of delicious cider, sparkling and sweet, fresh
      and intoxicating, which he preferred to all other drinks, and were smoking
      our pipes astride our chairs when two women appeared.

They were old, dried up and bent. After greeting us they asked for Saint
      Blanc. Matthew winked at us as he replied:

“I will get him for you.” And he disappeared in his wood shed.
      He remained there fully five minutes. Then he came back with an expression
      of consternation. He raised his hands.

“I don''t know where he is. I cannot find him. I am quite sure that I
      had him.” Then making a speaking trumpet of his hands, he roared
      once more:

Saint Blanc was indeed stuck into the earth like an ordinary stake,
      covered with mud and dirt, and forming a corner for the rabbit hutch.

As soon as they perceived him, the two women fell on their knees, crossed
      themselves and began to murmur an “Oremus.” But Matthew darted
      toward them.

He went to fetch the straw and made them a priedieu. Then, looking at his
      muddy saint and doubtless afraid of bringing discredit on his business, he
      added:

He took a pail of water and a brush and began to scrub the wooden image
      vigorously, while the two old women kept on praying.

“All the same, when I put Saint Blanc out with the rabbits I thought
      he would not make any more money. For two years no one had asked for him.
      But the saints, you see, they are never out of date.”

Mme. Oreille was a very economical woman; she knew the value of a centime,
      and possessed a whole storehouse of strict principles with regard to the
      multiplication of money, so that her cook found the greatest difficulty in
      making what the servants call their market-penny, and her husband was
      hardly allowed any pocket money at all. They were, however, very
      comfortably off, and had no children; but it really pained Mme. Oreille to
      see any money spent; it was like tearing at her heartstrings when she had
      to take any of those nice crown-pieces out of her pocket; and whenever she
      had to spend anything, no matter how necessary it might be, she slept
      badly the next night.

“You don''t know what may happen,” she used to reply. “It
      is better to have too much than too little.”

She was a little woman of about forty, very active, rather hasty,
      wrinkled, very neat and tidy, and with a very short temper.

Her husband frequently complained of all the privations she made him
      endure; some of them were particularly painful to him, as they touched his
      vanity.

He was one of the head clerks in the War Office, and only stayed on there
      in obedience to his wife''s wish, to increase their income which they did
      not nearly spend.

For two years he had always come to the office with the same old patched
      umbrella, to the great amusement of his fellow clerks. At last he got
      tired of their jokes, and insisted upon his wife buying him a new one. She
      bought one for eight francs and a half, one of those cheap articles which
      large houses sell as an advertisement. When the men in the office saw the
      article, which was being sold in Paris by the thousand, they began their
      jokes again, and Oreille had a dreadful time of it. They even made a song
      about it, which he heard from morning till night all over the immense
      building.

Oreille was very angry, and peremptorily told his wife to get him a new
      one, a good silk one, for twenty francs, and to bring him the bill, so
      that he might see that it was all right.

She bought him one for eighteen francs, and said, getting red with anger
      as she gave it to her husband:

Oreille felt quite triumphant, and received a small ovation at the office
      with his new acquisition.

“You should not leave it fastened up with the elastic; it will very
      likely cut the silk. You must take care of it, for I shall not buy you a
      new one in a hurry.”

She took it, unfastened it, and remained dumfounded with astonishment and
      rage; in the middle of the silk there was a hole as big as a
      six-penny-piece; it had been made with the end of a cigar.

And rushing at him, as if she were going to beat him, she violently thrust
      the little circular burned hole under his nose.

“What-what is it? How should I know? I have done nothing, I will
      swear. I don''t know what is the matter with the umbrella.”

“You have been playing tricks with it at the office; you have been
      playing the fool and opening it, to show it off!” she screamed.

But she shook with rage, and got up one of those conjugal scenes which
      make a peaceable man dread the domestic hearth more than a battlefield
      where bullets are raining.

She mended it with a piece of silk cut out of the old umbrella, which was
      of a different color, and the next day Oreille went off very humbly with
      the mended article in his hand. He put it into a cupboard, and thought no
      more of it than of some unpleasant recollection.

But he had scarcely got home that evening when his wife took the umbrella
      from him, opened it, and nearly had a fit when she saw what had befallen
      it, for the disaster was irreparable. It was covered with small holes,
      which evidently proceeded from burns, just as if some one had emptied the
      ashes from a lighted pipe on to it. It was done for utterly, irreparably.

She looked at it without a word, in too great a passion to be able to say
      anything. He, also, when he saw the damage, remained almost dumfounded, in
      a state of frightened consternation.

They looked at each other, then he looked at the floor; and the next
      moment she threw the useless article at his head, screaming out in a
      transport of the most violent rage, for she had recovered her voice by
      that time:

“Oh! you brute! you brute! You did it on purpose, but I will pay you
      out for it. You shall not have another.”

And then the scene began again, and after the storm had raged for an hour,
      he at last was able to explain himself. He declared that he could not
      understand it at all, and that it could only proceed from malice or from
      vengeance.

Mme. Oreille submitted the case to him. As for buying a new umbrella, that
      was out of the question; her husband should not have another. The friend
      very sensibly said that in that case his clothes would be spoiled, and
      they were certainly worth more than the umbrella. But the little woman,
      who was still in a rage, replied:

“Very well, then, when it rains he may have the kitchen umbrella,
      for I will not give him a new silk one.”

“All right,” he said; “then I shall resign my post. I am
      not going to the office with the kitchen umbrella.”

“It will cost at least eight francs to re-cover it. Eight and
      eighteen are twenty-six. Just fancy, twenty-six francs for an umbrella! It
      is utter madness!”

“Make your fire assurance pay for it. The companies pay for all
      articles that are burned, as long as the damage has been done in your own
      house.”

On hearing this advice the little woman calmed down immediately, and then,
      after a moment''s reflection, she said to her husband:

“To-morrow, before going to your office, you will go to the
      Maternelle Assurance Company, show them the state your umbrella is in, and
      make them pay for the damage.”

“I would not do it for my life! It is eighteen francs lost, that is
      all. It will not ruin us.”

Left at home alone, Mme. Oreille could not get over the loss of her
      eighteen francs by any means. She had put the umbrella on the dining-room
      table, and she looked at it without being able to come to any
      determination.

Every moment she thought of the assurance company, but she did not dare to
      encounter the quizzical looks of the gentlemen who might receive her, for
      she was very timid before people, and blushed at a mere nothing, and was
      embarrassed when she had to speak to strangers.

But the regret at the loss of the eighteen francs pained her as if she had
      been wounded. She tried not to think of it any more, and yet every moment
      the recollection of the loss struck her painfully. What was she to do,
      however? Time went on, and she could not decide; but suddenly, like all
      cowards, on making a resolve, she became determined.

But first of all she was obliged to prepare the umbrella so that the
      disaster might be complete, and the reason of it quite evident. She took a
      match from the mantelpiece, and between the ribs she burned a hole as big
      as the palm of her hand; then she delicately rolled it up, fastened it
      with the elastic band, put on her bonnet and shawl, and went quickly
      toward the Rue de Rivoli, where the assurance office was.

But the nearer she got, the slower she walked. What was she going to say,
      and what reply would she get?

She looked at the numbers of the houses; there were still twenty-eight.
      That was all right, so she had time to consider, and she walked slower and
      slower. Suddenly she saw a door on which was a large brass plate with
      “La Maternelle Fire Assurance Office” engraved on it. Already!
      She waited a moment, for she felt nervous and almost ashamed; then she
      walked past, came back, walked past again, and came back again.

She could not help noticing, however, how her heart beat as she entered.
      She went into an enormous room with grated doors all round it, and above
      them little openings at which a man''s head appeared, and as a gentleman
      carrying a number of papers passed her, she stopped him and said timidly:
      “I beg your pardon, monsieur, but can you tell me where I must apply
      for payment for anything that has been accidentally burned?”

This frightened her still more, and she felt inclined to run away, to put
      in no claim, to sacrifice her eighteen francs. But the idea of that sum
      revived her courage, and she went upstairs, out of breath, stopping at
      almost every other step.

She obeyed mechanically, and found herself in a large room where three
      solemn gentlemen, all with a decoration in their buttonholes, were
      standing talking.

She could hardly get out her words, but stammered: “I have come—I
      have come on account of an accident, something—“.

“The company, gentlemen, does not consider that it is under any
      obligation to you for more than four hundred thousand francs, and we can
      pay no attention to your claim to the further sum of a hundred thousand,
      which you wish to make us pay. Besides that, the surveyor''s valuation—”

“That is quite enough, monsieur; the law courts will decide between
      us, and we have nothing further to do than to take our leave.” And
      they went out after mutual ceremonious bows.

Oh! if she could only have gone away with them, how gladly she would have
      done it; she would have run away and given up everything. But it was too
      late, for the gentleman came back, and said, bowing:

With trembling fingers she tried to undo the elastic, and succeeding,
      after several attempts, she hastily opened the damaged remains of the
      umbrella.

She began to feel uncomfortable; perhaps this company did not pay for such
      small articles, and she said:

She remained open-mouthed, not knowing what to say next; then, suddenly
      recollecting that she had left out the main thing, she said hastily:

“I am Mme. Oreille; we are assured in La Maternelle, and I have come
      to claim the value of this damage.”

The manager was rather embarrassed, and said: “But, really, madame,
      we do not sell umbrellas; we cannot undertake such kinds of repairs.”

The little woman felt her courage reviving; she was not going to give up
      without a struggle; she was not even afraid any more, and said:

“Really, madame, it is such a very small matter! We are never asked
      to give compensation for such trivial losses. You must allow that we
      cannot make good pocket-handkerchiefs, gloves, brooms, slippers, all the
      small articles which are every day exposed to the chances of being burned.”

“But, monsieur, last December one of our chimneys caught fire, and
      caused at least five hundred francs'' damage; M. Oreille made no claim on
      the company, and so it is only just that it should pay for my umbrella
      now.”

“You must acknowledge, madame, that it is very surprising that M.
      Oreille should have asked no compensation for damages amounting to five
      hundred francs, and should now claim five or six francs for mending an
      umbrella.”

“I beg your pardon, monsieur, the five hundred francs affected M.
      Oreille''s pocket, whereas this damage, amounting to eighteen francs,
      concerns Mme. Oreille''s pocket only, which is a totally different matter.”

As he saw that he had no chance of getting rid of her, and that he would
      only be wasting his time, he said resignedly:

“This is how it happened, monsieur: In our hall there is a bronze
      stick and umbrella stand, and the other day, when I came in, I put my
      umbrella into it. I must tell you that just above there is a shelf for the
      candlesticks and matches. I put out my hand, took three or four matches,
      and struck one, but it missed fire, so I struck another, which ignited,
      but went out immediately, and a third did the same.”

“Very likely. At any rate, the fourth caught fire, and I lit my
      candle, and went into my room to go to bed; but in a quarter of an hour I
      fancied that I smelt something burning, and I have always been terribly
      afraid of fire. If ever we have an accident it will not be my fault, I
      assure you. I am terribly nervous since our chimney was on fire, as I told
      you; so I got up, and hunted about everywhere, sniffing like a dog after
      game, and at last I noticed that my umbrella was burning. Most likely a
      match had fallen between the folds and burned it. You can see how it has
      damaged it.”

She did not know what to say, as she was not certain what value to put on
      it, but at last she replied:

“Well, I think that—Look here, monsieur, I do not want to make
      any money out of you, so I will tell you what we will do. I will take my
      umbrella to the maker, who will re-cover it in good, durable silk, and I
      will bring the bill to you. Will that suit you, monsieur?”

“Perfectly, madame; we will settle it so. Here is a note for the
      cashier, who will repay you whatever it costs you.”

He gave Mme. Oreille a slip of paper, who took it, got up and went out,
      thanking him, for she was in a hurry to escape lest he should change his
      mind.

She went briskly through the streets, looking out for a really good
      umbrella maker, and when she found a shop which appeared to be a
      first-class one, she went in, and said, confidently:

“I want this umbrella re-covered in silk, good silk. Use the very
      best and strongest you have; I don''t mind what it costs.”

The coach for Havre was ready to leave Criquetot, and all the passengers
      were waiting for their names to be called out, in the courtyard of the
      Commercial Hotel kept by Monsieur Malandain, Jr.

It was a yellow wagon, mounted on wheels which had once been yellow, but
      were now almost gray through the accumulation of mud. The front wheels
      were very small, the back ones, high and fragile, carried the large body
      of the vehicle, which was swollen like the belly of an animal. Three white
      horses, with enormous heads and great round knees, were the first things
      one noticed. They were harnessed ready to draw this coach, which had
      something of the appearance of a monster in its massive structure. The
      horses seemed already asleep in front of the strange vehicle.

The driver, Cesaire Horlaville, a little man with a big paunch, supple
      nevertheless, through his constant habit of climbing over the wheels to
      the top of the wagon, his face all aglow from exposure to the brisk air of
      the plains, to rain and storms, and also from the use of brandy, his eyes
      twitching from the effect of constant contact with wind and hail, appeared
      in the doorway of the hotel, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand.
      Large round baskets, full of frightened poultry, were standing in front of
      the peasant women. Cesaire Horlaville took them one after the other and
      packed them on the top of his coach; then more gently, he loaded on those
      containing eggs; finally he tossed up from below several little bags of
      grain, small packages wrapped in handkerchiefs, pieces of cloth, or paper.
      Then he opened the back door, and drawing a list from his pocket he
      called:

The priest advanced. He was a large, powerful, robust man with a red face
      and a genial expression. He hitched up his cassock to lift his foot, just
      as the women hold up their skirts, and climbed into the coach.

The man hastened forward, tall, timid, wearing a long frock coat which
      fell to his knees, and he in turn disappeared through the open door.

Poiret approached, a tall, round-shouldered man, bent by the plow,
      emaciated through abstinence, bony, with a skin dried by a sparing use of
      water. His wife followed him, small and thin, like a tired animal,
      carrying a large green umbrella in her hands.

The driver was going to answer with a jest, when Rabot dived head first
      towards the door, pushed forward by a vigorous shove from his wife, a
      tall, square woman with a large, round stomach like a barrel, and hands as
      large as hams.

A large peasant, heavier than an ox, made the springs bend, and was in
      turn engulfed in the interior of the yellow chest.

Belhomme, tall and thin, came forward, his neck bent, his head hanging, a
      handkerchief held to his ear as if he were suffering from a terrible
      toothache.

All these people wore the blue blouse over quaint and antique coats of a
      black or greenish cloth, Sunday clothes which they would only uncover in
      the streets of Havre. Their heads were covered by silk caps at high as
      towers, the emblem of supreme elegance in the small villages of Normandy.

The driver then yelling “Get up!” as loud as he could, whipped
      up his horses. They shook themselves, and, with an effort, started off at
      a slow, halting gait. And behind them came the coach, rattling its shaky
      windows and iron springs, making a terrible clatter of hardware and glass,
      while the passengers were tossed hither and thither like so many rubber
      balls.

At first all kept silent out of respect for the priest, that they might
      not shock him. Being of a loquacious and genial disposition, he started
      the conversation.

The enormous farmer who, on account of his size, girth and stomach, felt a
      bond of sympathy for the representative of the Church, answered with a
      smile:

“Oh! I''d be all right only the colzas ain''t a-goin'' to give much
      this year, and times are so hard that they are the only things worth while
      raisin''.”

Rabot, slender, timid, and self-satisfied, bowed smilingly, bending his
      head forward as though to say: “Yes, I''m the Rabot whom Blondel
      married.”

Suddenly Maitre Belhomme, still holding his handkerchief to his ear, began
      groaning in a pitiful fashion. He was going “Oh-oh-oh!” and
      stamping his foot in order to show his terrible suffering.

“I don''t know whether it''s wax; but I know that it is a bug, a big
      bug, that crawled in while I was asleep in the haystack.”

“Am I sure? As sure as I am of heaven, Monsieur le cure! I can feel
      it gnawing at the bottom of my ear! It''s eating my head for sure! It''s
      eating my head! Oh-oh-oh!” And he began to stamp his foot again.

Great interest had been aroused among the spectators. Each one gave his
      bit of advice. Poiret claimed that it was a spider, the teacher, thought
      it might be a caterpillar. He had already seen such a thing once, at
      Campemuret, in Orne, where he had been for six years. In this case the
      caterpillar had gone through the head and out at the nose. But the man
      remained deaf in that ear ever after, the drum having been pierced.

Maitre Belhomme, his head resting against the door, for he had been the
      last one to enter, was still moaning.

“Oh—oh—oh! I think it must be an ant, a big ant—there
      it is biting again. Oh, Monsieur le cure, how it hurts! how it hurts!”

The fear of the doctor seemed to cure Belhomme. He straightened up
      without, however, dropping his handkerchief.

“What! You have money for them, for those loafers? He would have
      come once, twice, three times, four times, five times! That means two
      five-franc pieces, two five-franc pieces, for sure. And what would he have
      done, the loafer, tell me, what would he have done? Can you tell me?”

“He kneaded his back with both hands as though he were making bread!
      And he was all right in a couple of hours!”

Belhomme thought that Chambrelan must also have used some charm, but he
      did not dare say so before the priest. Caniveau replied, laughing:

“Are you sure it isn''t a rabbit that you have in your ear? He might
      have taken that hole for his home. Wait, I''ll make him run away.”

Whereupon Caniveau, making a megaphone of his hands, began to mimic the
      barking of hounds. He snapped, howled, growled, barked. And everybody in
      the carriage began to roar, even the schoolmaster, who, as a rule, never
      ever smiled.

However, as Belhomme seemed angry at their making fun of him, the priest
      changed the conversation and turning to Rabot''s big wife, said:

And Rabot smiled broadly, nodding his head. He was responsible for
      fifteen, he alone, Rabot! His wife said so! Therefore there could be no
      doubt about it. And he was proud!

And whose was the sixteenth? She didn''t tell. It was doubtless the first.
      Perhaps everybody knew, for no one was surprised. Even Caniveau kept mum.

“If someone were to pour a little water into your ear, it might
      perhaps drive it out. Do you want to try?”

And everybody got out in order to witness the operation. The priest asked
      for a bowl, a napkin and a glass of water, then he told the teacher to
      hold the patient''s head over on one side, and, as soon as the liquid
      should have entered the ear, to turn his head over suddenly on the other
      side.

But Caniveau, who was already peering into Belhomme''s ear to see if he
      couldn''t discover the beast, shouted:

“Gosh! What a mess! You''ll have to clear that out, old man. Your
      rabbit could never get through that; his feet would stick.”

The priest in turn examined the passage and saw that it was too narrow and
      too congested for him to attempt to expel the animal. It was the teacher
      who cleared out this passage by means of a match and a bit of cloth. Then,
      in the midst of the general excitement, the priest poured into the passage
      half a glass of water, which trickled over the face through the hair and
      down the neck of the patient. Then the schoolmaster quickly twisted the
      head round over the bowl, as though he were trying to unscrew it. A couple
      of drops dripped into the white bowl. All the passengers rushed forward.
      No insect had come out.

However, Belhomme exclaimed: “I don''t feel anything any more.”
      The priest triumphantly exclaimed: “Certainly it has been drowned.”
      Everybody was happy and got back into the coach.

But hardly had they started when Belhomme began to cry out again. The bug
      had aroused itself and had become furious. He even declared that it had
      now entered his head and was eating his brain. He was howling with such
      contortions that Poiret''s wife, thinking him possessed by the devil, began
      to cry and to cross herself. Then, the pain abating a little, the sick man
      began to tell how it was running round in his ear. With his finger he
      imitated the movements of the body, seeming to see it, to follow it with
      his eyes: “There it goes up again! Oh—oh—oh—what
      torture!”

Caniveau was getting impatient. “It''s the water that is making the
      bug angry. It is probably more accustomed to wine.”

Everybody laughed, and he continued: “When we get to the Cafe
      Bourbeux, give it some brandy, and it won''t bother you any more, I wager.”

But Belhomme could contain himself no longer; he began howling as though
      his soul were being torn from his body. The priest was obliged to hold his
      head for him. They asked Cesaire Horlaville to stop at the nearest house.
      It was a farmhouse at the side of the road. Belhomme was carried into it
      and laid on the kitchen table in order to repeat the operation. Caniveau
      advised mixing brandy and water in order to benumb and perhaps kill the
      insect. But the priest preferred vinegar.

They poured the liquid in drop by drop this time, that it might penetrate
      down to the bottom, and they left it several minutes in the organ that the
      beast had chosen for its home.

A bowl had once more been brought; Belhomme was turned over bodily by the
      priest and Caniveau, while the schoolmaster was tapping on the healthy ear
      in order to empty the other.

Suddenly, at the bottom of the bowl appeared a little brown spot, no
      bigger than a tiny seed. However, it was moving. It was a flea! First
      there were cries of astonishment and then shouts of laughter. A flea!
      Well, that was a good joke, a mighty good one! Caniveau was slapping his
      thigh, Cesaire Horlaville snapped his whip, the priest laughed like a
      braying donkey, the teacher cackled as though he were sneezing, and the
      two women were giving little screams of joy, like the clucking of hens.

Belhomme had seated himself on the table and had taken the bowl between
      his knees; he was observing, with serious attention and a vengeful anger
      in his eye, the conquered insect which was twisting round in the water. He
      grunted, “You rotten little beast!” and he spat on it.

The driver, wild with joy, kept repeating: “A flea, a flea, ah!
      there you are, damned little flea, damned little flea, damned little flea!”
      Then having calmed down a little, he cried: “Well, back to the
      coach! We''ve lost enough time.”

The steamer was crowded with people and the crossing promised to be good.
      I was going from Havre to Trouville.

The ropes were thrown off, the whistle blew for the last time, the whole
      boat started to tremble, and the great wheels began to revolve, slowly at
      first, and then with ever-increasing rapidity.

We were gliding along the pier, black with people. Those on board were
      waving their handkerchiefs, as though they were leaving for America, and
      their friends on shore were answering in the same manner.

The big July sun was shining down on the red parasols, the light dresses,
      the joyous faces and on the ocean, barely stirred by a ripple. When we
      were out of the harbor, the little vessel swung round the big curve and
      pointed her nose toward the distant shore which was barely visible through
      the early morning mist. On our left was the broad estuary of the Seine,
      her muddy water, which never mingles with that of the ocean, making large
      yellow streaks clearly outlined against the immense sheet of the pure
      green sea.

As soon as I am on a boat I feel the need of walking to and fro, like a
      sailor on watch. Why? I do not know. Therefore I began to thread my way
      along the deck through the crowd of travellers. Suddenly I heard my name
      called. I turned around. I beheld one of my old friends, Henri Sidoine,
      whom I had not seen for ten years.

We shook hands and continued our walk together, talking of one thing or
      another. Suddenly Sidoine, who had been observing the crowd of passengers,
      cried out angrily:

It was indeed full of them. The men were standing about, looking over the
      ocean with an all-important air, as though to say: “We are the
      English, the lords of the sea! Here we are!”

The young girls, formless, with shoes which reminded one of the naval
      constructions of their fatherland, wrapped in multi-colored shawls, were
      smiling vacantly at the magnificent scenery. Their small heads, planted at
      the top of their long bodies, wore English hats of the strangest build.

And the old maids, thinner yet, opening their characteristic jaws to the
      wind, seemed to threaten one with their long, yellow teeth. On passing
      them, one could notice the smell of rubber and of tooth wash.

“You don''t understand? I''m not surprised. Well, she simply learned
      how to speak French—that''s all! Listen.

“I didn''t have the least desire of getting married when I went to
      spend the summer at Etretat two years ago. There is nothing more dangerous
      than watering-places. You have no idea how it suits young girls. Paris is
      the place for women and the country for young girls.

“Donkey rides, surf-bathing, breakfast on the grass, all these
      things are traps set for the marriageable man. And, really, there is
      nothing prettier than a child about eighteen, running through a field or
      picking flowers along the road.

“I made the acquaintance of an English family who were stopping at
      the same hotel where I was. The father looked like those men you see over
      there, and the mother was like all other Englishwomen.

“They had two sons, the kind of boys who play rough games with
      balls, bats or rackets from morning till night; then came two daughters,
      the elder a dry, shrivelled-up Englishwoman, the younger a dream of
      beauty, a heavenly blonde. When those chits make up their minds to be
      pretty, they are divine. This one had blue eyes, the kind of blue which
      seems to contain all the poetry, all the dreams, all the hopes and
      happiness of the world!

“What an infinity of dreams is caused by two such eyes! How well
      they answer the dim, eternal question of our heart!

“It must not be forgotten either that we Frenchmen adore foreign
      women. As soon as we meet a Russian, an Italian, a Swede, a Spaniard, or
      an Englishwoman with a pretty face, we immediately fall in love with her.
      We enthuse over everything which comes from outside—clothes, hats,
      gloves, guns and—women. But what a blunder!

“I believe that that which pleases us in foreign women is their
      accent. As soon as a woman speaks our language badly we think she is
      charming, if she uses the wrong word she is exquisite and if she jabbers
      in an entirely unintelligible jargon, she becomes irresistible.

“My little English girl, Kate, spoke a language to be marvelled at.
      At the beginning I could understand nothing, she invented so many new
      words; then I fell absolutely in love with this queer, amusing dialect.
      All maimed, strange, ridiculous terms became delightful in her mouth.
      Every evening, on the terrace of the Casino, we had long conversations
      which resembled spoken enigmas.

“I married her! I loved her wildly, as one can only love in a dream.
      For true lovers only love a dream which has taken the form of a woman.

“Well, my dear fellow, the most foolish thing I ever did was to give
      my wife a French teacher. As long as she slaughtered the dictionary and
      tortured the grammar I adored her. Our conversations were simple. They
      revealed to me her surprising gracefulness and matchless elegance; they
      showed her to me as a wonderful speaking jewel, a living doll made to be
      kissed, knowing, after a fashion, how to express what she loved. She
      reminded me of the pretty little toys which say ''papa'' and ''mamma'' when
      you pull a string.

“Ah! you don''t know, as I do, the opinions, the ideas, the theories
      of a well-educated young English girl, whom I can blame in nothing, and
      who repeats to me from morning till night sentences from a French reader
      prepared in England for the use of young ladies'' schools.

“You have seen those cotillon favors, those pretty gilt papers,
      which enclose candies with an abominable taste. I have one of them. I tore
      it open. I wished to eat what was inside and it disgusted me so that I
      feel nauseated at seeing her compatriots.

“I have married a parrot to whom some old English governess might
      have taught French. Do you understand?”

Daddy Taille had three daughters: Anna, the eldest, who was scarcely ever
      mentioned in the family; Rose, the second girl, who was eighteen, and
      Clara, the youngest, who was a girl of fifteen.

Old Taille was a widower and a foreman in M. Lebrument''s button
      manufactory. He was a very upright man, very well thought of, abstemious;
      in fact, a sort of model workman. He lived at Havre, in the Rue
      d''Angouleme.

When Anna ran away from home the old man flew into a fearful rage. He
      threatened to kill the head clerk in a large draper''s establishment in
      that town, whom he suspected. After a time, when he was told by various
      people that she was very steady and investing money in government
      securities, that she was no gadabout, but was a great friend of Monsieur
      Dubois, who was a judge of the Tribunal of Commerce, the father was
      appeased.

He even showed some anxiety as to how she was getting on, and asked some
      of her old friends who had been to see her, and when told that she had her
      own furniture, and that her mantelpiece was covered with vases and the
      walls with pictures, that there were clocks and carpets everywhere, he
      gave a broad contented smile. He had been working for thirty years to get
      together a wretched five or six thousand francs. This girl was evidently
      no fool.

One fine morning the son of Touchard, the cooper, at the other end of the
      street, came and asked him for the hand of Rose, the second girl. The old
      man''s heart began to beat, for the Touchards were rich and in a good
      position. He was decidedly lucky with his girls.

The marriage was agreed upon, and it was settled that it should be a grand
      affair, and the wedding dinner was to be held at Sainte-Adresse, at Mother
      Jusa''s restaurant. It would cost a lot certainly, but never mind, it did
      not matter just for once in a way.

But one morning, just as the old man was going home to luncheon with his
      two daughters, the door opened suddenly, and Anna appeared. She was well
      dressed and looked undeniably pretty and nice. She threw her arms round
      her father''s neck before he could say a word, then fell into her sisters''
      arms with many tears and then asked for a plate, so that she might share
      the family soup. Taille was moved to tears in his turn and said several
      times:

Then she told them about herself. She did not wish Rose''s wedding to take
      place at Sainte-Adresse—certainly not. It should take place at her
      house and would cost her father nothing. She had settled everything and
      arranged everything, so it was “no good to say any more about it—there!”

“Very well, my dear! very well!” the old man said; “we
      will leave it so.” But then he felt some doubt. Would the Touchards
      consent? But Rose, the bride-elect, was surprised and asked: “Why
      should they object, I should like to know? Just leave that to me; I will
      talk to Philip about it.”

She mentioned it to her lover the very same day, and he declared it would
      suit him exactly. Father and Mother Touchard were naturally delighted at
      the idea of a good dinner which would cost them nothing and said:

They asked to be allowed to bring a friend, Madame Florence, the cook on
      the first floor, and Anna agreed to everything.

After the civil formalities and the religious ceremony the wedding party
      went to Anna''s house. Among those whom the Tailles had brought was a
      cousin of a certain age, a Monsieur Sauvetanin, a man given to
      philosophical reflections, serious, and always very self-possessed, and
      Madame Lamondois, an old aunt.

Monsieur Sautevanin had been told off to give Anna his arm, as they were
      looked upon as the two most important persons in the company.

As soon as they had arrived at the door of Anna''s house she let go her
      companion''s arm, and ran on ahead, saying: “I will show you the way,”
      and ran upstairs while the invited guests followed more slowly; and, when
      they got upstairs, she stood on one side to let them pass, and they rolled
      their eyes and turned their heads in all directions to admire this
      mysterious and luxurious dwelling.

The table was laid in the drawing-room, as the dining-room had been
      thought too small. Extra knives, forks and spoons had been hired from a
      neighboring restaurant, and decanters stood full of wine under the rays of
      the sun which shone in through the window.

The ladies went into the bedroom to take off their shawls and bonnets, and
      Father Touchard, who was standing at the door, made funny and suggestive
      signs to the men, with many a wink and nod. Daddy Taille, who thought a
      great deal of himself, looked with fatherly pride at his child''s
      well-furnished rooms and went from one to the other, holding his hat in
      his hand, making a mental inventory of everything, and walking like a
      verger in a church.

Anna went backward and forward, ran about giving orders and hurrying on
      the wedding feast. Soon she appeared at the door of the dining-room and
      cried: “Come here, all of you, for a moment,” and as the
      twelve guests entered the room they saw twelve glasses of Madeira on a
      small table.

Rose and her husband had their arms round each other''s waists and were
      kissing each other in every corner. Monsieur Sauvetanin never took his
      eyes off Anna.

They sat down, and the wedding breakfast began, the relations sitting at
      one end of the table and the young people at the other. Madame Touchard,
      the mother, presided on the right and the bride on the left. Anna looked
      after everybody, saw that the glasses were kept filled and the plates well
      supplied. The guests evidently felt a certain respectful embarrassment at
      the sight of all the sumptuousness of the rooms and at the lavish manner
      in which they were treated. They all ate heartily of the good things
      provided, but there were no jokes such as are prevalent at weddings of
      that sort; it was all too grand, and it made them feel uncomfortable. Old
      Madame Touchard, who was fond of a bit of fun, tried to enliven matters a
      little, and at the beginning of the dessert she exclaimed: “I say,
      Philip, do sing us something.” The neighbors in their street
      considered that he had the finest voice in all Havre.

The bridegroom got up, smiled, and, turning to his sister-in-law, from
      politeness and gallantry, tried to think of something suitable for the
      occasion, something serious and correct, to harmonize with the seriousness
      of the repast.

Anna had a satisfied look on her face, and leaned back in her chair to
      listen, and all assumed looks of attention, though prepared to smile
      should smiles be called for.

The singer announced “The Accursed Bread,” and, extending his
      right arm, which made his coat ruck up into his neck, he began.

It was decidedly long, three verses of eight lines each, with the last
      line and the last but one repeated twice.

All went well for the first two verses; they were the usual commonplaces
      about bread gained by honest labor and by dishonesty. The aunt and the
      bride wept outright. The cook, who was present, at the end of the first
      verse looked at a roll which she held in her hand, with streaming eyes, as
      if it applied to her, while all applauded vigorously. At the end of the
      second verse the two servants, who were standing with their backs to the
      wall, joined loudly in the chorus, and the aunt and the bride wept
      outright.

Daddy Taille blew his nose with the noise of a trombone, and old Touchard
      brandished a whole loaf half over the table, and the cook shed silent
      tears on the crust which she was still holding.

“That is the right sort of song; very different from the nasty,
      risky things one generally hears at weddings.”

Anna, who was visibly affected, kissed her hand to her sister and pointed
      to her husband with an affectionate nod, as if to congratulate her.

Intoxicated by his success, the young man continued, and unfortunately the
      last verse contained words about the “bread of dishonor”
      gained by young girls who had been led astray. No one took up the refrain
      about this bread, supposed to be eaten with tears, except old Touchard and
      the two servants. Anna had grown deadly pale and cast down her eyes, while
      the bridegroom looked from one to the other without understanding the
      reason for this sudden coldness, and the cook hastily dropped the crust as
      if it were poisoned.

Monsieur Sauvetanin said solemnly, in order to save the situation: “That
      last couplet is not at all necessary”; and Daddy Taille, who had got
      red up to his ears, looked round the table fiercely.

Then Anna, her eyes swimming in tears, told the servants in the faltering
      voice of a woman trying to stifle her sobs, to bring the champagne.

All the guests were suddenly seized with exuberant joy, and all their
      faces became radiant again. And when old Touchard, who had seen, felt and
      understood nothing of what was going on, and pointing to the guests so as
      to emphasize his words, sang the last words of the refrain:

“Children, I warn you all to eat not of that bread,” the whole
      company, when they saw the champagne bottles, with their necks covered
      with gold foil, appear, burst out singing, as if electrified by the sight:

The marriage of Maitre Simon Lebrument with Mademoiselle Jeanne Cordier
      was a surprise to no one. Maitre Lebrument had bought out the practice of
      Maitre Papillon; naturally, he had to have money to pay for it; and
      Mademoiselle Jeanne Cordier had three hundred thousand francs clear in
      currency, and in bonds payable to bearer.

Maitre Lebrument was a handsome man. He was stylish, although in a
      provincial way; but, nevertheless, he was stylish—a rare thing at
      Boutigny-le-Rebours.

Mademoiselle Cordier was graceful and fresh-looking, although a trifle
      awkward; nevertheless, she was a handsome girl, and one to be desired.

The marriage ceremony turned all Boutigny topsy-turvy. Everybody admired
      the young couple, who quickly returned home to domestic felicity, having
      decided simply to take a short trip to Paris, after a few days of
      retirement.

This tete-a-tete was delightful, Maitre Lebrument having shown just the
      proper amount of delicacy. He had taken as his motto: “Everything
      comes to him who waits.” He knew how to be at the same time patient
      and energetic. His success was rapid and complete.

After four days, Madame Lebrument adored her husband. She could not get
      along without him. She would sit on his knees, and taking him by the ears
      she would say: “Open your mouth and shut your eyes.” He would
      open his mouth wide and partly close his eyes, and he would try to nip her
      fingers as she slipped some dainty between his teeth. Then she would give
      him a kiss, sweet and long, which would make chills run up and down his
      spine. And then, in his turn, he would not have enough caresses to please
      his wife from morning to night and from night to morning.

“If you wish, we will leave for Paris next Tuesday. We will be like
      two lovers, we will go to the restaurants, the theatres, the concert
      halls, everywhere, everywhere!”

“And then, as we must forget nothing, ask your father to have your
      dowry ready; I shall pay Maitre Papillon on this trip.”

And he took her in his arms once more, to renew those sweet games of love
      which she had so enjoyed for the past week.

The following Tuesday, father-in-law and mother-in-law went to the station
      with their daughter and their son-in-law who were leaving for the capital.

“I tell you it is very imprudent to carry so much money about in a
      pocketbook.” And the young lawyer smiled.

“Don''t worry; I am accustomed to such things. You understand that,
      in my profession, I sometimes have as much as a million about me. In this
      manner, at least we avoid a great amount of red tape and delay. You
      needn''t worry.”

The whistle blew and the train started. The trip lasted about an hour,
      during which time they did not say very much to each other, as the two old
      ladies did not go to sleep.

“Dearie, let us first go over to the Boulevard and get something to
      eat; then we can quietly return and get our trunk and bring it to the
      hotel.”

“Is that the way you save money? A cab for a five minutes'' ride at
      six cents a minute! You would deprive yourself of nothing.”

A big omnibus was passing by, drawn by three big horses, which were
      trotting along. Lebrument called out:

She had no time to answer. The conductor, who had seized her by the arm to
      help her up the step, pushed her inside, and she fell into a seat,
      bewildered, looking through the back window at the feet of her husband as
      he climbed up to the top of the vehicle.

And she sat there motionless, between a fat man who smelled of cheap
      tobacco and an old woman who smelled of garlic.

All the other passengers were lined up in silence—a grocer''s boy, a
      young girl, a soldier, a gentleman with gold-rimmed spectacles and a big
      silk hat, two ladies with a self-satisfied and crabbed look, which seemed
      to say: “We are riding in this thing, but we don''t have to,”
      two sisters of charity and an undertaker. They looked like a collection of
      caricatures.

The jolting of the wagon made them wag their heads and the shaking of the
      wheels seemed to stupefy them—they all looked as though they were
      asleep.

“Why didn''t he come inside with me?” she was saying to
      herself. An unaccountable sadness seemed to be hanging over her. He really
      need not have acted so.

The sisters motioned to the conductor to stop, and they got off one after
      the other, leaving in their wake the pungent smell of camphor. The bus
      started tip and soon stopped again. And in got a cook, red-faced and out
      of breath. She sat down and placed her basket of provisions on her knees.
      A strong odor of dish-water filled the vehicle.

The undertaker went out, and was replaced by a coachman who seemed to
      bring the atmosphere of the stable with him. The young girl had as a
      successor a messenger, the odor of whose feet showed that he was
      continually walking.

Other persons left and others entered. The stage went on through
      interminable streets, stopping at stations and starting again.

“How far it is!” thought Jeanne. “I hope he hasn''t gone
      to sleep! He has been so tired the last few days.”

She looked at him, understanding that he was speaking to her, as there was
      no one else there. For the third time the man said:

“Come on, little one, you''ve talked enough! You can find ten men for
      every one that you lose. Now run along. You''ll find another one somewhere.”

“But, monsieur, you are mistaken; I assure you that you must be
      mistaken. He had a big portfolio under his arm.”

“A big portfolio! Oh, yes! He got off at the Madeleine. He got rid
      of you, all right! Ha! ha! ha!”

The stage had stopped. She got out and, in spite of herself, she looked up
      instinctively to the roof of the bus. It was absolutely deserted.

Then she began to cry, and, without thinking that anybody was listening or
      watching her, she said out loud:

She began to walk straight ahead, too bewildered, too crazed even to
      understand what had happened to her. Where was she to go? What could she
      do? What could have happened to him? How could he have made such a
      mistake? How could he have been so forgetful?

She had two francs in her pocket. To whom could she go? Suddenly she
      remembered her cousin Barral, one of the assistants in the offices of the
      Ministry of the Navy.

She had just enough to pay for a cab. She drove to his house. He met her
      just as he was leaving for his office. He was carrying a large portfolio
      under his arm, just like Lebrument.

As people were stopping to look at them, he pushed her gently into the
      vestibule of his house, and, supporting her with his arm around her waist,
      he led her up the stairs, and as his astonished servant opened the door,
      he ordered:

“Sophie, run to the restaurant and get a luncheon for two. I am not
      going to the office to-day.”

He was dead—the head of a high tribunal, the upright magistrate
      whose irreproachable life was a proverb in all the courts of France.
      Advocates, young counsellors, judges had greeted him at sight of his
      large, thin, pale face lighted up by two sparkling deep-set eyes, bowing
      low in token of respect.

He had passed his life in pursuing crime and in protecting the weak.
      Swindlers and murderers had no more redoubtable enemy, for he seemed to
      read the most secret thoughts of their minds.

He was dead, now, at the age of eighty-two, honored by the homage and
      followed by the regrets of a whole people. Soldiers in red trousers had
      escorted him to the tomb and men in white cravats had spoken words and
      shed tears that seemed to be sincere beside his grave.

But here is the strange paper found by the dismayed notary in the desk
      where he had kept the records of great criminals! It was entitled: WHY?

20th June, 1851. I have just left court. I have condemned Blondel to
      death! Now, why did this man kill his five children? Frequently one meets
      with people to whom the destruction of life is a pleasure. Yes, yes, it
      should be a pleasure, the greatest of all, perhaps, for is not killing the
      next thing to creating? To make and to destroy! These two words contain
      the history of the universe, all the history of worlds, all that is, all!
      Why is it not intoxicating to kill?

25th June. To think that a being is there who lives, who walks, who runs.
      A being? What is a being? That animated thing, that bears in it the
      principle of motion and a will ruling that motion. It is attached to
      nothing, this thing. Its feet do not belong to the ground. It is a grain
      of life that moves on the earth, and this grain of life, coming I know not
      whence, one can destroy at one''s will. Then nothing—nothing more. It
      perishes, it is finished.

26th June. Why then is it a crime to kill? Yes, why? On the contrary, it
      is the law of nature. The mission of every being is to kill; he kills to
      live, and he kills to kill. The beast kills without ceasing, all day,
      every instant of his existence. Man kills without ceasing, to nourish
      himself; but since he needs, besides, to kill for pleasure, he has
      invented hunting! The child kills the insects he finds, the little birds,
      all the little animals that come in his way. But this does not suffice for
      the irresistible need to massacre that is in us. It is not enough to kill
      beasts; we must kill man too. Long ago this need was satisfied by human
      sacrifices. Now the requirements of social life have made murder a crime.
      We condemn and punish the assassin! But as we cannot live without yielding
      to this natural and imperious instinct of death, we relieve ourselves,
      from time to time, by wars. Then a whole nation slaughters another nation.
      It is a feast of blood, a feast that maddens armies and that intoxicates
      civilians, women and children, who read, by lamplight at night, the
      feverish story of massacre.

One might suppose that those destined to accomplish these butcheries of
      men would be despised! No, they are loaded with honors. They are clad in
      gold and in resplendent garments; they wear plumes on their heads and
      ornaments on their breasts, and they are given crosses, rewards, titles of
      every kind. They are proud, respected, loved by women, cheered by the
      crowd, solely because their mission is to shed human blood; They drag
      through the streets their instruments of death, that the passer-by, clad
      in black, looks on with envy. For to kill is the great law set by nature
      in the heart of existence! There is nothing more beautiful and honorable
      than killing!

30th June. To kill is the law, because nature loves eternal youth. She
      seems to cry in all her unconscious acts: “Quick! quick! quick!”
      The more she destroys, the more she renews herself.

2d July. A human being—what is a human being? Through thought it is
      a reflection of all that is; through memory and science it is an abridged
      edition of the universe whose history it represents, a mirror of things
      and of nations, each human being becomes a microcosm in the macrocosm.

3d July. It must be a pleasure, unique and full of zest, to kill; to have
      there before one the living, thinking being; to make therein a little
      hole, nothing but a little hole, to see that red thing flow which is the
      blood, which makes life; and to have before one only a heap of limp flesh,
      cold, inert, void of thought!

5th August. I, who have passed my life in judging, condemning, killing by
      the spoken word, killing by the guillotine those who had killed by the
      knife, I, I, if I should do as all the assassins have done whom I have
      smitten, I—I—who would know it?

10th August. Who would ever know? Who would ever suspect me, me, me,
      especially if I should choose a being I had no interest in doing away
      with?

15th August. The temptation has come to me. It pervades my whole being; my
      hands tremble with the desire to kill.

22d August. I could resist no longer. I killed a little creature as an
      experiment, for a beginning. Jean, my servant, had a goldfinch in a cage
      hung in the office window. I sent him on an errand, and I took the little
      bird in my hand, in my hand where I felt its heart beat. It was warm. I
      went up to my room. From time to time I squeezed it tighter; its heart
      beat faster; this was atrocious and delicious. I was near choking it. But
      I could not see the blood.

Then I took scissors, short-nail scissors, and I cut its throat with three
      slits, quite gently. It opened its bill, it struggled to escape me, but I
      held it, oh! I held it—I could have held a mad dog—and I saw
      the blood trickle.

And then I did as assassins do—real ones. I washed the scissors, I
      washed my hands. I sprinkled water and took the body, the corpse, to the
      garden to hide it. I buried it under a strawberry-plant. It will never be
      found. Every day I shall eat a strawberry from that plant. How one can
      enjoy life when one knows how!

30th August. It is done. But what a little thing! I had gone for a walk in
      the forest of Vernes. I was thinking of nothing, literally nothing. A
      child was in the road, a little child eating a slice of bread and butter.

The wish to kill him intoxicated me like wine. I approached him quite
      softly, persuaded that he was going to run away. And, suddenly, I seized
      him by the throat. He looked at me with terror in his eyes—such
      eyes! He held my wrists in his little hands and his body writhed like a
      feather over the fire. Then he moved no more. I threw the body in the
      ditch, and some weeds on top of it. I returned home, and dined well. What
      a little thing it was! In the evening I was very gay, light, rejuvenated;
      I passed the evening at the Prefect''s. They found me witty. But I have not
      seen blood! I am tranquil.

6th October. Nothing has been discovered. Some strolling vagabond must
      have done the deed. Ah! ah! If I had seen the blood flow, it seems to me I
      should be tranquil now! The desire to kill is in my blood; it is like the
      passion of youth at twenty.

20th October. Yet another. I was walking by the river, after breakfast.
      And I saw, under a willow, a fisherman asleep. It was noon. A spade was
      standing in a potato-field near by, as if expressly, for me.

I took it. I returned; I raised it like a club, and with one blow of the
      edge I cleft the fisherman''s head. Oh! he bled, this one! Rose-colored
      blood. It flowed into the water, quite gently. And I went away with a
      grave step. If I had been seen! Ah! ah! I should have made an excellent
      assassin.

25th October. The affair of the fisherman makes a great stir. His nephew,
      who fished with him, is charged with the murder.

26th October. The examining magistrate affirms that the nephew is guilty.
      Everybody in town believes it. Ah! ah!

27th October. The nephew makes a very poor witness. He had gone to the
      village to buy bread and cheese, he declared. He swore that his uncle had
      been killed in his absence! Who would believe him?

15th November. There are overwhelming proofs against the nephew, who was
      his uncle''s heir. I shall preside at the sessions.

25th January. To death! to death! to death! I have had him condemned to
      death! Ah! ah! The advocate-general spoke like an angel! Ah! ah! Yet
      another! I shall go to see him executed!

10th March. It is done. They guillotined him this morning. He died very
      well! very well! That gave me pleasure! How fine it is to see a man''s head
      cut off!

Alienist physicians to whom the awful story has been submitted declare
      that there are in the world many undiscovered madmen as adroit and as much
      to be feared as this monstrous lunatic.

There was a masquerade ball at the Elysee-Montmartre that evening. It was
      the ''Mi-Careme'', and the crowds were pouring into the brightly lighted
      passage which leads to the dance ball, like water flowing through the open
      lock of a canal. The loud call of the orchestra, bursting like a storm of
      sound, shook the rafters, swelled through the whole neighborhood and
      awoke, in the streets and in the depths of the houses, an irresistible
      desire to jump, to get warm, to have fun, which slumbers within each human
      animal.

The patrons came from every quarter of Paris; there were people of all
      classes who love noisy pleasures, a little low and tinged with debauch.
      There were clerks and girls—girls of every description, some wearing
      common cotton, some the finest batiste; rich girls, old and covered with
      diamonds, and poor girls of sixteen, full of the desire to revel, to
      belong to men, to spend money. Elegant black evening suits, in search of
      fresh or faded but appetizing novelty, wandering through the excited
      crowds, looking, searching, while the masqueraders seemed moved above all
      by the desire for amusement. Already the far-famed quadrilles had
      attracted around them a curious crowd. The moving hedge which encircled
      the four dancers swayed in and out like a snake, sometimes nearer and
      sometimes farther away, according to the motions of the performers. The
      two women, whose lower limbs seemed to be attached to their bodies by
      rubber springs, were making wonderful and surprising motions with their
      legs. Their partners hopped and skipped about, waving their arms about.
      One could imagine their panting breath beneath their masks.

One of them, who had taken his place in the most famous quadrille, as
      substitute for an absent celebrity, the handsome “Songe-au-Gosse,”
      was trying to keep up with the tireless “Arete-de-Veau” and
      was making strange fancy steps which aroused the joy and sarcasm of the
      audience.

He was thin, dressed like a dandy, with a pretty varnished mask on his
      face. It had a curly blond mustache and a wavy wig. He looked like a wax
      figure from the Musee Grevin, like a strange and fantastic caricature of
      the charming young man of fashion plates, and he danced with visible
      effort, clumsily, with a comical impetuosity. He appeared rusty beside the
      others when he tried to imitate their gambols: he seemed overcome by
      rheumatism, as heavy as a great Dane playing with greyhounds. Mocking
      bravos encouraged him. And he, carried away with enthusiasm, jigged about
      with such frenzy that suddenly, carried away by a wild spurt, he pitched
      head foremost into the living wall formed by the audience, which opened up
      before him to allow him to pass, then closed around the inanimate body of
      the dancer, stretched out on his face.

Some men picked him up and carried him away, calling for a doctor. A
      gentleman stepped forward, young and elegant, in well-fitting evening
      clothes, with large pearl studs. “I am a professor of the Faculty of
      Medicine,” he said in a modest voice. He was allowed to pass, and he
      entered a small room full of little cardboard boxes, where the still
      lifeless dancer had been stretched out on some chairs. The doctor at first
      wished to take off the mask, and he noticed that it was attached in a
      complicated manner, with a perfect network of small metal wires which
      cleverly bound it to his wig and covered the whole head. Even the neck was
      imprisoned in a false skin which continued the chin and was painted the
      color of flesh, being attached to the collar of the shirt.

All this had to be cut with strong scissors. When' WHERE id = '47483ce4-df10-44b3-81b8-ab924b78ab8b';
