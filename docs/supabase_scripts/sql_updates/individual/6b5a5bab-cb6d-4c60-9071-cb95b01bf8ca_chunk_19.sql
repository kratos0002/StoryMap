      often, for they were both kept at home by their occupations, and lived a
      long way from each other. But as the girl was twelve years old, and going
      to be confirmed, he seized that opportunity to write to his sister, asking
      her to come and be present at the ceremony. Their old parents were dead,
      and as she could not well refuse her goddaughter, she accepted the
      invitation. Her brother, whose name was Joseph, hoped that by dint of
      showing his sister attention, she might be induced to make her will in the
      girl''s favor, as she had no children of her own.

His sister''s occupation did not trouble his scruples in the least, and,
      besides, nobody knew anything about it at Virville. When they spoke of
      her, they only said: “Madame Tellier is living at Fecamp,”
      which might mean that she was living on her own private income. It was
      quite twenty leagues from Fecamp to Virville, and for a peasant, twenty
      leagues on land is as long a journey as crossing the ocean would be to
      city people. The people at Virville had never been further than Rouen, and
      nothing attracted the people from Fecamp to a village of five hundred
      houses in the middle of a plain, and situated in another department; at
      any rate, nothing was known about her business.

But the Confirmation was coming on, and Madame Tellier was in great
      embarrassment. She had no substitute, and did not at all care to leave her
      house, even for a day; for all the rivalries between the girls upstairs
      and those downstairs would infallibly break out. No doubt Frederic would
      get drunk, and when he was in that state, he would knock anybody down for
      a mere word. At last, however, she made up her mind to take them all with
      her, with the exception of the man, to whom she gave a holiday until the
      next day but one.

When she asked her brother, he made no objection, but undertook to put
      them all up for a night, and so on Saturday morning the eight-o''clock
      express carried off Madame Tellier and her companions in a second-class
      carriage. As far as Beuzeville they were alone, and chattered like
      magpies, but at that station a couple got in. The man, an old peasant,
      dressed in a blue blouse with a turned-down collar, wide sleeves tight at
      the wrist, ornamented with white embroidery, wearing an old high hat with
      long nap, held an enormous green umbrella in one hand, and a large basket
      in the other, from which the heads of three frightened ducks protruded.
      The woman, who sat up stiffly in her rustic finery, had a face like a
      fowl, with a nose that was as pointed as a bill. She sat down opposite her
      husband and did not stir, as she was startled at finding herself in such
      smart company.

There was certainly an array of striking colors in the carriage. Madame
      Tellier was dressed in blue silk from head to foot, and had on a dazzling
      red imitation French cashmere shawl. Fernande was puffing in a Scotch
      plaid dress, of which her companions had laced the bodice as tight as they
      could, forcing up her full bust, that was continually heaving up and down.
      Raphaele, with a bonnet covered with feathers, so that it looked like a
      bird''s nest, had on a lilac dress with gold spots on it, and there was
      something Oriental about it that suited her Jewish face. Rosa had on a
      pink skirt with largo flounces, and looked like a very fat child, an obese
      dwarf; while the two Pumps looked as if they had cut their dresses out of
      old flowered curtains dating from the Restoration.

As soon as they were no longer alone in the compartment, the ladies put on
      staid looks, and began to talk of subjects which might give others a high
      opinion of them. But at Bolbeck a gentleman with light whiskers, a gold
      chain, and wearing two or three rings, got in, and put several parcels
      wrapped in oilcloth on the rack over his head. He looked inclined for a
      joke, and seemed a good-hearted fellow.

“Are you ladies changing your quarters?” he said, and that
      question embarrassed them all considerably. Madame Tellier, however,
      quickly regained her composure, and said sharply, to avenge the honor of
      her corps:

She could not think of a retort, so, perhaps thinking she had said enough,
      madame gave him a dignified bow and compressed her lips.

Then the gentleman, who was sitting between Rosa and the old peasant,
      began to wink knowingly at the ducks whose heads were sticking out of the
      basket, and when he felt that he had fixed the attention of his public, he
      began to tickle them under the bills and spoke funnily to them to make the
      company smile.

“We have left our little pond, quack! quack! to make the
      acquaintance of the little spit, qu-ack! qu-ack!”

The unfortunate creatures turned their necks away, to avoid his caresses,
      and made desperate efforts to get out of their wicker prison, and then,
      suddenly, all at once, uttered the most lamentable quacks of distress. The
      women exploded with laughter. They leaned forward and pushed each other,
      so as to see better; they were very much interested in the ducks, and the
      gentleman redoubled his airs, his wit and his teasing.

Rosa joined in, and leaning over her neighbor''s legs, she kissed the three
      animals on the head, and immediately all the girls wanted to kiss them, in
      turn, and as they did so the gentleman took them on his knee, jumped them
      up and down and pinched their arms. The two peasants, who were even in
      greater consternation than their poultry, rolled their eyes as if they
      were possessed, without venturing to move, and their old wrinkled faces
      had not a smile, not a twitch.

Then the gentleman, who was a commercial traveller, offered the ladies
      suspenders by way of a joke, and taking up one of his packages, he opened
      it. It was a joke, for the parcel contained garters. There were blue silk,
      pink silk, red silk, violet silk, mauve silk garters, and the buckles were
      made of two gilt metal cupids embracing each other. The girls uttered
      exclamations of delight and looked at them with that gravity natural to
      all women when they are considering an article of dress. They consulted
      one another by their looks or in a whisper, and replied in the same
      manner, and Madame Tellier was longingly handling a pair of orange garters
      that were broader and more imposing looking than the rest; really fit for
      the mistress of such an establishment.

There was a torrent of exclamations, and they squeezed their petticoats
      between their legs, but he quietly waited his time and said: “Well,
      if you will not try them on I shall pack them up again.”

But the two Pumps looked so distressed that he renewed his offer to them,
      and Flora, especially, visibly hesitated, and he insisted: “Come, my
      dear, a little courage! Just look at that lilac pair; it will suit your
      dress admirably.”

That decided her, and pulling up her dress she showed a thick leg fit for
      a milkmaid, in a badly fitting, coarse stocking. The commercial traveller
      stooped down and fastened the garter. When he had done this, he gave her
      the lilac pair and asked: “Who next?”

“I! I!” they all shouted at once, and he began on Rosa, who
      uncovered a shapeless, round thing without any ankle, a regular “sausage
      of a leg,” as Raphaele used to say.

Lastly, Madame Tellier herself put out her leg, a handsome, muscular
      Norman leg, and in his surprise and pleasure, the commercial traveller
      gallantly took off his hat to salute that master calf, like a true French
      cavalier.

The two peasants, who were speechless from surprise, glanced sideways out
      of the corner of one eye, and they looked so exactly like fowls that the
      man with the light whiskers, when he sat up, said: “Co—co—ri—co”
      under their very noses, and that gave rise to another storm of amusement.

The old people got out at Motteville with their basket, their ducks and
      their umbrella, and they heard the woman say to her husband as they went
      away:

The funny commercial traveller himself got out at Rouen, after behaving so
      coarsely that Madame Tellier was obliged sharply to put him in his right
      place, and she added, as a moral: “This will teach us not to talk to
      the first comer.”

At Oissel they changed trains, and at a little station further on Monsieur
      Joseph Rivet was waiting for them with a large cart with a number of
      chairs in it, drawn by a white horse.

Three of them sat on three chairs at the back, Raphaele, Madame Tellier
      and her brother on the three chairs in front, while Rosa, who had no seat,
      settled herself as comfortably as she could on tall Fernande''s knees, and
      then they set off.

But the horse''s jerky trot shook the cart so terribly that the chairs
      began to dance and threw the travellers about, to the right and to the
      left, as if they were dancing puppets, which made them scream and make
      horrible grimaces.

They clung on to the sides of the vehicle, their bonnets fell on their
      backs, over their faces and on their shoulders, and the white horse went
      on stretching out his head and holding out his little hairless tail like a
      rat''s, with which he whisked his buttocks from time to time.

Joseph Rivet, with one leg on the shafts and the other doubled under him,
      held the reins with his elbows very high, and kept uttering a kind of
      clucking sound, which made the horse prick up its ears and go faster.

The green country extended on either side of the road, and here and there
      the colza in flower presented a waving expanse of yellow, from which arose
      a strong, wholesome, sweet and penetrating odor, which the wind carried to
      some distance.

The cornflowers showed their little blue heads amid the rye, and the women
      wanted to pick them, but Monsieur Rivet refused to stop.

Then, sometimes, a whole field appeared to be covered with blood, so thick
      were the poppies, and the cart, which looked as if it were filled with
      flowers of more brilliant hue, jogged on through fields bright with wild
      flowers, and disappeared behind the trees of a farm, only to reappear and
      to go on again through the yellow or green standing crops, which were
      studded with red or blue.

One o''clock struck as they drove up to the carpenter''s door. They were
      tired out and pale with hunger, as they had eaten nothing since they left
      home. Madame Rivet ran out and made them alight, one after another, and
      kissed them as soon as they were on the ground, and she seemed as if she
      would never tire of kissing her sister-in-law, whom she apparently wanted
      to monopolize. They had lunch in the workshop, which had been cleared out
      for the next day''s dinner.

The capital omelet, followed by boiled chitterlings and washed down with
      good hard cider, made them all feel comfortable.

Rivet had taken a glass so that he might drink with them, and his wife
      cooked, waited on them, brought in the dishes, took them out and asked
      each of them in a whisper whether they had everything they wanted. A
      number of boards standing against the walls and heaps of shavings that had
      been swept into the corners gave out a smell of planed wood, a smell of a
      carpenter''s shop, that resinous odor which penetrates to the lungs.

They wanted to see the little girl, but she had gone to church and would
      not be back again until evening, so they all went out for a stroll in the
      country.

It was a small village, through which the highroad passed. Ten or a dozen
      houses on either side of the single street were inhabited by the butcher,
      the grocer, the carpenter, the innkeeper, the shoemaker and the baker.

The church was at the end of the street and was surrounded by a small
      churchyard, and four immense lime-trees, which stood just outside the
      porch, shaded it completely. It was built of flint, in no particular
      style, and had a slate-roofed steeple. When you got past it, you were
      again in the open country, which was varied here and there by clumps of
      trees which hid the homesteads.

Rivet had given his arm to his sister, out of politeness, although he was
      in his working clothes, and was walking with her in a dignified manner.
      His wife, who was overwhelmed by Raphaele''s gold-striped dress, walked
      between her and Fernande, and roly-poly Rosa was trotting behind with
      Louise and Flora, the Seesaw, who was limping along, quite tired out.

The inhabitants came to their doors, the children left off playing, and a
      window curtain would be raised, so as to show a muslin cap, while an old
      woman with a crutch, who was almost blind, crossed herself as if it were a
      religious procession, and they all gazed for a long time at those handsome
      ladies from town, who had come so far to be present at the confirmation of
      Joseph Rivet''s little girl, and the carpenter rose very much in the public
      estimation.

As they passed the church they heard some children singing. Little shrill
      voices were singing a hymn, but Madame Tellier would not let them go in,
      for fear of disturbing the little cherubs.

After the walk, during which Joseph Rivet enumerated the principal landed
      proprietors, spoke about the yield of the land and the productiveness of
      the cows and sheep, he took his tribe of women home and installed them in
      his house, and as it was very small, they had to put them into the rooms,
      two and two.

Just for once Rivet would sleep in the workshop on the shavings; his wife
      was to share her bed with her sister-in-law, and Fernande and Raphaele
      were to sleep together in the next room. Louise and Flora were put into
      the kitchen, where they had a mattress on the floor, and Rosa had a little
      dark cupboard to herself at the top of the stairs, close to the loft,
      where the candidate for confirmation was to sleep.

When the little girl came in she was overwhelmed with kisses; all the
      women wished to caress her with that need of tender expansion, that habit
      of professional affection which had made them kiss the ducks in the
      railway carriage.

They each of them took her on their knees, stroked her soft, light hair
      and pressed her in their arms with vehement and spontaneous outbursts of
      affection, and the child, who was very good and religious, bore it all
      patiently.

As the day had been a fatiguing one for everybody, they all went to bed
      soon after dinner. The whole village was wrapped in that perfect stillness
      of the country, which is almost like a religious silence, and the girls,
      who were accustomed to the noisy evenings of their establishment, felt
      rather impressed by the perfect repose of the sleeping village, and they
      shivered, not with cold, but with those little shivers of loneliness which
      come over uneasy and troubled hearts.

As soon as they were in bed, two and two together, they clasped each other
      in their arms, as if to protect themselves against this feeling of the
      calm and profound slumber of the earth. But Rosa, who was alone in her
      little dark cupboard, felt a vague and painful emotion come over her.

She was tossing about in bed, unable to get to sleep, when she heard the
      faint sobs of a crying child close to her head, through the partition. She
      was frightened, and called out, and was answered by a weak voice, broken
      by sobs. It was the little girl, who was always used to sleeping in her
      mother''s room, and who was afraid in her small attic.

Rosa was delighted, got up softly so as not to awaken any one, and went
      and fetched the child. She took her into her warm bed, kissed her and
      pressed her to her bosom, lavished exaggerated manifestations of
      tenderness on her, and at last grew calmer herself and went to sleep. And
      till morning the candidate for confirmation slept with her head on Rosa''s
      bosom.

At five o''clock the little church bell, ringing the Angelus, woke the
      women, who usually slept the whole morning long.

The villagers were up already, and the women went busily from house to
      house, carefully bringing short, starched muslin dresses or very long wax
      tapers tied in the middle with a bow of silk fringed with gold, and with
      dents in the wax for the fingers.

The sun was already high in the blue sky, which still had a rosy tint
      toward the horizon, like a faint remaining trace of dawn. Families of
      fowls were walking about outside the houses, and here and there a black
      cock, with a glistening breast, raised his head, which was crowned by his
      red comb, flapped his wings and uttered his shrill crow, which the other
      cocks repeated.

Vehicles of all sorts came from neighboring parishes, stopping at the
      different houses, and tall Norman women dismounted, wearing dark dresses,
      with kerchiefs crossed over the bosom, fastened with silver brooches a
      hundred years old.

The men had put on their blue smocks over their new frock-coats or over
      their old dress-coats of green-cloth, the two tails of which hung down
      below their blouses. When the horses were in the stable there was a double
      line of rustic conveyances along the road: carts, cabriolets, tilburies,
      wagonettes, traps of every shape and age, tipping forward on their shafts
      or else tipping backward with the shafts up in the air.

The carpenter''s house was as busy as a bee-hive. The women, in
      dressing-jackets and petticoats, with their thin, short hair, which looked
      faded and worn, hanging down their backs, were busy dressing the child,
      who was standing quietly on a table, while Madame Tellier was directing
      the movements of her battalion. They washed her, did her hair, dressed
      her, and with the help of a number of pins, they arranged the folds of her
      dress and took in the waist, which was too large.

Then, when she was ready, she was told to sit down and not to move, and
      the women hurried off to get ready themselves.

The church bell began to ring again, and its tinkle was lost in the air,
      like a feeble voice which is soon drowned in space. The candidates came
      out of the houses and went toward the parochial building, which contained
      the two schools and the mansion house, and which stood quite at one end of
      the village, while the church was situated at the other.

The parents, in their very best clothes, followed their children, with
      embarrassed looks, and those clumsy movements of a body bent by toil.

The little girls disappeared in a cloud of muslin, which looked like
      whipped cream, while the lads, who looked like embryo waiters in a cafe
      and whose heads shone with pomatum, walked with their legs apart, so as
      not to get any dust or dirt on their black trousers.

It was something for a family, to be proud of, when a large number of
      relatives, who had come from a distance, surrounded the child, and the
      carpenter''s triumph was complete.

Madame Tellier''s regiment, with its leader at its head, followed
      Constance; her father gave his arm to his sister, her mother walked by the
      side of Raphaele, Fernande with Rosa and Louise and Flora together, and
      thus they proceeded majestically through the village, like a general''s
      staff in full uniform, while the effect on the village was startling.

At the school the girls ranged themselves under the Sister of Mercy and
      the boys under the schoolmaster, and they started off, singing a hymn as
      they went. The boys led the way, in two files, between the two rows of
      vehicles, from which the horses had been taken out, and the girls followed
      in the same order; and as all the people in the village had given the town
      ladies the precedence out of politeness, they came immediately behind the
      girls, and lengthened the double line of the procession still more, three
      on the right and three on the left, while their dresses were as striking
      as a display of fireworks.

When they went into the church the congregation grew quite excited. They
      pressed against each other, turned round and jostled one another in order
      to see, and some of the devout ones spoke almost aloud, for they were so
      astonished at the sight of those ladies whose dresses were more elaborate
      than the priest''s vestments.

The mayor offered them his pew, the first one on the right, close to the
      choir, and Madame Tellier sat there with her sister-in-law, Fernande and
      Raphaele. Rosa, Louise and Flora occupied the second seat, in company with
      the carpenter.

The choir was full of kneeling children, the girls on one side and the
      boys on the other, and the long wax tapers which they held looked like
      lances pointing in all directions, and three men were standing in front of
      the lectern, singing as loud as they could.

They prolonged the syllables of the sonorous Latin indefinitely, holding
      on to “Amens” with interminable “a-a''s,” which the
      reed stop of the organ sustained in a monotonous, long-drawn-out tone.

A child''s shrill voice took up the reply, and from time to time a priest
      sitting in a stall and wearing a biretta got up, muttered something and
      sat down again, while the three singers continued, their eyes fixed on the
      big book of plain chant lying open before them on the outstretched wings
      of a wooden eagle.

Then silence ensued and the service went on. Toward the close Rosa, with
      her head in both hands, suddenly thought of her mother, her village church
      and her first communion. She almost fancied that that day had returned,
      when she was so small and was almost hidden in her white dress, and she
      began to cry.

First of all she wept silently, and the tears dropped slowly from her
      eyes, but her emotion in creased with her recollections, and she began to
      sob. She took out her pocket handkerchief, wiped her eyes and held it to
      her mouth, so as not to scream, but it was in vain. A sort of rattle
      escaped her throat, and she was answered by two other profound,
      heartbreaking sobs, for her two neighbors, Louise and Flora, who were
      kneeling near her, overcome by similar recollections, were sobbing by her
      side, amid a flood of tears; and as tears are contagious, Madame Tellier
      soon in turn found that her eyes were wet, and on turning to her
      sister-in-law, she saw that all the occupants of her seat were also
      crying.

Soon, throughout the church, here and there, a wife, a mother, a sister,
      seized by the strange sympathy of poignant emotion, and affected at the
      sight of those handsome ladies on their knees, shaken with sobs was
      moistening her cambric pocket handkerchief and pressing her beating heart
      with her left hand.

Just as the sparks from an engine will set fire to dry grass, so the tears
      of Rosa and of her companions infected the whole congregation in a moment.
      Men, women, old men and lads in new smocks were soon all sobbing, and
      something superhuman seemed to be hovering over their heads—a
      spirit, the powerful breath of an invisible and all powerful Being.

Suddenly a species of madness seemed to pervade the church, the noise of a
      crowd in a state of frenzy, a tempest of sobs and stifled cries. It came
      like gusts of wind which blow the trees in a forest, and the priest,
      paralyzed by emotion, stammered out incoherent prayers, without finding
      words, ardent prayers of the soul soaring to heaven.

The people behind him gradually grew calmer. The cantors, in all the
      dignity of their white surplices, went on in somewhat uncertain voices,
      and the reed stop itself seemed hoarse, as if the instrument had been
      weeping; the priest, however, raised his hand to command silence and went
      and stood on the chancel steps, when everybody was silent at once.

After a few remarks on what had just taken place, and which he attributed
      to a miracle, he continued, turning to the seats where the carpenter''s
      guests were sitting; “I especially thank you, my dear sisters, who
      have come from such a distance, and whose presence among us, whose evident
      faith and ardent piety have set such a salutary example to all. You have
      edified my parish; your emotion has warmed all hearts; without you, this
      great day would not, perhaps, have had this really divine character. It is
      sufficient, at times, that there should be one chosen lamb, for the Lord
      to descend on His flock.”

They now left the church as quickly as possible; the children themselves
      were restless and tired with such a prolonged tension of the mind. The
      parents left the church by degrees to see about dinner.

There was a crowd outside, a noisy crowd, a babel of loud voices, where
      the shrill Norman accent was discernible. The villagers formed two ranks,
      and when the children appeared, each family took possession of their own.

The whole houseful of women caught hold of Constance, surrounded her and
      kissed her, and Rosa was especially demonstrative. At last she took hold
      of one hand, while Madame Tellier took the other, and Raphaele and
      Fernande held up her long muslin skirt, so that it might not drag in the
      dust; Louise and Flora brought up the rear with Madame Rivet; and the
      child, who was very silent and thoughtful, set off for home in the midst
      of this guard of honor.

Dinner was served in the workshop on long boards supported by trestles,
      and through the open door they could see all the enjoyment that was going
      on in the village. Everywhere they were feasting, and through every window
      were to be seen tables surrounded by people in their Sunday best, and a
      cheerful noise was heard in every house, while the men sat in their
      shirt-sleeves, drinking glass after glass of cider.

In the carpenter''s house the gaiety maintained somewhat of an air of
      reserve, the consequence of the emotion of the girls in the morning, and
      Rivet was the only one who was in a jolly mood, and he was drinking to
      excess. Madame Tellier looked at the clock every moment, for, in order not
      to lose two days running, they must take the 3:55 train, which would bring
      them to Fecamp by dark.

The carpenter tried very hard to distract her attention, so as to keep his
      guests until the next day, but he did not succeed, for she never joked
      when there was business on hand, and as soon as they had had their coffee
      she ordered her girls to make haste and get ready, and then, turning to
      her brother, she said:

“You must put in the horse immediately,” and she herself went
      to finish her last preparations.

When she came down again, her sister-in-law was waiting to speak to her
      about the child, and a long conversation took place, in which, however,
      nothing was settled. The carpenter''s wife was artful and pretended to be
      very much affected, and Madame Tellier, who was holding the girl on her
      knee, would not pledge herself to anything definite, but merely gave vague
      promises—she would not forget her, there was plenty of time, and
      besides, they would meet again.

But the conveyance did not come to the door and the women did not come
      downstairs. Upstairs they even heard loud laughter, romping, little
      screams, and much clapping of hands, and so, while the carpenter''s wife
      went to the stable to see whether the cart was ready, madame went
      upstairs.

Rivet, who was very drunk, was plaguing Rosa, who was half choking with
      laughter. Louise and Flora were holding him by the arms and trying to calm
      him, as they were shocked at his levity after that morning''s ceremony; but
      Raphaele and Fernande were urging him on, writhing and holding their sides
      with laughter, and they uttered shrill cries at every rebuff the drunken
      fellow received.

The man was furious, his face was red, and he was trying to shake off the
      two women who were clinging to him, while he was pulling Rosa''s skirt with
      all his might and stammering incoherently.

But Madame Tellier, who was very indignant, went up to her brother, seized
      him by the shoulders, and threw him out of the room with such violence
      that he fell against the wall in the passage, and a minute afterward they
      heard him pumping water on his head in the yard, and when he reappeared
      with the cart he was quite calm.

They started off in the same way as they had come the day before, and the
      little white horse started off with his quick, dancing trot. Under the hot
      sun, their fun, which had been checked during dinner, broke out again. The
      girls now were amused at the jolting of the cart, pushed their neighbors''
      chairs, and burst out laughing every moment.

There was a glare of light over the country, which dazzled their eyes, and
      the wheels raised two trails of dust along the highroad. Presently,
      Fernande, who was fond of music, asked Rosa to sing something, and she
      boldly struck up the “Gros Cure de Meudon,” but Madame Tellier
      made her stop immediately, as she thought it a very unsuitable song for
      such a day, and she added:

“Sing us something of Beranger''s.” And so, after a moment''s
      hesitation, Rosa began Beranger''s song “The Grandmother” in
      her worn-out voice, and all the girls, and even Madame Tellier herself,
      joined in the chorus:

“That is first rate,” Rivet declared, carried away by the
      rhythm, and they shouted the refrain to every verse, while Rivet beat time
      on the shaft with his foot, and with the reins on the back of the horse,
      who, as if he himself were carried away by the rhythm, broke into a wild
      gallop, and threw all the women in a heap, one on top of the other, on the
      bottom of the conveyance.

They got up, laughing as if they were mad, and the Gong went on, shouted
      at the top of their voices, beneath the burning sky, among the ripening
      grain, to the rapid gallop of the little horse, who set off every time the
      refrain was sung, and galloped a hundred yards, to their great delight,
      while occasionally a stone-breaker by the roadside sat up and looked at
      the load of shouting females through his wire spectacles.

“I am sorry you are going; we might have had some good times
      together.” But Madame Tellier replied very sensibly: “Everything
      has its right time, and we cannot always be enjoying ourselves.” And
      then he had a sudden inspiration:

“Look here, I will come and see you at Fecamp next month.” And
      he gave Rosa a roguish and knowing look.

“Come,” his sister replied, “you must be sensible; you
      may come if you like, but you are not to be up to any of your tricks.”

He did not reply, and as they heard the whistle of the train, he
      immediately began to kiss them all. When it came to Rosa''s turn, he tried
      to get to her mouth, which she, however, smiling with her lips closed,
      turned away from him each time by a rapid movement of her head to one
      side. He held her in his arms, but he could not attain his object, as his
      large whip, which he was holding in his hand and waving behind the girl''s
      back in desperation, interfered with his movements.

“Passengers for Rouen, take your seats!” a guard cried, and
      they got in. There was a slight whistle, followed by a loud whistle from
      the engine, which noisily puffed out its first jet of steam, while the
      wheels began to turn a little with a visible effort, and Rivet left the
      station and ran along by the track to get another look at Rosa, and as the
      carriage passed him, he began to crack his whip and to jump, while he sang
      at the top of his voice:

And then he watched a white pocket-handkerchief, which somebody was
      waving, as it disappeared in the distance.

They slept the peaceful sleep of a quiet conscience, until they got to
      Rouen, and when they returned to the house, refreshed and rested, Madame
      Tellier could not help saying:

They hurried over their supper, and then, when they had put on their usual
      evening costume, waited for their regular customers, and the little
      colored lamp outside the door told the passers-by that Madame Tellier had
      returned, and in a moment the news spread, nobody knew how or through
      whom.

Monsieur Philippe, the banker''s son, even carried his friendliness so far
      as to send a special messenger to Monsieur Tournevau, who was in the bosom
      of his family.

The fish curer had several cousins to dinner every Sunday, and they were
      having coffee, when a man came in with a letter in his hand. Monsieur
      Tournevau was much excited; he opened the envelope and grew pale; it
      contained only these words in pencil:

“The cargo of cod has been found; the ship has come into port; good
      business for you. Come immediately.”

He felt in his pockets, gave the messenger two sons, and suddenly blushing
      to his ears, he said: “I must go out.” He handed his wife the
      laconic and mysterious note, rang the bell, and when the servant came in,
      he asked her to bring him has hat and overcoat immediately. As soon as he
      was in the street, he began to hurry, and the way seemed to him to be
      twice as long as usual, in consequence of his impatience.

Madame Tellier''s establishment had put on quite a holiday look. On the
      ground floor, a number of sailors were making a deafening noise, and
      Louise and Flora drank with one and the other, and were being called for
      in every direction at once.

The upstairs room was full by nine o''clock. Monsieur Vasse, the Judge of
      the Tribunal of Commerce, Madame Tellier''s regular but Platonic wooer, was
      talking to her in a corner in a low voice, and they were both smiling, as
      if they were about to come to an understanding.

Monsieur Poulin, the ex-mayor, was talking to Rosa, and she was running
      her hands through the old gentleman''s white whiskers.

Tall Fernande was on the sofa, her feet on the coat of Monsieur Pinipesse,
      the tax collector, and leaning back against young Monsieur Philippe, her
      right arm around his neck, while she held a cigarette in her left hand.

Raphaele appeared to be talking seriously with Monsieur Dupuis, the
      insurance agent, and she finished by saying: “Yes, I will, yes.”

Just then, the door opened suddenly, and Monsieur Tournevau came in, and
      was greeted with enthusiastic cries of “Long live Tournevau!”
      And Raphaele, who was dancing alone up and down the room, went and threw
      herself into his arms. He seized her in a vigorous embrace and, without
      saying a word, lifted her up as if she had been a feather.

Rosa was chatting to the ex-mayor, kissing him and puffing; both his
      whiskers at the same time, in order to keep his head straight.

Fernanad and Madame Tellier remained with the four men, and Monsieur
      Philippe exclaimed: “I will pay for some champagne; get three
      bottles, Madame Tellier.” And Fernande gave him a hug, and whispered
      to him: “Play us a waltz, will you?” So he rose and sat down
      at the old piano in the corner, and managed to get a hoarse waltz out of
      the depths of the instrument.

The tall girl put her arms round the tax collector, Madame Tellier let
      Monsieur Vasse take her round the waist, and the two couples turned round,
      kissing as they danced. Monsieur Vasse, who had formerly danced in good
      society, waltzed with such elegance that Madame Tellier was quite
      captivated.

Frederic brought the champagne; the first cork popped, and Monsieur
      Philippe played the introduction to a quadrille, through which the four
      dancers walked in society fashion, decorously, with propriety, deportment,
      bows and curtsies, and then they began to drink.

Monsieur Philippe next struck up a lively polka, and Monsieur Tournevau
      started off with the handsome Jewess, whom he held without letting her
      feet touch the ground. Monsieur Pinipesse and Monsieur Vasse had started
      off with renewed vigor, and from time to time one or other couple would
      stop to toss off a long draught of sparkling wine, and that dance was
      threatening to become never-ending, when Rosa opened the door.

“I want to dance,” she exclaimed. And she caught hold of
      Monsieur Dupuis, who was sitting idle on the couch, and the dance began
      again.

But the bottles were empty. “I will pay for one,” Monsieur
      Tournevau said. “So will I,” Monsieur Vasse declared. “And.
      I will do the same,” Monsieur Dupuis remarked.

They all began to clap their hands, and it soon became a regular ball, and
      from time to time Louise and Flora ran upstairs quickly and had a few
      turns, while their customers downstairs grew impatient, and then they
      returned regretfully to the tap-room. At midnight they were still dancing.

Madame Tellier let them amuse themselves while she had long private talks
      in corners with Monsieur Vasse, as if to settle the last details of
      something that had already been settled.

At last, at one o''clock, the two married men, Monsieur Tournevau and
      Monsieur Pinipesse, declared that they were going home, and wanted to pay.
      Nothing was charged for except the champagne, and that cost only six
      francs a bottle, instead of ten, which was the usual price, and when they
      expressed their surprise at such generosity, Madame Tellier, who was
      beaming, said to them:

For twenty years Denis has been a servant in this house. He was a short,
      stout, jovial man, who was known throughout the countryside as a model
      servant. He asked:

M. Marambot was not rich. He was an old village druggist, a bachelor, who
      lived on an income acquired with difficulty by selling drugs to the
      farmers. He answered:

“Yes, my boy. Old man Malois is afraid of the law-suit with which I
      am threatening him. I shall get my money to-morrow. Five thousand francs
      are not liable to harm the account of an old bachelor.”

M. Marambot rubbed his hands with satisfaction. He was a man of quiet
      temperament, more sad than gay, incapable of any prolonged effort,
      careless in business.

He could undoubtedly have amassed a greater income had he taken advantage
      of the deaths of colleagues established in more important centers, by
      taking their places and carrying on their business. But the trouble of
      moving and the thought of all the preparations had always stopped him.
      After thinking the matter over for a few days, he would be satisfied to
      say:

“Bah! I''ll wait until the next time. I''ll not lose anything by the
      delay. I may even find something better.”

Denis, on the contrary, was always urging his master to new enterprises.
      Of an energetic temperament, he would continually repeat:

“Oh! If I had only had the capital to start out with, I could have
      made a fortune! One thousand francs would do me.”

M. Marambot would smile without answering and would go out in his little
      garden, where, his hands behind his back, he would walk about dreaming.

All day long, Denis sang the joyful refrains of the folk-songs of the
      district. He even showed an unusual activity, for he cleaned all the
      windows of the house, energetically rubbing the glass, and singing at the
      top of his voice.

The following day, at about nine o''clock in the morning, the postman gave
      Denis four letters for his master, one of them very heavy. M. Marambot
      immediately shut himself up in his room until late in the afternoon. He
      then handed his servant four letters for the mail. One of them was
      addressed to M. Malois; it was undoubtedly a receipt for the money.

Denis asked his master no questions; he appeared to be as sad and gloomy
      that day as he had seemed joyful the day before.

He was awakened by a strange noise. He sat up in his bed and listened.
      Suddenly the door opened, and Denis appeared, holding in one hand a candle
      and in the other a carving knife, his eyes staring, his face contracted as
      though moved by some deep emotion; he was as pale as a ghost.

M. Marambot, astonished, thought that he was sleep-walking, and he was
      going to get out of bed and assist him when the servant blew out the light
      and rushed for the bed. His master stretched out his hands to receive the
      shock which knocked him over on his back; he was trying to seize the hands
      of his servant, whom he now thought to be crazy, in order to avoid the
      blows which the latter was aiming at him.

He was struck by the knife; once in the shoulder, once in the forehead and
      the third time in the chest. He fought wildly, waving his arms around in
      the darkness, kicking and crying:

But the latter, gasping for breath, kept up his furious attack always
      striking, always repulsed, sometimes with a kick, sometimes with a punch,
      and rushing forward again furiously.

M. Marambot was wounded twice more, once in the leg and once in the
      stomach. But, suddenly, a thought flashed across his mind, and he began to
      shriek:

“I have received nothing. M. Malois takes back what he said, the
      law-suit will take place; that is why you carried the letters to the mail.
      Just read those on my desk.”

He was covered with blood. His sheets, his curtains, and even the walls,
      were spattered with red. Denis, standing in the middle of the room, was
      also bloody from head to foot.

At break of day he revived. It was some time, however, before he regained
      his senses, and was able to understand or remember. But, suddenly, the
      memory of the attack and of his wounds returned to him, and he was filled
      with such terror that he closed his eyes in order not to see anything.
      After a few minutes he grew calmer and began to think. He had not died
      immediately, therefore he might still recover. He felt weak, very weak;
      but he had no real pain, although he noticed an uncomfortable smarting
      sensation in several parts of his body. He also felt icy cold, and all
      wet, and as though wrapped up in bandages. He thought that this dampness
      came from the blood which he had lost; and he shivered at the dreadful
      thought of this red liquid which had come from his veins and covered his
      bed. The idea of seeing this terrible spectacle again so upset him that he
      kept his eyes closed with all his strength, as though they might open in
      spite of himself.

But what could he, Marambot, do now? Get up? Call for help? But if he
      should make the slightest motions, his wounds would undoubtedly open up
      again and he would die from loss of blood.

Suddenly he heard the door of his room open. His heart almost stopped. It
      was certainly Denis who was coming to finish him up. He held his breath in
      order to make the murderer think that he had been successful.

He felt his sheet being lifted up, and then someone feeling his stomach. A
      sharp pain near his hip made him start. He was being very gently washed
      with cold water. Therefore, someone must have discovered the misdeed and
      he was being cared for. A wild joy seized him; but prudently, he did not
      wish to show that he was conscious. He opened one eye, just one, with the
      greatest precaution.

He recognized Denis standing beside him, Denis himself! Mercy! He hastily
      closed his eye again.

Denis! What could he be doing? What did he want? What awful scheme could
      he now be carrying out?

What was he doing? Well, he was washing him in order to hide the traces of
      his crime! And he would now bury him in the garden, under ten feet of
      earth, so that no one could discover him! Or perhaps under the wine
      cellar! And M. Marambot began to tremble like a leaf. He kept saying to
      himself: “I am lost, lost!” He closed his eyes so as not to
      see the knife as it descended for the final stroke. It did not come. Denis
      was now lifting him up and bandaging him. Then he began carefully to dress
      the wound on his leg, as his master had taught him to do.

There was no longer any doubt. His servant, after wishing to kill him, was
      trying to save him.

M. Marambot opened both his eyes. There was no sign of blood either on the
      bed, on the walls, or on the murderer. The wounded man was stretched out
      on clean white sheets.

“I am trying to make up for it, monsieur. If you will not tell on
      me, I will serve you as faithfully as in the past.”

Denis saved his master. He spent days and nights without sleep, never
      leaving the sick room, preparing drugs, broths, potions, feeling his
      pulse, anxiously counting the beats, attending him with the skill of a
      trained nurse and the devotion of a son.

And when the sick man would wake up at night, he would often see his
      servant seated in an armchair, weeping silently.

Never had the old druggist been so cared for, so fondled, so spoiled. At
      first he had said to himself:

He was now convalescing, and from day to day he would put off dismissing
      his murderer. He thought that no one would ever show him such care and
      attention, for he held this man through fear; and he warned him that he
      had left a document with a lawyer denouncing him to the law if any new
      accident should occur.

This precaution seemed to guarantee him against any future attack; and he
      then asked himself if it would not be wiser to keep this man near him, in
      order to watch him closely.

Just as formerly, when he would hesitate about taking some larger place of
      business, he could not make up his mind to any decision.

One morning, just as he was finishing breakfast, he suddenly heard a great
      noise in the kitchen. He hastened in there. Denis was struggling with two
      gendarmes. An officer was taking notes on his pad.

“You told on me, monsieur, that''s not right, after what you had
      promised me. You have broken your word of honor, Monsieur Marambot; that
      is not right, that''s not right!”

“I swear to you before the Lord, my boy that I did not tell on you.
      I haven''t the slightest idea how the police could have found out about
      your attack on me.”

“Yes—but I did not tell on him—I haven''t said a word—I
      swear it—he has served me excellently from that time on—”

“I will take down your testimony. The law will take notice of this
      new action, of which it was ignorant, Monsieur Marambot. I was
      commissioned to arrest your servant for the theft of two ducks
      surreptitiously taken by him from M. Duhamel of which act there are
      witnesses. I shall make a note of your information.”

The lawyer used a plea of insanity, contrasting the two misdeeds in order
      to strengthen his argument. He had clearly proved that the theft of the
      two ducks came from the same mental condition as the eight knife-wounds in
      the body of Maramlot. He had cunningly analyzed all the phases of this
      transitory condition of mental aberration, which could, doubtless, be
      cured by a few months'' treatment in a reputable sanatorium. He had spoken
      in enthusiastic terms of the continued devotion of this faithful servant,
      of the care with which he had surrounded his master, wounded by him in a
      moment of alienation.

The lawyer noticed it, opened his arms with a broad gesture, spreading out
      the long black sleeves of his robe like the wings of a bat, and exclaimed:

“Look, look, gentleman of the jury, look at those tears. What more
      can I say for my client? What speech, what argument, what reasoning would
      be worth these tears of his master? They, speak louder than I do, louder
      than the law; they cry: ''Mercy, for the poor wandering mind of a while
      ago! They implore, they pardon, they bless!”

Then the judge, turning to Marambot, whose testimony had been excellent
      for his servant, asked him:

“But, monsieur, even admitting that you consider this man insane,
      that does not explain why you should have kept him. He was none the less
      dangerous.”

“Well, your honor, what can you expect? Nowadays it''s so hard to
      find good servants—I could never have found a better one.”

It had been a stag dinner. These men still came together once in a while
      without their wives as they had done when they were bachelors. They would
      eat for a long time, drink for a long time; they would talk of everything,
      stir up those old and joyful memories which bring a smile to the lip and a
      tremor to the heart. One of them was saying: “Georges, do you
      remember our excursion to Saint-Germain with those two little girls from
      Montmartre?”

And a little detail here or there would be remembered, and all these
      things brought joy to the hearts.

The conversation turned on marriage, and each one said with a sincere air:
      “Oh, if it were to do over again!” Georges Duportin added:
      “It''s strange how easily one falls into it. You have fully decided
      never to marry; and then, in the springtime, you go to the country; the
      weather is warm; the summer is beautiful; the fields are full of flowers;
      you meet a young girl at some friend''s house—crash! all is over. You
      return married!”

Pierre Letoile exclaimed: “Correct! that is exactly my case, only
      there were some peculiar incidents—”

His friend interrupted him: “As for you, you have no cause to
      complain. You have the most charming wife in the world, pretty, amiable,
      perfect! You are undoubtedly the happiest one of us all.”

“Yes—this is the adventure. I was thirty-five, and I had no
      more idea of marrying than I had of hanging myself. Young girls seemed to
      me to be inane, and I loved pleasure.

“During the month of May I was invited to the wedding of my cousin,
      Simon d''Erabel, in Normandy. It was a regular Normandy wedding. We sat
      down at the table at five o''clock in the evening and at eleven o''clock we
      were still eating. I had been paired off, for the occasion, with a
      Mademoiselle Dumoulin, daughter of a retired colonel, a young, blond,
      soldierly person, well formed, frank and talkative. She took complete
      possession of me for the whole day, dragged me into the park, made me
      dance willy-nilly, bored me to death. I said to myself: ''That''s all very
      well for to-day, but tomorrow I''ll get out. That''s all there is to it!''

“Toward eleven o''clock at night the women retired to their rooms;
      the men stayed, smoking while they drank or drinking while they smoked,
      whichever you will.

“Through the open window we could see the country folks dancing.
      Farmers and peasant girls were jumping about in a circle yelling at the
      top of their lungs a dance air which was feebly accompanied by two violins
      and a clarinet. The wild song of the peasants often completely drowned the
      sound of the instruments, and the weak music, interrupted by the
      unrestrained voices, seemed to come to us in little fragments of scattered
      notes. Two enormous casks, surrounded by flaming torches, contained drinks
      for the crowd. Two men were kept busy rinsing the glasses or bowls in a
      bucket and immediately holding them under the spigots, from which flowed
      the red stream of wine or the golden stream of pure cider; and the parched
      dancers, the old ones quietly, the girls panting, came up, stretched out
      their arms and grasped some receptacle, threw back their heads and poured
      down their throats the drink which they preferred. On a table were bread,
      butter, cheese and sausages. Each one would step up from time to time and
      swallow a mouthful, and under the starlit sky this healthy and violent
      exercise was a pleasing sight, and made one also feel like drinking from
      these enormous casks and eating the crisp bread and butter with a raw
      onion.

“A mad desire seized me to take part in this merrymaking, and I left
      my companions. I must admit that I was probably a little tipsy, but I was
      soon entirely so.

“I grabbed the hand of a big, panting peasant woman and I jumped her
      about until I was out of breath.

“Then I drank some wine and reached for another girl. In order to
      refresh myself afterward, I swallowed a bowlful of cider, and I began to
      bounce around as if possessed.

“I was very light on my feet. The boys, delighted, were watching me
      and trying to imitate me; the girls all wished to dance with me, and
      jumped about heavily with the grace of cows.

“After each dance I drank a glass of wine or a glass of cider, and
      toward two o''clock in the morning I was so drunk that I could hardly stand
      up.

“I realized my condition and tried to reach my room. Everybody was
      asleep and the house was silent and dark.

“I had no matches and everybody was in bed. As soon as I reached the
      vestibule I began to, feel dizzy. I had a lot of trouble to find the
      banister. At last, by accident, my hand came in contact with it, and I sat
      down on the first step of the stairs in order to try to gather my
      scattered wits.

“My room was on the second floor; it was the third door to the left.
      Fortunately I had not forgotten that. Armed with this knowledge, I arose,
      not without difficulty, and I began to ascend, step by step. In my hands I
      firmly gripped the iron railing in order not to fall, and took great pains
      to make no noise.

“Only three or four times did my foot miss the steps, and I went
      down on my knees; but thanks to the energy of my arms and the strength of
      my will, I avoided falling completely.

“At last I reached the second floor and I set out in my journey
      along the hall, feeling my way by the walls. I felt one door; I counted:
      ''One''; but a sudden dizziness made me lose my hold on the wall, make a
      strange turn and fall up against the other wall. I wished to turn in a
      straight line: The crossing was long and full of hardships. At last I
      reached the shore, and, prudently, I began to travel along again until I
      met another door. In order to be sure to make no mistake, I again counted
      out loud: ''Two.'' I started out on my walk again. At last I found the third
      door. I said: ''Three, that''s my room,'' and I turned the knob. The door
      opened. Notwithstanding my befuddled state, I thought: ''Since the door
      opens, this must be home.'' After softly closing the door, I stepped out in
      the darkness. I bumped against something soft: my easy-chair. I
      immediately stretched myself out on it.

“In my condition it would not have been wise to look for my bureau,
      my candles, my matches. It would have taken me at least two hours. It
      would probably have taken me that long also to undress; and even then I
      might not have succeeded. I gave it up.

“I only took my shoes off; I unbuttoned my waistcoat, which was
      choking me, I loosened my trousers and went to sleep.

“This undoubtedly lasted for a long time. I was suddenly awakened by
      a deep voice which was saying: ''What, you lazy girl, still in bed? It''s
      ten o''clock!''

“In bewilderment I wondered what this dialogue meant. Where was I?
      What had I done? My mind was wandering, still surrounded by a heavy fog.
      The first voice continued: ''I''m going to raise your curtains.''

“I heard steps approaching me. Completely at a loss what to do, I
      sat up. Then a hand was placed on my head. I started. The voice asked:
      ''Who is there?'' I took good care not to answer. A furious grasp seized me.
      I in turn seized him, and a terrific struggle ensued. We were rolling
      around, knocking over the furniture and crashing against the walls. A
      woman''s voice was shrieking: ''Help! help!''

“Servants, neighbors, frightened women crowded around us. The blinds
      were open and the shades drawn. I was struggling with Colonel Dumoulin.

“When we were separated, I escaped to my room, dumbfounded. I locked
      myself in and sat down with my feet on a chair, for my shoes had been left
      in the young girl''s room.

“I heard a great noise through the whole house, doors being opened
      and closed, whisperings and rapid steps.

“After half an hour some one knocked on my door. I cried: ''Who is
      there?'' It was my uncle, the bridegroom''s father. I opened the door:

“He was pale and furious, and he treated me harshly: ''You have
      behaved like a scoundrel in my house, do you hear?'' Then he added more
      gently ''But, you young fool, why the devil did you let yourself get caught
      at ten o''clock in the morning? You go to sleep like a log in that room,
      instead of leaving immediately—immediately after.''

“I exclaimed: ''But, uncle, I assure you that nothing occurred. I was
      drunk and got into the wrong room.''

“He shrugged his shoulders! ''Don''t talk nonsense.'' I raised my hand,
      exclaiming: ''I swear to you on my honor.'' My uncle continued: ''Yes, that''s
      all right. It''s your duty to say that.''

“I in turn grew angry and told him the whole unfortunate occurrence.
      He looked at me with a bewildered expression, not knowing what to believe.
      Then he went out to confer with the colonel.

“I heard that a kind of jury of the mothers had been formed, to
      which were submitted the different phases of the situation.

“He came back an hour later, sat down with the dignity of a judge
      and began: ''No matter what may be the situation, I can see only one way
      out of it for you; it is to marry Mademoiselle Dumoulin.''

“My uncle continued: ''Please do not jest. The colonel has decided to
      blow your brains out as soon as he sees you. And you may be sure that he
      does not threaten idly. I spoke of a duel and he answered: “No, I
      tell you that I will blow his brains out.”''

“''Let us now examine the question from another point of view. Either
      you have misbehaved yourself—and then so much the worse for you, my
      boy; one should not go near a young girl—or else, being drunk, as
      you say, you made a mistake in the room. In this case, it''s even worse for
      you. You shouldn''t get yourself into such foolish situations. Whatever you
      may say, the poor girl''s reputation is lost, for a drunkard''s excuses are
      never believed. The only real victim in the matter is the girl. Think it
      over.''

“I stayed alone for another hour. Then my aunt came. She was crying.
      She used every argument. No one believed my story. They could not imagine
      that this young girl could have forgotten to lock her door in a house full
      of company. The colonel had struck her. She had been crying the whole
      morning. It was a terrible and unforgettable scandal. And my good aunt
      added: ''Ask for her hand, anyhow. We may, perhaps, find some way out of it
      when we are drawing up the papers.''

“This prospect relieved me. And I agreed to write my proposal. An
      hour later I left for Paris. The following day I was informed that I had
      been accepted.

“Then, in three weeks, before I had been able to find any excuse,
      the banns were published, the announcement sent out, the contract signed,
      and one Monday morning I found myself in a church, beside a weeping young
      girl, after telling the magistrate that I consented to take her as my
      companion—for better, for worse.

“I had not seen her since my adventure, and I glanced at her out of
      the corner of my eye with a certain malevolent surprise. However, she was
      not ugly—far from it. I said to myself: ''There is some one who won''t
      laugh every day.''

“Toward the middle of the night I entered the bridal chamber with
      the full intention of letting her know my resolutions, for I was now
      master. I found her sitting in an armchair, fully dressed, pale and with
      red eyes. As soon as I entered she rose and came slowly toward me saying:
      ''Monsieur, I am ready to do whatever you may command. I will kill myself
      if you so desire''

“The colonel''s daughter was as pretty as she could be in this heroic
      role. I kissed her; it was my privilege.

“I soon saw that I had not got a bad bargain. I have now been
      married five years. I do not regret it in the least.”

Pierre Letoile was silent. His companions were laughing. One of them said:
      “Marriage is indeed a lottery; you must never choose your numbers.
      The haphazard ones are the best.”

Another added by way of conclusion: “Yes, but do not forget that the
      god of drunkards chose for Pierre.”

We were speaking of adventures, and each one of us was relating his story
      of delightful experiences, surprising meetings, on the train, in a hotel,
      at the seashore. According to Roger des Annettes, the seashore was
      particularly favorable to the little blind god.

“I guess Paris is about the best place for that,” he said.
      “Woman is like a precious trinket, we appreciate her all the more
      when we meet her in the most unexpected places; but the rarest ones are
      only to be found in Paris.”

“By Jove, it''s great! Walk along the streets on some spring morning.
      The little women, daintily tripping along, seem to blossom out like
      flowers. What a delightful, charming sight! The dainty perfume of violet
      is everywhere. The city is gay, and everybody notices the women. By Jove,
      how tempting they are in their light, thin dresses, which occasionally
      give one a glimpse of the delicate pink flesh beneath!

“One saunters along, head up, mind alert, and eyes open. I tell you
      it''s great! You see her in the distance, while still a block away; you
      already know that she is going to please you at closer quarters. You can
      recognize her by the flower on her hat, the toss of her head, or her gait.
      She approaches, and you say to yourself: ''Look out, here she is!'' You come
      closer to her and you devour her with your eyes.

“Is it a young girl running errands for some store, a young woman
      returning from church, or hastening to see her lover? What do you care?
      Her well-rounded bosom shows through the thin waist. Oh, if you could only
      take her in your arms and fondle and kiss her! Her glance may be timid or
      bold, her hair light or dark. What difference does it make? She brushes
      against you, and a cold shiver runs down your spine. Ah, how you wish for
      her all day! How many of these dear creatures have I met this way, and how
      wildly in love I would have been had I known them more intimately.

“Have you ever noticed that the ones we would love the most
      distractedly are those whom we never meet to know? Curious, isn''t it? From
      time to time we barely catch a glimpse of some woman, the mere sight of
      whom thrills our senses. But it goes no further. When I think of all the
      adorable creatures that I have elbowed in the streets of Paris, I fairly
      rave. Who are they! Where are they? Where can I find them again? There is
      a proverb which says that happiness often passes our way; I am sure that I
      have often passed alongside the one who could have caught me like a linnet
      in the snare of her fresh beauty.”

Roger des Annettes had listened smilingly. He answered: “I know that
      as well as you do. This is what happened to me: About five years ago, for
      the first time I met, on the Pont de la Concorde, a young woman who made a
      wonderful impression on me. She was dark, rather stout, with glossy hair,
      and eyebrows which nearly met above two dark eyes. On her lip was a
      scarcely perceptible down, which made one dream-dream as one dreams of
      beloved woods, on seeing a bunch of wild violets. She had a small waist
      and a well-developed bust, which seemed to present a challenge, offer a
      temptation. Her eyes were like two black spots on white enamel. Her glance
      was strange, vacant, unthinking, and yet wonderfully beautiful.

“I imagined that she might be a Jewess. I followed her, and then
      turned round to look at her, as did many others. She walked with a
      swinging gait that was not graceful, but somehow attracted one. At the
      Place de la Concorde she took a carriage, and I stood there like a fool,
      moved by the strongest desire that had ever assailed me.

“Six months later I descried her in the Rue de la Paix again. On
      seeing her I felt the same shock that one experiences on seeing a once
      dearly loved woman. I stopped that I might better observe her. When she
      passed close enough to touch me I felt as though I were standing before a
      red hot furnace. Then, when she had passed by, I noticed a delicious
      sensation, as of a cooling breeze blowing over my face. I did not follow
      her. I was afraid of doing something foolish. I was afraid of myself.

“It was a year before I saw her again. But just as the sun was going
      down on one beautiful evening in May I recognized her walking along the
      Avenue des Champs-Elysees. The Arc de Triomphe stood out in bold relief
      against the fiery glow of the sky. A golden haze filled the air; it was
      one of those delightful spring evenings which are the glory of Paris.

“I followed her, tormented by a desire to address her, to kneel
      before her, to pour forth the emotion which was choking me. Twice I passed
      by her only to fall back, and each time as I passed by I felt this
      sensation, as of scorching heat, which I had noticed in the Rue de la
      Paix.

“She glanced at me, and then I saw her enter a house on the Rue de
      Presbourg. I waited for her two hours and she did not come out. Then I
      decided to question the janitor. He seemed not to understand me. ''She must
      be visiting some one,'' he said.

“The next time I was eight months without seeing her. But one
      freezing morning in January, I was walking along the Boulevard Malesherbes
      at a dog trot, so as to keep warm, when at the corner I bumped into a
      woman and knocked a small package out of her hand. I tried to apologize.
      It was she!

“At first I stood stock still from the shock; then having returned
      to her the package which she had dropped, I said abruptly:

“''I am both grieved and delighted, madame, to have jostled you. For
      more than two years I have known you, admired you, and had the most ardent
      wish to be presented to you; nevertheless I have been unable to find out
      who you are, or where you live. Please excuse these foolish words.
      Attribute them to a passionate desire to be numbered among your
      acquaintances. Such sentiments can surely offend you in no way! You do not
      know me. My name is Baron Roger des Annettes. Make inquiries about me, and
      you will find that I am a gentleman. Now, if you refuse my request, you
      will throw me into abject misery. Please be good to me and tell me how I
      can see you.''

“I was so dumfounded that I must have shown my surprise. But I
      quickly gathered my wits together and gave her a visiting card, which she
      slipped into her pocket with a quick, deft movement.

“She went on, after having stared at me, judged, weighed and
      analyzed me with this heavy and vacant gaze which seemed to leave a
      quieting and deadening impression on the person towards whom it was
      directed.

“Until Sunday my mind was occupied day and night trying to guess who
      she might be and planning my course of conduct towards her. I finally
      decided to buy her a jewel, a beautiful little jewel, which I placed in
      its box on the mantelpiece, and left it there awaiting her arrival.

“At ten o''clock she came, calm and quiet, and with her hand
      outstretched, as though she had known me for years. Drawing up a chair, I
      took her hat and coat and furs, and laid them aside. And then, timidly, I
      took her hand in mine; after that all went on without a hitch.

“Ah, my friends! what a bliss it is, to stand at a discreet distance
      and watch the hidden pink and blue ribbons, partly concealed, to observe
      the hazy lines of the beloved one''s form, as they become visible through
      the last of the filmy garments! What a delight it is to watch the
      ostrich-like modesty of those who are in reality none too modest. And what
      is so pretty as their motions!

“Her back was turned towards me, and suddenly, my eyes were
      irresistibly drawn to a large black spot right between her shoulders. What
      could it be? Were my eyes deceiving me? But no, there it was, staring me
      in the face! Then my mind reverted to the faint down on her lip, the heavy
      eyebrows almost meeting over her coal-black eyes, her glossy black hair
      —I should have been prepared for some surprise.

“Nevertheless I was dumfounded, and my mind was haunted by dim
      visions of strange adventures. I seemed to see before me one of the evil
      genii of the Thousand and One Nights, one of these dangerous and crafty
      creatures whose mission it is to drag men down to unknown depths. I
      thought of Solomon, who made the Queen of Sheba walk on a mirror that he
      might be sure that her feet were not cloven.

“And when the time came for me to sing of love to her, my voice
      forsook me. At first she showed surprise, which soon turned to anger; and
      she said, quickly putting on her wraps:

“I wanted her to accept the ring which I had bought for her, but she
      replied haughtily: ''For whom do you take me, sir?'' I blushed to the roots
      of my hair. She left without saying another word.

“There is my whole adventure. But the worst part of it is that I am
      now madly in love with her. I can''t see a woman without thinking of her.
      All the others disgust me, unless they remind me of her. I cannot kiss a
      woman without seeing her face before me, and without suffering the torture
      of unsatisfied desire. She is always with me, always there, dressed or
      nude, my true love. She is there, beside the other one, visible but
      intangible. I am almost willing to believe that she was bewitched, and
      carried a talisman between her shoulders.

“Who is she? I don''t know yet. I have met her once or twice since. I
      bowed, but she pretended not to recognize me. Who is she? An Oriental?
      Yes, doubtless an oriental Jewess! I believe that she must be a Jewess!
      But why? Why? I don''t know!”

The subject of sequestration of the person came up in speaking of a recent
      lawsuit, and each of us had a story to tell—a true story, he said.
      We had been spending the evening together at an old family mansion in the
      Rue de Grenelle, just a party of intimate friends. The old Marquis de la
      Tour-Samuel, who was eighty-two, rose, and, leaning his elbow on the
      mantelpiece, said in his somewhat shaky voice:

“I also know of something strange, so strange that it has haunted me
      all my life. It is now fifty-six years since the incident occurred, and
      yet not a month passes that I do not see it again in a dream, so great is
      the impression of fear it has left on my mind. For ten minutes I
      experienced such horrible fright that ever since then a sort of constant
      terror has remained with me. Sudden noises startle me violently, and
      objects imperfectly distinguished at night inspire me with a mad desire to
      flee from them. In short, I am afraid of the dark!

“But I would not have acknowledged that before I reached my present
      age. Now I can say anything. I have never receded before real danger,
      ladies. It is, therefore, permissible, at eighty-two years of age, not to
      be brave in presence of imaginary danger.

“That affair so completely upset me, caused me such deep and
      mysterious and terrible distress, that I never spoke of it to any one. I
      will now tell it to you exactly as it happened, without any attempt at
      explanation.

“In July, 1827, I was stationed at Rouen. One day as I was walking
      along the quay I met a man whom I thought I recognized without being able
      to recall exactly who he was. Instinctively I made a movement to stop. The
      stranger perceived it and at once extended his hand.

“He was a friend to whom I had been deeply attached as a youth. For
      five years I had not seen him; he seemed to have aged half a century. His
      hair was quite white and he walked bent over as though completely
      exhausted. He apparently understood my surprise, and he told me of the
      misfortune which had shattered his life.

“Having fallen madly in love with a young girl, he had married her,
      but after a year of more than earthly happiness she died suddenly of an
      affection of the heart. He left his country home on the very day of her
      burial and came to his town house in Rouen, where he lived, alone and
      unhappy, so sad and wretched that he thought constantly of suicide.

“''Since I have found you again in this manner,'' he said, ''I will ask
      you to render me an important service. It is to go and get me out of the
      desk in my bedroom—our bedroom—some papers of which I have
      urgent need. I cannot send a servant or a business clerk, as discretion
      and absolute silence are necessary. As for myself, nothing on earth would
      induce me to reenter that house. I will give you the key of the room,
      which I myself locked on leaving, and the key of my desk, also a few words
      for my gardener, telling him to open the chateau for you. But come and
      breakfast with me tomorrow and we will arrange all that.''

“I promised to do him the slight favor he asked. It was, for that
      matter, only a ride which I could make in an hour on horseback, his
      property being but a few miles distant from Rouen.

“At ten o''clock the following day I breakfasted, tete-a-tete, with
      my friend, but he scarcely spoke.

“He begged me to pardon him; the thought of the visit I was about to
      make to that room, the scene of his dead happiness, overcame him, he said.
      He, indeed, seemed singularly agitated and preoccupied, as though
      undergoing some mysterious mental struggle.

“At length he explained to me exactly what I had to do. It was very
      simple. I must take two packages of letters and a roll of papers from the
      first right-hand drawer of the desk, of which I had the key. He added:

“''The weather was glorious, and I trotted across the fields,
      listening to the song of the larks and the rhythmical clang of my sword
      against my boot. Then I entered the forest and walked my horse. Branches
      of trees caressed my face as I passed, and now and then I caught a leaf
      with my teeth and chewed it, from sheer gladness of heart at being alive
      and vigorous on such a radiant day.

“As I approached the chateau I took from my pocket the letter I had
      for the gardener, and was astonished at finding it sealed. I was so
      irritated that I was about to turn back without having fulfilled my
      promise, but reflected that I should thereby display undue susceptibility.
      My friend in his troubled condition might easily have fastened the
      envelope without noticing that he did so.

“The manor looked as if it had been abandoned for twenty years. The
      open gate was falling from its hinges, the walks were overgrown with grass
      and the flower beds were no longer distinguishable.

“The noise I made by kicking at a shutter brought out an old man
      from a side door. He seemed stunned with astonishment at seeing me. On
      receiving my letter, he read it, reread it, turned it over and over,
      looked me up and down, put the paper in his pocket and finally said:

“''You ought to know, since you have just read your master''s orders.
      I wish to enter the chateau.''

“''No—sir—but—but it has not been opened since—since
      the-death. If you will be kind enough to wait five minutes I will go and—and
      see if—''

“I first went through the kitchen, then two rooms occupied by this
      man and his wife. I then crossed a large hall, mounted a staircase and
      recognized the door described by my friend.

“I easily opened it, and entered the apartment. It was so dark that
      at first I could distinguish nothing. I stopped short, disagreeably
      affected by that disagreeable, musty odor of closed, unoccupied rooms. As
      my eyes slowly became accustomed to the darkness I saw plainly enough a
      large and disordered bedroom, the bed without sheets but still retaining
      its mattresses and pillows, on one of which was a deep impression, as
      though an elbow or a head had recently rested there.

“The chairs all seemed out of place. I noticed that a door,
      doubtless that of a closet, had remained half open.

“I first went to the window, which I opened to let in the light, but
      the fastenings of the shutters had grown so rusty that I could not move
      them. I even tried to break them with my sword, but without success. As I
      was growing irritated over my useless efforts and could now see fairly
      well in the semi-darkness, I gave up the hope of getting more light, and
      went over to the writing desk.

“I seated myself in an armchair and, letting down the lid of the
      desk, I opened the drawer designated. It was full to the top. I needed but
      three packages, which I knew how to recognize, and began searching for
      them.

“I was straining my eyes in the effort to read the superscriptions
      when I seemed to hear, or, rather, feel, something rustle back of me. I
      paid no attention, believing that a draught from the window was moving
      some drapery. But in a minute or so another movement, almost
      imperceptible, sent a strangely disagreeable little shiver over my skin.
      It was so stupid to be affected, even slightly, that self-respect
      prevented my turning around. I had just found the second package I needed
      and was about to lay my hand on the third when a long and painful sigh,
      uttered just at my shoulder, made me bound like a madman from my seat and
      land several feet off. As I jumped I had turned round my hand on the hilt
      of my sword, ' WHERE id = '6b5a5bab-cb6d-4c60-9071-cb95b01bf8ca';
