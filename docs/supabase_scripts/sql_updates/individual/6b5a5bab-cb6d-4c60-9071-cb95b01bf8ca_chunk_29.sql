      open this surprising arrangement, from the shoulder to the temple, he
      opened this armor and found the face of an old man, worn out, thin and
      wrinkled. The surprise among those who had brought in this seemingly young
      dancer was so great that no one laughed, no one said a word.

All were watching this sad face as he lay on the straw chairs, his eyes
      closed, his face covered with white hair, some long, falling from the
      forehead over the face, others short, growing around the face and the
      chin, and beside this poor head, that pretty little, neat varnished,
      smiling mask.

The man regained consciousness after being inanimate for a long time, but
      he still seemed to be so weak and sick that the physician feared some
      dangerous complication. He asked: “Where do you live?”

The old dancer seemed to be making an effort to remember, and then he
      mentioned the name of the street, which no one knew. He was asked for more
      definite information about the neighborhood. He answered with a great
      slowness, indecision and difficulty, which revealed his upset state of
      mind. The physician continued:

Curiosity had overcome him to find out who this strange dancer, this
      phenomenal jumper might be. Soon the two rolled away in a cab to the other
      side of Montmartre.

They stopped before a high building of poor appearance. They went up a
      winding staircase. The doctor held to the banister, which was so grimy
      that the hand stuck to it, and he supported the dizzy old man, whose
      forces were beginning to return. They stopped at the fourth floor.

The door at which they had knocked was opened by an old woman, neat
      looking, with a white nightcap enclosing a thin face with sharp features,
      one of those good, rough faces of a hard-working and faithful woman. She
      cried out:

He told her the whole affair in a few words. She became reassured and even
      calmed the physician himself by telling him that the same thing had
      happened many times. She said: “He must be put to bed, monsieur,
      that is all. Let him sleep and tomorrow he will be all right.”

“Oh! that''s just a little drink, nothing more; he has eaten no
      dinner, in order to be nimble, and then he took a few absinthes in order
      to work himself up to the proper pitch. You see, drink gives strength to
      his legs, but it stops his thoughts and words. He is too old to dance as
      he does. Really, his lack of common sense is enough to drive one mad!”

She shrugged her shoulders and turned red from the anger which was slowly
      rising within her and she cried out:

“Ah! yes, why? So that the people will think him young under his
      mask; so that the women will still take him for a young dandy and whisper
      nasty things into his ears; so that he can rub up against all their dirty
      skins, with their perfumes and powders and cosmetics. Ah! it''s a fine
      business! What a life I have had for the last forty years! But we must
      first get him to bed, so that he may have no ill effects. Would you mind
      helping me? When he is like that I can''t do anything with him alone.”

The old man was sitting on his bed, with a tipsy look, his long white hair
      falling over his face. His companion looked at him with tender yet
      indignant eyes. She continued:

“Just see the fine head he has for his age, and yet he has to go and
      disguise himself in order to make people think that he is young. It''s a
      perfect shame! Really, he has a fine head, monsieur! Wait, I''ll show it to
      you before putting him to bed.”

She went to a table on which stood the washbasin a pitcher of water, soap
      and a comb and brush. She took the brush, returned to the bed and pushed
      back the drunkard''s tangled hair. In a few seconds she made him look like
      a model fit for a great painter, with his long white locks flowing on his
      neck. Then she stepped back in order to observe him, saying: “There!
      Isn''t he fine for his age?”

She added: “And if you had known him when he was twenty-five! But we
      must get him to bed, otherwise the drink will make him sick. Do you mind
      drawing off that sleeve? Higher-like that-that''s right. Now the trousers.
      Wait, I will take his shoes off—that''s right. Now, hold him upright
      while I open the bed. There—let us put him in. If you think that he
      is going to disturb himself when it is time for me to get in you are
      mistaken. I have to find a little corner any place I can. That doesn''t
      bother him! Bah! You old pleasure seeker!”

As soon as he felt himself stretched out in his sheets the old man closed
      his eyes, opened them closed them again, and over his whole face appeared
      an energetic resolve to sleep. The doctor examined him with an
      ever-increasing interest and asked: “Does he go to all the fancy
      balls and try to be a young man?” “To all of them, monsieur,
      and he comes back to me in the morning in a deplorable condition. You see,
      it''s regret that leads him on and that makes him put a pasteboard face
      over his own. Yes, the regret of no longer being what he was and of no
      longer making any conquests!”

He was sleeping now and beginning to snore. She looked at him with a
      pitying expression and continued: “Oh! how many conquests that man
      has made! More than one could believe, monsieur, more than the finest
      gentlemen of the world, than all the tenors and all the generals.”

“Oh! it will surprise you at first, as you did not know him in his
      palmy days. When I met him it was also at a ball, for he has always
      frequented them. As soon as I saw him I was caught—caught like a
      fish on a hook. Ah! how pretty he was, monsieur, with his curly raven
      locks and black eyes as large as saucers! Indeed, he was good looking! He
      took me away that evening and I never have left him since, never, not even
      for a day, no matter what he did to me! Oh! he has often made it hard for
      me!”

She answered simply: “Yes, monsieur, otherwise he would have dropped
      me as he did the others. I have been his wife and his servant, everything,
      everything that he wished. How he has made me cry—tears which I did
      not show him; for he would tell all his adventures to me—to me,
      monsieur—without understanding how it hurt me to listen.”

“That''s so. I forgot to tell you. He was the foreman at Martel''s—a
      foreman such as they never had had—an artist who averaged ten francs
      an hour.”

“The hairdresser, monsieur, the great hairdresser of the Opera, who
      had all the actresses for customers. Yes, sir, all the smartest actresses
      had their hair dressed by Ambrose and they would give him tips that made a
      fortune for him. Ah! monsieur, all the women are alike, yes, all of them.
      When a man pleases their fancy they offer themselves to him. It is so easy—and
      it hurt me so to hear about it. For he would tell me everything—he
      simply could not hold his tongue—it was impossible. Those things
      please the men so much! They seem to get even more enjoyment out of
      telling than doing.

“When I would see him coming in the evening, a little pale, with a
      pleased look and a bright eye, would say to myself: ''One more. I am sure
      that he has caught one more.'' Then I felt a wild desire to question him
      and then, again, not to know, to stop his talking if he should begin. And
      we would look at each other.

“I knew that he would not keep still, that he would come to the
      point. I could feel that from his manner, which seemed to laugh and say:
      ''I had a fine adventure to-day, Madeleine.'' I would pretend to notice
      nothing, to guess nothing; I would set the table, bring on the soup and
      sit down opposite him.

“At those times, monsieur, it was as if my friendship for him had
      been crushed in my body as with a stone. It hurt. But he did not
      understand; he did not know; he felt a need to tell all those things to
      some one, to boast, to show how much he was loved, and I was the only one
      he had to whom he could talk-the only one. And I would have to listen and
      drink it in, like poison.

“Then he would begin: ''One more! And a beauty, too.'' And it would be
      some little one from the Vaudeville or else from the Varietes, and some of
      the big ones, too, some of the most famous. He would tell me their names,
      how their apartments were furnished, everything, everything, monsieur.
      Heartbreaking details. And he would go over them and tell his story over
      again from beginning to end, so pleased with himself that I would pretend
      to laugh so that he would not get angry with me.

“Everything may not have been true! He liked to glorify himself and
      was quite capable of inventing such things! They may perhaps also have
      been true! On those evenings he would pretend to be tired and wish to go
      to bed after supper. We would take supper at eleven, monsieur, for he
      could never get back from work earlier.

“When he had finished telling about his adventure he would walk
      round the room and smoke cigarettes, and he was so handsome, with his
      mustache and curly hair, that I would think: ''It''s true, just the same,
      what he is telling. Since I myself am crazy about that man, why should not
      others be the same?'' Then I would feel like crying, shrieking, running
      away and jumping out of the window while I was clearing the table and he
      was smoking. He would yawn in order to show how tired he was, and he would
      say two or three times before going to bed: ''Ah! how well I shall sleep
      this evening!''

“I bear him no ill will, because he did not know how he was hurting
      me. No, he could not know! He loved to boast about the women just as a
      peacock loves to show his feathers. He got to the point where he thought
      that all of them looked at him and desired him.

“It was hard when he grew old. Oh, monsieur, when I saw his first
      white hair I felt a terrible shock and then a great joy—a wicked joy—but
      so great, so great! I said to myself: ''It''s the end-it''s the end.'' It
      seemed as if I were about to be released from prison. At last I could have
      him to myself, all to myself, when the others would no longer want him.

“It was one morning in bed. He was still sleeping and I leaned over
      him to wake him up with a kiss, when I noticed in his curls, over his
      temple, a little thread which shone like silver. What a surprise! I should
      not have thought it possible! At first I thought of tearing it out so that
      he would not see it, but as I looked carefully I noticed another farther
      up. White hair! He was going to have white hair! My heart began to thump
      and perspiration stood out all over me, but away down at the bottom I was
      happy.

“It was mean to feel thus, but I did my housework with a light heart
      that morning, without waking him up, and, as soon as he opened his eyes of
      his own accord, I said to him: ''Do you know what I discovered while you
      were asleep?''

“He jumped out of bed and ran over to the mirror. He could not find
      them. Then I showed him the first one, the lowest, the little curly one,
      and I said: ''It''s no wonder, after the life that you have been leading. In
      two years all will be over for you.''

“Well, monsieur, I had spoken true; two years later one could not
      recognize him. How quickly a man changes! He was still handsome, but he
      had lost his freshness, and the women no longer ran after him. Ah! what a
      life I led at that time! How he treated me! Nothing suited him. He left
      his trade to go into the hat business, in which he ate up all his money.
      Then he unsuccessfully tried to be an actor, and finally he began to
      frequent public balls. Fortunately, he had had common sense enough to save
      a little something on which we now live. It is sufficient, but it is not
      enormous. And to think that at one time he had almost a fortune.

“Now you see what he does. This habit holds him like a frenzy. He
      has to be young; he has to dance with women who smell of perfume and
      cosmetics. You poor old darling!”

She was looking at her old snoring husband fondly, ready to cry. Then,
      gently tiptoeing up to him, she kissed his hair. The physician had risen
      and was getting ready to leave, finding nothing to say to this strange
      couple. Just as he was leaving she asked:

From April to the end of May, before the Parisian visitors arrive, one
      sees, all at once, on the little beach at Etretat several old gentlemen,
      booted and belted in shooting costume. They spend four or five days at the
      Hotel Hauville, disappear, and return again three weeks later. Then, after
      a fresh sojourn, they go away altogether.

These are the last penguin hunters, what remain of the old set. There were
      about twenty enthusiasts thirty or forty years ago; now there are only a
      few of the enthusiastic sportsmen.

The penguin is a very rare bird of passage, with peculiar habits. It lives
      the greater part of the year in the latitude of Newfoundland and the
      islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon. But in the breeding season a flight of
      emigrants crosses the ocean and comes every year to the same spot to lay
      their eggs, to the Penguins'' Rock near Etretat. They are found nowhere
      else, only there. They have always come there, have always been chased
      away, but return again, and will always return. As soon as the young birds
      are grown they all fly away, and disappear for a year.

Why do they not go elsewhere? Why not choose some other spot on the long
      white, unending cliff that extends from the Pas-de-Calais to Havre? What
      force, what invincible instinct, what custom of centuries impels these
      birds to come back to this place? What first migration, what tempest,
      possibly, once cast their ancestors on this rock? And why do the children,
      the grandchildren, all the descendants of the first parents always return
      here?

There are not many of them, a hundred at most, as if one single family,
      maintaining the tradition, made this annual pilgrimage.

And each spring, as soon as the little wandering tribe has taken up its
      abode an the rock, the same sportsmen also reappear in the village. One
      knew them formerly when they were young; now they are old, but constant to
      the regular appointment which they have kept for thirty or forty years.
      They would not miss it for anything in the world.

It was an April evening in one of the later years. Three of the old
      sportsmen had arrived; one was missing—M. d''Arnelles.

He had written to no one, given no account of himself. But he was not
      dead, like so many of the rest; they would have heard of it. At length,
      tired of waiting for him, the other three sat down to table. Dinner was
      almost over when a carriage drove into the yard of the hotel, and the late
      comer presently entered the dining room.

He sat down, in a good humor, rubbing his hands, and ate with zest. When
      one of his comrades remarked with surprise at his being in a frock-coat,
      he replied quietly:

They retired on leaving the table, for they had to set out before daybreak
      in order to take the birds unawares.

At three o''clock in the morning the sailors awoke the sportsmen by
      throwing sand against the windows. They were ready in a few minutes and
      went down to the beach. Although it was still dark, the stars had paled a
      little. The sea ground the shingle on the beach. There was such a fresh
      breeze that it made one shiver slightly in spite of one''s heavy clothing.

Presently two boats were pushed down the beach, by the sailors, with a
      sound as of tearing cloth, and were floated on the nearest waves. The
      brown sail was hoisted, swelled a little, fluttered, hesitated and
      swelling out again as round as a paunch, carried the boats towards the
      large arched entrance that could be faintly distinguished in the darkness.

The sky became clearer, the shadows seemed to melt away. The coast still
      seemed veiled, the great white coast, perpendicular as a wall.

They passed through the Manne-Porte, an enormous arch beneath which a ship
      could sail; they doubled the promontory of La Courtine, passed the little
      valley of Antifer and the cape of the same name; and suddenly caught sight
      of a beach on which some hundreds of seagulls were perched.

That was the Penguins'' Rock. It was just a little protuberance of the
      cliff, and on the narrow ledges of rock the birds'' heads might be seen
      watching the boats.

They remained there, motionless, not venturing to fly off as yet. Some of
      them perched on the edges, seated upright, looked almost like bottles, for
      their little legs are so short that when they walk they glide along as if
      they were on rollers. When they start to fly they cannot make a spring and
      let themselves fall like stones almost down to the very men who are
      watching them.

They know their limitation and the danger to which it subjects them, and
      cannot make up their minds to fly away.

But the boatmen begin to shout, beating the sides of the boat with the
      wooden boat pins, and the birds, in affright, fly one by one into space
      until they reach the level of the waves. Then, moving their wings rapidly,
      they scud, scud along until they reach the open sea; if a shower of lead
      does not knock them into the water.

For an hour the firing is kept up, obliging them to give up, one after
      another. Sometimes the mother birds will not leave their nests, and are
      riddled with shot, causing drops of blood to spurt out on the white cliff,
      and the animal dies without having deserted her eggs.

The first day M. d''Arnelles fired at the birds with his habitual zeal; but
      when the party returned toward ten o''clock, beneath a brilliant sun, which
      cast great triangles of light on the white cliffs along the coast he
      appeared a little worried, and absentminded, contrary to his accustomed
      manner.

As soon as they got on shore a kind of servant dressed in black came up to
      him and said something in a low tone. He seemed to reflect, hesitate, and
      then replied:

The following day they set out again. This time M, d''Arnelles frequently
      missed his aim, although the birds were close by. His friends teased him,
      asked him if he were in love, if some secret sorrow was troubling his mind
      and heart. At length he confessed.

As soon as breakfast was over the valet in black appeared. M. d''Arnelles
      ordered his carriage, and the man was leaving the room when the three
      sportsmen interfered, insisting, begging, and praying their friend to
      stay. One of them at last said:

M. d''Arnelles, altogether perplexed, began to think, evidently baffled,
      divided between pleasure and duty, unhappy and disturbed.

“I had the misfortune to lose him; and as I was taking the body to
      my house, in Briseville, I came round this way so as not to miss our
      appointment. But you can see that I cannot wait any longer.”

M. d''Arnelles appeared to be relieved of a great weight, but a little
      uneasy, nevertheless, he asked:

“Parbleu! my dear boy, two days more or less can make no difference
      in his present condition.”

I was to see my old friend, Simon Radevin, of whom I had lost sight for
      fifteen years. At one time he was my most intimate friend, the friend who
      knows one''s thoughts, with whom one passes long, quiet, happy evenings, to
      whom one tells one''s secret love affairs, and who seems to draw out those
      rare, ingenious, delicate thoughts born of that sympathy that gives a
      sense of repose.

For years we had scarcely been separated; we had lived, travelled, thought
      and dreamed together; had liked the same things, had admired the same
      books, understood the same authors, trembled with the same sensations, and
      very often laughed at the same individuals, whom we understood completely
      by merely exchanging a glance.

Then he married. He married, quite suddenly, a little girl from the
      provinces, who had come to Paris in search of a husband. How in the world
      could that little thin, insipidly fair girl, with her weak hands, her
      light, vacant eyes, and her clear, silly voice, who was exactly like a
      hundred thousand marriageable dolls, have picked up that intelligent,
      clever young fellow? Can any one understand these things? No doubt he had
      hoped for happiness, simple, quiet and long-enduring happiness, in the
      arms of a good, tender and faithful woman; he had seen all that in the
      transparent looks of that schoolgirl with light hair.

He had not dreamed of the fact that an active, living and vibrating man
      grows weary of everything as soon as he understands the stupid reality,
      unless, indeed, he becomes so brutalized that he understands nothing
      whatever.

What would he be like when I met him again? Still lively, witty,
      light-hearted and enthusiastic, or in a state of mental torpor induced by
      provincial life? A man may change greatly in the course of fifteen years!

The train stopped at a small station, and as I got out of the carriage, a
      stout, a very stout man with red cheeks and a big stomach rushed up to me
      with open arms, exclaiming: “George!” I embraced him, but I
      had not recognized him, and then I said, in astonishment: “By Jove!
      You have not grown thin!” And he replied with a laugh:

“What did you expect? Good living, a good table and good nights!
      Eating and sleeping, that is my existence!”

I looked at him closely, trying to discover in that broad face the
      features I held so dear. His eyes alone had not changed, but I no longer
      saw the same expression in them, and I said to myself: “If the
      expression be the reflection of the mind, the thoughts in that head are
      not what they used to be formerly; those thoughts which I knew so well.”

Yet his eyes were bright, full of happiness and friendship, but they had
      not that clear, intelligent expression which shows as much as words the
      brightness of the intellect. Suddenly he said:

“Here are my two eldest children.” A girl of fourteen, who was
      almost a woman, and a boy of thirteen, in the dress of a boy from a Lycee,
      came forward in a hesitating and awkward manner, and I said in a low
      voice: “Are they yours?” “Of course they are,” he
      replied, laughing. “How many have you?” “Five! There are
      three more at home.”

He said this in a proud, self-satisfied, almost triumphant manner, and I
      felt profound pity, mingled with a feeling of vague contempt, for this
      vainglorious and simple reproducer of his species.

I got into a carriage which he drove himself, and we set off through the
      town, a dull, sleepy, gloomy town where nothing was moving in the streets
      except a few dogs and two or three maidservants. Here and there a
      shopkeeper, standing at his door, took off his hat, and Simon returned his
      salute and told me the man''s name; no doubt to show me that he knew all
      the inhabitants personally, and the thought struck me that he was thinking
      of becoming a candidate for the Chamber of Deputies, that dream of all
      those who bury themselves in the provinces.

We were soon out of the town, and the carriage turned into a garden that
      was an imitation of a park, and stopped in front of a turreted house,
      which tried to look like a chateau.

“That is my den,” said Simon, so that I might compliment him
      on it. “It is charming,” I replied.

A lady appeared on the steps, dressed for company, and with company
      phrases all ready prepared. She was no longer the light-haired, insipid
      girl I had seen in church fifteen years previously, but a stout lady in
      curls and flounces, one of those ladies of uncertain age, without
      intellect, without any of those things that go to make a woman. In short,
      she was a mother, a stout, commonplace mother, a human breeding machine
      which procreates without any other preoccupation but her children and her
      cook-book.

She welcomed me, and I went into the hall, where three children, ranged
      according to their height, seemed set out for review, like firemen before
      a mayor, and I said: “Ah! ah! so there are the others?” Simon,
      radiant with pleasure, introduced them: “Jean, Sophie and Gontran.”

The door of the drawing-room was open. I went in, and in the depths of an
      easy-chair, I saw something trembling, a man, an old, paralyzed man.
      Madame Radevin came forward and said: “This is my grandfather,
      monsieur; he is eighty-seven.” And then she shouted into the shaking
      old man''s ears: “This is a friend of Simon''s, papa.” The old
      gentleman tried to say “good-day” to me, and he muttered:
      “Oua, oua, oua,” and waved his hand, and I took a seat saying:
      “You are very kind, monsieur.”

Simon had just come in, and he said with a laugh: “So! You have made
      grandpapa''s acquaintance. He is a treasure, that old man; he is the
      delight of the children. But he is so greedy that he almost kills himself
      at every meal; you have no idea what he would eat if he were allowed to do
      as he pleased. But you will see, you will see. He looks at all the sweets
      as if they were so many girls. You never saw anything so funny; you will
      see presently.”

I was then shown to my room, to change my dress for dinner, and hearing a
      great clatter behind me on the stairs, I turned round and saw that all the
      children were following me behind their father; to do me honor, no doubt.

My windows looked out across a dreary, interminable plain, an ocean of
      grass, of wheat and of oats, without a clump of trees or any rising
      ground, a striking and melancholy picture of the life which they must be
      leading in that house.

A bell rang; it was for dinner, and I went downstairs. Madame Radevin took
      my arm in a ceremonious manner, and we passed into the dining-room. A
      footman wheeled in the old man in his armchair. He gave a greedy and
      curious look at the dessert, as he turned his shaking head with difficulty
      from one dish to the other.

Simon rubbed his hands: “You will be amused,” he said; and all
      the children understanding that I was going to be indulged with the sight
      of their greedy grandfather, began to laugh, while their mother merely
      smiled and shrugged her shoulders, and Simon, making a speaking trumpet of
      his hands, shouted at the old man: “This evening there is sweet
      creamed rice!” The wrinkled face of the grandfather brightened, and
      he trembled more violently, from head to foot, showing that he had
      understood and was very pleased. The dinner began.

“Just look!” Simon whispered. The old man did not like the
      soup, and refused to eat it; but he was obliged to do it for the good of
      his health, and the footman forced the spoon into his mouth, while the old
      man blew so energetically, so as not to swallow the soup, that it was
      scattered like a spray all over the table and over his neighbors. The
      children writhed with laughter at the spectacle, while their father, who
      was also amused, said: “Is not the old man comical?”

During the whole meal they were taken up solely with him. He devoured the
      dishes on the table with his eyes, and tried to seize them and pull them
      over to him with his trembling hands. They put them almost within his
      reach, to see his useless efforts, his trembling clutches at them, the
      piteous appeal of his whole nature, of his eyes, of his mouth and of his
      nose as he smelt them, and he slobbered on his table napkin with
      eagerness, while uttering inarticulate grunts. And the whole family was
      highly amused at this horrible and grotesque scene.

Then they put a tiny morsel on his plate, and he ate with feverish
      gluttony, in order to get something more as soon as possible, and when the
      sweetened rice was brought in, he nearly had a fit, and groaned with
      greediness, and Gontran called out to him:

“You have eaten too much already; you can have no more.” And
      they pretended not to give him any. Then he began to cry; he cried and
      trembled more violently than ever, while all the children laughed. At
      last, however, they gave him his helping, a very small piece; and as he
      ate the first mouthful, he made a comical noise in his throat, and a
      movement with his neck as ducks do when they swallow too large a morsel,
      and when he had swallowed it, he began to stamp his feet, so as to get
      more.

I was seized with pity for this saddening and ridiculous Tantalus, and
      interposed on his behalf:

“Come, give him a little more rice!” But Simon replied:
      “Oh! no, my dear fellow, if he were to eat too much, it would harm
      him, at his age.”

I held my tongue, and thought over those words. Oh, ethics! Oh, logic! Oh,
      wisdom! At his age! So they deprived him of his only remaining pleasure
      out of regard for his health! His health! What would he do with it, inert
      and trembling wreck that he was? They were taking care of his life, so
      they said. His life? How many days? Ten, twenty, fifty, or a hundred? Why?
      For his own sake? Or to preserve for some time longer the spectacle of his
      impotent greediness in the family.

There was nothing left for him to do in this life, nothing whatever. He
      had one single wish left, one sole pleasure; why not grant him that last
      solace until he died?

After we had played cards for a long time, I went up to my room and to
      bed; I was low-spirited and sad, sad, sad! and I sat at my window. Not a
      sound could be heard outside but the beautiful warbling of a bird in a
      tree, somewhere in the distance. No doubt the bird was singing in a low
      voice during the night, to lull his mate, who was asleep on her eggs. And
      I thought of my poor friend''s five children, and pictured him to myself,
      snoring by the side of his ugly wife.

“On Wednesday night the people living in No. 40 Rue de——-,
      were awakened by two successive shots. The explosions seemed to come from
      the apartment occupied by M. X——. The door was broken in and
      the man was found bathed in his blood, still holding in one hand the
      revolver with which he had taken his life.

“M. X——was fifty-seven years of age, enjoying a
      comfortable income, and had everything necessary to make him happy. No
      cause can be found for his action.”

What terrible grief, what unknown suffering, hidden despair, secret wounds
      drive these presumably happy persons to suicide? We search, we imagine
      tragedies of love, we suspect financial troubles, and, as we never find
      anything definite, we apply to these deaths the word “mystery.”

A letter found on the desk of one of these “suicides without cause,”
      and written during his last night, beside his loaded revolver, has come
      into our hands. We deem it rather interesting. It reveals none of those
      great catastrophes which we always expect to find behind these acts of
      despair; but it shows us the slow succession of the little vexations of
      life, the disintegration of a lonely existence, whose dreams have
      disappeared; it gives the reason for these tragic ends, which only nervous
      and high-strung people can understand.

“It is midnight. When I have finished this letter I shall kill
      myself. Why? I shall attempt to give the reasons, not for those who may
      read these lines, but for myself, to kindle my waning courage, to impress
      upon myself the fatal necessity of this act which can, at best, be only
      deferred.

“I was brought up by simple-minded parents who were unquestioning
      believers. And I believed as they did.

“During the last few years a strange change has been taking place
      within me. All the events of Life, which formerly had to me the glow of a
      beautiful sunset, are now fading away. The true meaning of things has
      appeared to me in its brutal reality; and the true reason for love has
      bred in me disgust even for this poetic sentiment: ''We are the eternal
      toys of foolish and charming illusions, which are always being renewed.''

“On growing older, I had become partly reconciled to the awful
      mystery of life, to the uselessness of effort; when the emptiness of
      everything appeared to me in a new light, this evening, after dinner.

“Formerly, I was happy! Everything pleased me: the passing women,
      the appearance of the streets, the place where I lived; and I even took an
      interest in the cut of my clothes. But the repetition of the same sights
      has had the result of filling my heart with weariness and disgust, just as
      one would feel were one to go every night to the same theatre.

“For the last thirty years I have been rising at the same hour; and,
      at the same restaurant, for thirty years, I have been eating at the same
      hours the same dishes brought me by different waiters.

“I have tried travel. The loneliness which one feels in strange
      places terrified me. I felt so alone, so small on the earth that I quickly
      started on my homeward journey.

“But here the unchanging expression of my furniture, which has stood
      for thirty years in the same place, the smell of my apartments (for, with
      time, each dwelling takes on a particular odor) each night, these and
      other things disgust me and make me sick of living thus.

“Everything repeats itself endlessly. The way in which I put my key
      in the lock, the place where I always find my matches, the first object
      which meets my eye when I enter the room, make me feel like jumping out of
      the window and putting an end to those monotonous events from which we can
      never escape.

“Each day, when I shave, I feel an inordinate desire to cut my
      throat; and my face, which I see in the little mirror, always the same,
      with soap on my cheeks, has several times made me weak from sadness.

“Now I even hate to be with people whom I used to meet with
      pleasure; I know them so well, I can tell just what they are going to say
      and what I am going to answer. Each brain is like a circus, where the same
      horse keeps circling around eternally. We must circle round always, around
      the same ideas, the same joys, the same pleasures, the same habits, the
      same beliefs, the same sensations of disgust.

“The fog was terrible this evening. It enfolded the boulevard, where
      the street lights were dimmed and looked like smoking candles. A heavier
      weight than usual oppressed me. Perhaps my digestion was bad.

“For good digestion is everything in life. It gives the inspiration
      to the artist, amorous desires to young people, clear ideas to thinkers,
      the joy of life to everybody, and it also allows one to eat heartily
      (which is one of the greatest pleasures). A sick stomach induces
      scepticism unbelief, nightmares and the desire for death. I have often
      noticed this fact. Perhaps I would not kill myself, if my digestion had
      been good this evening.

“When I sat down in the arm-chair where I have been sitting every
      day for thirty years, I glanced around me, and just then I was seized by
      such a terrible distress that I thought I must go mad.

“I tried to think of what I could do to run away from myself. Every
      occupation struck me as being worse even than inaction. Then I bethought
      me of putting my papers in order.

“For a long time I have been thinking of clearing out my drawers;
      for, for the last thirty years, I have been throwing my letters and bills
      pell-mell into the same desk, and this confusion has often caused me
      considerable trouble. But I feel such moral and physical laziness at the
      sole idea of putting anything in order that I have never had the courage
      to begin this tedious business.

“I therefore opened my desk, intending to choose among my old papers
      and destroy the majority of them.

“And if, perchance, you should, take the contents by the handful,
      close your eyes that you may not read a word, so that you may not
      recognize some forgotten handwriting which may plunge you suddenly into a
      sea of memories; carry these papers to the fire; and when they are in
      ashes, crush them to an invisible powder, or otherwise you are lost—just
      as I have been lost for an hour.

“The first letters which I read did not interest me greatly. They
      were recent, and came from living men whom I still meet quite often, and
      whose presence does not move me to any great extent. But all at once one
      envelope made me start. My name was traced on it in a large, bold
      handwriting; and suddenly tears came to my eyes. That letter was from my
      dearest friend, the companion of my youth, the confidant of my hopes; and
      he appeared before me so clearly, with his pleasant smile and his hand
      outstretched, that a cold shiver ran down my back. Yes, yes, the dead come
      back, for I saw him! Our memory is a more perfect world than the universe:
      it gives back life to those who no longer exist.

“With trembling hand and dimmed eyes I reread everything that he
      told me, and in my poor sobbing heart I felt a wound so painful that I
      began to groan as a man whose bones are slowly being crushed.

“Then I travelled over my whole life, just as one travels along a
      river. I recognized people, so long forgotten that I no longer knew their
      names. Their faces alone lived in me. In my mother''s letters I saw again
      the old servants, the shape of our house and the little insignificant odds
      and ends which cling to our minds.

“Yes, I suddenly saw again all my mother''s old gowns, the different
      styles which she adopted and the several ways in which she dressed her
      hair. She haunted me especially in a silk dress, trimmed with old lace;
      and I remembered something she said one day when she was wearing this
      dress. She said: ''Robert, my child, if you do not stand up straight you
      will be round-shouldered all your life.''

“Then, opening another drawer, I found myself face to face with
      memories of tender passions: a dancing-pump, a torn handkerchief, even a
      garter, locks of hair and dried flowers. Then the sweet romances of my
      life, whose living heroines are now white-haired, plunged me into the deep
      melancholy of things. Oh, the young brows where blond locks curl, the
      caress of the hands, the glance which speaks, the hearts which beat, that
      smile which promises the lips, those lips which promise the embrace! And
      the first kiss-that endless kiss which makes you close your eyes, which
      drowns all thought in the immeasurable joy of approaching possession!

“Taking these old pledges of former love in both my hands, I covered
      them with furious caresses, and in my soul, torn by these memories, I saw
      them each again at the hour of surrender; and I suffered a torture more
      cruel than all the tortures invented in all the fables about hell.

“One last letter remained. It was written by me and dictated fifty
      years ago by my writing teacher. Here it is:

“It is all over. I had gone back to the beginning, and suddenly I
      turned my glance on what remained to me of life. I saw hideous and lonely
      old age, and approaching infirmities, and everything over and gone. And
      nobody near me!

And that is how many men come to kill themselves; and we search in vain to
      discover some great sorrow in their lives.

The old doctor sat by the fireside, talking to his fair patient who was
      lying on the lounge. There was nothing much the matter with her, except
      that she had one of those little feminine ailments from which pretty women
      frequently suffer—slight anaemia, a nervous attack, etc.

“No, doctor,” she said; “I shall never be able to
      understand a woman deceiving her husband. Even allowing that she does not
      love him, that she pays no heed to her vows and promises, how can she give
      herself to another man? How can she conceal the intrigue from other
      people''s eyes? How can it be possible to love amid lies and treason?”

The doctor smiled, and replied: “It is perfectly easy, and I can
      assure you that a woman does not think of all those little subtle details
      when she has made up her mind to go astray.

“As for dissimulation, all women have plenty of it on hand for such
      occasions, and the simplest of them are wonderful, and extricate
      themselves from the greatest dilemmas in a remarkable manner.”

“No, doctor,” she said; “one never thinks until after it
      has happened of what one ought to have done in a critical situation, and
      women are certainly more liable than men to lose their head on such
      occasions:”

The doctor raised his hands. “After it has happened, you say! Now I
      will tell you something that happened to one of my female patients, whom I
      always considered an immaculate woman.

“It happened in a provincial town, and one night when I was asleep,
      in that deep first sleep from which it is so difficult to rouse us, it
      seemed to me, in my dreams, as if the bells in the town were sounding a
      fire alarm, and I woke up with a start. It was my own bell, which was
      ringing wildly, and as my footman did not seem to be answering the door,
      I, in turn, pulled the bell at the head of my bed, and soon I heard a
      banging, and steps in the silent house, and Jean came into my room, and
      handed me a letter which said: ''Madame Lelievre begs Dr. Simeon to come to
      her immediately.''

“I thought for a few moments, and then I said to myself: ''A nervous
      attack, vapors; nonsense, I am too tired.'' And so I replied: ''As Dr.
      Simeon is not at all well, he must beg Madame Lelievre to be kind enough
      to call in his colleague, Monsieur Bonnet.'' I put the note into an
      envelope and went to sleep again, but about half an hour later the street
      bell rang again, and Jean came to me and said: ''There is somebody
      downstairs; I do not quite know whether it is a man or a woman, as the
      individual is so wrapped up, but they wish to speak to you immediately.
      They say it is a matter of life and death for two people.'' Whereupon I sat
      up in bed and told him to show the person in.

“A kind of black phantom appeared and raised her veil as soon as
      Jean had left the room. It was Madame Berthe Lelievre, quite a young
      woman, who had been married for three years to a large merchant in the
      town, who was said to have married the prettiest girl in the neighborhood.

“She was terribly pale, her face was contracted as the faces of
      insane people are, occasionally, and her hands trembled violently. Twice
      she tried to speak without being able to utter a sound, but at last she
      stammered out: ''Come—quick—quick, doctor. Come—my—friend
      has just died in my bedroom.'' She stopped, half suffocated with emotion,
      and then went on: ''My husband will be coming home from the club very
      soon.''

“I jumped out of bed without even considering that I was only in my
      nightshirt, and dressed myself in a few moments, and then I said: ''Did you
      come a short time ago?'' ''No,'' she said, standing like a statue petrified
      with horror. ''It was my servant—she knows.'' And then, after a short
      silence, she went on: ''I was there—by his side.'' And she uttered a
      sort of cry of horror, and after a fit of choking, which made her gasp,
      she wept violently, and shook with spasmodic sobs for a minute: or two.
      Then her tears suddenly ceased, as if by an internal fire, and with an air
      of tragic calmness, she said: ''Let us make haste.''

“I was ready, but exclaimed: ''I quite forgot to order my carriage.''
      ''I have one,'' she said; ''it is his, which was waiting for him!'' She
      wrapped herself up, so as to completely conceal her face, and we started.

“When she was by my side in the carriage she suddenly seized my
      hand, and crushing it in her delicate fingers, she said, with a shaking
      voice, that proceeded from a distracted heart: ''Oh! if you only knew, if
      you only knew what I am suffering! I loved him, I have loved him
      distractedly, like a madwoman, for the last six months.'' ''Is anyone up in
      your house?'' I asked. ''No, nobody except those, who knows everything.''

“We stopped at the door, and evidently everybody was asleep. We went
      in without making any noise, by means of her latch-key, and walked
      upstairs on tiptoe. The frightened servant was sitting on the top of the
      stairs with a lighted candle by her side, as she was afraid to remain with
      the dead man, and I went into the room, which was in great disorder. Wet
      towels, with which they had bathed the young man''s temples, were lying on
      the floor, by the side of a washbasin and a glass, while a strong smell of
      vinegar pervaded the room.

“The dead man''s body was lying at full length in the middle of the
      room, and I went up to it, looked at it, and touched it. I opened the eyes
      and felt the hands, and then, turning to the two women, who were shaking
      as if they were freezing, I said to them: ''Help me to lift him on to the
      bed.'' When we had laid him gently on it, I listened to his heart and put a
      looking-glass to his lips, and then said: ''It is all over.'' It was a
      terrible sight!

“I looked at the man, and said: ''You ought to arrange his hair a
      little.'' The girl went and brought her mistress'' comb and brush, but as
      she was trembling, and pulling out his long, matted hair in doing it,
      Madame Lelievre took the comb out of her hand, and arranged his hair as if
      she were caressing him. She parted it, brushed his beard, rolled his
      mustaches gently round her fingers, then, suddenly, letting go of his
      hair, she took the dead man''s inert head in her hands and looked for a
      long time in despair at the dead face, which no longer could smile at her,
      and then, throwing herself on him, she clasped him in her arms and kissed
      him ardently. Her kisses fell like blows on his closed mouth and eyes, his
      forehead and temples; and then, putting her lips to his ear, as if he
      could still hear her, and as if she were about to whisper something to
      him, she said several times, in a heartrending voice:

“Just then the clock struck twelve, and I started up. ''Twelve
      o''clock!'' I exclaimed. ''That is the time when the club closes. Come,
      madame, we have not a moment to lose!'' She started up, and I said:

“''We must carry him into the drawing-room.'' And when we had done
      this, I placed him on a sofa, and lit the chandeliers, and just then the
      front door was opened and shut noisily. ''Rose, bring me the basin and the
      towels, and make the room look tidy. Make haste, for Heaven''s sake!
      Monsieur Lelievre is coming in.''

“I heard his steps on the stairs, and then his hands feeling along
      the walls. ''Come here, my dear fellow,'' I said; ''we have had an accident.''

“And the astonished husband appeared in the door with a cigar in his
      mouth, and said: ''What is the matter? What is the meaning of this?'' ''My
      dear friend,'' I said, going up to him, ''you find us in great
      embarrassment. I had remained late, chatting with your wife and our
      friend, who had brought me in his carriage, when he suddenly fainted, and
      in spite of all we have done, he has remained unconscious for two hours. I
      did not like to call in strangers, and if you will now help me downstairs
      with him, I shall be able to attend to him better at his own house.''

“The husband, who was surprised, but quite unsuspicious, took off
      his hat, and then he took his rival, who would be quite inoffensive for
      the future, under the arms. I got between his two legs, as if I had been a
      horse between the shafts, and we went downstairs, while his wife held a
      light for us. When we got outside I stood the body up, so as to deceive
      the coachman, and said: ''Come, my friend; it is nothing; you feel better
      already I expect. Pluck up your courage, and make an effort. It will soon
      be over.'' But as I felt that he was slipping out of my hands, I gave him a
      slap on the shoulder, which sent him forward and made him fall into the
      carriage, and then I got in after him. Monsieur Lelievre, who was rather
      alarmed, said to me: ''Do you think it is anything serious?'' To which I
      replied: ''No,'' with a smile, as I looked at his wife, who had put her arm
      into that of her husband, and was trying to see into the carriage.

“I shook hands with them and told my coachman to start, and during
      the whole drive the dead man kept falling against me. When we got to his
      house I said that he had become unconscious on the way home, and helped to
      carry him upstairs, where I certified that he was dead, and acted another
      comedy to his distracted family, and at last I got back to bed, not
      without swearing at lovers.”

The doctor ceased, though he was still smiling, and the young woman, who
      was in a very nervous state, said: “Why have you told me that
      terrible story?”

They had just dined together, five old friends, a writer, a doctor and
      three rich bachelors without any profession.

They had talked about everything, and a feeling of lassitude came over
      them, that feeling which precedes and leads to the departure of guests
      after festive gatherings. One of those present, who had for the last five
      minutes been gazing silently at the surging boulevard dotted with
      gas-lamps, with its rattling vehicles, said suddenly:

“And the nights too,” assented the guest who sat next to him.
      “I sleep very little; pleasures fatigue me; conversation is
      monotonous. Never do I come across a new idea, and I feel, before talking
      to any one, a violent longing to say nothing and to listen to nothing. I
      don''t know what to do with my evenings.”

“I would pay a great deal for anything that would help me to pass
      just two pleasant hours every day.”

“The man who could discover a new vice and introduce it among his
      fellow creatures, even if it were to shorten their lives, would render a
      greater service to humanity than the man who found the means of securing
      to them eternal salvation and eternal youth.”

“Yes, but it is not so easy to discover it. Men have however
      crudely, been seeking for—and working for the object you refer to
      since the beginning of the world. The men who came first reached
      perfection at once in this way. We are hardly equal to them.”

“If we could only sleep, sleep well, without feeling hot or cold,
      sleep with that perfect unconsciousness we experience on nights when we
      are thoroughly fatigued, sleep without dreams.”

“Because dreams are not always pleasant; they are always fantastic,
      improbable, disconnected; and because when we are asleep we cannot have
      the sort of dreams we like. We ought to dream waking.”

“My dear fellow, in order to dream when you are awake, you need
      great power and great exercise of will, and when you try to do it, great
      weariness is the result. Now, real dreaming, that journey of our thoughts
      through delightful visions, is assuredly the sweetest experience in the
      world; but it must come naturally, it must not be provoked in a painful,
      manner, and must be accompanied by absolute bodily comfort. This power of
      dreaming I can give you, provided you promise that you will not abuse it.”

“Ah! yes, I know—hasheesh, opium, green tea—artificial
      paradises. I have read Baudelaire, and I even tasted the famous drug,
      which made me very sick.”

“No; ether, nothing but ether; and I would suggest that you literary
      men should use it sometimes.”

“Let us put aside big words, shall we not? I am not talking of
      medicine or morality; I am talking of pleasure. You give yourselves up
      every day to excesses which consume your lives. I want to indicate to you
      a new sensation, possible only to intelligent men—let us say even
      very intelligent men—dangerous, like everything else that
      overexcites our organs, but exquisite. I might add that you would require
      a certain preparation, that is to say, practice, to feel in all their
      completeness the singular effects of ether.

“They are different from the effects of hasheesh, of opium, or
      morphia, and they cease as soon as the absorption of the drug is
      interrupted, while the other generators of day dreams continue their
      action for hours.

“I am now going to try to analyze these feelings as clearly as
      possible. But the thing is not easy, so facile, so delicate, so almost
      imperceptible, are these sensations.

“It was when I was attacked by violent neuralgia that I made use of
      this remedy, which since then I have, perhaps, slightly abused.

“I had acute pains in my head and neck, and an intolerable heat of
      the skin, a feverish restlessness. I took up a large bottle of ether, and,
      lying down, I began to inhale it slowly.

“At the end of some minutes I thought I heard a vague murmur, which
      ere long became a sort of humming, and it seemed to me that all the
      interior of my body had become light, light as air, that it was dissolving
      into vapor.

“Then came a sort of torpor, a sleepy sensation of comfort, in spite
      of the pains which still continued, but which had ceased to make
      themselves felt. It was one of those sensations which we are willing to
      endure and not any of those frightful wrenches against which our tortured
      body protests.

“Soon the strange and delightful sense of emptiness which I felt in
      my chest extended to my limbs, which, in their turn, became light, as
      light as if the flesh and the bones had been melted and the skin only were
      left, the skin necessary to enable me to realize the sweetness of living,
      of bathing in this sensation of well-being. Then I perceived that I was no
      longer suffering. The pain had gone, melted away, evaporated. And I heard
      voices, four voices, two dialogues, without understanding what was said.
      At one time there were only indistinct sounds, at another time a word
      reached my ear. But I recognized that this was only the humming I had
      heard before, but emphasized. I was not asleep; I was not awake; I
      comprehended, I felt, I reasoned with the utmost clearness and depth, with
      extraordinary energy and intellectual pleasure, with a singular
      intoxication arising from this separation of my mental faculties.

“It was not like the dreams caused by hasheesh or the somewhat
      sickly visions that come from opium; it was an amazing acuteness of
      reasoning, a new way of seeing, judging and appreciating the things of
      life, and with the certainty, the absolute consciousness that this was the
      true way.

“And the old image of the Scriptures suddenly came back to my mind.
      It seemed to me that I had tasted of the Tree of Knowledge, that all the
      mysteries were unveiled, so much did I find myself under the sway of a
      new, strange and irrefutable logic. And arguments, reasonings, proofs rose
      up in a heap before my brain only to be immediately displaced by some
      stronger proof, reasoning, argument. My head had, in fact, become a
      battleground of ideas. I was a superior being, armed with invincible
      intelligence, and I experienced a huge delight at the manifestation of my
      power.

“It lasted a long, long time. I still kept inhaling the ether from
      my flagon. Suddenly I perceived that it was empty.”

Noon had just struck. The school door opened and the youngsters darted
      out, jostling each other in their haste to get out quickly. But instead of
      promptly dispersing and going home to dinner as usual, they stopped a few
      paces off, broke up into knots, and began whispering.

The fact was that, that morning, Simon, the son of La Blanchotte, had, for
      the first time, attended school.

They had all of them in their families heard talk of La Blanchotte; and,
      although in public she was welcome enough, the mothers among themselves
      treated her with a somewhat disdainful compassion, which the children had
      imitated without in the least knowing why.

As for Simon himself, they did not know him, for he never went out, and
      did not run about with them in the streets of the village, or along the
      banks of the river. And they did not care for him; so it was with a
      certain delight, mingled with considerable astonishment, that they met and
      repeated to each other what had been said by a lad of fourteen or fifteen
      who appeared to know all about it, so sagaciously did he wink. “You
      know—Simon—well, he has no papa.”

He was seven or eight years old, rather pale, very neat, with a timid and
      almost awkward manner.

He was starting home to his mother''s house when the groups of his
      schoolmates, whispering and watching him with the mischievous and
      heartless eyes of children bent upon playing a nasty trick, gradually
      closed in around him and ended by surrounding him altogether. There he
      stood in their midst, surprised and embarrassed, not understanding what
      they were going to do with him. But the lad who had brought the news,
      puffed up with the success he had met with already, demanded:

The urchins began to laugh. The triumphant tormentor cried: “You can
      see plainly that he has no papa.”

A deep silence ensued. The children were dumfounded by this extraordinary,
      impossible, monstrous thing—a boy who had not a papa; they looked
      upon him as a phenomenon, an unnatural being, and they felt that hitherto
      inexplicable contempt of their mothers for La Blanchotte growing upon
      them. As for Simon, he had leaned against a tree to avoid falling, and he
      remained as if prostrated by an irreparable disaster. He sought to
      explain, but could think of nothing-to say to refute this horrible charge
      that he had no papa. At last he shouted at them quite recklessly: “Yes,
      I have one.”

Simon was silent, he did not know. The children roared, tremendously
      excited; and those country boys, little more than animals, experienced
      that cruel craving which prompts the fowls of a farmyard to destroy one of
      their number as soon as it is wounded. Simon suddenly espied a little
      neighbor, the son of a widow, whom he had seen, as he himself was to be
      seen, always alone with his mother.

A murmur of approval rose among the little wretches as if this fact of
      possessing a papa dead in a cemetery had caused their comrade to grow big
      enough to crush the other one who had no papa at all. And these boys,
      whose fathers were for the most part bad men, drunkards, thieves, and who
      beat their wives, jostled each other to press closer and closer, as though
      they, the legitimate ones, would smother by their pressure one who was
      illegitimate.

The boy who chanced to be next Simon suddenly put his tongue out at him
      with a mocking air and shouted at him:

Simon seized him by the hair with both hands and set to work to disable
      his legs with kicks, while he bit his cheek ferociously. A tremendous
      struggle ensued between the two combatants, and Simon found himself
      beaten, torn, bruised, rolled on the ground in the midst of the ring of
      applauding schoolboys. As he arose, mechanically brushing with his hand
      his little blouse all covered with dust, some one shouted at him:

Then he felt a great sinking at his heart. They were stronger than he was,
      they had beaten him, and he had no answer to give them, for he knew well
      that it was true that he had no papa. Full of pride, he attempted for some
      moments to struggle against the tears which were choking him. He had a
      feeling of suffocation, and then without any sound he commenced to weep,
      with great shaking sobs. A ferocious joy broke out among his enemies, and,
      with one accord, just like savages in their fearful festivals, they took
      each other by the hand and danced round him in a circle, repeating as a
      refrain:

But suddenly Simon ceased sobbing. He became ferocious. There were stones
      under his feet; he picked them up and with all his strength hurled them at
      his tormentors. Two or three were struck and rushed off yelling, and so
      formidable did he appear that the rest became panic-stricken. Cowards, as
      the mob always is in presence of an exasperated man, they broke up and
      fled. Left alone, the little fellow without a father set off running
      toward the fields, for a recollection had been awakened in him which
      determined his soul to a great resolve. He made up his mind to drown
      himself in the river.

He remembered, in fact, that eight days before, a poor devil who begged
      for his livelihood had thrown himself into the water because he had no
      more money. Simon had been there when they fished him out again; and the
      wretched man, who usually seemed to him so miserable, and ugly, had then
      struck him as being so peaceful with his pale cheeks, his long drenched
      beard, and his open eyes full of calm. The bystanders had said:

And Simon wished to drown himself also, because he had no father, just
      like the wretched being who had no money.

He reached the water and watched it flowing. Some fish were sporting
      briskly in the clear stream and occasionally made a little bound and
      caught the flies flying on the surface. He stopped crying in order to
      watch them, for their maneuvers interested him greatly. But, at intervals,
      as in a tempest intervals of calm alternate suddenly with tremendous gusts
      of wind, which snap off the trees and then lose themselves in the horizon,
      this thought would return to him with intense pain:

It was very warm, fine weather. The pleasant sunshine warmed the grass.
      The water shone like a mirror. And Simon enjoyed some minutes of
      happiness, of that languor which follows weeping, and felt inclined to
      fall asleep there upon the grass in the warm sunshine.

A little green frog leaped from under his feet. He endeavored to catch it.
      It escaped him. He followed it and lost it three times in succession. At
      last he caught it by one of its hind legs and began to laugh as he saw the
      efforts the creature made to escape. It gathered itself up on its hind
      legs and then with a violent spring suddenly stretched them out as stiff
      as two bars; while it beat the air with its front legs as though they were
      hands, its round eyes staring in their circle of yellow. It reminded him
      of a toy made of straight slips of wood nailed zigzag one on the other;
      which by a similar movement regulated the movements of the little soldiers
      fastened thereon. Then he thought of his home, and then of his mother,
      and, overcome by sorrow, he again began to weep. A shiver passed over him.
      He knelt down and said his prayers as before going to bed. But he was
      unable to finish them, for tumultuous, violent sobs shook his whole frame.
      He no longer thought, he no longer saw anything around him, and was wholly
      absorbed in crying.

Simon turned round. A tall workman with a beard and black curly hair was
      staring at him good-naturedly. He answered with his eyes and throat full
      of tears:

Then the workman became serious. He had recognized La Blanchotte''s son,
      and, although himself a new arrival in the neighborhood, he had a vague
      idea of her history.

“Well,” said he, “console yourself, my boy, and come
      with me home to your mother. They will give you—a papa.”

And so they started on the way, the big fellow holding the little fellow
      by the hand, and the man smiled, for he was not sorry to see this
      Blanchotte, who was, it was said, one of the prettiest girls of the
      countryside, and, perhaps, he was saying to himself, at the bottom of his
      heart, that a lass who had erred might very well err again.

A woman appeared, and the workman instantly left off smiling, for he saw
      at once that there was no fooling to be done with the tall pale girl who
      stood austerely at her door as though to defend from one man the threshold
      of that house where she had already been betrayed by another. Intimidated,
      his cap in his hand, he stammered out:

“No, mamma, I wished to drown myself, because the others had beaten
      me —had beaten me—because I have no papa.”

A burning redness covered the young woman''s cheeks; and, hurt to the
      quick, she embraced her child passionately, while the tears coursed down
      her face. The man, much moved, stood there, not knowing how to get away.

A deep silence ensued. La Blanchotte, dumb and tortured with shame, leaned
      herself against the wall, both her hands upon her heart. The child, seeing
      that no answer was made him, replied:

“What is your name,” went on the child, “so that I may
      tell the others when they wish to know your name?”

Simon was silent a moment so that he might get the name well into his
      head; then he stretched out his arms, quite consoled, as he said:

The workman, lifting him from the ground, kissed him hastily on both
      cheeks, and then walked away very quickly with great strides. When the
      child returned to school next day he was received with a spiteful laugh,
      and at the end of school, when the lads were on the point of recommencing,
      Simon threw these words at their heads as he would have done a stone:
      “He is named Philip, my papa.”

Simon answered nothing; and, immovable in his faith, he defied them with
      his eye, ready to be martyred rather than fly before them. The school
      master came to his rescue and he returned home to his mother.

During three months, the tall workman, Philip, frequently passed by La
      Blanchotte''s house, and sometimes he made bold to speak to her when he saw
      her sewing near the window. She answered him civilly, always sedately,
      never joking with him, nor permitting him to enter her house.
      Notwithstanding, being, like all men, a bit of a coxcomb, he imagined that
      she was often rosier than usual when she chatted with him.

But a lost reputation is so difficult to regain and always remains so
      fragile that, in spite of the shy reserve of La Blanchotte, they already
      gossiped in the neighborhood.

As for Simon he loved his new papa very much, and walked with him nearly
      every evening when the day''s work was done. He went regularly to school,
      and mixed with great dignity with his schoolfellows without ever answering
      them back.

“That can very well be,” exclaimed the urchin with a sneer,
      “but that is not being your papa altogether.”

La Blanchotte''s little one bowed his head and went off dreaming in the
      direction of the forge belonging to old Loizon, where Philip worked. This
      forge was as though buried beneath trees. It was very dark there; the red
      glare of a formidable furnace alone lit up with great flashes five
      blacksmiths; who hammered upon their anvils with a terrible din. They were
      standing enveloped in flame, like demons, their eyes fixed on the red-hot
      iron they were pounding; and their dull ideas rose and fell with their
      hammers.

Simon entered without being noticed, and went quietly to pluck his friend
      by the sleeve. The latter turned round. All at once the work came to a
      standstill, and all the men looked on, very attentive. Then, in the midst
      of this unaccustomed silence, rose the slender pipe of Simon:

No one laughed. Philip remained standing, leaning his forehead upon the
      back of his great hands, which supported the handle of his hammer standing
      upright upon the anvil. He mused. His four companions watched him, and
      Simon, a tiny mite among these giants, anxiously waited. Suddenly, one of
      the smiths, answering to the sentiment of all, said to Philip:

“La Blanchotte is a good, honest girl, and upright and steady in
      spite of her misfortune, and would make a worthy wife for an honest man.”

“Is it the girl''s fault if she went wrong? She had been promised
      marriage; and I know more than one who is much respected to-day, and who
      sinned every bit as much.”

“How hard she has toiled, poor thing, to bring up her child all
      alone, and how she has wept all these years she has never gone out except
      to church, God only knows.”

Then nothing was heard but the bellows which fanned the fire of the
      furnace. Philip hastily bent himself down to Simon:

“Go and tell your mother that I am coming to speak to her this
      evening.” Then he pushed the child out by the shoulders. He returned
      to his work, and with a single blow the five hammers again fell upon their
      anvils. Thus they wrought the iron until nightfall, strong, powerful,
      happy, like contented hammers. But just as the great bell of a cathedral
      resounds upon feast days above the jingling of the other bells, so
      Philip''s hammer, sounding above the rest, clanged second after second with
      a deafening uproar. And he stood amid the flying sparks plying his trade
      vigorously.

The sky was full of stars as he knocked at La Blanchotte''s door. He had on
      his Sunday blouse, a clean shirt, and his beard was trimmed. The young
      woman showed herself upon the threshold, and said in a grieved tone:

No voice replied to him, but he believed that he heard in the shadow of
      the room the sound of a falling body. He entered quickly; and Simon, who
      had gone to bed, distinguished the sound of a kiss and some words that his
      mother murmured softly. Then, all at once, he found himself lifted up by
      the hands of his friend, who, holding him at the length of his herculean
      arms, exclaimed:

“You will tell them, your schoolmates, that your papa is Philip
      Remy, the blacksmith, and that he will pull the ears of all who do you any
      harm.”

On the morrow, when the school was full and lessons were about to begin,
      little Simon stood up, quite pale with trembling lips:

“My papa,” said he in a clear voice, “is Philip Remy,
      the blacksmith, and he has promised to pull the ears of all who does me
      any harm.”

This time no one laughed, for he was very well known, was Philip Remy, the
      blacksmith, and was a papa of whom any one in the world would have been
      proud.

Lemonnier had remained a widower with one child. He had loved his wife
      devotedly, with a tender and exalted love, without a slip, during their
      entire married life. He was a good, honest man, perfectly simple, sincere,
      without suspicion or malice.

He fell in love with a poor neighbor, proposed and was accepted. He was
      making a very comfortable living out of the wholesale cloth business, and
      he did not for a minute suspect that the young girl might have accepted
      him for anything else but himself.

She made him happy. She was everything to him; he only thought of her,
      looked at her continually, with worshiping eyes. During meals he would
      make any number of blunders, in order not to have to take his eyes from
      the beloved face; he would pour the wine in his plate and the water in the
      salt-cellar, then he would laugh like a child, repeating:

She would smile with a calm and resigned look; then she would look away,
      as though embarrassed by the adoration of her husband, and try to make him
      talk about something else; but he would take her hand under the table and
      he would hold it in his, whispering:

For five years they had no children. Then suddenly she announced to him
      that this state of affairs would soon cease. He was wild with joy. He no
      longer left her for a minute, until his old nurse, who had brought him up
      and who often ruled the house, would push him out and close the door
      behind him, in order to compel him to go out in the fresh air.

He had grown very intimate with a young man who had known his wife since
      childhood, and who was one of the prefect''s secretaries. M. Duretour would
      dine three times a week with the Lemonniers, bringing flowers to madame,
      and sometimes a box at the theater; and often, at the end of the dinner,
      Lemonnier, growing tender, turning towards his wife, would explain:
      “With a companion like you and a friend like him, a man is
      completely happy on earth.”

She died in childbirth. The shock almost killed him. But the sight of the
      child, a poor, moaning little creature, gave him courage.

He loved it with a passionate and sorrowful love, with a morbid love in
      which stuck the memory of death, but in which lived something of his
      worship for the dead mother. It was the flesh of his wife, her being
      continued, a sort of quintessence of herself. This child was her very life
      transferred to another body; she had disappeared that it might exist, and
      the father would smother it in with kisses. But also, this child had
      killed her; he had stolen this beloved creature, his life was at the cost
      of hers. And M. Lemonnier would place his son in the cradle and would sit
      down and watch him. He would sit this way by the hour, looking at him,
      dreaming of thousands of things, sweet or sad. Then, when the little one
      was asleep, he would bend over him and sob.

The child grew. The father could no longer spend an hour away from him; he
      would stay near him, take him out for walks, and himself dress him, wash
      him, make him eat. His friend, M. Duretour, also seemed to love the boy;
      he would kiss him wildly, in those frenzies of tenderness which are
      characteristic of parents. He would toss him in his arms, he would trot
      him on his knees, by the hour, and M. Lemonnier, delighted, would mutter:

Celeste, the old nurse, alone, seemed to have no tenderness for the little
      one. She would grow angry at his pranks, and seemed impatient at the
      caresses of the two men. She would exclaim:

Years went by, and Jean was nine years old. He hardly knew how to read; he
      had been so spoiled, and only did as he saw fit. He was willful, stubborn
      and quick-tempered. The father always gave in to him and let him have his
      own way. M. Duretour would always buy him all the toys he wished, and he
      fed him on cake and candies. Then Celeste would grow angry and exclaim:

“It''s a shame, monsieur, a shame. You are spoiling this child. But
      it will have to stop; yes, sir, I tell you it will have to stop, and
      before long, too.”

Jean was delicate, rather. The doctor said that he was anaemic, prescribed
      iron, rare meat and broth.

But the little fellow loved only cake and refused all other nourishment;
      and the father, in despair, stuffed him with cream-puffs and chocolate
      eclairs.

One evening, as they were sitting down to supper, Celeste brought on the
      soup with an air of authority and an assurance which she did not usually
      have. She took off the cover and, dipping the ladle into the dish, she
      declared:

“Here is some broth such as I have never made; the young one will
      have to take some this time.”

The servant took the boy''s plate and poured a spoonful of soup in it. Then
      she retreated a few steps and waited.

Jean smelled the food and pushed his plate away with an expression of
      disgust. Celeste, suddenly pale, quickly stepped forward and forcibly
      poured a spoonful down the child''s open mouth.

He choked, coughed, sneezed, spat; howling, he seized his glass and threw
      it at his nurse. She received it full in the stomach. Then, exasperated,
      she took the young shaver''s head under her arm and began pouring spoonful
      after spoonful of soup down his throat. He grew as red as a beet, and he
      would cough it up, stamping, twisting, choking, beating the air with his
      hands.

At first the father was so surprised that he could not move. Then,
      suddenly, he rushed forward, wild with rage, seized the servant by the
      throat and threw her up against the wall stammering:

But she shook him off, and, her hair streaming down her back, her eyes
      snapping, she cried out:

“What''s gettin'' hold of you? You''re trying to thrash me because I am
      making this child eat soup when you are filling him with sweet stuff!”

“Ah!—you think-you think that you can treat me like that? Oh!
      no. And for whom?—for that brat who is not even yours. No, not
      yours! No, not yours—not yours! Everybody knows it, except yourself!
      Ask the grocer, the butcher, the baker, all of them, any one of them!”

He was motionless livid, his arms hanging by his sides. After a short
      pause, he murmured in a faint, shaky voice, instinct with deep feeling:

He seized her and, with the fury of a beast, he tried to throw her down.
      But, although old, she was strong and nimble. She slipped under his arm,
      and running around the table once more furious, she screamed:

“Look at him, just look at him, fool that you are! Isn''t he the
      living image of M. Durefour? just look at his nose and his eyes! Are yours
      like that? And his hair! Is it like his mother''s? I tell you that everyone
      knows it, everyone except yourself! It''s the joke of the town! Look at
      him!”

At the end of an hour, she returned gently, to see how matters stood. The
      child, after doing away with all the cakes and a pitcher full of cream and
      one of syrup, was now emptying the jam-pot with his soup-spoon.

Celeste took the child, kissed him, and gently carried him to his room and
      put him to bed. She came back to the dining-room, cleared the table, put
      everything in place, feeling very uneasy all the time.

Not a single sound could be heard throughout the house. She put her ear
      against her master''s door. He seemed to be per' WHERE id = '6b5a5bab-cb6d-4c60-9071-cb95b01bf8ca';
