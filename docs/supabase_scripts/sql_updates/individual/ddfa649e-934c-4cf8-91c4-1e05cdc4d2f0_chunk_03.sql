UPDATE stories SET original_text = original_text || 'said Nastia. "I belong to you and
not to your father. You have not quarrelled with young Berestoff yet.
Let the old people fight if they please."

"I would rather tell you in proper order. We were just in time for
dinner; the room was quite full. There were the Zaharievskys, the
steward''s wife and daughters, the Shlupinskys——"

"Wait a bit. We sat down to dinner. The steward''s wife had the seat of
honour; I sat next to her, and her daughters were huffy; but what do I
care!"

"How impatient you are! Well, then we rose from table—we had been
sitting for about three hours and it was a splendid dinner-party,
blue, red and striped creams—then we went into the garden to play at
kiss-in-the-ring when the young gentleman appeared."

"Really! I thought his face was pale. Well, how did he strike you—Was
he melancholy and thoughtful?"

"Oh, no! I never saw such a mad fellow. He took it into his head to
join us at kiss-in-the-ring." "He played at kiss-in-the-ring! It is
impossible."

"No, it''s very possible; and what more do you think? When he caught any
one he kissed her." "Of course you may tell lies if you like, Nastia."

"As you please, miss, only I am not lying. I could scarcely get away
from him. Indeed he spent the whole day with us."

"I am sure I don''t know, miss. He looked too much at me and Tania too,
the steward''s daughter, and at Pasha too. In fact, he neglected nobody.
He is such a wild fellow!"

"They say he is a splendid gentleman—so kind, so lively! He has only
one fault: he is too fond of the girls. But I don''t think that is such
a great fault. He will get steadier in time."

"And why can''t you? Tugilovo is only a mile off. Take a walk in that
direction, or a ride, and you are sure to meet him. He shoulders his
gun and goes shooting every morning."

"No, it would never do. He would think I was running after him.
Besides, our fathers have quarrelled, so he and I could hardly set up
a friendship. Oh, Nastia! I know what I''ll do. I will dress up like a
peasant."

"That will do. Put on a coarse chemise and a sarafan, and set out
boldly for Tugilovo. Berestoff will never miss you I promise you."

"I can talk like a peasant splendidly. Oh, Nastia, dear Nastia, what
a happy thought!" and Lisa went to bed resolved to carry out her
plan. Next day she made her preparations. She went to the market for
some coarse linen, some dark blue stuff, and some brass buttons, and
out of these Nastia and she cut a chemise and a sarafan. All the
maid-servants were set down to sew, and by evening everything was
ready.

As she tried on her new costume before the glass, Lisa said to herself
that she had never looked so nice. Then she began to rehearse her
meeting with Alexis. First she gave him a low bow as she passed along,
then she continued to nod her head like a mandarin. Next she addressed
him in a peasant patois, simpering and shyly hiding her face behind
her sleeve. Nastia gave the performance her full approval. But there
was one difficulty. She tried to cross the yard barefooted, but the
grass stalks pricked her tender feet and the gravel caused intolerable
pain. Nastia again came to the rescue.

She took the measure of Lisa''s foot and hurried across the fields to
the herdsman Trophim, of whom she ordered a pair of bark shoes.

The next morning before daylight Lisa awoke. The whole household was
still asleep. Nastia was at the gate waiting for the herdsman; soon
the sound of his horn drew near, and the village herd straggled past
the Manor gates. After them came Trophim, who, as he passed, handed to
Nastia a little pair of speckled bark shoes, and received a ruble.

Lisa, who had quietly donned her peasant dress, whispered to Nastia
her last instructions about Miss Jackson; then she went through the
kitchen, out of the back door, into the open field, then she began to
run.

Dawn was breaking, and the rows of golden clouds stood like courtiers
waiting for their monarch. The clear sky, the fresh morning air, the
dew, the breeze and singing of the birds filled Lisa''s heart with
child-like joy.

Fearing to meet with some acquaintance, she did nor walk but flew. As
she drew near the wood where lay the boundary of her father''s property
she slackened her pace. It was here she was to meet Alexis. Her heart
beat violently, she knew not why. The terrors of our youthful escapades
are their chief charm.

Lisa stepped forward into the darkness of the wood; its hollow
echoes bade her welcome. Her buoyant spirits gradually gave place to
meditation. She thought—but who shall truly tell the thoughts of sweet
seventeen in a wood, alone, at six o''clock on a spring morning?

And as she walked in meditation under the shade of lofty trees,
suddenly a beautiful pointer began to bark at her. Lisa cried out with
fear, and at the same moment a voice exclaimed, "Tout beau Shogar,
ici," and a young sportsman stepped from behind the bushes. "Don''t be
afraid, my dear, he won''t bite."

"It''s all very well, sir," she said, with assumed timidity and shyness,
"I am afraid of him, he[Pg 165] seems such a savage creature, and may fly at
me again."

Alexis, whom the reader has already recognised, looked steadily at the
young peasant. "I will escort you, if you are afraid; will you allow me
to walk by your side?"

"From Prilutchina; I am the daughter of Yassili, the blacksmith, and I
am looking for mushrooms." She was carrying a basket suspended from her
shoulders by a cord.

"Exactly, I am the young gentleman''s valet" (he wished to equalize
their ranks). But Lisa looked at him and laughed.

"How can one help it. You are not dressed like a servant. You speak
differently. You even call your dog in a foreign tongue."

Lisa charmed him more and more every moment. Accustomed to be
unceremonious with pretty country girls, he tried to kiss her, but
Lisa[Pg 166] jumped aside, and suddenly assumed so distant and severe an air
that though it amused him he did not attempt any further familiarities.

"Who has taught you this wisdom?" asked Alexis, with a laugh. "Can
it be my little friend Nastia, your mistress''s maid? So this is how
civilization spreads."

Lisa felt she had almost betrayed herself, and said, "Do you think I
have never been up to the Manor House? I have seen and heard more than
you think. Still, chattering here with you won''t get me mushrooms. You
go that way, barin; I''ll go the other, begging your pardon;" and Lisa
made as if to depart, but Alexis held her by the hand.

"Akulina," she said, struggling to get her fingers free. "Let me go,
barin, it is time for me to be home."

"For the Lord''s sake don''t do that. If they knew at home I had been
talking here alone with the young barin, I should catch it. My father
would beat me within an inch of my life."

"My dear Akulina, I would kiss you if I dared. To-morrow, then, at the
same time; that is a bargain."

The young couple parted. Lisa ran out of the wood across the fields,
stole into the garden, and rushed headlong into the farmyard, where
Nastia was waiting for her. Then she changed her dress, answering at
random the impatient questions of her confidante, and went into the
dining-room to find the cloth laid and breakfast ready. Miss Jackson,
freshly powdered and Jaced, until she looked like a wine glass, was
cutting thin slices of bread and butter. Her father complimented Lisa
on her early walk.

"There is no healthier habit," he remarked, "than to rise at daybreak."
He quoted from the English papers several cases of longevity, adding
that all centenarians had abstained from spirits, and made it a
practice to rise at daybreak winter and summer. Lisa did not prove
an attentive listener. She was repeating in her mind the details of
her morning''s interview, and as she recalled[Pg 168] Akulina''s conversation
with the young sportsman her conscience smote her. In vain she assured
herself that the bounds of decorum had not been passed. This joke, she
argued, could have no evil consequences, but conscience would not be
quieted. What most disturbed her was her promise to repeat the meeting.
She half decided not to keep her word, but then Alexis, tired of
waiting, might go to seek the blacksmiths daughter in the village and
find the real Akulina—a stout, pockmarked girl—and so discover the
hoax. Alarmed at this she determined to re-enact the part of Akulina.
Alexis was enchanted. All day he thought about his new acquaintance
and at night he dreamt of her. It was scarcely dawn when he was up and
dressed. Without waiting even to load his gun he set out followed by
the faithful Shogar, and ran to the meeting place. Half an hour passed
in undeniable delay. At last he caught a glimpse of a blue sarafan
among the bushes and rushed to meet dear Akulina. She smiled to see his
eagerness; but he saw traces of anxiety and melancholy on her face. He
asked her the cause, and she at last confessed. She had been flighty
and was very sorry for it. She had meant not to keep her promise, and
this meeting at any rate must be the last. She begged him not to seek
to continue an acquaintance which could have no good end. All this,
of course, was said[Pg 169] in peasant dialect; but the thought and feeling
struck Alexis as unusual in a peasant. In eloquent words he urged
her to abandon this cruel resolution. She should have no reason for
repentance; he would obey her in everything, if only she would not rob
him of his one happiness and let him see her alone three times or even
only twice a week. He spoke with passion, and at the moment he was
really in love. Lisa listened to him in silence.

They parted; and Alexis was left to wonder how in two meetings a simple
rustic had gained such influence over him. There was a freshness and
novelty about it all that charmed him, and though the conditions
she imposed were irksome, the thought of breaking his promise never
even entered his mind. After all, in spite of his fatal ring and the
mysterious correspondence, Alexis was a kind and affectionate youth,
with a pure heart still capable of innocent enjoyment. Did I[Pg 170] consult
only my own wishes I should dwell at length on the meetings of these
young people, their growing love, their mutual trust, and all they did
and all they said. But my pleasure I know would not be shared by the
majority of my readers; so for their sake I will omit them. I will
only say that in a brief two months Alexis was already madly in love,
and Lisa, though more reticent than he was, not indifferent. Happy
in the present they took little thought for the future. Visions of
indissoluble ties flitted not seldom through the minds of both. But
neither mentioned them. For Alexis, however strong his attachment to
Akulina, could not forget the social distance that was between them,
while Lisa, knowing the enmity between their fathers, dared not count
on their becoming reconciled. Besides, her vanity was stimulated by the
vague romantic hope of at last seeing the lord of Tugilovo at the feet
of the daughter of a village blacksmith. Suddenly something happened
which came near to change the course of their true love. One of those
cold bright mornings so common in our Russian autumns Ivan Berestoff
came a-riding. For all emergencies he brought with him six pointers
and a dozen beaters. That same morning Grigori Muromsky, tempted by
the fine weather, saddled his English mare and came trotting through
his agricultural estates. Nearing the[Pg 171] wood he came upon his neighbour
proudly seated in the saddle wearing his fur-lined overcoat. Ivan
Berestoff was waiting for the hare which the beaters were driving with
discordant noises out of the brushwood. If Muromsky could have foreseen
this meeting he would have avoided it. But finding himself suddenly
within pistol-shot there was no escape. Like a cultivated European
gentleman, Muromsky rode up to and addressed his enemy politely.
Berestoff answered with the grace of a chained bear dancing to the
order of his keeper. At this moment out shot the hare and scudded
across the field. Berestoff and his groom shouted to loose the dogs,
and started after them full speed. Muromsky''s mare took fright and
bolted. Her rider, who often boasted of his horsemanship, gave her
her head and chuckled inwardly over this opportunity of escaping a
disagreeable companion. But the mare coming at a gallop to an unseen
ditch swerved. Muromsky lost his seat, fell rather heavily on the
frozen ground, and lay there cursing the animal, which, sobered by the
loss of her master, stopped at once. Berestoff galloped to the rescue,
asking if Muromsky was hurt. Meanwhile the groom led up the culprit by
the bridle. Berestoff helped Muromsky into the saddle and then invited
him to his house. Peeling himself under an obligation Muromsky could
not refuse, and so Berestoff returned in[Pg 172] glory, having killed the hare
and bringing home with him his adversary wounded and almost a prisoner
of war.

At breakfast the neighbours fell into rather friendly conversation;
Muromsky asked Berestoff to lend him a droshky, confessing that his
fall made it too painful for him to ride back. Berestoff accompanied
him to the outer gate, and before the leavetaking was over Muromsky
Pad obtained from him a promise to come and bring Alexis to a friendly
dinner at Prelutchina next day. So this old enmity which seemed before
so deeply rooted was on the point of ending because the little mare had
taken fright.

"What has happened, papa?" she asked in astonishment. "Why are you
limping? Where is the mare? Whose droshki is this?"

Lisa could not believe Per ears. Before she Pad time to collect herself
she heard that to-morrow both the Berestoffs would come to dinner.

"What do you say?" she exclaimed, turning pale. "The Berestoffs, father
and son! Dine with us to-morrow! No, papa, you can do as you please, I
certainly do not appear."

"Why? Are you mad? Since when have you[Pg 173] become so shy? Have you imbibed
hereditary hatred like a heroine of romance? Come, don''t be afoot."

Her father shrugged his shoulders, and left off arguing. He knew he
could not prevail with her by opposition, so he went to bed after his
memorable ride. Lisa, too, went to her room, and summoned Nastia.
Long did they discuss the coming visit. What will Alexis think on
recognising in the cultivated young lady his Akulina? What opinion will
he form as to her behaviour and her sense? On the other hand, Lisa was
very curious to see how such an unexpected meeting would affect him.
Then an idea struck her. She told it to Nastia, and with rejoicing they
determined to carry it into effect.

Next morning at breakfast Muromsky asked his daughter whether she still
meant to hide from the Berestoffs.

"Papa," she answered, "I will receive them if you wish it, on one
condition. However I may appear before them, whatever I may do, you
must promise me not to be angry, and you must show no surprise or
disapproval."

"At your tricks again!" exclaimed Muromsky, laughing. "Well, well, I
consent; do as you please, my black-eyed mischief."[Pg 174] With these words
he kissed her forehead, and Lisa ran off to make her preparations.

Punctually at two, six horses, drawing the home-made carriage, drove
into the courtyard, and skirted the circle of green turf that formed
its centre.

Old Berestoff, helped by two of Muromsky''s servants in livery, mounted
the steps. His son followed immediately on horseback, and the two
together entered the dining-room, where the table was already laid.

Muromsky gave his guests a cordial welcome, and proposing a tour of
inspection of the garden and live stock before dinner, led them along
his well-swept gravel paths.

Old Berestoff secretly deplored the time and trouble wasted on such a
useless whim as this Anglo-mania, but politeness forbade him to express
his feelings.

His son shared neither the disapproval of the careful farmer, nor the
enthusiasm of the complacent Anglo-maniac. He impatiently awaited the
appearance of his hosts daughter, of whom he had often heard; for,
though his heart as we know was no longer free, a young and unknown
beauty might still claim his interest.

When they had come back and were all seated in the drawing-room,
the old men talked over bygone days, re-telling the stories of the
mess-room,[Pg 175] while Alexis considered what attitude he should assume
towards Lisa. He decided upon a cold preoccupation as most suitable,
and arranged accordingly.

The door opened, he turned his head round with indifference—with such
proud indifference—that the heart of the most hardened coquette must
have quivered. Unfortunately there came in not Lisa but elderly Miss
Jackson, whitened, laced in, with downcast eyes and her little curtsey,
and Alexis'' magnificent military movement failed. Before he could
reassemble his scattered forces the door opened again and this time
entered Lisa. All rose, Muromsky began the introductions, but suddenly
stopped and bit his lip. Lisa, his dark Lisa, was painted white up
to her ears, and pencilled worse than Miss Jackson herself. She wore
false fair ringlets, puffed out like a Louis XIV. wig; her sleeves Ã 
l''imbÃ©cille extended like the hoops of Madame de Pompadour. Her figure
was laced in like a letter X, and all those of her mother''s diamonds
which had escaped the pawnbroker sparkled on her fingers, neck, and
ears. Alexis could not discover in this ridiculous young lady his
Akulina. His father kissed her hand, and he, much to his annoyance,
had to do the same. As he touched her little white fingers they seemed
to tremble. He noticed, too, a tiny foot intentionally displayed and
shod in the most coquettish of[Pg 176] shoes. This reconciled him a little to
the rest of her attire. The white paint and black pencilling—to tell
the truth—in his simplicity he did not notice at first, nor indeed
afterwards.

Grigori Muromsky, remembering his promise, tried not to show surprise;
for the rest, he was so much amused at his daughter''s mischief, that
he could scarcely keep his countenance. For the prim Englishwoman,
however, it was no laughing matter. She guessed that the white and
black paint had been abstracted from her drawer, and a red patch of
indignation shone through the artificial whiteness of her face. Flaming
glances shot from her eyes at the young rogue, who, reserving all
explanation for the future, pretended not to notice them. They sat down
to table, Alexis continuing his performance as an absent-minded pensive
man. Lisa was all affectation. She minced her words, drawled, and would
speak only in French. Her father glanced at her from time to time,
unable to divine her object, but he thought it all a great joke. The
Englishwoman fumed, but said nothing. Ivan Berestoff alone felt at his
ease. He ate for two, drank his fill, and as the meal went on became
more and more friendly, and laughed louder and louder.

At last they rose from the table. The guests departed and Muromsky gave
vent to his mirth and curiosity.

"What made you play such tricks upon them?" he inquired. "Do you know,
Lisa, that white paint really becomes you? I do not wish to pry into
the secrets of a lady''s toilet, but if I were you I should always
paint, not too much, of course, but a little."

Lisa was delighted with her success. She kissed her father, promised
to consider his suggestion, and ran off to propitiate the enraged Miss
Jackson, whom she could scarcely prevail upon to open the door and hear
her excuses.

Lisa was ashamed, she said, to show herself before the visitors—such a
blackamoor. She had not dared to ask; she knew dear kind Miss Jackson
would forgive her.

Miss Jackson, persuaded that her pupil had not meant to ridicule her,
became pacified, kissed Lisa, and in token of forgiveness presented her
with a little pot of English white, which the latter, with expressions
of deep gratitude, accepted.

"You were yesterday at our master''s, sir?" she began to Alexis. "What
did you think of our young lady?"

"Oh! barin, it is a sin of you to say so. Our young lady is so fair,
so elegant! How can I vie with her?"

Alexis vowed that she was prettier than all imaginable fair young
ladies, and to appease her thoroughly, began describing her young lady
so funnily that Lisa burst into a hearty laugh.

"Still," she said, with a sigh, "though she may be ridiculous, yet by
her side I am an illiterate fool."

They sat down. Alexis produced a pencil and note-book, and Akulina
proved astonishingly quick in learning the alphabet. Alexis wondered at
her intelligence. At their next meeting she wished to learn to write.
The pencil at first would not obey her, but in a few minutes she could
trace the letters pretty well.

Indeed, at the third lesson Akulina could read words of even three
syllables, and the intelligent remarks with which she interrupted the
lessons fairly astonished Alexis. As for writing she covered a whole
page with aphorisms, taken from the story she had been reading. A week
passed and they had begun a correspondence. Their post-office was the
trunk of an old oak, and Nastia secretly played the part of postman.
Thither Alexis would bring his letters, written in a large round hand,
and there he found the letters of his beloved scrawled on coarse blue
paper. Akulina''s style was evidently improving, and her mind clearly
was developing under cultivation.

Meanwhile the new-made acquaintance between Berestoff and Muromsky
grew stronger, soon it became friendship. Muromsky often reflected
that on the death of old Berestoff his property would come to Alexis,
who would then be one of the richest landowners in that province. Why
should he not marry Lisa? Old Berestoff, on the other hand, though he
looked on his neighbour as a lunatic, did not deny that he possessed
many excellent qualities, among them a certain cleverness. Muromsky
was related to Count Pronsky, a distinguished and influential man.
The count might be very useful to Alexis, and Muromsky[Pg 180] (so thought
Berestoff) would probably be glad to marry his daughter so well. Both
the old men pondered all this so thoroughly that at last they broached
the subject, confabulated, embraced, and severally began a plan of
campaign. Muromsky foresaw one difficulty—how to persuade his Betty to
make the better acquaintance of Alexis, whom she had never seen since
the memorable dinner. They hardly seemed to suit each other well. At
any rate Alexis had not renewed his visit to Prelutchina. Whenever old
Berestoff called Lisa made a point of retreating to her own room.

"But," thought Muromsky, "if Alexis called every day Betty could not
help falling in love with him. That is the way to manage it. Time will
settle everything."

Berestoff troubled himself less about his plans. That same evening
he called his son into his study, lit his pipe, and, after a short
silence, began:

"You have not spoken about the army lately, Alexis. Has the Hussar
uniform lost its attraction for you?"

"No, father," he replied respectfully. "I know you do not wish me to
join the Hussars. It is my duty to consult your wishes."

"I am pleased to find you such an obedient son, still I do not wish
to force your inclinations.[Pg 181] I will not insist upon your entering the
Civil Service at once; and in the meantime I mean to marry you."

"You need not trouble yourself about that. All you have to do is to
respect the wishes of your father."

"You shall marry or I will curse you; and, by Heaven, I will sell and
squander my property, and not leave you a farthing! I will give you
three days for reflection, and, in the meanwhile, do not dare to show
your face in my presence."

Alexis knew that when his father took a thing into his head nothing
could knock it out again; but then Alexis was as obstinate as his
father.[Pg 182] He went to his room and there reflected upon the limits of
parental authority, on Lisa Muromskaia, his father''s threat to make him
a beggar, and finally he thought of Akulina.

For the first time he clearly saw how much he loved her. The romantic
idea of marrying a peasant girl and working for a living came into his
mind; and the more he thought of it, the more he approved it. Their
meetings in the wood had been stopped of late by the wet weather.

He wrote to Akulina in the roundest hand and the maddest style, telling
her of his impending ruin, and asking her to be his wife. He took
the letter at once to the tree trunk, dropped it in, and went much
satisfied with himself to bed.

Next morning, firm in resolution, he started early to call on Muromsky
and explain the situation. He meant to win him over by appealing to his
generosity.

"It will soon be over," he thought, going towards the drawing-room.
"I will explain to Miss Muromsky herself." He entered ... and was
transfixed. Lisa!... no, Akulina, dear, dark Akulina, wearing no
sarafan but a white morning frock, sat by the window reading his
letter. So intent was she upon it that she did not hear him enter.
Alexis could not repress a cry of delight. Lisa started, raised her
hand, cried out, and attempted to run away. He rushed to stop her.
"Akulina! Akulina!" Lisa tried to free herself.

Miss Jackson, who was an eye-witness of this scene, knew not what to
think. The door opened and Grigori Muromsky entered.

Kirdjali with his depredations brought terror upon the whole of
Moldavia. To give some idea of him I will relate one of his exploits.
One night he and the Arnout Michailaki fell together upon a Bulgarian
village. They set fire to it from both ends and went from hut to hut,
Kirdjali killing, while Michailaki carried off the plunder. Both cried,
"Kirdjali! Kirdjali!" and the whole village ran.

When Alexander Ipsilanti proclaimed the insurrection and began raising
his army, Kirdjali brought him several of his old followers. They
knew little of the real object of the hetairi. But war presented an
opportunity for getting rich at the expense of the Turks, and perhaps
of the Moldavians too.

Alexander Ipsilanti was personally brave, but[Pg 185] he was wanting in
the qualities necessary for playing the part he had with such eager
recklessness assumed. He did not know how to manage the people under
his command. They had neither respect for him nor confidence.

After the unfortunate battle, when the flower of Greek youth fell,
Jordaki Olimbisti advised him to retire, and himself took his place.
Ipsilanti escaped to the frontiers of Austria, whence he sent his
curse to the people whom he now stigmatised as mutineers, cowards, and
blackguards. These cowards and blackguards mostly perished within the
walls of the monastery of Seke, or on the banks of the Pruth, defending
themselves desperately against a foe ten times their number.

Kirdjali belonged to the detachment commanded by George CantacuzÃ¨ne, of
whom might be repeated what has already been said of Ipsilanti.

On the eve of the battle near Skuliana, CantacuzÃ¨ne asked permission
of the Russian authorities to enter their quarters. The band was left
without a commander. But Kirdjali, Sophianos, Cantagoni, and others had
no need of a commander.

The battle of Skuliana seems not to have been described by any one in
all its pathetic truth. Just imagine seven hundred Arnouts, Albanians,
Greeks, Bulgarians, and every kind of rabble, with no notion of
military art, retreating within[Pg 186] sight of fifteen thousand Turkish
cavalry. The band kept close to the banks of the Pruth, placing in
front two tiny cannons, found at Jassy, in the courtyard of the
Hospodar, and which had formerly been used for firing salutes on
festive occasions.

The Turks would have been glad to use their cartridges, but dared not
without permission from the Russian authorities; for the shots would
have been sure to fly over to our banks. The commander of the Russian
military post (now dead), though he had been forty years in the army,
had never heard the whistle of a bullet; but he was fated to hear it
now. Several bullets buzzed passed his ears. The old man got very angry
and began to swear at Ohotsky, major of one of the infantry battalions.
The major, not knowing what to do, ran towards the river, on the other
side of which some insurgent cavalry were capering about. He shook his
finger at them, on which they turned round and galloped along, with
the whole Turkish army after them. The major who had shaken his finger
was called Hortchevsky. I don''t know what became of him. The next day,
however, the Turks attacked the Arnouts. Hot daring to use cartridges
or cannon balls, they resolved, contrary to their custom, to employ
cold steel. The battle was fierce. The combatants slashed and stabbed
one another.

The Turks were seen with lances, which, hitherto they had never
possessed, and these lances were Russian. Our Nekrassoff refugees were
fighting in their ranks. The hetairi, thanks to the permission of our
Emperor, were allowed to cross the Pruth and seek the protection of our
garrison. They began to cross the river, Cantagoni and Sophianos being
the last to quit the Turkish bank; Kirdjali, wounded the day before,
was already lying in Russian quarters. Sophianos was killed. Cantagoni,
a very stout man, was wounded with a spear in his stomach. With one
hand he raised his sword, with the other he seized the enemy''s spear,
pushed it deeper into himself, and by that means was able to reach his
murderer with his own sword, when they fell together.

All was over. The Turks remained victorious, Moldavia was cleared of
insurgents. About six hundred Arnouts were scattered over Bessarabia.
Unable to obtain the means of subsistence, they still felt grateful
to Russia for her protection. They led an idle though not a dissolute
life. They could be seen in coffee-houses of half Turkish Bessarabia,
with long pipes in their mouths sipping thick coffee out of small cups.
Their figured Zouave jackets and red slippers with pointed toes were
beginning to look shabby. But they still wore their tufted scull-cap
on one side of the head; and daggers and pistols still[Pg 188] protruded
from beneath, their broad girdles. No one complained of them. It
was impossible to imagine that these poor, peaceable fellows were
the celebrated pikemen of Moldavia, the followers of the ferocious
Kirdjali, and that he himself had been one of them.

The Pasha governing Jassy heard of all this, and, on the basis of
treaty rights, requested the Russian authorities to deliver up the
brigand. The police made inquiries, and found that Kirdjali really was
at Kishineff. They captured him in the house of a runaway monk in the
evening, while he was at supper, sitting in the twilight with seven
comrades.

"But," he added, "since I crossed the Pruth, I have not touched a
hair of property that did not belong to me, nor have I cheated the
meanest gipsy. To the Turks, the Moldavians, and the Walachians I am
certainly a brigand, but to the Russians a guest. When Sophianos, after
exhausting all his cartridges, came over here, he collected buttons
from the uniforms, nails, watch-chains, and nobs from the daggers for
the final discharge, and I myself handed him twenty beshlÃ©ks to fire
off, leaving myself without money. God is my witness that I, Kirdjali,
lived by[Pg 189] charity. Why then do the Russians now hand me over to my
enemies?"

After that Kirdjali was silent, and quietly awaited his fate. It was
soon announced to him. The authorities, not thinking themselves hound
to look upon brigandage from its romantic side, and admitting the
justice of the Turkish demand, ordered Kirdjali to be given up that he
might be sent to Jassy.

A man of brains and feeling, at that time young and unknown, but
now occupying an important post, gave me a graphic description of
Kirdjali''s departure.

"At the gates of the prison," he said, "stood a hired karutsa.
Perhaps you don''t know what a karutsa is? It is a low
basket-carriage, to which quite recently used to be harnessed six or
eight miserable screws. A Moldavian, with a moustache and a sheepskin
hat, sitting astride one of the horses, cried out and cracked his whip
every moment, and his wretched little beasts went on at a sharp trot.
If one of them began to lag, then he unharnessed it with terrific
cursing and left it on the road, not caring what became of it. On the
return journey he was sure to find them in the same place, calmly
grazing on the steppes. Frequently a traveller starting from a station
with eight horses would arrive at the next with a pair only. It was
so about fifteen years ago. Now in[Pg 190] Russianized Bessarabia, Russian
harness and Russian telegas (carts) have been adopted.

"Such a karutsa as I have described stood at the gate of the jail in
1821, towards the end of September. Jewesses with their sleeves hanging
down and with flapping slippers, Arnouts in ragged but picturesque
costumes, stately Moldavian women with black-eyed children in their
arms, surrounded the harutsa. The men maintained silence. The women
were excited, as if expecting something to happen.

"The gates opened, and several police officers stepped into the street,
followed by two soldiers leading Kirdjali in chains.

"He looked about thirty. The features of his dark face were regular and
austere. He was tall, broad-shouldered, and seemed to possess great
physical strength. He wore a variegated turban on the side of his head,
and a broad sash round his slender waist. A dolman of thick, dark blue
cloth, the wide plaits of his over-shirt falling just above the knees,
and a pair of handsome slippers completed his dress. His bearing was
calm and haughty.

"One of the officials, a red-faced old man in a faded uniform, with
three buttons hanging loose, a pair of lead spectacles which pinched
a crimson knob doing duty for a nose, unrolled a paper, and stooping,
began to read in the Moldavian tongue.[Pg 191] From time to time he glanced
haughtily at the handcuffed Kirdjali, to whom apparently the document
referred. Kirdjali listened attentively. The official finished his
reading, folded the paper, and called out sternly to the people,
ordering them to make way for the karutsa to drive up. Then Kirdjali,
turning towards him, said a few words in Moldavian; his voice trembled,
his countenance changed, he burst into tears, and fell at the feet of
the police officer, with a clanking of his chains. The police officer,
in alarm, started back; the soldiers were going to raise Kirdjali, but
he got up of his own accord, gathered up his chains, and stepping into
the harutsa, cried egaida!''

"He asked me," replied the officer, smiling, "to take care of his
wife and child, who live a short distance from Kilia, in a Bulgarian
village; he is afraid they might suffer through him. The rabble are so
ignorant!''"

The young official''s story affected me greatly. I was sorry for poor
Kirdjali. For a long while I knew nothing of his fate. Many years
afterwards I met the young official. We began talking of old times.

After being brought to Jassy, Kirdjali was taken before the Pasha,
who condemned him to be impaled. The execution was postponed till
some feast day. Meanwhile he was put in confinement. The prisoner was
guarded by seven Turks—common people, and at the bottom of their
hearts brigands like himself. They respected him and listened with
the eagerness of true orientals to his wonderful stories. Between the
guards and their prisoner a close friendship sprang up. On one occasion
Kirdjali said to them:

"Brothers! My hour is near. No one can escape his doom. I shall soon
part from you, and I should like to leave you something in remembrance
of me." The Turks opened their ears.

"Brothers;" added Kirdjali, "three years back, when I was engaged in
brigandage with the late Mihailaki, we buried in the Steppes, not far
from Jassy, a kettle with some coins in it. Seemingly, neither he nor
I will ever possess that treasure. So be it; take it to yourselves and
divide it amicably."

The Turks nearly went crazy. They began considering how they could find
the spot so vaguely[Pg 193] indicated. They thought and thought, and at last
decided that Kirdjali must himself show them.

Night set in. The Turks took off the fetters that weighed upon the
prisoner''s feet, hound his hands with a rope, and taking him with them,
started for the Steppes. Kirdjali led them, going in a straight line
from one mound to another. They walked about for some time. At last
Kirdjali stopped close to a broad stone, measured a dozen steps to the
south, stamped, and said, "Here."

The Turks arranged themselves for work. Four took out their daggers and
began digging the earth, while three remained on guard. Kirdjali sat
down on the stone, and looked on.

"Not yet," replied the Turks, and they worked away till the
perspiration rolled like hail from them.

"What people!" he exclaimed; "they can''t even dig decently. Why, I
should have found it in two minutes. Children! Untie my hands, and give
me a dagger."

"Why not?" they concluded. "We will release his hands, and give him a
dagger. What can it matter? He is only one, while we are seven."

At last Kirdjali was free and armed. What must have been his
sensations. He began digging rapidly, the guard assisting. Suddenly he
thrust his dagger into one of them, leaving the blade sticking in the
man''s breast; he snatched from his girdle a couple of pistols.

Kirdjali is now carrying on his brigandage near Jassy. Not long ago
he wrote to the Hospodar, demanding from him five thousand louis, and
threatening, in the event of the money not being paid, to set fire to
Jassy, and to reach the Hospodar himself. The five thousand louis were
forwarded to him.

My parents, respectable but humble folk, had been brought up in the old
fashion. They never read anything; and beyond an alphabet (bought for
me), an almanack, and the latest letter-writer, they had no books in
the house.

The letter-writer had long provided me with entertainment. I knew it by
heart, yet daily found in it fresh beauties; and next to General N——,
to whom my father had been aide-de-camp, Kurganoff, its author, was,
in my estimation, one of the greatest men. I questioned everyone about
him; but unhappily no one could gratify my curiosity. Nobody knew him
personally. To all my questioning the reply was that Kurganoff was the
author of the latest letter-writer, but that I[Pg 196] knew already. He was
wrapped in darkness and mystery like some ancient demi-god. At times
I doubted even his existence. His name was perhaps an invention, the
legend about him an empty myth awaiting the investigation of some
new Niebuhr. Nevertheless he dogged my imagination. I tried to give
some form to this very personage, and finally decided that he must be
like the land-judge, Koriuchkin, a little old man with a red nose and
glittering eyes.

In 1812 I was taken to Moscow and placed at a boarding school belonging
to Karl Ivanovitch Meyer. There I stayed only some three months,
because the school broke up in anticipation of the enemy''s coming. I
returned to the country.

This epoch of my life was to me so important that I shall dilate upon
it, apologizing beforehand if I trespass upon the good nature of the
reader.

It was a dull autumn day. On reaching the station whence I must turn
off to Gorohina (that was the name of our village) I engaged horses,
and drove off by the country road. Though naturally calm, so impatient
was I to revisit the scenes where I had passed the best years of my
life, that I kept urging the driver to quicken speed with alternate
promises of vodka and threats of chastisement. How much easier it was
to belabour him than to unloose my purse.[Pg 197] I own I struck him twice or
thrice, a thing I had never done in my life before. I don''t know why,
but I had a great liking for drivers as a class.

The driver urged his troika to a quicker pace, but to me it seemed that
public-driver-like he coaxed the horses and waved his whip but at the
same time tightened the reins. At last I caught sight of Gorohina wood,
and in ten minutes more we drove into the courtyard of the manor house.

My heart beat violently. I looked round with unwonted emotion. For
eight years I had not seen Gorohina. The little birches which I had
seen planted near the palings had now grown into tall branching trees.
The courtyard, once adorned with three regular flower beds divided by
broad gravel paths, was now an unmown meadow, the grazing land of a red
cow.

My britchka stopped at the front door. My servant went to open it, but
it was fastened; yet the shutters were open, and the house seemed to be
inhabited. A woman emerging from a servant''s hut asked what I wanted.
Hearing the master had arrived, she ran back into the hut, and soon
I had all the inhabitants of the courtyard around me. I was deeply
touched to see the known and unknown faces, and I greeted each with a
friendly kiss.

The boys my playmates had grown to men. The girls who used to squat
upon the floor and run with such alacrity on errands were married
women. The men wept. To the women I said unceremoniously:

They led me towards the back entrance; I was met by my old
wet-nurse, by whom I was welcomed back with sobs and tears, like the
much-suffering Ulysses. They hastened to heat the bath. The cook, who
in his long holiday had grown a beard, offered to cook my dinner or
supper, for it was growing dark. The rooms hitherto occupied by my
nurse and my late mother''s maids were at once got ready for me. Thus I
found myself in the humble home of my parents, and fell asleep in that
room where three-and-twenty years before I had been born.

Some three weeks passed in business of various kinds. I was engaged
with land judges, presidents, and every imaginable official of the
province. Finally I got possession of my inheritance. I was contented:
but soon the dulness of inaction began to torment me. I was not
yet acquainted with my kind and venerable neighbour N—— Domestic
occupations were altogether[Pg 199] strange to me. The conversation of my
nurse, whom I promoted to the rank of housekeeper, consisted of fifteen
family anecdotes. I found them very interesting, but as she always
related them in the same way she soon became for me another Niebuhr
letter-writer, in which I knew precisely on what page every particular
line occurred. That worthy book I found in the storeroom among a
quantity of rubbish sadly dilapidated. I brought it out into the light
and began to read it; but Kurganoff had lost his charm. I read him
through once more and never after opened him again.

"Why not write myself?" The reader has been already told that I was
educated on copper money. Besides, to become an author seemed so
difficult, so unattainable, that the idea of writing quite frightened
me at first. Dare I hope ever to be numbered amongst writers, when my
ardent wish even to meet one had not yet been gratified? This reminds
me of something which I shall tell to show my unbounded enthusiasm for
my native literature.

In 1820, while yet an ensign, I chanced to be on government business at
Petersburg. I stayed a week; and although I had not one acquaintance
in he place, I passed the time very pleasantly. I went daily to the
theatre, modestly to the fourth[Pg 200] row in the gallery. I learnt the
names of all the actors and fell passionately in love with B——. She
had played one Sunday with great artistic feeling as Eulalie in Hass
und Reue (in English The Stranger.) In the morning, on my way from
headquarters, I would call at a small confectioner''s, drink a cup of
chocolate, and read a literary journal. One day, while thus deep in an
article "by Goodintention, some one in a pea-green greatcoat suddenly
approached and gently withdrew the Hamburg Gazette from under my
newspaper. I was so occupied that I did not look up. The stranger
ordered a steak and sat down facing me. I went on reading without
noticing him.

Meanwhile he finished his luncheon, scolded the waiter for some
carelessness, drank half a bottle of wine, and left. Two young men were
also lunching.

"The writer!" I exclaimed involuntarily, and leaving the article unread
and the cup of chocolate undrunk, I hastily paid my reckoning, and
without waiting for the change rushed into the street. Looking round I
descried in the distance the pea-green coat and dashed along the Nevsky
Prospect almost at a run. When I had gone several steps I[Pg 201] felt myself
stopped by some one, and looking back I found I had been noticed by an
officer of the guards. I; ought not to have knocked against him on the
pavement, but rather to have stopped and saluted. After this reprimand
I was more careful. Unluckily I met an officer every moment, and every
moment I had to stop, while the author got farther and farther away.
Never before had my soldier''s overcoat proved so irksome, never had
epaulettes appeared so enviable. At last near the Annitchkin Bridge I
came up with the pea-green greatcoat.

"May I inquire," I said, saluting, "are you Mr. Goodintention, whose
excellent article I have had the pleasure of reading in the Zealous
Enlightener?"

"Not at all," he replied. "I am not a writer but a lawyer. But I know
Goodintention very well. A quarter of an hour ago I passed him at the
Police Bridge." In this way my respect for Russian letters cost me
80 kopecks of change, an official reprimand, and a narrow escape of
arrest, and all in vain.

In spite of all the protest of my reason, the audacious thought of
becoming a writer kept recurring. At last, unable longer to resist it,
I made a thick copy book and resolved to fill it somehow. All kinds
of poems (humble prose did not yet enter into my reckoning) were in
turn[Pg 202] considered and approved. I decided to write an epic furnished on
Russian history. I was not long in finding a hero. I chose Rurik, and I
set to work.

I had acquired a certain aptitude for rhymes, by copying those in
manuscript which used to circulate among our officers, such as the
criticism on the Moscow Boulevards, the Presnensky Ponds, and the
Dangerous Neighbour. In spite of that my poem progressed slowly,
and at the third verse I dropped it. I concluded that the epic was
not my style, and began Rurik, a Tragedy. The tragedy halted. I
turned it into a ballad, but the ballad hardly seemed to do. At last
I had a happy thought. I began and succeeded in finishing an ode to a
portrait of Rurik. Despite the inauspicious character of such a title,
particularly for a young bard''s first work, I yet felt that I had not
been born a poet, and after this first attempt desisted. These essays
in authorship gave me so great a taste for writing that I could now no
longer abstain from paper and ink. I could descend to prose. But at
first I wished to avoid the preliminary construction of a plot and the
connection of parts. I resolved to write detached thoughts without any
connection or order, just as they struck me. Unfortunately the thoughts
would not come, and in the course of two whole days the only thought
that struck me was the following:

He who disobeys reason and yields to the inclination of his passions
often goes wrong and ends by repenting when it is too late.

Abandoning aphorism I took to tales; but being too unpractised in
arranging incidents I selected such remarkable occurrences as I had
heard of at various times and tried to ornament the truth by a lively
style and the flowers of my own imagination. Composing these tales
little by little, I formed my style and learnt to express myself
correctly, pleasantly, and freely. My stock was soon exhausted, and I
again began to seek a subject.

To abandon these childish anecdotes of doubtful authenticity, and
narrate real and great events instead, was an idea by which I had long
been haunted.

To be the judge, the observer, and the prophet of ages and of peoples
seemed to me a most attainable object of ambition to a writer. What
history could I write—I with my pitiable education? Where was I not
forestalled by highly cultivated and conscientious men? What history
had they left unexhausted. Should I write a universal history? But was
there not already the immortal work of AbbÃ© Millot. A national history
of Russia, what could I say after Tatishtcheff Bolitin and Golikoff?
And was it for me to burrow amongst records and[Pg 204] to penetrate the
occult meaning of a dead language—for me who could never master the
Slavonian alphabet? Why not try a history on a smaller scale?—for
instance, the history of our town! But even here how very numerous
and insuperable seemed the obstacles—a journey to the town, a visit
to the governor and the bishop, permission to examine the archives,
the monastery, the cellars, and so on. The history of our town would
have been easier; but it could interest neither the philosopher nor
the artist, and afford but little opening for eloquence. The only
noteworthy record in its annals relates to a terrible fire ten years
ago which burnt the bazaar and the courts of justice. An accident
settled my doubts. A woman hanging linen in a loft found an old
basket full of shavings, dust, and books. The whole household knew my
passion for reading. My housekeeper while I sat over my paper gnawing
my pen and meditating on the experience of country prophets entered
triumphantly dragging a basket into my room, and bringing joyfully
"books! books!"

Books! I repeated in delight as I rushed to the basket. Actually a pile
of them with covers of green and of blue paper. It was a collection of
old almanacks. My ardour was cooled by the discovery, still they were
books, and I generously rewarded her pains with half a silver ruble.

When she had gone I began to examine my[Pg 205] almanacks; I soon became
absorbed. They formed a complete series from 1744 to 1799 including
exactly 55 years. The blue sheets of paper usually bound in the
almanacks were covered with old-fashioned handwriting. Skimming these
lines I noticed with surprise that besides remarks on the weather
and accounts they contained scraps of historical information about
the village of Gorohina. Among these valuable documents I began my
researches, and soon found that they presented a full history of my
native place for nearly a century, in chronological order, besides an
exhaustive store of economical, statistical, meteorological, and other
learned information. Thenceforth the study of these documents took up
my time, for I perceived that from them a stately, instructive, and
interesting history could be made. As I became sufficiently acquainted
with these valuable notes, I began to search for new sources of
information about the village of Gorohina, and I soon became astonished
at the wealth of material. After devoting six months to a preliminary
study of them, I at last began the long wished for work; and by God''s
grace completed the same on the 3rd of November, 1827. To-day, like a
fellow-historian, whose name I do not recollect, having finished my
hard task, I lay down my pen and sadly walk into my garden to meditate
upon my performance. It seems even to me that now the[Pg 206] history of
Gorohina is finished I am no longer wanted in the world. My task is
ended; and it is time for me to die.

I. A collection of ancient almanacks in fifty fifty—five parts. Of
these the first twenty are covered with an old-fashioned writing;
much abbreviated. The manuscript is that of my grandfather; Andrei
Stepanovitch Belkin; and is remarkably clear and concise. For example:
4th of May. Snow.

Trishka for his impertinence beaten. 6th. The red cow died. Senka for
drunkenness beaten. 8th. A fine day. 9th. Rain and snow. Trishka for
drunkenness beaten.... and so on without comment. 11th. The weather
fine, first snow; hunted three hares. The remaining thirty-five parts
were in various hands mostly commercial with or without abbreviations,
usually profuse; disjointed; and incorrectly written. Here and there a
feminine handwriting appeared. In these years occurred my grandfather''s
notes about his wife Bupraxic Aleksevna; others written by her and
others by the steward Grobovitsky.

II. The notes of the Gorohina church clerk. This curious manuscript
was discovered by me at the house of my priest; who has married the
daughter of the writer. The first earlier sheets[Pg 207] had been torn out and
used by the priests children for making kites. One of these had fallen
in the middle of my yard. I picked it up? and was about to restore it
to the children when I noticed that it was written on. From the first
lines I saw that the kite was made out of some one''s journal. Luckily I
was in time to save the rest. These journals, which I got for a measure
of oats, are remarkable for depth of thought and dignity of expression.

III. Oral legends. I despised no source of information, but I am
specially indebted for much of this to Agrafena Tryphonovna, the mother
of Avdei the starosta and reputed mistress of the steward Grobovitsky.

IV. Registry reports with remarks by the former starosta on the
morality and condition of the peasants.

The foundation of Gorohina and the history of its original inhabitants
are lost in obscurity. Dark legend tells how that Gorohina was once a
large and wealthy village, that all its inhabitants were rich, that
the obrok (the land proprietor''s tithes) was collected once a year and
carted off in loads no one knew to whom. At that time everything was
bought cheap and sold dear. There were no stewards, and the elders
dealt fairly by[Pg 208] all. The inhabitants worked little and lived merrily.
The shepherds as they watched their flocks wore boots. We must not be
deceived by this charming picture. The notion of a golden age is common
to all nations, and only proves that as people are never contented with
the present, and derive from experience small hope for the future,
they adorn the irrevocable past with all the hues of fancy. What is
certain, however, is that the village of Gorohina from ancient times
has belonged to the distinguished race of Belkins. But these ancestors
of mine had many other estates, and paid but little attention to this
remote village. Gorohina paid small tithe and was managed by elders
elected by the people in common council.

At that early period the inheritance of the Belkins was broken up, and
fell in value. The impoverished grandchildren of the rich grandsire,
unable to give up their luxurious habits, required from an estate now
only producing one tenth of its former revenue the full income of
former times. Threats followed threats. The starosta read them out in
common council. The elders declaimed, the commune agitated, and the
masters, instead of the double tithes, received tiresome excuses and
humble complaints written on dirty paper and sealed with a polushka
(less than a farthing).

A sombre cloud hung over Gorohina; but no[Pg 209] one heeded it. In the last
year of Tryphon''s power, the last of the starostas chosen by the
people, the day of the church festival, when the whole population
either crowded noisily round the house of entertainment (the
public-house) or wandered through the streets embracing one another
or loudly singing the songs of Arhip the Bald, there drove into the
courtyard a covered hired britchka drawn by a couple of half-dead
screws, with a ragged Jew upon the box. From the britchka a head in a
cap looked out and seemed to peer curiously at the merry-making crowd.
The inhabitants greeted the carriage with laughter and rude jokes.
With the flaps of their coats turned up the madmen mocked the Jewish
driver, shouting in doggrell rhyme, "Jew, Jew, eat a pig''s ear." But
how great was their astonishment (wrote the clerk) when the carriage
stopped in the middle of the village and the occupant jumped out, and
in an authoritative voice called for the starosta Tryphon. This officer
was in the house of pleasure, whence two elders led him forth holding
him under the arms. The stranger looked at him sternly, handed him a
letter, and told him to read it at once. The starostas of Gorohina
were in the habit of never reading anything themselves. The rural
clerk Avdei was sent for. He was found asleep under a hedge and was
brought before the stranger. But either from the sudden fright or from
a sad[Pg 210] fore-boding, the words distinctly written in the letter appeared
to him in a mist, and he could not read them. The stranger sent the
starosta Tryphon and the rural clerk Avdei with terrible curses to
bed, postponing the reading of the letter till the morrow and entered
the office hut, whither the Jew carried his small trunk. The people
of Gorohina looked in amazement at this unusual incident, but the
carriage, the stranger, and the Jew were quickly forgotten. They ended
their day with noise and merriment, and Gorohina went to sleep without
presentiments of the future.

At sunrise the inhabitants were awakened with knockings at the windows
and a call to a meeting of the commune. The citizens one after the
other appeared in the courtyard round the office hut, which served as
a council ground. Their eyes were dim and red, their faces swollen;
yawning and scratching their heads, they stared at the man with the
cap, in an old blue caftan, standing pompously on the steps of the
office hut, while they tried to recollect his features, which they
seemed to have seen some time or another.

The starosta and his clerk Avdei stood by his side, bareheaded, with
the same expression of dejection and sorrow.

"The whole hundred," replied the citizens,[Pg 211] when, the starosta informed
them that he had received a letter from the master, and, directed the
clerk to read it aloud to the commune. Avdei stepped forward and read
as follows:

N.B. This alarming document, which he kept carefully shut up in the
icon-case, together with other memorandum of his authority over the
people of Gorohina, I copied at the house of Tryphon, our starosta.

"The bearer of this letter, my agent.... is going to my patrimony,
the village of Gorohina, to assume the management of it. Directly he
arrives assemble the peasants and make known to them their master''s
wishes; namely, that they are to obey my agent as they would myself,
and attend to his orders without demur; otherwise he is empowered to
treat them with great severity. I have been forced to take this step
by their shameless disobedience and your, Tryphon Ivanoff, roguish
indulgence.

Then the agent, with his legs extended like an X and his arms akimbo
like a phitab, addressed to them the following pithy speech: "See that
you are not too troublesome, or I will certainly beat the folly out
of your heads quicker than the fumes of[Pg 212] yesterday''s drink." There
were no longer any fumes left in the head of any man of Gorohina. All
were dumbfounded, hung their noses, and dispersed in fear to their own
houses. The agent seized the reins of government, called for the list
of peasants, divided them into rich and poor, and began to carry into
effect his political system, which deserves particular description. It
was founded upon the following maxims: That the richer a peasant, the
more fractious he grows, and the poorer, the quieter.

First, the deficits were distributed among the rich peasants, and were
exacted from them with the greatest severity. Second, the defaulting
or idle hands were forthwith set to plough, and if their labour proved
insufficient according to his standard, he assigned them as workmen
to the other peasants, who paid him for this a voluntary tax. The men
given as bondsmen, on the other hand, possessed the right of redeeming
themselves by paying, besides their deficit, a double annual tithe. All
the communal obligations were thrown upon the rich peasants. But the
recruiting arrangements were the masterpiece of the avaricious ruler,
for by turns all the rich peasants bought themselves off, till at last
the choice fell upon either the blackguard or the ruined one.

Communal assemblies were abolished. The tithes were collected in small
sums and all the year round. The peasants, it seems, did not pay very
much more than before, but they could not earn or save enough to pay.
In three years Gorohina was quite pauperised. Gorohina quieted down;
the bazaar was empty, the songs of Arhip the Bald were unsung, one
half the men were ploughing in the fields, the other half serving
them as bond labourers. The children went begging, and the day of the
church fÃªte became, according to the historian, not a day of joy and
exultation, but an annual mourning and commemoration of sorrow.

The accursed steward put Anton Timofeieff into irons, but the old man
Timofei bought his son''s freedom for one hundred rubles. The steward
then put the irons on Petrusha Gremeieff, who likewise was ransomed
by his father for sixty-eight rubles. The accursed one then wanted to
handcuff Lech Tarassoff, but he escaped into the woods, to the regret
of the steward, who vented his rage in words; but sent to town in place
of Lech Tarassoff Vanka the drunkard, and gave him for a soldier as a
substitute.

Amongst the young men sent abroad by Peter the Great to acquire the
information necessary for a civilised country was his godson Ibrahim
the negro. He was educated in a Parisian military school, passed out
as a captain of the artillery, distinguished himself in the Spanish
war, and when seriously wounded returned to Paris. In the midst of his
enormous labours the emperor never ceased to ask after his favourite,
of whose progress and good conduct the accounts were always favourable.
Peter was exceedingly pleased with him, and frequently invited him to
Russia; but Ibrahim was in no hurry. He excused himself; either his
wound, or his wish to complete his education, or want of money, served
as the pretext; and Peter complied with his wishes,[Pg 215] begged him to take
care of his health, thanked him for his assiduity in study, and though
exceedingly economical himself was lavish to his protÃ©gÃ©, and sent
together with gold pieces fatherly advice and warning.

Judging by all historical accounts, the flightiness, madness, and
luxury of the French of that period were unequalled. The latter years
of Louis XIV.''s reign, memorable for the strict piety, dignity,
and propriety of the court, have left no traces behind. The Duke
of Orleans, in whom many brilliant qualities united with vice of
every kind, unfortunately did not possess an atom of hypocrisy. The
orgies of the Palais Royal were no secret in Paris; the example was
infectious. At that time Law made his appearance. To the love of money
was united the thirst for pleasure and amusement. Estates dwindled,
morals perished, Frenchmen laughed and discussed, while the kingdom
crumbled to the jovial tunes of satirical vaudevilles. Meanwhile
society presented a most uninteresting picture. Culture and the
craving for amusement united all classes. Riches, amiability, renown,
accomplishments, even eccentricity, whatever nourished curiosity or
promised entertainment, was received with equal pleasure. Literature,
learning, and philosophy left the seclusion of the study to appear in
the great world and minister to fashion, the ruler of opinions. Women
reigned,[Pg 216] but no longer exacted adoration. Superficial politeness took
the place of profound respect. The escapades of the Duke de Richelieu,
the Alcibiades of modern Athens, belong to history and display the
morals of that period:

"Temps Fortune, marquÃ© par la licence,
Ou la folie, agitant son grelot,
D''un pied leger parcourt toute la France,
Ou nul mortel ne daigne Ãªtre dÃ©vot,
Ou l''on fait tout exceptÃ© pÃ©nitence."

Ibrahim''s arrival, his appearance, culture, and native wit, attracted
general attention in Paris. All the ladies fought for a visit from
the Tsar''s negro. More than once was he invited to the Regent''s merry
evenings; he was present at the suppers enlivened by the youth of
Voltaire and the age of Shollier, the conversations of Montesquieu
and Fontenelle. Not a ball, not a fÃªte, not one first representation
did he miss; and he gave himself up to the general whirl with all the
passion of his youth and nature. But the idea of exchanging these
entertainments, these brilliant pleasures for the simplicity of the St.
Petersburg Court was not all that Ibrahim dreaded. Other and stronger
ties bound him to Paris. The young African was in love. No longer in
the first bloom of youth, the Countess L. was still celebrated for
her beauty. At seventeen, on leaving the[Pg 217] convent, she was married to
a man for whom she had not learnt to feel the love which ultimately
he showed no care to win. Rumour assigned her lovers, but through
the leniency of society she still enjoyed a good repute; for nothing
ridiculous or scandalous could be brought against her. Her house was
the most fashionable, a centre of the best society in Paris. Ibrahim
was introduced by young G. de Merville, who was regarded generally
as her latest lover; an impression which he tried by every means to
strengthen. The Countess received Ibrahim with civility, but without
particular attention. He was flattered. Usually the young negro was
regarded with wonder, surrounded and overwhelmed with attention
and questions; and this curiosity, though veiled by a display of
friendliness, offended his vanity.

The delightful attention of women, almost the sole aim of our
exertions, not only gave him no pleas are, but even ailed him with
bitterness and wrath. He felt that he was for them a species of rare
animal, a strange peculiar creature, accidentally brought into a
world with which he had naught in common. He even envied those whom
no one noticed, and deemed their insignificance a blessing. The idea
that nature had not formed him for tender passion robbed him of all
self-assertion and conceit, and added a rare charm to his manner
towards women. His conversation was[Pg 218] simple and dignified. He pleased
the Countess L., who was tired of the formal pleasantries and pointed
innuendoes of French, wit.

Ibrahim visited her often. Little by little she grew used to the young
negro''s looks, and even began to find something agreeable in that early
head, so black amid the powdered wigs that thronged her drawing-room
(Ibrahim had been wounded in the head and wore a bandage in the place
of a wig). He was twenty-seven, tall and well built, and more than one
beauty glanced at him with feelings more flattering to him than mere
curiosity. But Ibraham either did not observe them or thought their
notice merely coquetry. But when his gaze met that of the Countess his
mistrust vanished. Her eyes expressed so much kindness, her manner to
him was so simple, so easy, that it was impossible to suspect her of
the least coquetry or insincerity.

Though no thought of love entered his mind, to see the Countess daily
had become a necessity. He tried to meet her everywhere, and every
meeting seemed a godsend. The Countess guessed his feelings before he
did so himself. There is no doubt that a love which hopes nothing and
asks nothing touches the female heart more surely than all the arts of
the experienced. When Ibrahim was near, the Countess followed all his
movements,[Pg 219] listened to all his words. Without him she became pensive,
and fell into her usual abstraction. Merville was first to notice their
mutual attraction, and congratulated Ibrahim. Nothing inflames love
like approving comments of outsiders. Love is blind, and putting no
trust in itself clings eagerly to every support.

Merville''s words roused Ibrahim. Hope suddenly dawned upon his soul;
he fell madly in love. In vain the Countess, alarmed by the vehemence
of his passion, wished to meet him with friendly warnings and sage
counsels; but she herself was growing weak.

Nothing escapes the eye of the vigilant world. The Countess''s new
attachment soon became known. Some ladies wondered at her choice;
many found him very ordinary. Some laughed; others considered her
inexcusably imprudent. In the first intoxication of their passion
Ibrahim and the Countess noticed nothing, but soon the jokes of the
men, the sarcasms of the women, began to reach them. Ibrahim''s formal
and cold manner had hitherto guarded him from such attacks; he bore
them with impatience, and knew not how to retaliate. The Countess,
accustomed to the respect of society, could not calmly endure to see
herself an object of ridicule and scandal. She complained to Ibrahim
either with tears or bitter reproaches; then she begged him not to
take[Pg 220] her part, nor ruin her completely by useless disturbance.

Fresh circumstances complicated her position still more: results of her
imprudent love began to show themselves. The Countess in distress told
Ibrahim. Consolation, advice, suggestions were in turn exhausted and
rejected. She foresaw her inevitable ruin, and in despair awaited it.
Immediately the Countesses condition became known, reports circulated
with renewed vigour. Sensitive women exclaimed in horror; the men made
bets whether she would bear a white or a black child. Epigrams poured
in about her husband, who alone in all Paris suspected nothing. The
fatal moment approached, the Countess was in a terrible state. Ibrahim
called every day. He saw her strength of mind and body gradually
failing. Her tears and terror increased momentarily. At last she felt
the first throes. Measures were taken hurriedly. Means were found to
get the Count out of the way. The doctor arrived. Two days previous
to this a poor woman had been persuaded to resign into the hands of
strangers her new-born infant, for which a messenger was sent.

Ibrahim remained in the study next the bedroom where the unhappy
Countess lay, scarcely daring to breathe; he heard muffled groans, the
maidservants whispers, and the doctor''s[Pg 221] directions. She suffered long.
Each groan lacerated Ibrahim''s heart, and every silent pause filled
him with dread; suddenly he heard the weak cry of a child, and unable
to control his delight rushed into the Countess''s room. A black infant
lay on the bed at her feet. Ibrahim approached it. His heart throbbed
violently. He blessed his son with a trembling hand. The Countess with
a faint smile stretched towards him a feeble hand, but the doctor,
fearing too much excitement for his patient, dragged Ibrahim away from
her bedside. The new-born babe was laid in a covered basket and carried
out by a secret staircase. The other child was brought in, and its
cradle placed in the bedroom. Ibrahim left feeling a trifle calmer. The
Count was expected. He returned late, heard of the happy confinement
of his wife, and was much pleased. Thus the public, which expected
a great scandal, was disappointed, and forced to be satisfied with
backbiting. Everything fell back into its usual routine. But Ibrahim
felt that his life must undergo a change, and that his intimacy must
sooner or later become known to Count L. In which case, whatever might
ensue, the Countess''s ruin was inevitable. Ibrahim loved and was loved
with passion; but the Countess was wilful and flighty; and this was
not her first love. Disgust and hatred might in her heart replace[Pg 222]
the tenderest feelings. Ibrahim already foresaw the time of her
indifference. Hitherto he had not known jealousy, but now with horror
he anticipated, it. Convinced that the anguish of a separation would be
less painful, he resolved to break off this luckless connection, quit
Paris, and return to Russia, whither Peter and a dull sense of duty had
long been calling him.

Days and months passed, and love-sick Ibrahim could not resolve to
leave the woman he had wronged. The Countess from hour to hour grew
more attached to him. Their son was being brought up in a distant
province; social scandal was subsiding, and the lovers began to enjoy
greater tranquillity, in silence remembering the past storm and trying
not to think of the future.

One day Ibrahim was standing at the Duke of Orleans'' door. The Duke
passing him, stopped, handed him a letter, and bade him read it at his
leisure. It was a letter from Peter I. The Tsar, guessing the real
cause of his absence, wrote to the Hake that he in no way desired to
compel Ibrahim, and left it to his free will to[Pg 223] return to Russia or
not; but that in any case he should never forsake his foster-child.
This letter touched Ibrahim to the heart. From that moment his decision
was made. Next day he announced to the Regent his intention to start
immediately for Russia.

"Consider the step you are about to take," replied the Duke. "Russia is
not your home. I don''t think you will ever have a chance of seeing your
torrid Africa, and your long residence in France has made you equally
a stranger to the climate and the semi-barbarous life of Russia. You
were not born one of Peter''s subjects. Take my advice, profit by his
generous permission, stay in France, for which you have already shed
your blood, and be convinced that here your services and talents will
not be left without their due reward."

Ibrahim was soon ready for the journey. On the eve of his departure
he passed the evening as usual at the Countess L''s. She knew nothing.
Ibrahim had not the courage to tell her. The Countess was calm and
cheerful. She several[Pg 224] times called him to her and joked about
his pensiveness. After supper everybody had gone, leaving in the
drawing-room only the Countess, her husband, and Ibrahim. The unhappy
man would have given the world to be left alone with her; but Count L.
seemed to be settled so comfortably near the grate that it appeared
hopeless to wait to see him out of the room. All three remained silent.

Still he did not move. At last his eyes became dim, his head went
round, and he could scarcely get out of the room.

"I am going, dearest Leonora, to leave you for ever. I write because I
have not the strength to tell you otherwise. Our happiness could not
continue; I have enjoyed it against the will of destiny and nature.
You must in time have ceased to love me. The enchantment must have
vanished. This idea has always haunted me, even when I seemed to
forget all, when at your feet I was intoxicated by your[Pg 225] passionate
self-abnegation, by your boundless tenderness. The thoughtless world
mercilessly persecute that which in theory it permits. Sooner or later
its cold irony would have vanquished you, and cowed your passionate
soul, till finally you would have been ashamed of your love.

"Better to die; better to leave you before that terrible moment. Your
happiness to me is more precious than all; you could not enjoy it,
while the gaze of society was fixed upon us. Remember all you have
endured, your wounded pride, the torture of fear; the terrible birth
of our son. Think; ought I any longer to subject you to such fears and
dangers? Why should I endeavour to unite the fate of so tender, so
beautiful a creature with the miserable life of a negro, a pitiable
object scarce worthy of the name of man?

"Forgive me, Leonora; dear and only friend. In leaving you, I leave
the first and last joy of my heart. I have no fatherland nor kin. I go
to Russia, where my utter solitude will be my joy. Serious pursuits
to which from henceforth I devote myself, if they do not silence must
at any rate distract painful recollections of the days of rapture.
Farewell, Leonora! I tear myself away from this letter, as if from your
embrace. Farewell, be happy, and think sometimes[Pg 226] of the poor negro, of
your faithful Ibrahim."

The same night he started for Russia. The journey did not seem as
terrible as he had expected. His imagination triumphed over fact. The
further he got from Paris the nearer and more vivid seemed to him all
the objects he was leaving for ever.

Imperceptibly he reached the Russian frontier. Autumn had already set
in, but the hired relays, notwithstanding the badness of the roads,
brought him with the swiftness of the wind, and on the seventeenth
morning he arrived at Krasnoe Selo, through which at that time passed
the high road.

There remained twenty-eight versts'' journey to St. Petersburg. While
the horses were being changed Ibrahim entered the posting-house. In a
corner a tall man, in a green caftan and a clay pipe in his mouth, sat
leaning against the table reading the Hamburg Gazette. Hearing some
one enter he raised his head.

Ibrahim recognised Peter, and in his delight rushed at him, but stopped
respectfully. The monarch approached, put his arms round him, and
kissed him on the forehead.

"I was told of your coming," said Peter, "and drove off to meet you. I
Pave been waiting for you here since yesterday."

"Tell them," added the Tsar, "to let your carriage follow us, while you
get in by my side and drive to my place."

The Tsar''s calÃ¨che was announced; he and Ibrahim got in and started at
a gallop. In an hour and a half they reached St. Petersburg. Ibrahim
looked with interest at the new-born city, which had sprung up by the
will of the Tsar. The bare banks, the canals without quays, the wooden
bridges, everywhere bore witness to the recent triumph of human will
over the elements. The houses seemed to have been hurriedly built.
The whole town contained nothing magnificent but the Neva, not yet
decorated with its granite framework, but already covered with ships
of war and merchantmen. The Tsar''s calÃ¨che drew up at the palace,
i.e. at the Tsaritsa''s garden. On the door-steps Peter was met by a
woman about thirty-five, handsome, and dressed in the latest Parisian
fashion. Peter kissed her, and, taking Ibrahim by the hand, said:

Catherine turned on him her black searching[Pg 228] eyes, and graciously held
out her hand. Two young beauties, tall and shapely, and fresh as roses,
stood behind her and respectfully approached Peter.

"Lisa," he said to one, "do you remember the little negro who stole
apples from me at Oranienburgh to give to you? Here he is, I introduce
him to you."

The grand duchess laughed and blushed. They went into the dining-room.
In expectation of the Tsar the table had been laid. Peter, having
invited Ibrahim, sat down with all his family to dinner. During dinner
the Tsar talked to him on different topics, inquiring about the Spanish
war, the internal affairs of Prance and the Regent, whom he liked,
though he found in his conduct much to blame. Ibrahim displayed an
accurate and observant mind. Peter was much pleased with his answers;
remembering some incidents of Ibrahim''s childhood, he related them with
such good-humoured merriment that no one could have suspected this kind
and hospitable host to be the hero of Poltava, the mighty and terrible
reformer of Russia.

After dinner the Tsar, according to the Russian custom, retired to
rest. Ibrahim remained with the empress and the grand duchesses. He
tried to satisfy their curiosity, described Parisian life, their fÃªtes
and capricious fashions. In the[Pg 229] mean-while, some of the emperor''s
suite assembled in the palace. Ibrahim recognised the magnificent
Prince Menshikoff, who, seeing the negro conversing with Catherine,
cast him a scornful glance; Prince Jacob Dolgoruki, Peter''s stern
counsellor; the learned Bruce, known among the people as the Russian
Paustus; young Bagusinski, his former companion, and others who had
come to the Tsar to bring reports and receive instructions. In a couple
of hours the Tsar came out.

"Let us see," he said to Ibrahim, "if you remember your old duties.
Get a slate and follow me." Peter locked himself in the carpenter''s
room and was engaged with state affairs. He worked alternately with
Bruce, Prince Dolgoruki, General Police-master DeviÃ¨re, and dictated
to Ibrahim several ukases and decisions. Ibrahim was struck by the
rapidity and firmness of his decision, the strength and the pliability
of his intellect, and the variety of his occupations. When his work
was ended Peter took out a pocket book to compare the notes and see if
he had got through all he had meant to do that day. Then quitting the
carpenter''s workroom he said to Ibrahim:

"It is late; I dare say you are tired, sleep the night here, as in the
old time; to-morrow I will wake you."

Ibrahim, left alone, could hardly realise that he was again at St.
Petersburg, i' WHERE id = 'ddfa649e-934c-4cf8-91c4-1e05cdc4d2f0';
