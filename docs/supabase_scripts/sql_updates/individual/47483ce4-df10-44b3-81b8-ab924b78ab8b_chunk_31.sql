      inn at the foot of the path leading to the lake.

The next day, at nightfall, I came to the chateau of Murol. The old
      fortress, an enormous tower standing on a peak in the midst of a large
      valley, where three valleys intersect, rears its brown, uneven, cracked
      surface into the sky; it is round, from its large circular base to the
      crumbling turrets on its pinnacles.

It astonishes the eye more than any other ruin by its simple mass, its
      majesty, its grave and imposing air of antiquity. It stands there, alone,
      high as a mountain, a dead queen, but still the queen of the valleys
      stretched out beneath it. You go up by a slope planted with firs, then you
      enter a narrow gate, and stop at the foot of the walls, in the first
      inclosure, in full view of the entire country.

Inside there are ruined halls, crumbling stairways, unknown cavities,
      dungeons, walls cut through in the middle, vaulted roofs held up one knows
      not how, and a mass of stones and crevices, overgrown with grass, where
      animals glide in and out.

Suddenly I perceived behind a bit of wall a being, a kind of phantom, like
      the spirit of this ancient and crumbling habitation.

I was taken aback with surprise, almost with fear, when I recognized the
      old lady whom I had seen twice.

I turned around to go away, when she spoke to me, apparently ashamed to
      have been surprised in her grief.

“Pardon me, madame, for having disturbed you,” I stammered,
      confused, not knowing what to say. “Some misfortune has doubtless
      come to you.”

“Yes. No—I am like a lost dog,” she murmured, and began
      to sob, with her handkerchief over her eyes.

Moved by these contagious tears, I took her hand, trying to calm her. Then
      brusquely she told me her history, as if no longer ably to bear her grief
      alone.

“Once I was happy. I have a house down there—a home. I cannot
      go back to it any more; I shall never go back to it again, it is too hard
      to bear.

“I have a son. It is he! it is he! Children don''t know. Oh, one has
      such a short time to live! If I should see him now I should perhaps not
      recognize him. How I loved him? How I loved him! Even before he was born,
      when I felt him move. And after that! How I have kissed and caressed and
      cherished him! If you knew how many nights I have passed in watching him
      sleep, and how many in thinking of him. I was crazy about him. When he was
      eight years old his father sent him to boarding-school. That was the end.
      He no longer belonged to me. Oh, heavens! He came to see me every Sunday.
      That was all!

“He went to college in Paris. Then he came only four times a year,
      and every time I was astonished to see how he had changed, to find him
      taller without having seen him grow. They stole his childhood from me, his
      confidence, and his love which otherwise would not have gone away from me;
      they stole my joy in seeing him grow, in seeing him become a little man.

“I saw him four times a year. Think of it! And at every one of his
      visits his body, his eye, his movements, his voice his laugh, were no
      longer the same, were no longer mine. All these things change so quickly
      in a child; and it is so sad if one is not there to see them change; one
      no longer recognizes him.

“One year he came with down on his cheek! He! my son! I was
      dumfounded —would you believe it? I hardly dared to kiss him. Was it
      really he, my little, little curly head of old, my dear; dear child, whom
      I had held in his diapers or my knee, and who had nursed at my breast with
      his little greedy lips—was it he, this tall, brown boy, who no
      longer knew how to kiss me, who seemed to love me as a matter of duty, who
      called me ''mother'' for the sake of politeness, and who kissed me on the
      forehead, when I felt like crushing him in my arms?

“My husband died. Then my parents, and then my two sisters. When
      Death enters a house it seems as if he were hurrying to do his utmost, so
      as not to have to return for a long time after that. He spares only one or
      two to mourn the others.

“I remained alone. My tall son was then studying law. I was hoping
      to live and die near him, and I went to him so that we could live
      together. But he had fallen into the ways of young men, and he gave me to
      understand that I was in his way. So I left. I was wrong in doing so, but
      I suffered too much in feeling myself in his way, I, his mother! And I
      came back home.

“He married. What a joy! At last we should be together for good. I
      should have grandchildren. His wife was an Englishwoman, who took a
      dislike to me. Why? Perhaps she thought that I loved him too much.

“Then he went to England, to live with them, with his wife''s
      parents. Do you understand? They have him—they have my son for
      themselves. They have stolen him from me. He writes to me once a month. At
      first he came to see me. But now he no longer comes.

“It is now four years since I saw him last. His face then was
      wrinkled and his hair white. Was that possible? This man, my son, almost
      an old man? My little rosy child of old? No doubt I shall never see him
      again.

“I am like a lost dog. Adieu, monsieur! don''t stay here with me for
      it hurts me to have told you all this.”

I went down the hill, and on turning round to glance back, I saw the old
      woman standing on a broken wall, looking out upon the mountains, the long
      valley and Lake Chambon in the distance.

And her skirt and the queer little shawl which she wore around her thin
      shoulders were fluttering tike a flag in the wind.

We were just leaving the asylum when I saw a tall, thin man in a corner of
      the court who kept on calling an imaginary dog. He was crying in a soft,
      tender voice: “Cocotte! Come here, Cocotte, my beauty!” and
      slapping his thigh as one does when calling an animal. I asked the
      physician, “Who is that man?” He answered: “Oh! he is
      not at all interesting. He is a coachman named Francois, who became insane
      after drowning his dog.”

I insisted: “Tell me his story. The most simple and humble things
      are sometimes those which touch our hearts most deeply.”

There was a family of rich bourgeois who lived in a suburb of Paris. They
      had a villa in the middle of a park, at the edge of the Seine. Their
      coachman was this Francois, a country fellow, somewhat dull, kind-hearted,
      simple and easy to deceive.

One evening, as he was returning home, a dog began to follow him. At first
      he paid no attention to it, but the creature''s obstinacy at last made him
      turn round. He looked to see if he knew this dog. No, he had never seen
      it. It was a female dog and frightfully thin. She was trotting behind him
      with a mournful and famished look, her tail between her legs, her ears
      flattened against her head and stopping and starting whenever he did.

“Run along! Get out! Kss! kss!” She retreated a few steps,
      then sat down and waited. And when the coachman started to walk again she
      followed along behind him.

He pretended to pick up some stones. The animal ran a little farther away,
      but came back again as soon as the man''s back was turned.

Then the coachman Francois took pity on the beast and called her. The dog
      approached timidly. The man patted her protruding ribs, moved by the
      beast''s misery, and he cried: “Come! come here!” Immediately
      she began to wag her tail, and, feeling herself taken in, adopted, she
      began to run along ahead of her new master.

He made her a bed on the straw in the stable, then he ran to the kitchen
      for some bread. When she had eaten all she could she curled up and went to
      sleep.

When his employers heard of this the next day they allowed the coachman to
      keep the animal. It was a good beast, caressing and faithful, intelligent
      and gentle.

Nevertheless Francois adored Cocotte, and he kept repeating: “That
      beast is human. She only lacks speech.”

He had a magnificent red leather collar made for her which bore these
      words engraved on a copper plate: “Mademoiselle Cocotte, belonging
      to the coachman Francois.”

She was remarkably prolific and four times a year would give birth to a
      batch of little animals belonging to every variety of the canine race.
      Francois would pick out one which he would leave her and then he would
      unmercifully throw the others into the river. But soon the cook joined her
      complaints to those of the gardener. She would find dogs under the stove,
      in the ice box, in the coal bin, and they would steal everything they came
      across.

Finally the master, tired of complaints, impatiently ordered Francois to
      get rid of Cocotte. In despair the man tried to give her away. Nobody
      wanted her. Then he decided to lose her, and he gave her to a teamster,
      who was to drop her on the other side of Paris, near Joinville-le-Pont.

Cocotte returned the same day. Some decision had to be taken. Five francs
      was given to a train conductor to take her to Havre. He was to drop her
      there.

The master took pity on her and let her stay. But other dogs were
      attracted as before, and one evening, when a big dinner party was on, a
      stuffed turkey was carried away by one of them right under the cook''s
      nose, and she did not dare to stop him.

This time the master completely lost his temper and said angrily to
      Francois: “If you don''t throw this beast into the water before—to-morrow
      morning, I''ll put you out, do you hear?”

The man was dumbfounded, and he returned to his room to pack his trunk,
      preferring to leave the place. Then he bethought himself that he could
      find no other situation as long as he dragged this animal about with him.
      He thought of his good position, where he was well paid and well fed, and
      he decided that a dog was really not worth all that. At last he decided to
      rid himself of Cocotte at daybreak.

He slept badly. He rose at dawn, and taking a strong rope, went to get the
      dog. She stood up slowly, shook herself, stretched and came to welcome her
      master.

Then his courage forsook him, and he began to pet her affectionately,
      stroking her long ears, kissing her muzzle and calling her tender names.

But a neighboring clock struck six. He could no longer hesitate. He opened
      the door, calling: “Come!” The beast wagged her tail,
      understanding that she was to be taken out.

They reached the beach, and he chose a place where the water seemed deep.
      Then he knotted the rope round the leather collar and tied a heavy stone
      to the other end. He seized Cocotte in his arms and kissed her madly, as
      though he were taking leave of some human being. He held her to his
      breast, rocked her and called her “my dear little Cocotte, my sweet
      little Cocotte,” and she grunted with pleasure.

But suddenly he made up his mind and threw her as far from him as he
      could. At first she tried to swim, as she did when he gave her a bath, but
      her head, dragged down by the stone, kept going under, and she looked at
      her master with wild, human glances as she struggled like a drowning
      person. Then the front part of her body sank, while her hind legs waved
      wildly out of the water. Finally those also disappeared.

Then, for five minutes, bubbles rose to the surface as though the river
      were boiling, and Francois, haggard, his heart beating, thought that he
      saw Cocotte struggling in the mud, and, with the simplicity of a peasant,
      he kept saying to himself: “What does the poor beast think of me
      now?”

He almost lost his mind. He was ill for a month and every night he dreamed
      of his dog. He could feel her licking his hands and hear her barking. It
      was necessary to call in a physician. At last he recovered, and toward the
      2nd of June his employers took him to their estate at Biesard, near Rouen.

There again he was near the Seine. He began to take baths. Each morning he
      would go down with the groom and they would swim across the river.

One day, as they were disporting themselves in the water, Francois
      suddenly cried to his companion: “Look what''s coming! I''m going to
      give you a chop!”

It was an enormous, swollen corpse that was floating down with its feet
      sticking straight up in the air.

Francois swam up to it, still joking: “Whew! it''s not fresh. What a
      catch, old man! It isn''t thin, either!” He kept swimming about at a
      distance from the animal that was in a state of decomposition. Then,
      suddenly, he was silent and looked at it: attentively. This time he came
      near enough to touch, it. He looked fixedly at the collar, then he
      stretched out his arm, seized the neck, swung the corpse round and drew it
      up close to him and read on the copper which had turned green and which
      still stuck to the discolored leather: “Mademoiselle Cocotte,
      belonging to the coachman Francois.”

He let out a frightful shriek and began to swim for the beach with all his
      might, still howling; and as soon as he touched land he ran away wildly,
      stark naked, through the country. He was insane!

The road ascended gently through the forest of Aitone. The large pines
      formed a solemn dome above our heads, and that mysterious sound made by
      the wind in the trees sounded like the notes of an organ.

After walking for three hours, there was a clearing, and then at intervals
      an enormous pine umbrella, and then we suddenly came to the edge of the
      forest, some hundred meters below, the pass leading to the wild valley of
      Niolo.

On the two projecting heights which commanded a view of this pass, some
      old trees, grotesquely twisted, seemed to have mounted with painful
      efforts, like scouts sent in advance of the multitude in the rear. When we
      turned round, we saw the entire forest stretched beneath our feet, like a
      gigantic basin of verdure, inclosed by bare rocks whose summits seemed to
      reach the sky.

Then I beheld a remarkable landscape. Beyond another forest stretched a
      valley, but a valley such as I had never seen before; a solitude of stone,
      ten leagues long, hollowed out between two high mountains, without a field
      or a tree to be seen. This was the Niolo valley, the fatherland of
      Corsican liberty, the inaccessible citadel, from which the invaders had
      never been able to drive out the mountaineers.

Not a blade of grass, not a plant-nothing but granite. As far as our eyes
      could reach, we saw in front of us a desert of glittering stone, heated
      like an oven by a burning sun, which seemed to hang for that very purpose
      right above the gorge. When we raised our eyes towards the crests, we
      stood dazzled and stupefied by what we saw. They looked like a festoon of
      coral; all the summits are of porphyry; and the sky overhead was violet,
      purple, tinged with the coloring of these strange mountains. Lower down,
      the granite was of scintillating gray, and seemed ground to powder beneath
      our feet. At our right, along a long and irregular course, roared a
      tumultuous torrent. And we staggered along under this heat, in this light,
      in this burning, arid, desolate valley cut by this torrent of turbulent
      water which seemed to be ever hurrying onward, without fertilizing the
      rocks, lost in this furnace which greedily drank it up without being
      saturated or refreshed by it.

But, suddenly, there was visible at our right a little wooden cross sunk
      in a little heap of stones. A man had been killed there; and I said to my
      companion.

“His father was killed in a quarrel by a young man of the district,
      it is said; and St. Lucia was left alone with his sister. He was a weak,
      timid youth, small, often ill, without any energy. He did not proclaim
      vengeance against the assassin of his father. All his relatives came to
      see him, and implored of him to avenge his death; he remained deaf to
      their menaces and their supplications.

“Then, following the old Corsican custom, his sister, in her
      indignation carried away his black clothes, in order that he might not
      wear mourning for a dead man who had not been avenged. He was insensible
      to even this affront, and rather than take down from the rack his father''s
      gun, which was still loaded, he shut himself up, not daring to brave the
      looks of the young men of the district.

“He seemed to have even forgotten the crime, and lived with his
      sister in the seclusion of their dwelling.

“But, one day, the man who was suspected of having committed the
      murder, was about to get married. St. Lucia did not appear to be moved by
      this news, but, out of sheer bravado, doubtless, the bridegroom, on his
      way to the church, passed before the house of the two orphans.

“The brother and the sister, at their window, were eating frijoles,
      when the young man saw the bridal procession going by. Suddenly he began
      to tremble, rose to his feet without uttering a word, made the sign of the
      cross, took the gun which was hanging over the fireplace, and went out.

“When he spoke of this later on, he said: ''I don''t know what was the
      matter with me; it was like fire in my blood; I felt that I must do it,
      that, in spite of everything, I could not resist, and I concealed the gun
      in a cave on the road to Corte.

“An hour later, he came back, with nothing in his hand, and with his
      habitual air of sad weariness. His sister believed that there was nothing
      further in his thoughts.

“His enemy had, the same evening, to repair to Corte on foot,
      accompanied by his two groomsmen.

“He was walking along, singing as he went, when St. Lucia stood
      before him, and looking straight in the murderer''s face, exclaimed: ''Now
      is the time!'' and shot him point-blank in the chest.

“''What have you done, St. Lucia?'' and he was about to hasten to
      Corte for help, when St. Lucia said in a stern tone:

“The other, aware of his timidity hitherto, replied: ''You would not
      dare to do it!'' and was hurrying off when he fell instantaneously, his
      thigh shattered by a bullet.

“''I am going to look at your wound; if it is not serious, I''ll leave
      you there; if it is mortal I''ll finish you off.”

“He inspected the wound, considered it mortal, and slowly reloading
      his gun, told the wounded man to say a prayer, and shot him through the
      head.

“All his family were arrested by the gendarmes. His uncle, the cure,
      who was suspected of having incited him to this deed of vengeance, was
      himself put in prison, and accused by the dead man''s relatives. But he
      escaped, took a gun in his turn, and went to join his nephew in the brush.

“Next, St. Lucia killed, one after the other, his uncle''s accusers,
      and tore out their eyes to teach the others never to state what they had
      seen with their eyes.

“He killed all the relatives, all the connections of his enemy''s
      family. He slew during his life fourteen gendarmes, burned down the houses
      of his adversaries, and was, up to the day of his death, the most terrible
      of all the bandits whose memory we have preserved.”

The sun disappeared behind Monte Cinto and the tall shadow of the granite
      mountain went to sleep on the granite of the valley. We quickened our pace
      in order to reach before night the little village of Albertaccio, nothing
      but a pile of stones welded into the stone flanks of a wild gorge. And I
      said as I thought of the bandit:

The seventeenth of July, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-three, at
      half-past two in the morning, the watchman in the cemetery of Besiers, who
      lived in a small cottage on the edge of this field of the dead, was
      awakened by the barking of his dog, which was shut up in the kitchen.

Going down quickly, he saw the animal sniffing at the crack of the door
      and barking furiously, as if some tramp had been sneaking about the house.
      The keeper, Vincent, therefore took his gun and went out.

His dog, preceding him, at once ran in the direction of the Avenue General
      Bonnet, stopping short at the monument of Madame Tomoiseau.

The keeper, advancing cautiously, soon saw a faint light on the side of
      the Avenue Malenvers, and stealing in among the graves, he came upon a
      horrible act of profanation.

A man had dug up the coffin of a young woman who had been buried the
      evening before and was dragging the corpse out of it.

Vincent sprang upon the wretch, threw him to the ground, bound his hands
      and took him to the police station.

He was brought into court. The public prosecutor opened the case by
      referring to the monstrous deeds of the Sergeant Bertrand.

A wave of indignation swept over the courtroom. When the magistrate sat
      down the crowd assembled cried: “Death! death!” With
      difficulty the presiding judge established silence.

Courbataille, who had refused counsel, rose. He was a handsome fellow,
      tall, brown, with a frank face, energetic manner and a fearless eye.

Paying no attention to the whistlings in the room, he began to speak in a
      voice that was low and veiled at first, but that grew more firm as he
      proceeded.

“Monsieur le President, gentlemen of the jury: I have very little to
      say. The woman whose grave I violated was my sweetheart. I loved her.

“I loved her, not with a sensual love and not with mere tenderness
      of heart and soul, but with an absolute, complete love, with an
      overpowering passion.

“When I met her for the first time I felt a strange sensation. It
      was not astonishment nor admiration, nor yet that which is called love at
      first sight, but a feeling of delicious well-being, as if I had been
      plunged into a warm bath. Her gestures seduced me, her voice enchanted me,
      and it was with infinite pleasure that I looked upon her person. It seemed
      to me as if I had seen her before and as if I had known her a long time.
      She had within her something of my spirit.

“She seemed to me like an answer to a cry uttered by my soul, to
      that vague and unceasing cry with which we call upon Hope during our whole
      life.

“When I knew her a little better, the mere thought of seeing her
      again filled me with exquisite and profound uneasiness; the touch of her
      hand in mine was more delightful to me than anything that I had imagined;
      her smile filled me with a mad joy, with the desire to run, to dance, to
      fling myself upon the ground.

“Yes, more than that: she was my very life. I looked for nothing
      further on earth, and had no further desires. I longed for nothing
      further.

“One evening, when we had gone on a somewhat long walk by the river,
      we were overtaken by the rain, and she caught cold. It developed into
      pneumonia the next day, and a week later she was dead.

“During the hours of her suffering astonishment and consternation
      prevented my understanding and reflecting upon it, but when she was dead I
      was so overwhelmed by blank despair that I had no thoughts left. I wept.

“During all the horrible details of the interment my keen and wild
      grief was like a madness, a kind of sensual, physical grief.

“Then when she was gone, when she was under the earth, my mind at
      once found itself again, and I passed through a series of moral sufferings
      so terrible that even the love she had vouchsafed to me was dear at that
      price.

“When one dwells on this thought for a whole day one feels as if he
      were going mad. Just think of it! There is a woman whom you adore, a
      unique woman, for in the whole universe there is not a second one like
      her. This woman has given herself to you and has created with you the
      mysterious union that is called Love. Her eye seems to you more vast than
      space, more charming than the world, that clear eye smiling with her
      tenderness. This woman loves you. When she speaks to you her voice floods
      you with joy.

“And suddenly she disappears! Think of it! She disappears, not only
      for you, but forever. She is dead. Do you understand what that means?
      Never, never, never, not anywhere will she exist any more. Nevermore will
      that eye look upon anything again; nevermore will that voice, nor any
      voice like it, utter a word in the same way as she uttered it.

“Nevermore will a face be born that is like hers. Never, never! The
      molds of statues are kept; casts are kept by which one can make objects
      with the same outlines and forms. But that one body and that one face will
      never more be born again upon the earth. And yet millions and millions of
      creatures will be born, and more than that, and this one woman will not
      reappear among all the women of the future. Is it possible? It drives one
      mad to think of it.

“She lived for twenty years, not more, and she has disappeared
      forever, forever, forever! She thought, she smiled, she loved me. And now
      nothing! The flies that die in the autumn are as much as we are in this
      world. And now nothing! And I thought that her body, her fresh body, so
      warm, so sweet, so white, so lovely, would rot down there in that box
      under the earth. And her soul, her thought, her love—where is it?

“Not to see her again! The idea of this decomposing body, that I
      might yet recognize, haunted me. I wanted to look at it once more.

“I went out with a spade, a lantern and a hammer; I jumped over the
      cemetery wall and I found the grave, which had not yet been closed
      entirely; I uncovered the coffin and took up a board. An abominable odor,
      the stench of putrefaction, greeted my nostrils. Oh, her bed perfumed with
      orris!

“Yet I opened the coffin, and, holding my lighted lantern down into
      it I saw her. Her face was blue, swollen, frightful. A black liquid had
      oozed out of her mouth.

“She! That was she! Horror seized me. But I stretched out my arm to
      draw this monstrous face toward me. And then I was caught.

“All night I have retained the foul odor of this putrid body, the
      odor of my well beloved, as one retains the perfume of a woman after a
      love embrace.

A strange silence seemed to oppress the room. They seemed to be waiting
      for something more. The jury retired to deliberate.

When they came back a few minutes later the accused showed no fear and did
      not even seem to think.

The president announced with the usual formalities that his judges
      declared him to be not guilty.

This entire stretch of country was amazing; it was characterized by a
      grandeur that was almost religious, and yet it had an air of sinister
      desolation.

A great, wild lake, filled with stagnant, black water, in which thousands
      of reeds were waving to and fro, lay in the midst of a vast circle of
      naked hills, where nothing grew but broom, or here and there an oak
      curiously twisted by the wind.

Just one house stood on the banks of that dark lake, a small, low house
      inhabited by Uncle Joseph, an old boatman, who lived on what he could make
      by his fishing. Once a week he carried the fish he caught into the
      surrounding villages, returning with the few provisions that he needed for
      his sustenance.

His boat was old, worm-eaten and clumsy, and the skinny old man rowed with
      a gentle and monotonous stroke that was soothing to the soul, already
      oppressed by the sadness of the land round about.

It seemed to me as if I were transported to olden times, in the midst of
      that ancient country, in that primitive boat, which was propelled by a man
      of another age.

He took up his nets and threw the fish into the bottom of the boat, as the
      fishermen of the Bible might have done. Then he took me down to the end of
      the lake, where I suddenly perceived a ruin on the other side of the bank
      a dilapidated hut, with an enormous red cross on the wall that looked as
      if it might have been traced with blood, as it gleamed in the last rays of
      the setting sun.

But it was better than a legend, being a true story, and quite a recent
      one, since Uncle Joseph had known the man.

This hut had formerly been occupied by a large woman, a kind of beggar,
      who lived on public charity.

Uncle Joseph did not remember from whom she had this hut. One evening an
      old man with a white beard, who seemed to be at least two hundred years
      old, and who could hardly drag himself along, asked alms of this forlorn
      woman, as he passed her dwelling.

“Sit down, father,” she replied; “everything here
      belongs to all the world, since it comes from all the world.”

He sat down on a stone before the door. He shared the woman''s bread, her
      bed of leaves, and her house.

“It was Our Lady the Virgin who permitted this, monsieur,”
      Joseph added, “it being a woman who had opened her door to a Judas,
      for this old vagabond was the Wandering Jew. It was not known at first in
      the country, but the people suspected it very soon, because he was always
      walking; it had become a sort of second nature to him.”

And suspicion had been aroused by still another thing. This woman, who
      kept that stranger with her, was thought to be a Jewess, for no one had
      ever seen her at church. For ten miles around no one ever called her
      anything else but the Jewess.

When the little country children saw her come to beg they cried out:
      “Mamma, mamma, here is the Jewess!”

The old man and she began to go out together into the neighboring
      districts, holding out their hands at all the doors, stammering
      supplications into the ears of all the passers. They could be seen at all
      hours of the day, on by-paths, in the villages, or again eating bread,
      sitting in the noon heat under the shadow of some solitary tree. And the
      country people began to call the beggar Old Judas.

One day he brought home in his sack two little live pigs, which a farmer
      had given him after he had cured the farmer of some sickness.

Soon he stopped begging, and devoted himself entirely to his pigs. He took
      them out to feed by the lake, or under isolated oaks, or in the near-by
      valleys. The woman, however, went about all day begging, but she always
      came back to him in the evening.

He also did not go to church, and no one ever had seen him cross himself
      before the wayside crucifixes. All this gave rise to much gossip:

One night his companion was attacked by a fever and began to tremble like
      a leaf in the wind. He went to the nearest town to get some medicine, and
      then he shut himself up with her, and was not seen for six days.

The priest, having heard that the “Jewess” was about to die,
      came to offer the consolation of his religion and administer the last
      sacrament. Was she a Jewess? He did not know. But in any case, he wished
      to try to save her soul.

Hardly had he knocked at the door when old Judas appeared on the
      threshold, breathing hard, his eyes aflame, his long beard agitated, like
      rippling water, and he hurled blasphemies in an unknown language,
      extending his skinny arms in order to prevent the priest from entering.

The priest attempted to speak, offered his purse and his aid, but the old
      man kept on abusing him, making gestures with his hands as if throwing;
      stones at him.

The companion of old Judas died the following day. He buried her himself,
      in front of her door. They were people of so little account that no one
      took any interest in them.

Then they saw the man take his pigs out again to the lake and up the
      hillsides. And he also began begging again to get food. But the people
      gave him hardly anything, as there was so much gossip about him. Every one
      knew, moreover, how he had treated the priest.

But on Easter Sunday the boys and girls who had gone walking out to the
      lake heard a great noise in the hut. The door was locked; but the boys
      broke it in, and the two pigs ran out, jumping like gnats. No one ever saw
      them again.

The whole crowd went in; they saw some old rags on the floor, the beggar''s
      hat, some bones, clots of dried blood and bits of flesh in the hollows of
      the skull.

“This happened on Good Friday, monsieur.” Joseph concluded his
      story, “three hours after noon.”

I did not attempt to make him understand that it could easily happen that
      the famished animals had eaten their master, after he had died suddenly in
      his hut.

As for the cross on the wall, it had appeared one morning, and no one knew
      what hand traced it in that strange color.

He was a tall man of forty or thereabout, this Jules Chicot, the innkeeper
      of Spreville, with a red face and a round stomach, and said by those who
      knew him to be a smart business man. He stopped his buggy in front of
      Mother Magloire''s farmhouse, and, hitching the horse to the gatepost, went
      in at the gate.

Chicot owned some land adjoining that of the old woman, which he had been
      coveting for a long while, and had tried in vain to buy a score of times,
      but she had always obstinately refused to part with it.

He found her peeling potatoes outside the farmhouse door. She was a woman
      of about seventy-two, very thin, shriveled and wrinkled, almost dried up
      in fact and much bent but as active and untiring as a girl. Chicot patted
      her on the back in a friendly fashion and then sat down by her on a stool.

“Oh, pretty well, thank you, except a few rheumatic pains
      occasionally; otherwise I have nothing to complain of.”

And she said no more, while Chicot watched her going on with her work. Her
      crooked, knotted fingers, hard as a lobster''s claws, seized the tubers,
      which were lying in a pail, as if they had been a pair of pincers, and she
      peeled them rapidly, cutting off long strips of skin with an old knife
      which she held in the other hand, throwing the potatoes into the water as
      they were done. Three daring fowls jumped one after the other into her
      lap, seized a bit of peel and then ran away as fast as their legs would
      carry them with it in their beak.

Chicot seemed embarrassed, anxious, with something on the tip of his
      tongue which he could not say. At last he said hurriedly:

“Certainly not; you may make up your mind to that. What I have said
      I have said, so don''t refer to it again.”

“Just this. You shall sell it to me and keep it all the same. You
      don''t understand? Very well, then follow me in what I am going to say.”

The old woman left off peeling potatoes and looked at the innkeeper
      attentively from under her heavy eyebrows, and he went on:

“Let me explain myself. Every month I will give you a hundred and
      fifty francs. You understand me! suppose! Every month I will come and
      bring you thirty crowns, and it will not make the slightest difference in
      your life—not the very slightest. You will have your own home just
      as you have now, need not trouble yourself about me, and will owe me
      nothing; all you will have to do will be to take my money. Will that
      arrangement suit you?”

He looked at her good-humoredly, one might almost have said benevolently,
      and the old woman returned his looks distrustfully, as if she suspected a
      trap, and said:

“Never mind about that,” he said; “you may remain here
      as long as it pleases God Almighty to let you live; it will be your home.
      Only you will sign a deed before a lawyer making it over to me; after your
      death. You have no children, only nephews and nieces for whom you don''t
      care a straw. Will that suit you? You will keep everything during your
      life, and I will give you the thirty crowns a month. It is pure gain as
      far as you are concerned.”

The old woman was surprised, rather uneasy, but, nevertheless, very much
      tempted to agree, and answered:

“I don''t say that I will not agree to it, but I must think about it.
      Come back in a week, and we will talk it over again, and I will then give
      you my definite answer.”

Mother Magloire was thoughtful, and did not sleep at all that night; in
      fact, for four days she was in a fever of hesitation. She suspected that
      there was something underneath the offer which was not to her advantage;
      but then the thought of thirty crowns a month, of all those coins clinking
      in her apron, falling to her, as it were, from the skies, without her
      doing anything for it, aroused her covetousness.

She went to the notary and told him about it. He advised her to accept
      Chicot''s offer, but said she ought to ask for an annuity of fifty instead
      of thirty, as her farm was worth sixty thousand francs at the lowest
      calculation.

“If you live for fifteen years longer,” he said, “even
      then he will only have paid forty-five thousand francs for it.”

The old woman trembled with joy at this prospect of getting fifty crowns a
      month, but she was still suspicious, fearing some trick, and she remained
      a long time with the lawyer asking questions without being able to make up
      her mind to go. At last she gave him instructions to draw up the deed and
      returned home with her head in a whirl, just as if she had drunk four jugs
      of new cider.

When Chicot came again to receive her answer she declared, after a lot of
      persuading, that she could not make up her mind to agree to his proposal,
      though she was all the time trembling lest he should not consent to give
      the fifty crowns, but at last, when he grew urgent, she told him what she
      expected for her farm.

“I am certainly not likely to live more than five or six years
      longer. I am nearly seventy-three, and far from strong, even considering
      my age. The other evening I thought I was going to die, and could hardly
      manage to crawl into bed.”

“Come, come, old lady, you are as strong as the church tower, and
      will live till you are a hundred at least; you will no doubt see me put
      under ground first.”

The whole day was spent in discussing the money, and as the old woman
      would not give in, the innkeeper consented to give the fifty crowns, and
      she insisted upon having ten crowns over and above to strike the bargain.

Three years passed and the old dame did not seem to have grown a day
      older. Chicot was in despair, and it seemed to him as if he had been
      paying that annuity for fifty years, that he had been taken in, done,
      ruined. From time to time he went to see the old lady, just as one goes in
      July to see when the harvest is likely to begin. She always met him with a
      cunning look, and one might have supposed that she was congratulating
      herself on the trick she had played him. Seeing how well and hearty she
      seemed he very soon got into his buggy again, growling to himself:

He did not know what to do, and he felt inclined to strangle her when he
      saw her. He hated her with a ferocious, cunning hatred, the hatred of a
      peasant who has been robbed, and began to cast about for some means of
      getting rid of her.

One day he came to see her again, rubbing his hands as he did the first
      time he proposed the bargain, and, after having chatted for a few minutes,
      he said:

“Why do you never come and have a bit of dinner at my place when you
      are in Spreville? The people are talking about it, and saying we are not
      on friendly terms, and that pains me. You know it will cost you nothing if
      you come, for I don''t look at the price of a dinner. Come whenever you
      feel inclined; I shall be very glad to see you.”

Old Mother Magloire did not need to be asked twice, and the next day but
      one, as she had to go to the town in any case, it being market day, she
      let her man drive her to Chicot''s place, where the buggy was put in the
      barn while she went into the house to get her dinner.

The innkeeper was delighted and treated her like a lady, giving her roast
      fowl, black pudding, leg of mutton and bacon and cabbage. But she ate next
      to nothing. She had always been a small eater, and had generally lived on
      a little soup and a crust of bread and butter.

Chicot was disappointed and pressed her to eat more, but she refused, and
      she would drink little, and declined coffee, so he asked her:

The servant appeared, carrying a long bottle ornamented with a paper
      vine-leaf, and he filled two liqueur glasses.

The good woman drank it slowly in sips, so as to make the pleasure last
      all the longer, and when she had finished her glass, she said:

Almost before she had said it Chicot had poured her out another glassful.
      She wished to refuse, but it was too late, and she drank it very slowly,
      as she had done the first, and he asked her to have a third. She objected,
      but he persisted.

“It is as mild as milk, you know; I can drink ten or a dozen glasses
      without any ill effects; it goes down like sugar and does not go to the
      head; one would think that it evaporated on the tongue: It is the most
      wholesome thing you can drink.”

“Look here, as it is so much to your taste, I will give you a small
      keg of it, just to show that you and I are still excellent friends.”
      So she took one away with her, feeling slightly overcome by the effects of
      what she had drunk.

The next day the innkeeper drove into her yard and took a little
      iron-hooped keg out of his gig. He insisted on her tasting the contents,
      to make sure it was the same delicious article, and, when they had each of
      them drunk three more glasses, he said as he was going away:

“Well, you know when it is all gone there is more left; don''t be
      modest, for I shall not mind. The sooner it is finished the better pleased
      I shall be.”

Four days later he came again. The old woman was outside her door cutting
      up the bread for her soup.

He went up to her and put his face close to hers, so that he might smell
      her breath; and when he smelt the alcohol he felt pleased.

“I suppose you will give me a glass of the Special?” he said.
      And they had three glasses each.

Soon, however, it began to be whispered abroad that Mother Magloire was in
      the habit of getting drunk all by herself. She was picked up in her
      kitchen, then in her yard, then in the roads in the neighborhood, and she
      was often brought home like a log.

The innkeeper did not go near her any more, and, when people spoke to him
      about her, he used to say, putting on a distressed look:

“It is a great pity that she should have taken to drink at her age,
      but when people get old there is no remedy. It will be the death of her in
      the long run.”

And it certainly was the death of her. She died the next winter. About
      Christmas time she fell down, unconscious, in the snow, and was found dead
      the next morning.

“It was very stupid of her; if she had not taken to drink she would
      probably have lived ten years longer.”

Father Boitelle (Antoine) made a specialty of undertaking dirty jobs all
      through the countryside. Whenever there was a ditch or a cesspool to be
      cleaned out, a dunghill removed, a sewer cleansed, or any dirt hole
      whatever, he way always employed to do it.

He would come with the instruments of his trade, his sabots covered with
      dirt, and set to work, complaining incessantly about his occupation. When
      people asked him then why he did this loathsome work, he would reply
      resignedly:

“Faith, ''tis for my children, whom I must support. This brings me in
      more than anything else.”

He had, indeed, fourteen children. If any one asked him what had become of
      them, he would say with an air of indifference:

“I did not oppose them. I opposed them in nothing. They married just
      as they pleased. We shouldn''t go against people''s likings, it turns out
      badly. I am a night scavenger because my parents went against my likings.
      But for that I would have become a workman like the others.”

He was at the time a soldier stationed at Havre, not more stupid than
      another, or sharper either, a rather simple fellow, however. When he was
      not on duty, his greatest pleasure was to walk along the quay, where the
      bird dealers congregate. Sometimes alone, sometimes with a soldier from
      his own part of the country, he would slowly saunter along by cages
      containing parrots with green backs and yellow heads from the banks of the
      Amazon, or parrots with gray backs and red heads from Senegal, or enormous
      macaws, which look like birds reared in hot-houses, with their flower-like
      feathers, their plumes and their tufts. Parrots of every size, who seem
      painted with minute care by the miniaturist, God Almighty, and the little
      birds, all the smaller birds hopped about, yellow, blue and variegated,
      mingling their cries with the noise of the quay; and adding to the din
      caused by unloading the vessels, as well as by passengers and vehicles, a
      violent clamor, loud, shrill and deafening, as if from some distant forest
      of monsters.

Boitelle would pause, with wondering eyes, wide-open mouth, laughing and
      enraptured, showing his teeth to the captive cockatoos, who kept nodding
      their white or yellow topknots toward the glaring red of his breeches and
      the copper buckle of his belt. When he found a bird that could talk he put
      questions to it, and if it happened at the time to be disposed to reply
      and to hold a conversation with him he would carry away enough amusement
      to last him till evening. He also found heaps of amusement in looking at
      the monkeys, and could conceive no greater luxury for a rich man than to
      own these animals as one owns cats and dogs. This kind of taste for the
      exotic he had in his blood, as people have a taste for the chase, or for
      medicine, or for the priesthood. He could not help returning to the quay
      every time the gates of the barracks opened, drawn toward it by an
      irresistible longing.

On one occasion, having stopped almost in ecstasy before an enormous
      macaw, which was swelling out its plumes, bending forward and bridling up
      again as if making the court curtseys of parrot-land, he saw the door of a
      little cafe adjoining the bird dealer''s shop open, and a young negress
      appeared, wearing on her head a red silk handkerchief. She was sweeping
      into the street the corks and sand of the establishment.

Boitelle''s attention was soon divided between the bird and the woman, and
      he really could not tell which of these two beings he contemplated with
      the greater astonishment and delight.

The negress, having swept the rubbish into the street, raised her eyes,
      and, in her turn, was dazzled by the soldier''s uniform. There she stood
      facing him with her broom in her hands as if she were bringing him a
      rifle, while the macaw continued bowing. But at the end of a few seconds
      the soldier began to feel embarrassed at this attention, and he walked
      away quietly so as not to look as if he were beating a retreat.

But he came back. Almost every day he passed before the Cafe des Colonies,
      and often he could distinguish through the window the figure of the little
      black-skinned maid serving “bocks” or glasses of brandy to the
      sailors of the port. Frequently, too, she would come out to the door on
      seeing him; soon, without even having exchanged a word, they smiled at one
      another like acquaintances; and Boitelle felt his heart touched when he
      suddenly saw, glittering between the dark lips of the girl, a shining row
      of white teeth. At length, one day he ventured to enter, and was quite
      surprised to find that she could speak French like every one else. The
      bottle of lemonade, of which she was good enough to accept a glassful,
      remained in the soldier''s recollection memorably delicious, and it became
      a custom with him to come and absorb in this little tavern on the quay all
      the agreeable drinks which he could afford.

For him it was a treat, a happiness, on which his thoughts dwelt
      constantly, to watch the black hand of the little maid pouring something
      into his glass while her teeth laughed more than her eyes. At the end of
      two months they became fast friends, and Boitelle, after his first
      astonishment at discovering that this negress had as good principles as
      honest French girls, that she exhibited a regard for economy, industry,
      religion and good conduct, loved her more on that account, and was so
      charmed with her that he wanted to marry her.

He told her his intentions, which made her dance with joy. She had also a
      little money, left her by a female oyster dealer, who had picked her up
      when she had been left on the quay at Havre by an American captain. This
      captain had found her, when she was only about six years old, lying on
      bales of cotton in the hold of his ship, some hours after his departure
      from New York. On his arrival in Havre he abandoned to the care of this
      compassionate oyster dealer the little black creature, who had been hidden
      on board his vessel, he knew not why or by whom.

Antoine Boitelle added: “This will be all right if my parents don''t
      oppose it. I will never go against them, you understand, never! I''m going
      to say a word or two to them the first time I go back to the country.”

On the following week, in fact, having obtained twenty-four hours'' leave,
      he went to see his family, who cultivated a little farm at Tourteville,
      near Yvetot.

He waited till the meal was finished, the hour when the coffee baptized
      with brandy makes people more open-hearted, before informing his parents
      that he had found a girl who satisfied his tastes, all his tastes, so
      completely that there could not exist any other in all the world so
      perfectly suited to him.

The old people, on hearing this, immediately assumed a cautious manner and
      wanted explanations. He had concealed nothing from them except the color
      of her skin.

She was a servant, without much means, but strong, thrifty, clean,
      well-conducted and sensible. All these things were better than money would
      be in the hands of a bad housewife. Moreover, she had a few sous, left her
      by a woman who had reared her, a good number of sous, almost a little
      dowry, fifteen hundred francs in the savings bank. The old people,
      persuaded by his talk, and relying also on their own judgment, were
      gradually weakening, when he came to the delicate point. Laughing in
      rather a constrained fashion, he said:

They did not understand, and he had to explain at some length and very
      cautiously, to avoid shocking them, that she belonged to the dusky race of
      which they had only seen samples in pictures at Epinal. Then they became
      restless, perplexed, alarmed, as if he had proposed a union with the
      devil.

The son answered: “Perhaps a little less than that. She is black,
      but not disgustingly black. The cure''s cassock is black, but it is not
      uglier than a surplice which is white.”

Then, after many other questions, it was agreed that the parents should
      see this girl before coming; to any decision, and that the young fellow,
      whose, term of military service would be over in a month, should bring her
      to the house in order that they might examine her and decide by talking
      the matter over whether or not she was too dark to enter the Boitelle
      family.

Antoine accordingly announced that on Sunday, the 22d of May, the day of
      his discharge, he would start for Tourteville with his sweetheart.

She had put on, for this journey to the house of her lover''s parents, her
      most beautiful and most gaudy clothes, in which yellow, red and blue were
      the prevailing colors, so that she looked as if she were adorned for a
      national festival.

At the terminus, as they were leaving Havre, people stared at her, and
      Boitelle was proud of giving his arm to a person who commanded so much
      attention. Then, in the third-class carriage, in which she took a seat by
      his side, she aroused so much astonishment among the country folks that
      the people in the adjoining compartments stood up on their benches to look
      at her over the wooden partition which divides the compartments. A child,
      at sight of her, began to cry with terror, another concealed his face in
      his mother''s apron. Everything went off well, however, up to their arrival
      at their destination. But when the train slackened its rate of motion as
      they drew near Yvetot, Antoine felt ill at ease, as he would have done at
      a review when; he did not know his drill practice. Then, as he; leaned his
      head out, he recognized in the distance: his father, holding the bridle of
      the horse harnessed to a carryall, and his mother, who had come forward to
      the grating, behind which stood those who were expecting friends.

He alighted first, gave his hand to his sweetheart, and holding himself
      erect, as if he were escorting a general, he went to meet his family.

The mother, on seeing this black lady in variegated costume in her son''s
      company, remained so stupefied that she could not open her mouth; and the
      father found it hard to hold the horse, which the engine or the negress
      caused to rear continuously. But Antoine, suddenly filled with unmixed joy
      at seeing once more the old people, rushed forward with open arms,
      embraced his mother, embraced his father, in spite of the nag''s fright,
      and then turning toward his companion, at whom the passengers on the
      platform stopped to stare with amazement, he proceeded to explain:

“Here she is! I told you that, at first sight, she is not
      attractive; but as soon as you know her, I can assure you there''s not a
      better sort in the whole world. Say good-morning to her so that she may
      not feel badly.”

Thereupon Mere Boitelle, almost frightened out of her wits, made a sort of
      curtsy, while the father took off his cap, murmuring:

Then, without further delay, they climbed into the carryall, the two women
      at the back, on seats which made them jump up and down as the vehicle went
      jolting along the road, and the two men in front on the front seat.

Nobody spoke. Antoine, ill at ease, whistled a barrack-room air; his
      father whipped the nag; and his mother, from where she sat in the corner,
      kept casting sly glances at the negress, whose forehead and cheekbones
      shone in the sunlight like well-polished shoes.

It was a funny anecdote of long standing in the family. But, as his mother
      still remained silent, paralyzed by her emotion, he undertook himself to
      tell the story, laughing as he did so at the memorable incident. The
      father, who knew it by heart brightened at the opening words of the
      narrative; his wife soon followed his example; and the negress herself,
      when he reached the drollest part of it, suddenly gave vent to a laugh,
      such a loud, rolling torrent of laughter that the horse, becoming excited,
      broke into a gallop for a while.

They had scarcely reached the house and had all alighted, when Antoine
      conducted his sweetheart to a room, so that she might take off her dress,
      to avoid staining it, as she was going to prepare a nice dish, intended to
      win the old people''s affections through their stomachs. He drew his
      parents outside the house, and, with beating heart, asked:

They went into the house, where the good woman was somewhat affected at
      the spectacle of the negress engaged in cooking. She at once proceeded to
      assist her, with petticoats tucked up, active in spite of her age.

The meal was an excellent one, very long, very enjoyable. When they were
      taking a turn after dinner, Antoine took his father aside.

“My poor lad, she is really too black. If she were only a little
      less black, I would not go against you, but this is too much. One would
      think it was Satan!”

He did not press her, knowing how obstinate the old woman had always been,
      but he felt a tempest of disappointment sweeping over his heart. He was
      turning over in his mind what he ought to do, what plan he could devise,
      surprised, moreover, that she had not conquered them already as she had
      captivated himself. And they, all four, walked along through the wheat
      fields, having gradually relapsed into silence. Whenever they passed a
      fence they saw a countryman sitting on the stile, and a group of brats
      climbed up to stare at them, and every one rushed out into the road to see
      the “black” whore young Boitelle had brought home with him. At
      a distance they noticed people scampering across the fields just as when
      the drum beats to draw public attention to some living phenomenon. Pere
      and Mere Boitelle, alarmed at this curiosity, which was exhibited
      everywhere through the country at their approach, quickened their pace,
      walking side by side, and leaving their son far behind. His dark companion
      asked what his parents thought of her.

But on the village green people rushed out of all the houses in a flutter
      of excitement; and, at the sight of the gathering crowd, old Boitelle took
      to his heels, and regained his abode, while Antoine; swelling with rage,
      his sweetheart on his arm, advanced majestically under the staring eyes,
      which opened wide in amazement.

He understood that it was at an end, and there was no hope for him, that
      he could not marry his negress. She also understood it; and as they drew
      near the farmhouse they both began to weep. As soon as they had got back
      to the house, she once more took off her dress to aid the mother in the
      household duties, and followed her everywhere, to the dairy, to the
      stable, to the hen house, taking on herself the hardest part of the work,
      repeating always: “Let me do it, Madame Boitelle,” so that,
      when night came on, the old woman, touched but inexorable, said to her
      son: “She is a good girl, all the same. It''s a pity she is so black;
      but indeed she is too black. I could not get used to it. She must go back
      again. She is too, too black!”

“She will not consent. She thinks you are too black. You must go
      back again. I will go with you to the train. No matter—don''t fret. I
      am going to talk to them after you have started.”

He then took her to the railway station, still cheering her with hope,
      and, when he had kissed her, he put her into the train, which he watched
      as it passed out of sight, his eyes swollen with tears.

And when he had told this story, which was known all over the country,
      Antoine Boitelle would always add:

“From that time forward I have had no heart for anything—for
      anything at all. No trade suited me any longer, and so I became what I am—a
      night scavenger.”

“Yes, and I can''t say that my wife didn''t please me, seeing that I
      have fourteen children; but she is not the other one, oh, no—certainly
      not! The other one, mark you, my negress, she had only to give me one
      glance, and I felt as if I were in Heaven.”

This story was told during the hunting season at the Chateau Baneville.
      The autumn had been rainy and sad. The red leaves, instead of rustling
      under the feet, were rotting under the heavy downfalls.

The forest was as damp as it could be. From it came an odor of must, of
      rain, of soaked grass and wet earth; and the sportsmen, their backs
      hunched under the downpour, mournful dogs, with tails between their legs
      and hairs sticking to their sides, and the young women, with their clothes
      drenched, returned every evening, tired in body and in mind.

After dinner, in the large drawing-room, everybody played lotto, without
      enjoyment, while the wind whistled madly around the house. Then they tried
      telling stories like those they read in books, but no one was able to
      invent anything amusing. The hunters told tales of wonderful shots and of
      the butchery of rabbits; and the women racked their brains for ideas
      without revealing the imagination of Scheherezade. They were about to give
      up this diversion when a young woman, who was idly caressing the hand of
      an old maiden aunt, noticed a little ring made of blond hair, which she
      had often seen, without paying any attention to it.

She fingered it gently and asked, “Auntie, what is this ring? It
      looks as if it were made from the hair of a child.”

The old lady blushed, grew pale, then answered in a trembling voice:
      “It is sad, so sad that I never wish to speak of it. All the
      unhappiness of my life comes from that. I was very young then, and the
      memory has remained so painful that I weep every time I think of it.”

Immediately everybody wished to know the story, but the old lady refused
      to tell it. Finally, after they had coaxed her for a long time, she
      yielded. Here is the story:

“You have often heard me speak of the Santeze family, now extinct. I
      knew the last three male members of this family. They all died in the same
      manner; this hair belongs to the last one. He was thirteen when he killed
      himself for me. That seems strange to you, doesn''t it?

“Oh! it was a strange family—mad, if you will, but a charming
      madness, the madness of love. From father to son, all had violent passions
      which filled their whole being, which impelled them to do wild things,
      drove them to frantic enthusiasm, even to crime. This was born in them,
      just as burning devotion is in certain souls. Trappers have not the same
      nature as minions of the drawing-room. There was a saying: ''As passionate
      as a Santeze.'' This could be noticed by looking at them. They all had wavy
      hair, falling over their brows, curly beards and large eyes whose glance
      pierced and moved one, though one could not say why.

“The grandfather of the owner of this hair, of whom it is the last
      souvenir, after many adventures, duels and elopements, at about sixty-five
      fell madly in love with his farmer''s daughter. I knew them both. She was
      blond, pale, distinguished-looking, with a slow manner of talking, a quiet
      voice and a look so gentle that one might have taken her for a Madonna.
      The old nobleman took her to his home and was soon so captivated with her
      that he could not live without her for a minute. His daughter and
      daughter-in-law, who lived in the chateau, found this perfectly natural,
      love was such a tradition in the family. Nothing in regard to a passion
      surprised them, and if one spoke before them of parted lovers, even of
      vengeance after treachery, both said in the same sad tone: ''Oh, how he
      must have suffered to come to that point!'' That was all. They grew sad
      over tragedies of love, but never indignant, even when they were criminal.

“Now, one day a young man named Monsieur de Gradelle, who had been
      invited for the shooting, eloped with the young girl.

“Monsieur de Santeze remained calm as if nothing had happened, but
      one morning he was found hanging in the kennels, among his dogs.

“His son died in the same manner in a hotel in Paris during a
      journey which he made there in 1841, after being deceived by a singer from
      the opera.

“He left a twelve-year-old child and a widow, my mother''s sister.
      She came to my father''s house with the boy, while we were living at
      Bertillon. I was then seventeen.

“You have no idea how wonderful and precocious this Santeze child
      was. One might have thought that all the tenderness and exaltation of the
      whole race had been stored up in this last one. He was always dreaming and
      walking about alone in a great alley of elms leading from the chateau to
      the forest. I watched from my window this sentimental boy, who walked with
      thoughtful steps, his hands behind his back, his head bent, and at times
      stopping to raise his eyes as if he could see and understand things that
      were not comprehensible at his age.

“Often, after dinner on clear evenings, he would say to me: ''Let us
      go outside and dream, cousin.'' And we would go outside together in the
      park. He would stop quickly before a clearing where the white vapor of the
      moon lights the woods, and he would press my hand, saying: ''Look! look!
      but you don''t understand me; I feel it. If you understood me, we should be
      happy. One must love to know! I would laugh and then kiss this child, who
      loved me madly.

“Often, after dinner, he would sit on my mother''s knees. ''Come,
      auntie,'' he would say, ''tell me some love-stories.'' And my mother, as a
      joke, would tell him all the old legends of the family, all the passionate
      adventures of his forefathers, for thousands of them were current, some
      true and some false. It was their reputation for love and gallantry which
      was the ruin of every one of these men; they gloried in it and then
      thought that they had to live up to the renown of their house.

“The little fellow became exalted by these tender or terrible
      stories, and at times he would clap his hands, crying: ''I, too, I, too,
      know how to love, better than all of them!''

“Then, he began to court me in a timid and tender manner, at which
      every one laughed, it was, so amusing. Every morning I had some flowers
      picked by him, and every evening before going to his room he would kiss my
      hand and murmur: ''I love you!''

“I was guilty, very guilty, and I grieved continually about it, and
      I have been doing penance all my life; I have remained an old maid—or,
      rather, I have lived as a widowed fiancee, his widow.

“I was amused at this childish tenderness, and I even encouraged
      him. I was coquettish, as charming as with a man, alternately caressing
      and severe. I maddened this child. It was a game for me and a joyous
      diversion for his mother and mine. He was twelve! think of it! Who would
      have taken this atom''s passion seriously? I kissed him as often as he
      wished; I even wrote him little notes, which were read by our respective
      mothers; and he answered me by passionate letters, which I have kept.
      Judging himself as a man, he thought that our loving intimacy was secret.
      We had forgotten that he was a Santeze.

“This lasted for about a year. One evening in the park he fell at my
      feet and, as he madly kissed the hem of my dress, he kept repeating: ''I
      love you! I love you! I love you! If ever you deceive me, if ever you
      leave me for another, I''ll do as my father did.'' And he added in a hoarse
      voice, which gave me a shiver: ''You know what he did!''

“I stood there astonished. He arose, and standing on the tips of his
      toes in order to reach my ear, for I was taller than he, he pronounced my
      first name: ''Genevieve!'' in such a gentle, sweet, tender tone that I
      trembled all over. I stammered: ''Let us return! let us return!'' He said no
      more and followed me; but as we were going up the steps of the porch, he
      stopped me, saying: ''You know, if ever you leave me, I''ll kill myself.''

“This time I understood that I had gone too far, and I became quite
      reserved. One day, as he was reproaching me for this, I answered: ''You are
      now too old for jesting and too young for serious love. I''ll wait.''

“I thought that this would end the matter. In the autumn he was sent
      to a boarding-school. When he returned the following summer I was engaged
      to be married. He understood immediately, and for a week he became so
      pensive that I was quite anxious.

“On the morning of the ninth day I saw a little paper under my door
      as I got up. I seized it, opened it and read: ''You have deserted me and
      you know what I said. It is death to which you have condemned me. As I do
      not wish to be found by another than you, come to the park just where I
      told you last year that I loved you and look in the air.''

“I thought that I should go mad. I dressed as quickly as I could and
      ran wildly to the place that he had mentioned. His little cap was on the
      ground in the mud. It had been raining all night. I raised my eyes and saw
      something swinging among the leaves, for the wind was blowing a gale.

“I don''t know what I did after that. I must have screamed at first,
      then fainted and fallen, and finally have run to the chateau. The next
      thing that I remember I was in bed, with my mother sitting beside me.

“I thought that I had dreamed all this in a frightful nightmare. I
      stammered: ''And what of him, what of him, Gontran?'' There was no answer.
      It was true!

And the old maid stretched out her trembling hand in a despairing gesture.
      Then she blew her nose several times, wiped her eyes and continued:

“I broke off my marriage—without saying why. And I—I
      always have remained the—the widow of this thirteen-year-old boy.”
      Then her head fell on her breast and she wept for a long time.

As the guests were retiring for the night a large man, whose quiet she had
      disturbed, whispered in his neighbor''s ear: “Isn''t it unfortunate
      to, be so sentimental?”

A great English poet has just crossed over to France in order to greet
      Victor Hugo. All the newspapers are full of his name and he is the great
      topic of conversation in all drawing-rooms. Fifteen years ago I had
      occasion several times to meet Algernon Charles Swinburne. I will attempt
      to show him just as I saw him and to give an idea of the strange
      impression he made on me, which will remain with me throughout time.

I believe it was in 1867 or in 1868 that an unknown young Englishman came
      to Etretat and bought a little hut hidden under great trees. It was said
      that he lived there, always alone, in a strange manner; and he aroused the
      inimical surprise of the natives, for the inhabitants were sullen and
      foolishly malicious, as they always are in little towns.

They declared that this whimsical Englishman ate nothing but boiled,
      roasted or stewed monkey; that he would see no one; that he talked to
      himself hours at a time and many other surprising things that made people
      think that he was different from other men. They were surprised that he
      should live alone with a monkey. Had it been a cat or a dog they would
      have said nothing. But a monkey! Was that not frightful? What savage
      tastes the man must have!

I knew this young man only from seeing him in the streets. He was short,
      plump, without being fat, mild-looking, and he wore a little blond
      mustache, which was almost invisible.

Chance brought us together. This savage had amiable and pleasing manners,
      but he was one of those strange Englishmen that one meets here and there
      throughout the world.

Endowed with remarkable intelligence, he seemed to live in a fantastic
      dream, as Edgar Poe must have lived. He had translated into English a
      volume of strange Icelandic legends, which I ardently desired to see
      translated into French. He loved the supernatural, the dismal and
      grewsome, but he spoke of the most marvellous things with a calmness that
      was typically English, to which his gentle and quiet voice gave a
      semblance of reality that was maddening.

Full of a haughty disdain for the world, with its conventions, prejudices
      and code of morality, he had nailed to his house a name that was boldly
      impudent. The keeper of a lonely inn who should write on his door: “Travellers
      murdered here!” could not make a more sinister jest. I never had
      entered his dwelling, when one day I received an invitation to luncheon,
      following an accident that had occurred to one of his friends, who had
      been almost drowned and whom I had attempted to rescue.

Although I was unable to reach the man until he had already been rescued,
      I received the hearty thanks of the two Englishmen, and the following day
      I called upon them.

The friend was a man about thirty years old. He bore an enormous head on a
      child''s body—a body without chest or shoulders. An immense forehead,
      which seemed to have engulfed the rest of the man, expanded like a dome
      above a thin face which ended in a little pointed beard. Two sharp eyes
      and a peculiar mouth gave one the impression of the head of a reptile,
      while the magnificent brow suggested a genius.

A nervous twitching shook this peculiar being, who walked, moved, acted by
      jerks like a broken spring.

This was Algernon Charles Swinburne, son of an English admiral and
      grandson, on the maternal side, of the Earl of Ashburnham.

He strange countenance was transfigured when he spoke. I have seldom seen
      a man more impressive, more eloquent, incisive or charming in
      conversation. His rapid, clear, piercing and fantastic imagination seemed
      to creep into his voice and to lend life to his words. His brusque
      gestures enlivened his speech, which penetrated one like a dagger, and he
      had bursts of thought, just as lighthouses throw out flashes of fire,
      great, genial lights that seemed to illuminate a whole world of ideas.

The home of the two friends was pretty and by no means commonplace.
      Everywhere were paintings, some superb, some strange, representing
      different conceptions of insanity. Unless I am mistaken, there was a
      water-color which represented the head of a dead man floating in a
      rose-colored shell on a boundless ocean, under a moon with a human face.

Here and there I came across bones. I clearly remember a flayed hand on
      which was hanging some dried skin and black muscles, and on the snow-white
      bones could be seen the traces of dried blood.

The food was a riddle which I could not solve. Was it good? Was it bad? I
      could not say. Some roast monkey took away all desire to make a steady
      diet of this animal, and the great monkey who roamed about among us at
      large and playfully pushed his head into my glass when I wished to drink
      cured me of any desire I might have to take one of his brothers as a
      companion for the rest of my days.

As for the two men, they gave me the impression of two strange, original,
      remarkable minds, belonging to that peculiar race of talented madmen from
      among whom have arisen Poe, Hoffmann and many others.

If genius is, as is commonly believed, a sort of aberration of great
      minds, then Algernon Charles Swinburne is undoubtedly a genius.

Great minds that are healthy are never considered geniuses, while this
      sublime qualification is lavished on brains that are often inferior but
      are slightly touched by madness.

At any rate, this poet remains one of the first of his time, through his
      originality and polished form. He is an exalted lyrical singer who seldom
      bothers about the good and humble truth, which French poets are now
      seeking so persistently and patiently. He strives to set down dreams,
      subtle thoughts, sometimes great, sometimes visibly forced, but sometimes
      magnificent.

Two years later I found the house closed and its tenants gone. The
      furniture was being sold. In memory of them I bought the hideous flayed
      hand. On the grass an enormous square block of granite bore this simple
      word: “Nip.” Above this a hollow stone offered water to the
      birds. It was the grave of the monkey, who had been hanged by a young,
      vindictive negro servant. It was said that this violent domestic had been
      forced to flee at the point of his exasperated master''s revolver. After
      wandering about without home or food for several days, he returned and
      began to peddle barley-sugar in the streets. He was expelled from the
      country after he had almost strangled a displeased customer.

It was a men''s dinner party, and they were sitting over their cigars and
      brandy and discussing magnetism. Donato''s tricks and Charcot''s
      experiments. Presently, the sceptical, easy-going men, who cared nothing
      for religion of any sort, began telling stories of strange occurrences,
      incredible things which, nevertheless, had really occurred, so they said,
      falling back into superstitious beliefs, clinging to these last remnants
      of the marvellous, becoming devotees of this mystery of magnetism,
      defending it in the name of science. There was only one person who smiled,
      a vigorous young fellow, a great ladies'' man who was so incredulous that
      he would not even enter upon a discussion of such matters.

“Humbug! humbug! humbug! We need not discuss Donato, who is merely a
      very smart juggler. As for M. Charcot, who is said to be a remarkable man
      of science, he produces on me the effect of those story-tellers of the
      school of Edgar Poe, who end by going mad through constantly reflecting on
      queer cases of insanity. He has authenticated some cases of unexplained
      and inexplicable nervous phenomena; he makes his way into that unknown
      region which men are exploring every day, and unable always to understand
      what he sees, he recalls, perhaps, the ecclesiastical interpretation of
      these mysteries. I should like to hear what he says himself.”

The words of the unbeliever were listened to with a kind of pity, as if he
      had blasphemed in an assembly of monks.

Then, each mentioned some fact, some fantastic presentiment some instance
      of souls communicating with each other across space, or some case of the
      secret influence of one being over another. They asserted and maintained
      that these things had actually occurred, while the sceptic angrily
      repeated:

At last he rose, threw away his cigar, and with his hands in his pockets,
      said: “Well, I also have two stories to tell you, which I will
      afterwards explain. Here they are:

“I' WHERE id = '47483ce4-df10-44b3-81b8-ab924b78ab8b';
