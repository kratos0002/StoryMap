      the following day.

My father was informed that there were a number of dead bodies in the
      fields. He had them brought to our place so that they might be buried
      together. They were laid all along the great avenue of pines as fast as
      they brought them in, on both sides of the avenue, and as they began to
      smell unpleasant, their bodies were covered with earth until the deep
      trench could be dug. Thus one saw only their heads which seemed to
      protrude from the clayey earth and were almost as yellow, with their
      closed eyes.

I wanted to see them. But when I saw those two rows of frightful faces, I
      thought I should faint. However, I began to look at them, one by one,
      trying to guess what kind of men these had been.

The uniforms were concealed beneath the earth, and yet immediately, yes,
      immediately, my dear, I recognized the Frenchmen by their mustache!

Some of them had shaved on the very day of the battle, as though they
      wished to be elegant up to the last; others seemed to have a week''s
      growth, but all wore the French mustache, very plain, the proud mustache
      that seems to say: “Do not take me for my bearded friend, little
      one; I am a brother.”

And I cried, oh, I cried a great deal more than I should if I had not
      recognized them, the poor dead fellows.

The first thing I did was to look at the clock as I entered the
      waiting-room of the station at Loubain, and I found that I had to wait two
      hours and ten minutes for the Paris express.

I had walked twenty miles and felt suddenly tired. Not seeing anything on
      the station walls to amuse me, I went outside and stood there racking my
      brains to think of something to do. The street was a kind of boulevard,
      planted with acacias, and on either side a row of houses of varying shape
      and different styles of architecture, houses such as one only sees in a
      small town, and ascended a slight hill, at the extreme end of which there
      were some trees, as though it ended in a park.

From time to time a cat crossed the street and jumped over the gutters
      carefully. A cur sniffed at every tree and hunted for scraps from the
      kitchens, but I did not see a single human being, and I felt listless and
      disheartened. What could I do with myself? I was already thinking of the
      inevitable and interminable visit to the small cafe at the railway
      station, where I should have to sit over a glass of undrinkable beer and
      the illegible newspaper, when I saw a funeral procession coming out of a
      side street into the one in which I was, and the sight of the hearse was a
      relief to me. It would, at any rate, give me something to do for ten
      minutes.

Suddenly, however, my curiosity was aroused. The hearse was followed by
      eight gentlemen, one of whom was weeping, while the others were chatting
      together, but there was no priest, and I thought to myself:

“This is a non-religious funeral,” and then I reflected that a
      town like Loubain must contain at least a hundred freethinkers, who would
      have made a point of making a manifestation. What could it be, then? The
      rapid pace of the procession clearly proved that the body was to be buried
      without ceremony, and, consequently, without the intervention of the
      Church.

My idle curiosity framed the most complicated surmises, and as the hearse
      passed me, a strange idea struck me, which was to follow it, with the
      eight gentlemen. That would take up my time for an hour, at least, and I
      accordingly walked with the others, with a sad look on my face, and, on
      seeing this, the two last turned round in surprise, and then spoke to each
      other in a low voice.

No doubt they were asking each other whether I belonged to the town, and
      then they consulted the two in front of them, who stared at me in turn.
      This close scrutiny annoyed me, and to put an end to it I went up to them,
      and, after bowing, I said:

“I beg your pardon, gentlemen, for interrupting your conversation,
      but, seeing a civil funeral, I have followed it, although I did not know
      the deceased gentleman whom you are accompanying.”

The other gentleman, who evidently wished to tell me all about it, then
      said: “Yes and no. The clergy have refused to allow us the use of
      the church.”

On hearing this I uttered a prolonged “A-h!” of astonishment.
      I could not understand it at all, but my obliging neighbor continued:

“It is rather a long story. This young woman committed suicide, and
      that is the reason why she cannot be buried with any religious ceremony.
      The gentleman who is walking first, and who is crying, is her husband.”

“You surprise and interest me very much, monsieur. Shall I be
      indiscreet if I ask you to tell me the facts of the case? If I am
      troubling you, forget that I have said anything about the matter.”

“Not at all, not at all. Let us linger a little behind the others,
      and I will tell it you, although it is a very sad story. We have plenty of
      time before getting to the cemetery, the trees of which you see up yonder,
      for it is a stiff pull up this hill.”

“This young woman, Madame Paul Hamot, was the daughter of a wealthy
      merchant in the neighborhood, Monsieur Fontanelle. When she was a mere
      child of eleven, she had a shocking adventure; a footman attacked her and
      she nearly died. A terrible criminal case was the result, and the man was
      sentenced to penal servitude for life.

“The little girl grew up, stigmatized by disgrace, isolated, without
      any companions; and grown-up people would scarcely kiss her, for they
      thought that they would soil their lips if they touched her forehead, and
      she became a sort of monster, a phenomenon to all the town. People said to
      each other in a whisper: ''You know, little Fontanelle,'' and everybody
      turned away in the streets when she passed. Her parents could not even get
      a nurse to take her out for a walk, as the other servants held aloof from
      her, as if contact with her would poison everybody who came near her.

“It was pitiable to see the poor child go and play every afternoon.
      She remained quite by herself, standing by her maid and looking at the
      other children amusing themselves. Sometimes, yielding to an irresistible
      desire to mix with the other children, she advanced timidly, with nervous
      gestures, and mingled with a group, with furtive steps, as if conscious of
      her own disgrace. And immediately the mothers, aunts and nurses would come
      running from every seat and take the children entrusted to their care by
      the hand and drag them brutally away.

“Little Fontanelle remained isolated, wretched, without
      understanding what it meant, and then she began to cry, nearly heartbroken
      with grief, and then she used to run and hide her head in her nurse''s lap,
      sobbing.

“As she grew up, it was worse still. They kept the girls from her,
      as if she were stricken with the plague. Remember that she had nothing to
      learn, nothing; that she no longer had the right to the symbolical wreath
      of orange-flowers; that almost before she could read she had penetrated
      that redoubtable mystery which mothers scarcely allow their daughters to
      guess at, trembling as they enlighten them on the night of their marriage.

“When she went through the streets, always accompanied by her
      governess, as if, her parents feared some fresh, terrible adventure, with
      her eyes cast down under the load of that mysterious disgrace which she
      felt was always weighing upon her, the other girls, who were not nearly so
      innocent as people thought, whispered and giggled as they looked at her
      knowingly, and immediately turned their heads absently, if she happened to
      look at them. People scarcely greeted her; only a few men bowed to her,
      and the mothers pretended not to see her, while some young blackguards
      called her Madame Baptiste, after the name of the footman who had attacked
      her.

“Nobody knew the secret torture of her mind, for she hardly ever
      spoke, and never laughed, and her parents themselves appeared
      uncomfortable in her presence, as if they bore her a constant grudge for
      some irreparable fault.

“An honest man would not willingly give his hand to a liberated
      convict, would he, even if that convict were his own son? And Monsieur and
      Madame Fontanelle looked on their daughter as they would have done on a
      son who had just been released from the hulks. She was pretty and pale,
      tall, slender, distinguished-looking, and she would have pleased me very
      much, monsieur, but for that unfortunate affair.

“Well, when a new sub-prefect was appointed here, eighteen months
      ago, he brought his private secretary with him. He was a queer sort of
      fellow, who had lived in the Latin Quarter, it appears. He saw
      Mademoiselle Fontanelle and fell in love with her, and when told of what
      occurred, he merely said:

“''Bah! That is just a guarantee for the future, and I would rather
      it should have happened before I married her than afterward. I shall live
      tranquilly with that woman.''

“He paid his addresses to her, asked for her hand and married her,
      and then, not being deficient in assurance, he paid wedding calls, as if
      nothing had happened. Some people returned them, others did not; but, at
      last, the affair began to be forgotten, and she took her proper place in
      society.

“She adored her husband as if he had been a god; for, you must
      remember, he had restored her to honor and to social life, had braved
      public opinion, faced insults, and, in a word, performed such a courageous
      act as few men would undertake, and she felt the most exalted and tender
      love for him.

“When she became enceinte, and it was known, the most particular
      people and the greatest sticklers opened their doors to her, as if she had
      been definitely purified by maternity.

“It is strange, but so it is, and thus everything was going on as
      well as possible until the other day, which was the feast of the patron
      saint of our town. The prefect, surrounded by his staff and the
      authorities, presided at the musical competition, and when he had finished
      his speech the distribution of medals began, which Paul Hamot, his private
      secretary, handed to those who were entitled to them.

“As you know, there are always jealousies and rivalries, which make
      people forget all propriety. All the ladies of the town were there on the
      platform, and, in his turn, the bandmaster from the village of Mourmillon
      came up. This band was only to receive a second-class medal, for one
      cannot give first-class medals to everybody, can one? But when the private
      secretary handed him his badge, the man threw it in his face and
      exclaimed:

“''You may keep your medal for Baptiste. You owe him a first-class
      one, also, just as you do me.''

“There were a number of people there who began to laugh. The common
      herd are neither charitable nor refined, and every eye was turned toward
      that poor lady. Have you ever seen a woman going mad, monsieur? Well, we
      were present at the sight! She got up and fell back on her chair three
      times in succession, as if she wished to make her escape, but saw that she
      could not make her way through the crowd, and then another voice in the
      crowd exclaimed:

“And a great uproar, partly of laughter and partly of indignation,
      arose. The word was repeated over and over again; people stood on tiptoe
      to see the unhappy woman''s face; husbands lifted their wives up in their
      arms, so that they might see her, and people asked:

“She did not move now on her state chair, but sat just as if she had
      been put there for the crowd to look at. She could not move, nor conceal
      herself, nor hide her face. Her eyelids blinked quickly, as if a vivid
      light were shining on them, and she breathed heavily, like a horse that is
      going up a steep hill, so that it almost broke one''s heart to see her.
      Meanwhile, however, Monsieur Hamot had seized the ruffian by the throat,
      and they were rolling on the ground together, amid a scene of
      indescribable confusion, and the ceremony was interrupted.

“An hour later, as the Hamots were returning home, the young woman,
      who had not uttered a word since the insult, but who was trembling as if
      all her nerves had been set in motion by springs, suddenly sprang over the
      parapet of the bridge and threw herself into the river before her husband
      could prevent her. The water is very deep under the arches, and it was two
      hours before her body was recovered. Of course, she was dead.”

“It was, perhaps, the best thing she could do under the
      circumstances. There are some things which cannot be wiped out, and now
      you understand why the clergy refused to have her taken into church. Ah!
      If it had been a religious funeral the whole town would have been present,
      but you can understand that her suicide added to the other affair and made
      families abstain from attending her funeral; and then, it is not an easy
      matter here to attend a funeral which is performed without religious
      rites.”

We passed through the cemetery gates and I waited, much moved by what I
      had heard, until the coffin had been lowered into the grave, before I went
      up to the poor fellow who was sobbing violently, to press his hand warmly.
      He looked at me in surprise through his tears and then said:

This subject of Latin that has been dinned into our ears for some time
      past recalls to my mind a story—a story of my youth.

I was finishing my studies with a teacher, in a big central town, at the
      Institution Robineau, celebrated through the entire province for the
      special attention paid there to the study of Latin.

For the past ten years, the Robineau Institute beat the imperial lycee of
      the town at every competitive examination, and all the colleges of the
      subprefecture, and these constant successes were due, they said, to an
      usher, a simple usher, M. Piquedent, or rather Pere Piquedent.

He was one of those middle-aged men quite gray, whose real age it is
      impossible to tell, and whose history we can guess at first glance. Having
      entered as an usher at twenty into the first institution that presented
      itself so that he could proceed to take first his degree of Master of Arts
      and afterward the degree of Doctor of Laws, he found himself so enmeshed
      in this routine that he remained an usher all his life. But his love for
      Latin did not leave him and harassed him like an unhealthy passion. He
      continued to read the poets, the prose writers, the historians, to
      interpret them and penetrate their meaning, to comment on them with a
      perseverance bordering on madness.

One day, the idea came into his head to oblige all the students in his
      class to answer him in Latin only; and he persisted in this resolution
      until at last they were capable of sustaining an entire conversation with
      him just as they would in their mother tongue. He listened to them, as a
      leader of an orchestra listens to his musicians rehearsing, and striking
      his desk every moment with his ruler, he exclaimed:

“Monsieur Plantel, your way of expressing yourself is altogether
      French and in no way Latin. You must understand the genius of a language.
      Look here, listen to me.”

Now, it came to pass that the pupils of the Institution Robineau carried
      off, at the end of the year, all the prizes for composition, translation,
      and Latin conversation.

Next year, the principal, a little man, as cunning as an ape, whom he
      resembled in his grinning and grotesque appearance, had had printed on his
      programmes, on his advertisements, and painted on the door of his
      institution:

“Two honor prizes at the general examinations in competition with
      all the lycees and colleges of France.”

For ten years the Institution Robineau triumphed in the same fashion. Now
      my father, allured by these successes, sent me as a day pupil to
      Robineau''s—or, as we called it, Robinetto or Robinettino''s—and
      made me take special private lessons from Pere Piquedent at the rate of
      five francs per hour, out of which the usher got two francs and the
      principal three francs. I was then eighteen, and was in the philosophy
      class.

These private lessons were given in a little room looking out on the
      street. It so happened that Pere Piquedent, instead of talking Latin to
      me, as he did when teaching publicly in the institution, kept telling me
      his troubles in French. Without relations, without friends, the poor man
      conceived an attachment to me, and poured out his misery to me.

The other ushers disgusted him. He knew nobody in the town, since he had
      no time to devote to making acquaintances.

“Not even the nights, my friend, and that is the hardest thing on
      me. The dream of my life is to have a room with my own furniture, my own
      books, little things that belong to myself and which others may not touch.
      And I have nothing of my own, nothing except my trousers and my
      frock-coat, nothing, not even my mattress and my pillow! I have not four
      walls to shut myself up in, except when I come to give a lesson in this
      room. Do you see what this means—a man forced to spend his life
      without ever having the right, without ever finding the time, to shut
      himself up all alone, no matter where, to think, to reflect, to work, to
      dream? Ah! my dear boy, a key, the key of a door which one can lock—this
      is happiness, mark you, the only happiness!

“Here, all day long, teaching all those restless rogues, and during
      the night the dormitory with the same restless rogues snoring. And I have
      to sleep in the bed at the end of two rows of beds occupied by these
      youngsters whom I must look after. I can never be alone, never! If I go
      out I find the streets full of people, and, when I am tired of walking, I
      go into some cafe crowded with smokers and billiard players. I tell you
      what, it is the life of a galley slave.”

“What, my little friend? I am not a shoemaker, or a joiner, or a
      hatter, or a baker, or a hairdresser. I only know Latin, and I have no
      diploma which would enable me to sell my knowledge at a high price. If I
      were a doctor I would sell for a hundred francs what I now sell for a
      hundred sous; and I would supply it probably of an inferior quality, for
      my title would be enough to sustain my reputation.”

“I have no rest in life except in the hours spent with you. Don''t be
      afraid! you''ll lose nothing by that. I''ll make it up to you in the
      class-room by making you speak twice as much Latin as the others.”

One day, I grew bolder, and offered him a cigarette. He stared at me in
      astonishment at first, then he gave a glance toward the door.

And we went and leaned our elbows on the windowsill looking on the street,
      holding concealed in our hands the little rolls of tobacco. Just opposite
      to us was a laundry. Four women in loose white waists were passing hot,
      heavy irons over the linen spread out before them, from which a warm steam
      arose.

Suddenly, another, a fifth, carrying on her arm a large basket which made
      her stoop, came out to take the customers their shirts, their
      handkerchiefs, and their sheets. She stopped on the threshold as if she
      were already fatigued; then, she raised her eyes, smiled as she saw us
      smoking, flung at us, with her left hand, which was free, the sly kiss
      characteristic of a free-and-easy working-woman, and went away at a slow
      place, dragging her feet as she went.

She was a woman of about twenty, small, rather thin, pale, rather pretty,
      with a roguish air and laughing eyes beneath her ill-combed fair hair.

And he spoke with emotion about the misery of the people. He had a heart
      which swelled with lofty democratic sentiment, and he referred to the
      fatiguing pursuits of the working class with phrases borrowed from
      Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and with sobs in his throat.

Next day, as we were leaning our elbows on the same window sill, the same
      woman perceived us and cried out to us:

“Good-day, scholars!” in a comical sort of tone, while she
      made a contemptuous gesture with her hands.

I flung her a cigarette, which she immediately began to smoke. And the
      four other ironers rushed out to the door with outstretched hands to get
      cigarettes also.

And each day a friendly intercourse was established between the
      working-women of the pavement and the idlers of the boarding school.

Pere Piquedent was really a comical sight. He trembled at being noticed,
      for he might lose his position; and he made timid and ridiculous gestures,
      quite a theatrical display of love signals, to which the women responded
      with a regular fusillade of kisses.

A perfidious idea came into my mind. One day, on entering our room, I said
      to the old usher in a low tone:

“You would not believe it, Monsieur Piquedent, I met the little
      washerwoman! You know the one I mean, the woman who had the basket, and I
      spoke to her!”

“She said to me—why, she said she thought you were very nice.
      The fact of the matter is, I believe, I believe, that she is a little in
      love with you.” I saw that he was growing pale.

But every day I pretended that I had met the little laundress and that I
      had spoken to her about him, so that in the end he believed me, and sent
      her ardent and earnest kisses.

Now it happened that one morning, on my way to the boarding school, I
      really came across her. I accosted her without hesitation, as if I had
      known her for the last ten years.

“Oh! no, I am not fooling! He keeps talking of you all through the
      lesson. I bet that he''ll marry you!”

She ceased laughing. The idea of marriage makes every girl serious. Then
      she repeated, with an incredulous air:

And he wrote a long letter, tenderly affectionate, full of phrases and
      circumlocutions, metaphors and similes, philosophy and academic gallantry;
      and I took on myself the responsibility of delivering it to the young
      woman.

“How well he writes! It is easy to see he has got education! Does he
      really mean to marry me?”

“She loves you, Monsieur Piquedent, and I believe her to be a decent
      girl. It is not right to lead her on and then abandon her.”

I confess I had at the time no plan. I was playing a practical joke a
      schoolboy joke, nothing more. I had been aware of the simplicity of the
      old usher, his innocence and his weakness. I amused myself without asking
      myself how it would turn out. I was eighteen, and I had been for a long
      time looked upon at the lycee as a sly practical joker.

So it was agreed that Pere Piquedent and I should set out in a hack for
      the ferry of Queue de Vache, that we should there pick up Angele, and that
      I should take them into my boat, for in those days I was fond of boating.
      I would then bring them to the Ile des Fleurs, where the three of us would
      dine. I had inflicted myself on them, the better to enjoy my triumph, and
      the usher, consenting to my arrangement, proved clearly that he was losing
      his head by thus risking the loss of his position.

When we arrived at the ferry, where my boat had been moored since morning,
      I saw in the grass, or rather above the tall weeds of the bank, an
      enormous red parasol, resembling a monstrous wild poppy. Beneath the
      parasol was the little laundress in her Sunday clothes. I was surprised.
      She was really pretty, though pale; and graceful, though with a rather
      suburban grace.

Pere Piquedent raised his hat and bowed. She put out her hand toward him,
      and they stared at one another without uttering a word. Then they stepped
      into my boat, and I took the oars. They were seated side by side near the
      stern.

She dipped her hand into the water, skimming the surface, making a thin,
      transparent film like a sheet of glass, which made a soft plashing along
      the side of the boat.

When they were in the restaurant, she took it on herself to speak, and
      ordered dinner, fried fish, a chicken, and salad; then she led us on
      toward the isle, which she knew perfectly.

Until dessert, no question of love arose. I had treated them to champagne,
      and Pere Piquedent was tipsy. Herself slightly the worse, she called out
      to him:

It was thus that these two silly creatures promised marriage to each other
      through the trick of a young scamp. But I did not believe that it was
      serious, nor, indeed, did they, perhaps.

“What do I know? We shall see. With five thousand francs we could do
      many things. You don''t want me to go and live in your boarding school, do
      you?”

“Then we''ll buy a grocer''s shop! Oh! what luck! we''ll buy a grocer''s
      shop. Not on a big scale, of course; with five thousand francs one does
      not go far.”

We got back into the boat. The night was dark, very dark. I saw clearly,
      however, that he had caught her by the waist, and that they were hugging
      each other again and again.

It was a frightful catastrophe. Our escapade was discovered, with the
      result that Pere Piquedent was dismissed. And my father, in a fit of
      anger, sent me to finish my course of philosophy at Ribaudet''s school.

Six months later I took my degree of Bachelor of Arts. Then I went to
      study law in Paris, and did not return to my native town till two years
      later.

At the corner of the Rue de Serpent a shop caught my eye. Over the door
      were the words: “Colonial Products—Piquedent”; then
      underneath, so as to enlighten the most ignorant: “Grocery.”

Piquedent raised his head, left his female customer, and rushed toward me
      with outstretched hands.

A beautiful woman, very plump, abruptly left the cashier''s desk and flung
      herself on my breast. I had some difficulty in recognizing her, she had
      grown so stout.

It was nothing but an accident, an accident pure and simple. On that
      particular evening the princess'' rooms were open, and as they appeared
      dark after the brilliantly lighted parlors, Baron d''Etraille, who was
      tired of standing, inadvertently wandered into an empty bedroom.

He looked round for a chair in which to have a doze, as he was sure his
      wife would not leave before daylight. As soon as he became accustomed to
      the light of the room he distinguished the big bed with its azure-and-gold
      hangings, in the middle of the great room, looking like a catafalque in
      which love was buried, for the princess was no longer young. Behind it, a
      large bright surface looked like a lake seen at a distance. It was a large
      mirror, discreetly covered with dark drapery, that was very rarely let
      down, and seemed to look at the bed, which was its accomplice. One might
      almost fancy that it had reminiscences, and that one might see in it
      charming female forms and the gentle movement of loving arms.

The baron stood still for a moment, smiling, almost experiencing an
      emotion on the threshold of this chamber dedicated to love. But suddenly
      something appeared in the looking-glass, as if the phantoms which he had
      evoked had risen up before him. A man and a woman who had been sitting on
      a low couch concealed in the shadow had arisen, and the polished surface,
      reflecting their figures, showed that they were kissing each other before
      separating.

Baron d''Etraille recognized his wife and the Marquis de Cervigne. He
      turned and went away like a man who is fully master of himself, and waited
      till it was day before taking away the baroness; but he had no longer any
      thoughts of sleeping.

“Madame, I saw you just now in Princesse de Raynes'' room; I need say
      no more, and I am not fond either of reproaches, acts of violence, or of
      ridicule. As I wish to avoid all such things, we shall separate without
      any scandal. Our lawyers will settle your position according to my orders.
      You will be free to live as you please when you are no longer under my
      roof; but, as you will continue to bear my name, I must warn you that
      should any scandal arise I shall show myself inflexible.”

He was more astonished and sad than unhappy. He had loved her dearly
      during the first period of their married life; but his ardor had cooled,
      and now he often amused himself elsewhere, either in a theatre or in
      society, though he always preserved a certain liking for the baroness.

She was very young, hardly four-and-twenty, small, slight—too slight—and
      very fair. She was a true Parisian doll: clever, spoiled, elegant,
      coquettish, witty, with more charm than real beauty. He used to say
      familiarly to his brother, when speaking of her:

“My wife is charming, attractive, but—there is nothing to lay
      hold of. She is like a glass of champagne that is all froth; when you get
      to the wine it is very good, but there is too little of it, unfortunately.”

He walked up and down the room in great agitation, thinking of a thousand
      things. At one moment he was furious, and felt inclined to give the
      marquis a good thrashing, or to slap his face publicly, in the club. But
      he decided that would not do, it would not be good form; he would be
      laughed at, and not his rival, and this thought wounded his vanity. So he
      went to bed, but could not sleep. Paris knew in a few days that the Baron
      and Baroness d''Etraille had agreed to an amicable separation on account of
      incompatibility of temper. No one suspected anything, no one laughed, and
      no one was astonished.

The baron, however, to avoid meeting his wife, travelled for a year, then
      spent the summer at the seaside, and the autumn in shooting, returning to
      Paris for the winter. He did not meet the baroness once.

He did not even know what people said about her. In any case, she took
      care to respect appearances, and that was all he asked for.

He became dreadfully bored, travelled again, restored his old castle of
      Villebosc, which took him two years; then for over a year he entertained
      friends there, till at last, tired of all these so-called pleasures, he
      returned to his mansion in the Rue de Lille, just six years after the
      separation.

He was now forty-five, with a good crop of gray hair, rather stout, and
      with that melancholy look characteristic of those who have been handsome,
      sought after, and liked, but who are deteriorating, daily.

A month after his return to Paris, he took cold on coming out of his club,
      and had such a bad cough that his medical man ordered him to Nice for the
      rest of the winter.

He reached the station only a few minutes before the departure of the
      train on Monday evening, and had barely time to get into a carriage, with
      only one other occupant, who was sitting in a corner so wrapped in furs
      and cloaks that he could not even make out whether it was a man or a
      woman, as nothing of the figure could be seen. When he perceived that he
      could not find out, he put on his travelling cap, rolled himself up in his
      rugs, and stretched out comfortably to sleep.

He did not wake until the day was breaking, and looked at once at his
      fellow-traveller, who had not stirred all night, and seemed still to be
      sound asleep.

M. d''Etraille made use of the opportunity to brush his hair and his beard,
      and to try to freshen himself up a little generally, for a night''s travel
      does not improve one''s appearance when one has attained a certain age.

As one grows older one wakes up in a very different condition. Dull eyes,
      red, swollen cheeks, dry lips, hair and beard disarranged, impart an old,
      fatigued, worn-out look to the face.

The engine whistled, the train stopped, and his neighbor moved. No doubt
      he was awake. They started off again, and then a slanting ray of sunlight
      shone into the carriage and on the sleeper, who moved again, shook
      himself, and then his face could be seen.

It was a young, fair, pretty, plump woman, and the baron looked at her in
      amazement. He did not know what to think. He could really have sworn that
      it was his wife, but wonderfully changed for the better: stouter —why
      she had grown as stout as he was, only it suited her much better than it
      did him.

She looked at him calmly, did not seem to recognize him, and then slowly
      laid aside her wraps. She had that quiet assurance of a woman who is sure
      of herself, who feels that on awaking she is in her full beauty and
      freshness.

The baron was really bewildered. Was it his wife, or else as like her as
      any sister could be? Not having seen her for six years, he might be
      mistaken.

She yawned, and this gesture betrayed her. She turned and looked at him
      again, calmly, indifferently, as if she scarcely saw him, and then looked
      out of the window again.

Yes; it was surely his wife. How could he possibly have doubted it? There
      could certainly not be two noses like that, and a thousand recollections
      flashed through his mind. He felt the old feeling of the intoxication of
      love stealing over him, and he called to mind the sweet odor of her skin,
      her smile when she put her arms on to his shoulders, the soft intonations
      of her voice, all her graceful, coaxing ways.

But how she had changed and improved! It was she and yet not she. She
      seemed riper, more developed, more of a woman, more seductive, more
      desirable, adorably desirable.

And this strange, unknown woman, whom he had accidentally met in a railway
      carriage, belonged to him; he had only to say to her:

He had formerly slept in her arms, existed only in her love, and now he
      had found her again certainly, but so changed that he scarcely knew her.
      It was another, and yet it was she herself. It was some one who had been
      born and had formed and grown since he had left her. It was she, indeed;
      she whom he had loved, but who was now altered, with a more assured smile
      and greater self-possession. There were two women in one, mingling a great
      part of what was new and unknown with many sweet recollections of the
      past. There was something singular, disturbing, exciting about it —a
      kind of mystery of love in which there floated a delicious confusion. It
      was his wife in a new body and in new flesh which lips had never pressed.

And he thought that in a few years nearly every thing changes in us; only
      the outline can be recognized, and sometimes even that disappears.

The blood, the hair, the skin, all changes and is renewed, and when people
      have not seen each other for a long time, when they meet they find each
      other totally different beings, although they are the same and bear the
      same name.

And the heart also can change. Ideas may be modified and renewed, so that
      in forty years of life we may, by gradual and constant transformations,
      become four or five totally new and different beings.

He dwelt on this thought till it troubled him; it had first taken
      possession of him when he surprised her in the princess'' room. He was not
      the least angry; it was not the same woman that he was looking at —that
      thin, excitable little doll of those days.

What was he to do? How should he address her? and what could he say to
      her? Had she recognized him?

The train stopped again. He got up, bowed, and said: “Bertha, do you
      want anything I could bring you?”

She looked at him from head to foot, and answered, without showing the
      slightest surprise, or confusion, or anger, but with the most perfect
      indifference:

He got out and walked up and down the platform a little in order to
      recover himself, and, as it were, to recover his senses after a fall. What
      should he do now? If he got into another carriage it would look as if he
      were running away. Should he be polite or importunate? That would look as
      if he were asking for forgiveness. Should he speak as if he were her
      master? He would look like a fool, and, besides, he really had no right to
      do so.

During his absence she had hastily arranged her dress and hair, and was
      now lying stretched out on the seat, radiant, and without showing any
      emotion.

He turned to her, and said: “My dear Bertha, since this singular
      chance has brought up together after a separation of six years—a
      quite friendly separation—are we to continue to look upon each other
      as irreconcilable enemies? We are shut up together, tete-a-tete, which is
      so much the better or so much the worse. I am not going to get into
      another carriage, so don''t you think it is preferable to talk as friends
      till the end of our journey?”

Then he suddenly stopped, really not knowing what to say; but as he had
      plenty of assurance, he sat down on the middle seat, and said:

“Well, I see I must pay my court to you; so much the better. It is,
      however, really a pleasure, for you are charming. You cannot imagine how
      you have improved in the last six years. I do not know any woman who could
      give me that delightful sensation which I experienced just now when you
      emerged from your wraps. I really could not have thought such a change
      possible.”

Without moving her head or looking at him, she said: “I cannot say
      the same with regard to you; you have certainly deteriorated a great deal.”

“Why?” was her reply. “I am only stating facts. I don''t
      suppose you intend to offer me your love? It must, therefore, be a matter
      of perfect indifference to you what I think about you. But I see it is a
      painful subject, so let us talk of something else. What have you been
      doing since I last saw you?”

He was very nearly saying something brutal, but he checked himself; and
      kissed his wife''s hand:

He went on: “As you have acceded to my first request, shall we now
      talk without any bitterness?”

“Bitterness? I don''t feel any; you are a complete stranger to me; I
      am only trying to keep up a difficult conversation.”

He was still looking at her, fascinated in spite of her harshness, and he
      felt seized with a brutal Beside, the desire of the master.

“I am forty-five”; and then he added: “I forgot to ask
      after Princesse de Raynes. Are you still intimate with her?”

“My dear Bertha, I have changed my mind. You are my wife, and I
      expect you to come with me to-day. You have, I think, improved both
      morally and physically, and I am going to take you back again. I am your
      husband, and it is my right to do so.”

She was stupefied, and looked at him, trying to divine his thoughts; but
      his face was resolute and impenetrable.

“So much the worse for you,” was his reply. “The law
      gives me the power, and I mean to use it.”

They were nearing Marseilles, and the train whistled and slackened speed.
      The baroness rose, carefully rolled up her wraps, and then, turning to her
      husband, said:

“My dear Raymond, do not make a bad use of this tete-a tete which I
      had carefully prepared. I wished to take precautions, according to your
      advice, so that I might have nothing to fear from you or from other
      people, whatever might happen. You are going to Nice, are you not?”

“Not at all; just listen to me, and I am sure that you will leave me
      in peace. In a few moments, when we get to the station, you will see the
      Princesse de Raynes and Comtesse Henriot waiting for me with their
      husbands. I wished them to see as, and to know that we had spent the night
      together in the railway carriage. Don''t be alarmed; they will tell it
      everywhere as a most surprising fact.

“I told you just now that I had most carefully followed your advice
      and saved appearances. Anything else does not matter, does it? Well, in
      order to do so, I wished to be seen with you. You told me carefully to
      avoid any scandal, and I am avoiding it, for, I am afraid—I am
      afraid—”

She waited till the train had quite stopped, and as her friends ran up to
      open the carriage door, she said:

The princess stretched out her arms to embrace her,—and the baroness
      said, painting to the baron, who was dumb with astonishment, and was
      trying to get at the truth:

“You do not recognize Raymond? He has certainly changed a good deal,
      and he agreed to come with me so that I might not travel alone. We take
      little trips like this occasionally, like good friends who cannot live
      together. We are going to separate here; he has had enough of me already.”

She put out her hand, which he took mechanically, and then she jumped out
      on to the platform among her friends, who were waiting for her.

The baron hastily shut the carriage door, for he was too much disturbed to
      say a word or come to any determination. He heard his wife''s voice and
      their merry laughter as they went away.

He never saw her again, nor did he ever discover whether she had told him
      a lie or was speaking the truth.

How is it that the sunlight gives us such joy? Why does this radiance when
      it falls on the earth fill us with the joy of living? The whole sky is
      blue, the fields are green, the houses all white, and our enchanted eyes
      drink in those bright colors which bring delight to our souls. And then
      there springs up in our hearts a desire to dance, to run, to sing, a happy
      lightness of thought, a sort of enlarged tenderness; we feel a longing to
      embrace the sun.

The blind, as they sit in the doorways, impassive in their eternal
      darkness, remain as calm as ever in the midst of this fresh gaiety, and,
      not understanding what is taking place around them, they continually check
      their dogs as they attempt to play.

When, at the close of the day, they are returning home on the arm of a
      young brother or a little sister, if the child says: “It was a very
      fine day!” the other answers: “I could notice that it was
      fine. Loulou wouldn''t keep quiet.”

I knew one of these men whose life was one of the most cruel martyrdoms
      that could possibly be conceived.

He was a peasant, the son of a Norman farmer. As long as his father and
      mother lived, he was more or less taken care of; he suffered little save
      from his horrible infirmity; but as soon as the old people were gone, an
      atrocious life of misery commenced for him. Dependent on a sister of his,
      everybody in the farmhouse treated him as a beggar who is eating the bread
      of strangers. At every meal the very food he swallowed was made a subject
      of reproach against him; he was called a drone, a clown, and although his
      brother-in-law had taken possession of his portion of the inheritance, he
      was helped grudgingly to soup, getting just enough to save him from
      starving.

His face was very pale and his two big white eyes looked like wafers. He
      remained unmoved at all the insults hurled at him, so reserved that one
      could not tell whether he felt them.

Moreover, he had never known any tenderness, his mother having always
      treated him unkindly and caring very little for him; for in country places
      useless persons are considered a nuisance, and the peasants would be glad
      to kill the infirm of their species, as poultry do.

As soon as he finished his soup he went and sat outside the door in summer
      and in winter beside the fireside, and did not stir again all the evening.
      He made no gesture, no movement; only his eyelids, quivering from some
      nervous affection, fell down sometimes over his white, sightless orbs. Had
      he any intellect, any thinking faculty, any consciousness of his own
      existence? Nobody cared to inquire.

For some years things went on in this fashion. But his incapacity for work
      as well as his impassiveness eventually exasperated his relatives, and he
      became a laughingstock, a sort of butt for merriment, a prey to the inborn
      ferocity, to the savage gaiety of the brutes who surrounded him.

It is easy to imagine all the cruel practical jokes inspired by his
      blindness. And, in order to have some fun in return for feeding him, they
      now converted his meals into hours of pleasure for the neighbors and of
      punishment for the helpless creature himself.

The peasants from the nearest houses came to this entertainment; it was
      talked about from door to door, and every day the kitchen of the farmhouse
      was full of people. Sometimes they placed before his plate, when he was
      beginning to eat his soup, some cat or dog. The animal instinctively
      perceived the man''s infirmity, and, softly approaching, commenced eating
      noiselessly, lapping up the soup daintily; and, when they lapped the food
      rather noisily, rousing the poor fellow''s attention, they would prudently
      scamper away to avoid the blow of the spoon directed at random by the
      blind man!

Then the spectators ranged along the wall would burst out laughing, nudge
      each other and stamp their feet on the floor. And he, without ever
      uttering a word, would continue eating with his right hand, while
      stretching out his left to protect his plate.

Another time they made him chew corks, bits of wood, leaves or even filth,
      which he was unable to distinguish.

After this they got tired even of these practical jokes, and the
      brother-in-law, angry at having to support him always, struck him, cuffed
      him incessantly, laughing at his futile efforts to ward off or return the
      blows. Then came a new pleasure—the pleasure of smacking his face.
      And the plough-men, the servant girls and even every passing vagabond were
      every moment giving him cuffs, which caused his eyelashes to twitch
      spasmodically. He did not know where to hide himself and remained with his
      arms always held out to guard against people coming too close to him.

He was placed somewhere on the high-road on market-days, and as soon as he
      heard the sound of footsteps or the rolling of a vehicle, he reached out
      his hat, stammering:

One winter the ground was covered with snow, and it was freezing hard. His
      brother-in-law led him one morning a great distance along the high road in
      order that he might solicit alms. The blind man was left there all day;
      and when night came on, the brother-in-law told the people of his house
      that he could find no trace of the mendicant. Then he added:

“Pooh! best not bother about him! He was cold and got someone to
      take him away. Never fear! he''s not lost. He''ll turn up soon enough
      tomorrow to eat the soup.”

After long hours of waiting, stiffened with the cold, feeling that he was
      dying, the blind man began to walk. Being unable to find his way along the
      road, owing to its thick coating of ice, he went on at random, falling
      into ditches, getting up again, without uttering a sound, his sole object
      being to find some house where he could take shelter.

But, by degrees, the descending snow made a numbness steal over him, and
      his feeble limbs being incapable of carrying him farther, he sat down in
      the middle of an open field. He did not get up again.

The white flakes which fell continuously buried him, so that his body,
      quite stiff and stark, disappeared under the incessant accumulation of
      their rapidly thickening mass, and nothing was left to indicate the place
      where he lay.

His relatives made a pretence of inquiring about him and searching for him
      for about a week. They even made a show of weeping.

The winter was severe, and the thaw did not set in quickly. Now, one
      Sunday, on their way to mass, the farmers noticed a great flight of crows,
      who were whirling incessantly above the open field, and then descending
      like a shower of black rain at the same spot, ever going and coming.

The following week these gloomy birds were still there. There was a crowd
      of them up in the air, as if they had gathered from all corners of the
      horizon, and they swooped down with a great cawing into the shining snow,
      which they covered like black patches, and in which they kept pecking
      obstinately. A young fellow went to see what they were doing and
      discovered the body of the blind man, already half devoured, mangled. His
      wan eyes had disappeared, pecked out by the long, voracious beaks.

And I can never feel the glad radiance of sunlit days without sadly
      remembering and pondering over the fate of the beggar who was such an
      outcast in life that his horrible death was a relief to all who had known
      him.

They had loved each other before marriage with a pure and lofty love. They
      had first met on the sea-shore. He had thought this young girl charming,
      as she passed by with her light-colored parasol and her dainty dress amid
      the marine landscape against the horizon. He had loved her, blond and
      slender, in these surroundings of blue ocean and spacious sky. He could
      not distinguish the tenderness which this budding woman awoke in him from
      the vague and powerful emotion which the fresh salt air and the grand
      scenery of surf and sunshine and waves aroused in his soul.

She, on the other hand, had loved him because he courted her, because he
      was young, rich, kind, and attentive. She had loved him because it is
      natural for young girls to love men who whisper sweet nothings to them.

So, for three months, they had lived side by side, and hand in hand. The
      greeting which they exchanged in the morning before the bath, in the
      freshness of the morning, or in the evening on the sand, under the stars,
      in the warmth of a calm night, whispered low, very low, already had the
      flavor of kisses, though their lips had never met.

Each dreamed of the other at night, each thought of the other on awaking,
      and, without yet having voiced their sentiments, each longing for the
      other, body and soul.

After marriage their love descended to earth. It was at first a tireless,
      sensuous passion, then exalted tenderness composed of tangible poetry,
      more refined caresses, and new and foolish inventions. Every glance and
      gesture was an expression of passion.

But, little by little, without even noticing it, they began to get tired
      of each other. Love was still strong, but they had nothing more to reveal
      to each other, nothing more to learn from each other, no new tale of
      endearment, no unexpected outburst, no new way of expressing the
      well-known, oft-repeated verb.

They tried, however, to rekindle the dwindling flame of the first love.
      Every day they tried some new trick or desperate attempt to bring back to
      their hearts the uncooled ardor of their first days of married life. They
      tried moonlight walks under the trees, in the sweet warmth of the summer
      evenings: the poetry of mist-covered beaches; the excitement of public
      festivals.

He looked at her with a questioning glance, seeing that she was thinking
      of something which she did not wish to tell.

He smiled: “Of course, I understand—you mean in one of the
      cafes which are commonly called bohemian.”

“Yes, that''s it. But take me to one of the big places, one where you
      are known, one where you have already supped—no—dined—well,
      you know—I—I—oh! I will never dare say it!”

“Well, I—I—I want to be taken for your sweetheart—there!
      and I want the boys, who do not know that you are married, to take me for
      such; and you too—I want you to think that I am your sweetheart for
      one hour, in that place which must hold so many memories for you. There!
      And I will play that I am your sweetheart. It''s awful, I know—I am
      abominably ashamed, I am as red as a peony. Don''t look at me!”

Toward seven o''clock they went up the stairs of one of the big cafes on
      the Boulevard, he, smiling, with the look of a conqueror, she, timid,
      veiled, delighted. They were immediately shown to one of the luxurious
      private dining-rooms, furnished with four large arm-chairs and a red plush
      couch. The head waiter entered and brought them the menu. Paul handed it
      to his wife.

After handing his coat to the waiter, he ordered dinner and champagne. The
      waiter looked at the young woman and smiled. He took the order and
      murmured:

Henriette was pleased to hear that this man knew her husband''s name. They
      sat on the couch, side by side, and began to eat.

Ten candles lighted the room and were reflected in the mirrors all around
      them, which seemed to increase the brilliancy a thousand-fold. Henriette
      drank glass after glass in order to keep up her courage, although she felt
      dizzy after the first few glasses. Paul, excited by the memories which
      returned to him, kept kissing his wife''s hands. His eyes were sparkling.

She was feeling strangely excited in this new place, restless, pleased, a
      little guilty, but full of life. Two waiters, serious, silent, accustomed
      to seeing and forgetting everything, to entering the room only when it was
      necessary and to leaving it when they felt they were intruding, were
      silently flitting hither and thither.

Toward the middle of the dinner, Henriette was well under the influence of
      champagne. She was prattling along fearlessly, her cheeks flushed, her
      eyes glistening.

He hesitated, a little perplexed, not knowing whether he should hide his
      adventures or boast of them.

“Because it''s dreadful when you think of it—all those women—and
      always—always the same thing. Oh! it''s dreadful, just the same—more
      than a hundred women!”

He was surprised that she should think that dreadful, and answered, with
      the air of superiority which men take with women when they wish to make
      them understand that they have said something foolish:

“Because with one woman you have a real bond of love which attaches
      you to her, while with a hundred women it''s not the same at all. There is
      no real love. I don''t understand how a man can associate with such women.”

She remained thoughtful, staring at her champagne glass. It was full
      —she drank it in one gulp; then putting it back on the table, she
      threw her arms around her husband''s neck and murmured in his ear:

He threw his arms around her in a passionate embrace. A waiter, who was
      just entering, backed out, closing the door discreetly. In about five
      minutes the head waiter came back, solemn and dignified, bringing the
      fruit for dessert. She was once more holding between her fingers a full
      glass, and gazing into the amber liquid as though seeking unknown things.
      She murmured in a dreamy voice:

The small engine attached to the Neuilly steam-tram whistled as it passed
      the Porte Maillot to warn all obstacles to get out of its way and puffed
      like a person out of breath as it sent out its steam, its pistons moving
      rapidly with a noise as of iron legs running. The train was going along
      the broad avenue that ends at the Seine. The sultry heat at the close of a
      July day lay over the whole city, and from the road, although there was
      not a breath of wind stirring, there arose a white, chalky, suffocating,
      warm dust, which adhered to the moist skin, filled the eyes and got into
      the lungs. People stood in the doorways of their houses to try and get a
      breath of air.

The windows of the steam-tram were open and the curtains fluttered in the
      wind. There were very few passengers inside, because on warm days people
      preferred the outside or the platforms. They consisted of stout women in
      peculiar costumes, of those shopkeepers'' wives from the suburbs, who made
      up for the distinguished looks which they did not possess by ill-assumed
      dignity; of men tired from office-work, with yellow faces, stooped
      shoulders, and with one shoulder higher than the other, in consequence of,
      their long hours of writing at a desk. Their uneasy and melancholy faces
      also spoke of domestic troubles, of constant want of money, disappointed
      hopes, for they all belonged to the army of poor, threadbare devils who
      vegetate economically in cheap, plastered houses with a tiny piece of
      neglected garden on the outskirts of Paris, in the midst of those fields
      where night soil is deposited.

A short, corpulent man, with a puffy face, dressed all in black and
      wearing a decoration in his buttonhole, was talking to a tall, thin man,
      dressed in a dirty, white linen suit, the coat all unbuttoned, with a
      white Panama hat on his head. The former spoke so slowly and hesitatingly
      that it occasionally almost seemed as if he stammered; he was Monsieur
      Caravan, chief clerk in the Admiralty. The other, who had formerly been
      surgeon on board a merchant ship, had set up in practice in Courbevoie,
      where he applied the vague remnants of medical knowledge which he had
      retained after an adventurous life, to the wretched population of that
      district. His name was Chenet, and strange rumors were current as to his
      morality.

Monsieur Caravan had always led the normal life of a man in a Government
      office. For the last thirty years he had invariably gone the same way to
      his office every morning, and had met the same men going to business at
      the same time, and nearly on the same spot, and he returned home every
      evening by the same road, and again met the same faces which he had seen
      growing old. Every morning, after buying his penny paper at the corner of
      the Faubourg Saint Honore, he bought two rolls, and then went to his
      office, like a culprit who is giving himself up to justice, and got to his
      desk as quickly as possible, always feeling uneasy; as though he were
      expecting a rebuke for some neglect of duty of which he might have been
      guilty.

Nothing had ever occurred to change the monotonous order of his existence,
      for no event affected him except the work of his office, perquisites,
      gratuities, and promotion. He never spoke of anything but of his duties,
      either at the office, or at home—he had married the portionless
      daughter of one of his colleagues. His mind, which was in a state of
      atrophy from his depressing daily work, had no other thoughts, hopes or
      dreams than such as related to the office, and there was a constant source
      of bitterness that spoilt every pleasure that he might have had, and that
      was the employment of so many naval officials, tinsmiths, as they were
      called because of their silver-lace as first-class clerks; and every
      evening at dinner he discussed the matter hotly with his wife, who shared
      his angry feelings, and proved to their own satisfaction that it was in
      every way unjust to give places in Paris to men who ought properly to have
      been employed in the navy.

He was old now, and had scarcely noticed how his life was passing, for
      school had merely been exchanged for the office without any intermediate
      transition, and the ushers, at whom he had formerly trembled, were
      replaced by his chiefs, of whom he was terribly afraid. When he had to go
      into the rooms of these official despots, it made him tremble from head to
      foot, and that constant fear had given him a very awkward manner in their
      presence, a humble demeanor, and a kind of nervous stammering.

He knew nothing more about Paris than a blind man might know who was led
      to the same spot by his dog every day; and if he read the account of any
      uncommon events or scandals in his penny paper, they appeared to him like
      fantastic tales, which some pressman had made up out of his own head, in
      order to amuse the inferior employees. He did not read the political news,
      which his paper frequently altered as the cause which subsidized it might
      require, for he was not fond of innovations, and when he went through the
      Avenue of the Champs-Elysees every evening, he looked at the surging crowd
      of pedestrians, and at the stream of carriages, as a traveller might who
      has lost his way in a strange country.

As he had completed his thirty years of obligatory service that year, on
      the first of January, he had had the cross of the Legion of Honor bestowed
      upon him, which, in the semi-military public offices, is a recompense for
      the miserable slavery—the official phrase is, loyal services—of
      unfortunate convicts who are riveted to their desk. That unexpected
      dignity gave him a high and new idea of his own capacities, and altogether
      changed him. He immediately left off wearing light trousers and fancy
      waistcoats, and wore black trousers and long coats, on which his ribbon,
      which was very broad, showed off better. He got shaved every morning,
      manicured his nails more carefully, changed his linen every two days, from
      a legitimate sense of what was proper, and out of respect for the national
      Order, of which he formed a part, and from that day he was another
      Caravan, scrupulously clean, majestic and condescending.

At home, he said, “my cross,” at every moment, and he had
      become so proud of it, that he could not bear to see men wearing any other
      ribbon in their button-holes. He became especially angry on seeing strange
      orders: “Which nobody ought to be allowed to wear in France,”
      and he bore Chenet a particular grudge, as he met him on a tram-car every
      evening, wearing a decoration of one kind or another, white, blue, orange,
      or green.

The conversation of the two men, from the Arc de Triomphe to Neuilly, was
      always the same, and on that day they discussed, first of all, various
      local abuses which disgusted them both, and the Mayor of Neuilly received
      his full share of their censure. Then, as invariably happens in the
      company of medical men, Caravan began to enlarge on the chapter of illness,
      as in that manner, he hoped to obtain a little gratuitous advice, if he
      was careful not to show his hand. His mother had been causing him no
      little anxiety for some time; she had frequent and prolonged fainting
      fits, and, although she was ninety, she would not take care of herself.

Caravan grew quite tender-hearted when he mentioned her great age, and
      more than once asked Doctor Chenet, emphasizing the word doctor—although
      he was not fully qualified, being only an Offcier de Sante—whether
      he had often met anyone as old as that. And he rubbed his hands with
      pleasure; not, perhaps, that he cared very much about seeing the good
      woman last forever here on earth, but because the long duration of his
      mother''s life was, as it were an earnest of old age for himself, and he
      continued:

“In my family, we last long, and I am sure that, unless I meet with
      an accident, I shall not die until I am very old.”

The doctor looked at him with pity, and glanced for a moment at his
      neighbor''s red face, his short, thick neck, his “corporation,”
      as Chenet called it to himself, his two fat, flabby legs, and the
      apoplectic rotundity of the old official; and raising the white Panama hat
      from his head, he said with a snigger:

“I am not so sure of that, old fellow; your mother is as tough as
      nails, and I should say that your life is not a very good one.”

This rather upset Caravan, who did not speak again until the tram put them
      down at their destination, where the two friends got out, and Chenet asked
      his friend to have a glass of vermouth at the Cafe du Globe, opposite,
      which both of them were in the habit of frequenting. The proprietor, who
      was a friend of theirs, held out to them two fingers, which they shook
      across the bottles of the counter; and then they joined three of their
      friends, who were playing dominoes, and who had been there since midday.
      They exchanged cordial greetings, with the usual question: “Anything
      new?” And then the three players continued their game, and held out
      their hands without looking up, when the others wished them “Good-night,”
      and then they both went home to dinner.

Caravan lived in a small two-story house in Courbevaie, near where the
      roads meet; the ground floor was occupied by a hair-dresser. Two bed
      rooms, a dining-room and a kitchen, formed the whole of their apartments,
      and Madame Caravan spent nearly her whole time in cleaning them up, while
      her daughter, Marie-Louise, who was twelve, and her son, Phillip-Auguste,
      were running about with all the little, dirty, mischievous brats of the
      neighborhood, and playing in the gutter.

Caravan had installed his mother, whose avarice was notorious in the
      neighborhood, and who was terribly thin, in the room above them. She was
      always cross, and she never passed a day without quarreling and flying
      into furious tempers. She would apostrophize the neighbors, who were
      standing at their own doors, the coster-mongers, the street-sweepers, and
      the street-boys, in the most violent language; and the latter, to have
      their revenge, used to follow her at a distance when she went out, and
      call out rude things after her.

A little servant from Normandy, who was incredibly giddy and thoughtless,
      performed the household work, and slept on the second floor in the same
      room as the old woman, for fear of anything happening to her in the night.

When Caravan got in, his wife, who suffered from a chronic passion for
      cleaning, was polishing up the mahogany chairs that were scattered about
      the room with a piece of flannel. She always wore cotton gloves, and
      adorned her head with a cap ornamented with many colored ribbons, which
      was always tilted over one ear; and whenever anyone caught her polishing,
      sweeping, or washing, she used to say:

“I am not rich; everything is very simple in my house, but
      cleanliness is my luxury, and that is worth quite as much as any other.”

As she was gifted with sound, obstinate, practical common sense, she led
      her husband in everything. Every evening during dinner, and afterwards
      when they were in their room, they talked over the business of the office
      for a long time, and although she was twenty years younger than he was, he
      confided everything to her as if she took the lead, and followed her
      advice in every matter.

She had never been pretty, and now she had grown ugly; in addition to
      that, she was short and thin, while her careless and tasteless way of
      dressing herself concealed her few small feminine attractions, which might
      have been brought out if she had possessed any taste in dress. Her skirts
      were always awry, and she frequently scratched herself, no matter on what
      part of her person, totally indifferent as to who might see her, and so
      persistently, that anyone who saw her might think that she was suffering
      from something like the itch. The only adornments that she allowed herself
      were silk ribbons, which she had in great profusion, and of various colors
      mixed together, in the pretentious caps which she wore at home.

He fell into a chair, in consternation, for that was the fourth time on
      which he had forgotten a commission that he had promised to do for her.

“It is a fatality,” he said; “it is no good for me to
      think of it all day long, for I am sure to forget it in the evening.”

“Yes, a great piece of news; another tinsmith has been appointed
      second chief clerk.” She became very serious, and said:

“So he succeeds Ramon; this was the very post that I wanted you to
      have. And what about Ramon?”

“There is nothing more to be done in that shop now. And what is the
      name of the new commissioner?”

“''Bonassot-Toulon. Born in 1851. Student Commissioner in 1871.
      Sub-Commissioner in 1875.'' Has he been to sea?” she continued. At
      that question Caravan''s looks cleared up, and he laughed until his sides
      shook.

“As much as Balin—as much as Baffin, his chief.” And he
      added an old office joke, and laughed more than ever:

“It would not even do to send them by water to inspect the
      Point-du-Jour, for they would be sick on the penny steamboats on the
      Seine.”

But she remained as serious as if she had not heard him, and then she said
      in a low voice, as she scratched her chin:

“If we only had a Deputy to fall back upon. When the Chamber hears
      everything that is going on at the Admiralty, the Minister will be turned
      out——”

She was interrupted by a terrible noise on the stairs. Marie-Louise and
      Philippe-Auguste, who had just come in from the gutter, were slapping each
      other all the way upstairs. Their mother rushed at them furiously, and
      taking each of them by an arm she dragged them into the room, shaking them
      vigorously; but as soon as they saw their father, they rushed up to him,
      and he kissed them affectionately, and taking one of them on each knee,
      began to talk to them.

Philippe-Auguste was an ugly, ill-kempt little brat, dirty from head to
      foot, with the face of an idiot, and Marie-Louise was already like her
      mother—spoke like her, repeated her words, and even imitated her
      movements. She also asked him whether there was anything fresh at the
      office, and he replied merrily:

“Your friend, Ramon, who comes and dines here every Sunday, is going
      to leave us, little one. There is a new second head-clerk.”

He stopped laughing, and did not reply, and in order to create a
      diversion, he said, addressing his wife, who was cleaning the windows:

Madame Caravan left off rubbing, turned round pulled her cap up, as it had
      fallen quite on to her back, and said with trembling lips:

“Ah! yes; let us talk about your mother, for she has made a pretty
      scene. Just imagine: a short time ago Madame Lebaudin, the hairdresser''s
      wife, came upstairs to borrow a packet of starch of me, and, as I was not
      at home, your mother chased her out as though she were a beggar; but I
      gave it to the old woman. She pretended not to hear, as she always does
      when one tells her unpleasant truths, but she is no more deaf than I am,
      as you know. It is all a sham, and the proof of it is, that she went up to
      her own room immediately, without saying a word.”

Caravan, embarrassed, did not utter a word, and at that moment the little
      servant came in to announce dinner. In order to let his mother know, he
      took a broom-handle, which always stood in a corner, and rapped loudly on
      the ceiling three times, and then they went into the dining-room. Madame
      Caravan, junior, helped the soup, and waited for the old woman, but she
      did not come, and as the soup was getting cold, they began to eat slowly,
      and when their plates were empty, they waited again, and Madame Caravan,
      who was furious, attacked her husband:

Not knowing which side to take, he sent Marie-Louise to fetch her
      grandmother, and he sat motionless, with his eyes cast down, while his
      wife tapped her glass angrily with her knife. In about a minute, the door
      flew open suddenly, and the child came in again, out of breath and very
      pale, and said hurriedly:

Caravan jumped up, threw his table-napkin down, and rushed upstairs, while
      his wife, who thought it was some trick of her mother-in-law''s, followed
      more slowly, shrugging her shoulders, as if to express her doubt. When
      they got upstairs, however, they found the old woman lying at full length
      in the middle of the room; and when they turned her over, they saw that
      she was insensible and motionless, while her skin looked more wrinkled and
      yellow than usual, her eyes were closed, her teeth clenched, and her thin
      body was stiff.

“Bah! She has only fainted again, that is all, and she has done it
      to prevent us from dining comfortably, you may be sure of that.”

They put her on the bed, undressed her completely, and Caravan, his wife,
      and the servant began to rub her; but, in spite of their efforts, she did
      not recover consciousness, so they sent Rosalie, the servant, to fetch
      Doctor Chenet. He lived a long way off, on the quay, going towards
      Suresnes, and so it was a considerable time before he arrived. He came at
      last, however, and, after having looked at the old woman, felt her pulse,
      and listened for a heart beat, he said: “It is all over.”

Caravan threw himself on the body, sobbing violently; he kissed his
      mother''s rigid face, and wept so that great tears fell on the dead woman''s
      face like drops of water, and, naturally, Madame Caravan, junior, showed a
      decorous amount of grief, and uttered feeble moans as she stood behind her
      husband, while she rubbed her eyes vigorously.

But, suddenly, Caravan raised himself up, with his thin hair in disorder,
      and, looking very ugly in his grief, said:

The doctor stooped over the body, and, handling it with professional
      dexterity, as a shopkeeper might do, when showing off his goods, he said:

He raised the eyelid, and the old woman''s eye appeared altogether
      unaltered, unless, perhaps, the pupil was rather larger, and Caravan felt
      a severe shock at the sight. Then Monsieur Chenet took her thin arm,
      forced the fingers open, and said, angrily, as if he had been
      contradicted:

Caravan fell on the bed, and almost bellowed, while his wife, still
      whimpering, did what was necessary.

She brought the night-table, on which she spread a towel and placed four
      wax candles on it, which she lighted; then she took a sprig of box, which
      was hanging over the chimney glass, and put it between the four candles,
      in a plate, which she filled with clean water, as she had no holy water.
      But, after a moment''s rapid reflection, she threw a pinch of salt into the
      water, no doubt thinking she was performing some sort of act of
      consecration by doing that, and when she had finished, she remained
      standing motionless, and the doctor, who had been helping her, whispered
      to her:

She nodded assent, and, going up to her husband, who was still on his
      knees, sobbing, she raised him up by one arm, while Chenet took him by the
      other.

They put him into a chair, and his wife kissed his forehead, and then
      began to lecture him. Chenet enforced her words and preached firmness,
      courage, and resignation—the very things which are always wanting in
      such overwhelming misfortunes—and then both of them took him by the
      arms again and led him out.

He was crying like a great child, with convulsive sobs; his arms hanging
      down, and his legs weak, and he went downstairs without knowing what he
      was doing, and moving his feet mechanically. They put him into the chair
      which he always occupied at dinner, in front of his empty soup plate. And
      there he sat, without moving, his eyes fixed on his glass, and so
      stupefied with grief, that he could not even think.

In a corner, Madame Caravan was talking with the doctor and asking what
      the necessary formalities were, as she wanted to obtain practical
      information. At last, Monsieur Chenet, who appeared to be waiting for
      something, took up his hat and prepared to go, saying that he had not
      dined yet; whereupon she exclaimed:

“What! you have not dined? Why, stay here, doctor; don''t go. You
      shall have whatever we have, for, of course, you understand that we do not
      fare sumptuously.” He made excuses and refused, but she persisted,
      and said: “You really must stay; at times like this, people like to
      have friends near them, and, besides that, perhaps you will be able to
      persuade my husband to take some nourishment; he must keep up his
      strength.”

She gave Rosalie, who seemed to have lost her head, some orders, and then
      sat down, “to pretend to eat,” as she said, “to keep the
      doctor company.”

The soup was brought in again, and Monsieur Chenet took two helpings. Then
      there came a dish of tripe, which exhaled a smell of onions, and which
      Madame Caravan made up her mind to taste.

“It is excellent,” the doctor said, at which she smiled, and,
      turning to her husband, she said:

“Do take a little, my poor Alfred, only just to put something in
      your stomach. Remember that you have got to pass the night watching by
      her!”

He held out his plate, docilely, just as he would have gone to bed, if he
      had been told to, obeying her in everything, without resistance and
      without reflection, and he ate; the doctor helped himself three times,
      while Madame Caravan, from time to time, fished out a large piece at the
      end of her fork, and swallowed it with a sort of studied indifference.

“By Jove! That is what I am very fond of.” And this time,
      Madame Caravan helped everybody. She even filled the saucers that were
      being scraped by the children, who, being left to themselves, had been
      drinking wine without any water, and were now kicking each other under the
      table.

Chenet remembered that Rossini, the composer, had been very fond of that
      Italian dish, and suddenly he exclaimed:

Nobody listened to him, however. Madame Caravan, who had suddenly grown
      thoughtful, was thinking of all the probable consequences of the event,
      while her husband made bread pellets, which he put on the table-cloth, and
      looked at with a fixed, idiotic stare. As he was devoured by thirst, he
      was continually raising his glass full of wine to his lips, and the
      consequence was that his mind, which had been upset by the shock and
      grief, seemed to become vague, and his ideas danced about as digestion
