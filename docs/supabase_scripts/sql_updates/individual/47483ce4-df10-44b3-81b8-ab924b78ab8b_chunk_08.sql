When the meal was over they once more stretched out on the dead donkey and
      slept. At nightfall Labouise awoke and shook his comrade, who was snoring
      like a buzzsaw. “Come on, sister,” he ordered.

Maillochon began to row. As they had plenty of time they went up the Seine
      slowly. They coasted along the reaches covered with water-lilies, and the
      heavy, mud-covered boat slipped over the lily pads and bent the flowers,
      which stood up again as soon as they had passed.

When they reached the wall of the Eperon, which separates the
      Saint-Germain forest from the Maisons-Laffitte Park, Labouise stopped his
      companion and explained his idea to him. Maillochon was moved by a
      prolonged, silent laugh.

They threw into the water the grass which had covered the body, took the
      animal by the feet and hid it behind some bushes. Then they got into their
      boat again and went to Maisons-Laffitte.

The night was perfectly black when they reached the wine shop of old man
      Jules. As soon as the dealer saw them he came up, shook hands with them
      and sat down at their table. They began to talk of one thing and another.
      By eleven o''clock the last customer had left and old man Jules winked at
      Labouise and asked: “Well, have you got any?”

Chicot dug his hands into his flannel shirt, drew out the ears of a rabbit
      and declared: “Three francs a pair!”

Then began a long discussion about the price. Two francs sixty-five and
      the two rabbits were delivered. As the two men were getting up to go, old
      man Jules, who had been watching them, exclaimed:

The man, growing eager, kept asking: “What is it? Something big?
      Perhaps we might make a deal.”

Labouise, who seemed perplexed, pretended to consult Maillochon with a
      glance. Then he answered in a slow voice: “This is how it is. We
      were in the bushes at Eperon when something passed right near us, to the
      left, at the end of the wall. Mailloche takes a shot and it drops. We
      skipped on account of the game people. I can''t tell you what it is,
      because I don''t know. But it''s big enough. But what is it? If I told you
      I''d be lying, and you know, sister, between us everything''s above-board.”

Labouise answered: “Might be and then again it might not! Venison?—uh!
      uh!—might be a little big for that! Mind you, I don''t say it''s a
      doe, because I don''t know, but it might be.”

Labouise stretched out his hand, exclaiming: “No, it''s not that!
      It''s not a buck. I should have seen the horns. No, it''s not a buck!”

“Because, sister, from now on I sell from where I stand. Plenty of
      people will buy. All you have to do is to take a walk over there, find the
      thing and take it. No risk for me.”

“He''s there, I swear!—first bush to the left. What it is, I
      don''t know. But it''s not a buck, I''m positive. It''s for you to find out
      what it is. Twenty-five francs, cash down!”

Then he took out four big five-franc pieces from the cash drawer, and the
      two friends pocketed the money. Labouise arose, emptied his glass and
      left. As he was disappearing in the shadows he turned round to exclaim:
      “It isn''t a buck. I don''t know what it is!—but it''s there.
      I''ll give you back your money if you find nothing!”

And he disappeared in the darkness. Maillochon, who was following him,
      kept punching him in the back to express his joy.

As we were still talking about Pranzini, M. Maloureau, who had been
      attorney general under the Empire, said: “Oh! I formerly knew a very
      curious affair, curious for several reasons, as you will see.

“I was at that time imperial attorney in one of the provinces. I had
      to take up the case which has remained famous under the name of the Moiron
      case.

“Monsieur Moiron, who was a teacher in the north of France, enjoyed
      an excellent reputation throughout the whole country. He was a person of
      intelligence, quiet, very religious, a little taciturn; he had married in
      the district of Boislinot, where he exercised his profession. He had had
      three children, who had died of consumption, one after the other. From
      this time he seemed to bestow upon the youngsters confided to his care all
      the tenderness of his heart. With his own money he bought toys for his
      best scholars and for the good boys; he gave them little dinners and
      stuffed them with delicacies, candy and cakes: Everybody loved this good
      man with his big heart, when suddenly five of his pupils died, in a
      strange manner, one after the other. It was supposed that there was an
      epidemic due to the condition of the water, resulting from drought; they
      looked for the causes without being able to discover them, the more so
      that the symptoms were so peculiar. The children seemed to be attacked by
      a feeling of lassitude; they would not eat, they complained of pains in
      their stomachs, dragged along for a short time, and died in frightful
      suffering.

“A post-mortem examination was held over the last one, but nothing
      was discovered. The vitals were sent to Paris and analyzed, and they
      revealed the presence of no toxic substance.

“For a year nothing new developed; then two little boys, the best
      scholars in the class, Moiron''s favorites, died within four days of each
      other. An examination of the bodies was again ordered, and in both of them
      were discovered tiny fragments of crushed glass. The conclusion arrived at
      was that the two youngsters must imprudently have eaten from some
      carelessly cleaned receptacle. A glass broken over a pail of milk could
      have produced this frightful accident, and the affair would have been
      pushed no further if Moiron''s servant had not been taken sick at this
      time. The physician who was called in noticed the same symptoms he had
      seen in the children. He questioned her and obtained the admission that
      she had stolen and eaten some candies that had been bought by the teacher
      for his scholars.

“On an order from the court the schoolhouse was searched, and a
      closet was found which was full of toys and dainties destined for the
      children. Almost all these delicacies contained bits of crushed glass or
      pieces of broken needles!

“Moiron was immediately arrested; but he seemed so astonished and
      indignant at the suspicion hanging over him that he was almost released.
      How ever, indications of his guilt kept appearing, and baffled in my mind
      my first conviction, based on his excellent reputation, on his whole life,
      on the complete absence of any motive for such a crime.

“Why should this good, simple, religious man have killed little
      children, and the very children whom he seemed to love the most, whom he
      spoiled and stuffed with sweet things, for whom he spent half his salary
      in buying toys and bonbons?

“One must consider him insane to believe him guilty of this act.
      Now, Moiron seemed so normal, so quiet, so rational and sensible that it
      seemed impossible to adjudge him insane.

“However, the proofs kept growing! In none of the candies that were
      bought at the places where the schoolmaster secured his provisions could
      the slightest trace of anything suspicious be found.

“He then insisted that an unknown enemy must have opened his
      cupboard with a false key in order to introduce the glass and the needles
      into the eatables. And he made up a whole story of an inheritance
      dependent on the death of a child, determined on and sought by some
      peasant, and promoted thus by casting suspicions on the schoolmaster. This
      brute, he claimed, did not care about the other children who were forced
      to die as well.

“The story was possible. The man appeared to be so sure of himself
      and in such despair that we should undoubtedly have acquitted him,
      notwithstanding the charges against him, if two crushing discoveries had
      not been made, one after the other.

“The first one was a snuffbox full of crushed glass; his own
      snuffbox, hidden in the desk where he kept his money!

“He explained this new find in an acceptable manner, as the ruse of
      the real unknown criminal. But a mercer from Saint-Marlouf came to the
      presiding judge and said that a gentleman had several times come to his
      store to buy some needles; and he always asked for the thinnest needles he
      could find, and would break them to see whether they pleased him. The man
      was brought forward in the presence of a dozen or more persons, and
      immediately recognized Moiron. The inquest revealed that the schoolmaster
      had indeed gone into Saint-Marlouf on the days mentioned by the tradesman.

“I will pass over the terrible testimony of children on the choice
      of dainties and the care which he took to have them eat the things in his
      presence, and to remove the slightest traces.

“Public indignation demanded capital punishment, and it became more
      and more insistent, overturning all objections.

“Moiron was condemned to death, and his appeal was rejected. Nothing
      was left for him but the imperial pardon. I knew through my father that
      the emperor would not grant it.

“One morning, as I was working in my study, the visit of the prison
      almoner was announced. He was an old priest who knew men well and
      understood the habits of criminals. He seemed troubled, ill at ease,
      nervous. After talking for a few minutes about one thing and another, he
      arose and said suddenly: ''If Moiron is executed, monsieur, you will have
      put an innocent man to death.''

“Then he left without bowing, leaving me behind with the deep
      impression made by his words. He had pronounced them in such a sincere and
      solemn manner, opening those lips, closed and sealed by the secret of
      confession, in order to save a life.

“An hour later I left for Paris, and my father immediately asked
      that I be granted an audience with the emperor.

“The following day I was received. His majesty was working in a
      little reception room when we were introduced. I described the whole case,
      and I was just telling about the priest''s visit when a door opened behind
      the sovereign''s chair and the empress, who supposed he was alone,
      appeared. His majesty, Napoleon, consulted her. As soon as she had heard
      the matter, she exclaimed: ''This man must be pardoned. He must, since he
      is innocent.''

“Until then I had ardently desired a change of sentence. And now I
      suddenly felt myself the toy, the dupe of a cunning criminal who had
      employed the priest and confession as a last means of defence.

“I explained my hesitancy to their majesties. The emperor remained
      undecided, urged on one side by his natural kindness and held back on the
      other by the fear of being deceived by a criminal; but the empress, who
      was convinced that the priest had obeyed a divine inspiration, kept
      repeating: ''Never mind! It is better to spare a criminal than to kill an
      innocent man!'' Her advice was taken. The death sentence was commuted to
      one of hard labor.

“A few years later I heard that Moiron had again been called to the
      emperor''s attention on account of his exemplary conduct in the prison at
      Toulon and was now employed as a servant by the director of the
      penitentiary.

“For a long time I heard nothing more of this man. But about two
      years ago, while I was spending a summer near Lille with my cousin, De
      Larielle, I was informed one evening, just as we were sitting down to
      dinner, that a young priest wished to speak to me.

“I had him shown in and he begged me to come to a dying man who
      desired absolutely to see me. This had often happened to me in my long
      career as a magistrate, and, although I had been set aside by the
      Republic, I was still often called upon in similar circumstances. I
      therefore followed the priest, who led me to a miserable little room in a
      large tenement house.

“There I found a strange-looking man on a bed of straw, sitting with
      his back against the wall, in order to get his breath. He was a sort of
      skeleton, with dark, gleaming eyes.

“''The story is too long. I haven''t time to tell it. I was going to
      die —and that priest was brought to me—and as I knew that you
      were here I sent for you. It is to you that I wish to confess—since
      you were the one who once saved my life.''

“His hands clutched the straw of his bed through the sheet and he
      continued in a hoarse, forcible and low tone: ''You see—I owe you the
      truth—I owe it to you—for it must be told to some one before I
      leave this earth.

“''Listen. I was an honest, straightforward, pure man—adoring
      God—this good Father—this Master who teaches us to love, and
      not the false God, the executioner, the robber, the murderer who governs
      the earth. I had never done any harm; I had never committed an evil act. I
      was as good as it is possible to be, monsieur.

“''I married and had children, and I loved them as no father or
      mother ever loved their children. I lived only for them. I was wild about
      them. All three of them died! Why? why? What had I done? I was rebellious,
      furious; and suddenly my eyes were opened as if I were waking up out of a
      sleep. I understood that God is bad. Why had He killed my children? I
      opened my eyes and saw that He loves to kill. He loves only that,
      monsieur. He gives life but to destroy it! God, monsieur, is a murderer!
      He needs death every day. And He makes it of every variety, in order the
      better to be amused. He has invented sickness and accidents in order to
      give Him diversion all through the months and the years; and when He grows
      tired of this, He has epidemics, the plague, cholera, diphtheria,
      smallpox, everything possible! But this does not satisfy Him; all these
      things are too similar; and so from time to time He has wars, in order to
      see two hundred thousand soldiers killed at once, crushed in blood and in
      the mud, blown apart, their arms and legs torn off, their heads smashed by
      bullets, like eggs that fall on the ground.

“''But this is not all. He has made men who eat each other. And then,
      as men become better than He, He has made beasts, in order to see men hunt
      them, kill them and eat them. That is not all. He has made tiny little
      animals which live one day, flies who die by the millions in one hour,
      ants which we are continually crushing under our feet, and so many, many
      others that we cannot even imagine. And all these things are continually
      killing each other and dying. And the good Lord looks on and is amused,
      for He sees everything, the big ones as well as the little ones, those who
      are in the drops of water and those in the other firmaments. He watches
      them and is amused. Wretch!

“''Then, monsieur, I began to kill children. I played a trick
on Him. He
      did not get those. It was not He, but I! And I would have killed many
      others, but you caught me. There!

“''I was to be executed. I! How He would have laughed! Then I asked
      for a priest, and I lied. I confessed to him. I lied and I lived.

“''Now, all is over. I can no longer escape from Him. I no longer
      fear Him, monsieur; I despise Him too much.''

“This poor wretch was frightful to see as he lay there gasping,
      opening an enormous mouth in order to utter words which could scarcely be
      heard, his breath rattling, picking at his bed and moving his thin legs
      under a grimy sheet as though trying to escape.

“I turned to the ashen-faced priest, whose dark outline stood out
      against the wall, and asked: ''Are you going to stay here, Monsieur
      l''Abbe?''

He lived formerly in a little house beside the high road outside the
      village. He had set up in business as a wheelwright, after marrying the
      daughter of a farmer of the neighborhood, and as they were both
      industrious, they managed to save up a nice little fortune. But they had
      no children, and this caused them great sorrow. Finally a son was born,
      whom they named Jean. They both loved and petted him, enfolding him with
      their affection, and were unwilling to let him be out of their sight.

When he was five years old some mountebanks passed through the country and
      set up their tent in the town hall square.

Jean, who had seen them pass by, made his escape from the house, and after
      his father had made a long search for him, he found him among the learned
      goats and trick dogs, uttering shouts of laughter and sitting on the knees
      of an old clown.

Three days later, just as they were sitting down to dinner, the
      wheelwright and his wife noticed that their son was not in the house. They
      looked for him in the garden, and as they did not find him, his father
      went out into the road and shouted at the top of his voice, “Jean!”

Night came on. A brown vapor arose making distant objects look still
      farther away and giving them a dismal, weird appearance. Three tall pines,
      close at hand, seemed to be weeping. Still there was no reply, but the air
      appeared to be full of indistinct sighing. The father listened for some
      time, thinking he heard a sound first in one direction, then in another,
      and, almost beside himself, he ran, out into the night, calling
      incessantly “Jean! Jean!”

He ran along thus until daybreak, filling the, darkness with his shouts,
      terrifying stray animals, torn by a terrible anguish and fearing that he
      was losing his mind. His wife, seated on the stone step of their home,
      sobbed until morning.

They did not find their son. They both aged rapidly in their inconsolable
      sorrow. Finally they sold their house and set out to search together.

They inquired of the shepherds on the hillsides, of the tradesmen passing
      by, of the peasants in the villages and of the authorities in the towns.
      But their boy had been lost a long time and no one knew anything about
      him. He had probably forgotten his own name by this time and also the name
      of his village, and his parents wept in silence, having lost hope.

Before long their money came to an end, and they worked out by the day in
      the farms and inns, doing the most menial work, eating what was left from
      the tables, sleeping on the ground and suffering from cold. Then as they
      became enfeebled by hard work no one would employ them any longer, and
      they were forced to beg along the high roads. They accosted passers-by in
      an entreating voice and with sad, discouraged faces; they begged a morsel
      of bread from the harvesters who were dining around a tree in the fields
      at noon, and they ate in silence seated on the edge of a ditch. An
      innkeeper to whom they told their story said to them one day:

When they entered the great city they were bewildered by its size and by
      the crowds that they saw. But they knew that Jean must be in the midst of
      all these people, though they did not know how to set about looking for
      him. Then they feared that they might not recognize him, for he was only
      five years old when they last saw him.

They visited every place, went through all the streets, stopping whenever
      they saw a group of people, hoping for some providential meeting, some
      extraordinary luck, some compassionate fate.

They frequently walked at haphazard straight ahead, leaning one against
      the other, looking so sad and poverty-stricken that people would give them
      alms without their asking.

They spent every Sunday at the doors of the churches, watching the crowds
      entering and leaving, trying to distinguish among the faces one that might
      be familiar. Several times they thought they recognized him, but always
      found they had made a mistake.

In the vestibule of one of the churches which they visited the most
      frequently there was an old dispenser of holy Water who had become their
      friend. He also had a very sad history, and their sympathy for him had
      established a bond of close friendship between them. It ended by them all
      three living together in a poor lodging on the top floor of a large house
      situated at some distance, quite on the outskirts of the city, and the
      wheelwright would sometimes take his new friend''s place at the church when
      the latter was ill.

Winter came, a very severe winter. The poor holy water sprinkler died and
      the parish priest appointed the wheelwright, whose misfortunes had come to
      his knowledge, to replace him. He went every morning and sat in the same
      place, on the same chair, wearing away the old stone pillar by continually
      leaning against it. He would gaze steadily at every man who entered the
      church and looked forward to Sunday with as much impatience as a
      schoolboy, for on that day the church was filled with people from morning
      till night.

He became very old, growing weaker each day from the dampness of the
      church, and his hope oozed away gradually.

He now knew by sight all the people who came to the services; he knew
      their hours, their manners, could distinguish their step on the stone
      pavement.

His interests had become so contracted that the entrance of a stranger in
      the church was for him a great event. One day two ladies came in; one was
      old, the other young—a mother and daughter probably. Behind them
      came a man who was following them. He bowed to them as they came out, and
      after offering them some holy water, he took the arm of the elder lady.

“That must be the fiance of the younger one,” thought the
      wheelwright. And until evening he kept trying to recall where he had
      formerly seen a young man who resembled this one. But the one he was
      thinking of must be an old man by this time, for it seemed as if he had
      known him down home in his youth.

The same man frequently came again to walk home with the ladies, and this
      vague, distant, familiar resemblance which he could not place worried the
      old man so much that he made his wife come with him to see if she could
      help his impaired memory.

One evening as it was growing dusk the three strangers entered together.
      When they had passed the old man said:

“Yes—yes—but he is darker, taller, stouter and is
      dressed like a gentleman, but, father, all the same, it is your face when
      you were young!”

It was true. He looked like himself and also like his brother who was
      dead, and like his father, whom he remembered while he was yet young. The
      old couple were so affected that they could not speak. The three persons
      came out and were about to leave the church.

The man touched his finger to the holy water sprinkler. Then the old man,
      whose hand was trembling so that he was fairly sprinkling the ground with
      holy water, exclaimed:

The man stooped down, with his face close to the old man''s, and as a
      memory of his childhood dawned on him he replied:

He had forgotten everything, his father''s surname and the name of his
      native place, but he always remembered those two words that he had so
      often repeated: “Papa Pierre, Mamma Jeanne.”

He sank to the floor, his face on the old man''s knees, and he wept,
      kissing now his father and then his mother, while they were almost
      breathless from intense joy.

The two ladies also wept, understanding as they did that some great
      happiness had come to pass.

Then they all went to the young man''s house and he told them his history.
      The circus people had carried him off. For three years he traveled with
      them in various countries. Then the troupe disbanded, and one day an old
      lady in a chateau had paid to have him stay with her because she liked his
      appearance. As he was intelligent, he was sent to school, then to college,
      and the old lady having no children, had left him all her money. He, for
      his part, had tried to find his parents, but as he could remember only the
      two names, “Papa Pierre, Mamma Jeanne,” he had been unable to
      do so. Now he was about to be married, and he introduced his fiancee, who
      was very good and very pretty.

When the two old people had told their story in their turn he kissed them
      once more. They sat up very late that night, not daring to retire lest the
      happiness they had so long sought should escape them again while they were
      asleep.

The lawyer had presented a plea of insanity. How could anyone explain this
      strange crime otherwise?

One morning, in the grass near Chatou, two bodies had been found, a man
      and a woman, well known, rich, no longer young and married since the
      preceding year, the woman having been a widow for three years before.

They were not known to have enemies; they had not been robbed. They seemed
      to have been thrown from the roadside into the river, after having been
      struck, one after the other, with a long iron spike.

The investigation revealed nothing. The boatmen, who had been questioned,
      knew nothing. The matter was about to be given up, when a young carpenter
      from a neighboring village, Georges Louis, nicknamed “the Bourgeois,”
      gave himself up.

“I had known the man for two years, the woman for six months. They
      often had me repair old furniture for them, because I am a clever workman.”

This man was undoubtedly an illegitimate child, put out to nurse and then
      abandoned. He had no other name than Georges Louis, but as on growing up
      he became particularly intelligent, with the good taste and native
      refinement which his acquaintances did not have, he was nicknamed “the
      Bourgeois,” and he was never called otherwise. He had become
      remarkably clever in the trade of a carpenter, which he had taken up. He
      was also said to be a socialist fanatic, a believer in communistic and
      nihilistic doctrines, a great reader of bloodthirsty novels, an
      influential political agitator and a clever orator in the public meetings
      of workmen or of farmers.

Indeed, how could one imagine that this workman should kill his best
      customers, rich and generous (as he knew), who in two years had enabled
      him to earn three thousand francs (his books showed it)? Only one
      explanation could be offered: insanity, the fixed idea of the unclassed
      individual who reeks vengeance on two bourgeois, on all the bourgeoisie,
      and the lawyer made a clever allusion to this nickname of “The
      Bourgeois,” given throughout the neighborhood to this poor wretch.
      He exclaimed:

“Is this irony not enough to unbalance the mind of this poor wretch,
      who has neither father nor mother? He is an ardent republican. What am I
      saying? He even belongs to the same political party, the members of which,
      formerly shot or exiled by the government, it now welcomes with open arms
      this party to which arson is a principle and murder an ordinary
      occurrence.

“These gloomy doctrines, now applauded in public meetings, have
      ruined this man. He has heard republicans—even women, yes, women—ask
      for the blood of M. Gambetta, the blood of M. Grevy; his weakened mind
      gave way; he wanted blood, the blood of a bourgeois!

Everywhere could be heard murmurs of assent. Everyone felt that the lawyer
      had won his case. The prosecuting attorney did not oppose him.

He was a short, flaxen blond, with calm, clear, gray eyes. A strong,
      frank, sonorous voice came from this frail-looking boy and, at the first
      words, quickly changed the opinion which had been formed of him.

He spoke loud in a declamatory manner, but so distinctly that every word
      could be understood in the farthest corners of the big hall:

“Your honor, as I do not wish to go to an insane asylum, and as I
      even prefer death to that, I will tell everything.

“A woman, having given birth to a boy, sent him out, somewhere, to a
      nurse. Did she even know where her accomplice carried this innocent little
      being, condemned to eternal misery, to the shame of an illegitimate birth;
      to more than that—to death, since he was abandoned and the nurse, no
      longer receiving the monthly pension, might, as they often do, let him die
      of hunger and neglect!

“The woman who nursed me was honest, better, more noble, more of a
      mother than my own mother. She brought me up. She did wrong in doing her
      duty. It is more humane to let them die, these little wretches who are
      cast away in suburban villages just as garbage is thrown away.

“I grew up with the indistinct impression that I was carrying some
      burden of shame. One day the other children called me a ''b——-''.
      They did not know the meaning of this word, which one of them had heard at
      home. I was also ignorant of its meaning, but I felt the sting all the
      same.

“I was, I may say, one of the cleverest boys in the school. I would
      have been a good man, your honor, perhaps a man of superior intellect, if
      my parents had not committed the crime of abandoning me.

“This crime was committed against me. I was the victim, they were
      the guilty ones. I was defenseless, they were pitiless. Their duty was to
      love me, they rejected me.

“I owed them life—but is life a boon? To me, at any rate, it
      was a misfortune. After their shameful desertion, I owed them only
      vengeance. They committed against me the most inhuman, the most infamous,
      the most monstrous crime which can be committed against a human creature.

“A man who has been insulted, strikes; a man who has been robbed,
      takes back his own by force. A man who has been deceived, played upon,
      tortured, kills; a man who has been slapped, kills; a man who has been
      dishonored, kills. I have been robbed, deceived, tortured, morally
      slapped, dishonored, all this to a greater degree than those whose anger
      you excuse.

“I revenged myself, I killed. It was my legitimate right. I took
      their happy life in exchange for the terrible one which they had forced on
      me.

“You will call me parricide! Were these people my parents, for whom
      I was an abominable burden, a terror, an infamous shame; for whom my birth
      was a calamity and my life a threat of disgrace? They sought a selfish
      pleasure; they got an unexpected child. They suppressed the child. My turn
      came to do the same for them.

“As I have said, this man, my father, came to me for the first time
      two years ago. I suspected nothing. He ordered two pieces of furniture. I
      found out, later on, that, under the seal of secrecy, naturally, he had
      sought information from the priest.

“He returned often. He gave me a lot of work and paid me well.
      Sometimes he would even talk to me of one thing or another. I felt a
      growing affection for him.

“At the beginning of this year he brought with him his wife, my
      mother. When she entered she was trembling so that I thought her to be
      suffering from some nervous disease. Then she asked for a seat and a glass
      of water. She said nothing; she looked around abstractedly at my work and
      only answered ''yes'' and ''no,'' at random, to all the questions which he
      asked her. When she had left I thought her a little unbalanced.

“The following month they returned. She was calm, self-controlled.
      That day they chattered for a long time, and they left me a rather large
      order. I saw her three more times, without suspecting anything. But one
      day she began to talk to me of my life, of my childhood, of my parents. I
      answered: ''Madame, my parents were wretches who deserted me.'' Then she
      clutched at her heart and fell, unconscious. I immediately thought: ''She
      is my mother!'' but I took care not to let her notice anything. I wished to
      observe her.

“I, in turn, sought out information about them. I learned that they
      had been married since last July, my mother having been a widow for only
      three years. There had been rumors that they had loved each other during
      the lifetime of the first husband, but there was no proof of it. I was the
      proof—the proof which they had at first hidden and then hoped to
      destroy.

“I waited. She returned one evening, escorted as usual by my father.
      That day she seemed deeply moved, I don''t know why. Then, as she was
      leaving, she said to me: ''I wish you success, because you seem to me to be
      honest and a hard worker; some day you will undoubtedly think of getting
      married. I have come to help you to choose freely the woman who may suit
      you. I was married against my inclination once and I know what suffering
      it causes. Now I am rich, childless, free, mistress of my fortune. Here is
      your dowry.''

“She drew back a few steps and hid her face in her hands so as not
      to see me. He, the man, my father, supported her in his arms and cried out
      to me: ''You must be crazy!''

“I answered: ''Not in the least. I know that you are my parents. I
      cannot be thus deceived. Admit it and I will keep the secret; I will bear
      you no ill will; I will remain what I am, a carpenter.''

“He retreated towards the door, still supporting his wife who was
      beginning to sob. Quickly I locked the door, put the key in my pocket and
      continued: ''Look at her and dare to deny that she is my mother.''

“Then he flew into a passion, very pale, terrified at the thought
      that the scandal, which had so far been avoided, might suddenly break out;
      that their position, their good name, their honor might all at once be
      lost. He stammered out: ''You are a rascal, you wish to get money from us!
      That''s the thanks we get for trying to help such common people!''

“Then, when he found the door locked, he exclaimed: ''If you do not
      open this door immediately, I will have you thrown into prison for
      blackmail and assault!''

“Then I seemed to have been suddenly orphaned, deserted, pushed to
      the wall. I was seized with an overwhelming sadness, mingled with anger,
      hatred, disgust; my whole being seemed to rise up in revolt against the
      injustice, the meanness, the dishonor, the rejected love. I began to run,
      in order to overtake them along the Seine, which they had to follow in
      order to reach the station of Chaton.

“I soon caught up with them. It was now pitch dark. I was creeping
      up behind them softly, that they might not hear me. My mother was still
      crying. My father was saying: ''It''s all your own fault. Why did you wish
      to see him? It was absurd in our position. We could have helped him from
      afar, without showing ourselves. Of what use are these dangerous visits,
      since we can''t recognize him?''

“''You see! You are my parents. You have already rejected me once;
      would you repulse me again?''

“Then, your honor, he struck me. I swear it on my honor, before the
      law and my country. He struck me, and as I seized him by the collar, he
      drew from his pocket a revolver.

“The blood rushed to my head, I no longer knew what I was doing, I
      had my compass in my pocket; I struck him with it as often as I could.

“Then she began to cry: ''Help! murder!'' and to pull my beard. It
      seems that I killed her also. How do I know what I did then?

“Then, when I saw them both lying on the ground, without thinking, I
      threw them into the Seine.

The prisoner sat down. After this revelation the case was carried over to
      the following session. It comes up very soon. If we were jurymen, what
      would we do with this parricide?

Dr. Bonnet, my old friend—one sometimes has friends older than one''s
      self—had often invited me to spend some time with him at Riom, and,
      as I did not know Auvergne, I made up my mind to visit him in the summer
      of 1876.

I arrived by the morning train, and the first person I saw on the platform
      was the doctor. He was dressed in a gray suit, and wore a soft, black,
      wide-brimmed, high-crowned felt hat, narrow at the top like a chimney pot,
      a hat which hardly any one except an Auvergnat would wear, and which
      reminded one of a charcoal burner. Dressed like that, the doctor had the
      appearance of an old young man, with his spare body under his thin coat,
      and his large head covered with white hair.

He embraced me with that evident pleasure which country people feel when
      they meet long-expected friends, and, stretching out his arm, he said
      proudly:

“This is Auvergne!” I saw nothing before me except a range of
      mountains, whose summits, which resembled truncated cones, must have been
      extinct volcanoes.

“Riom, the fatherland of magistrates, the pride of the magistracy,
      and which ought rather to be the fatherland of doctors.”

“Why?” he replied with a laugh. “If you transpose the
      letters, you have the Latin word ''mori'', to die. That is the reason why I
      settled here, my young friend.”

As soon as I had swallowed a cup of coffee, he made me go and see the
      town. I admired the druggist''s house, and the other noted houses, which
      were all black, but as pretty as bric-a-brac, with their facades of
      sculptured stone. I admired the statue of the Virgin, the patroness of
      butchers, and he told me an amusing story about this, which I will relate
      some other time, and then Dr. Bonnet said to me:

“I must beg you to excuse me for a few minutes while I go and see a
      patient, and then I will take you to Chatel-Guyon, so as to show you the
      general aspect of the town, and all the mountain chain of the Puy-de-Dome
      before lunch. You can wait for me outside; I shall only go upstairs and
      come down immediately.”

He left me outside one of those old, gloomy, silent, melancholy houses,
      which one sees in the provinces, and this one appeared to look
      particularly sinister, and I soon discovered the reason. All the large
      windows on the first floor were boarded half way up. The upper part of
      them alone could be opened, as if one had wished to prevent the people who
      were locked up in that huge stone box from looking into the street.

“You are quite right; the poor creature who is living there must
      never see what is going on outside. She is a madwoman, or rather an idiot,
      what you Normans would call a Niente. It is a miserable story, but a very
      singular pathological case at the same time. Shall I tell you?”

“Twenty years ago the owners of this house, who were my patients,
      had a daughter who was like all other girls, but I soon discovered that
      while her body became admirably developed, her intellect remained
      stationary.

“She began to walk very early, but she could not talk. At first I
      thought she was deaf, but I soon discovered that, although she heard
      perfectly, she did not understand anything that was said to her. Violent
      noises made her start and frightened her, without her understanding how
      they were caused.

“She grew up into a superb woman, but she was dumb, from an absolute
      want of intellect. I tried all means to introduce a gleam of intelligence
      into her brain, but nothing succeeded. I thought I noticed that she knew
      her nurse, though as soon as she was weaned, she failed to recognize her
      mother. She could never pronounce that word which is the first that
      children utter and the last which soldiers murmur when they are dying on
      the field of battle. She sometimes tried to talk, but she produced nothing
      but incoherent sounds.

“When the weather was fine, she laughed continually, and emitted low
      cries which might be compared to the twittering of birds; when it rained
      she cried and moaned in a mournful, terrifying manner, which sounded like
      the howling of a dog before a death occurs in a house.

“She was fond of rolling on the grass, as young animals do, and of
      running about madly, and she would clap her hands every morning, when the
      sun shone into her room, and would insist, by signs, on being dressed as
      quickly as possible, so that she might get out.

“She did not appear to distinguish between people, between her
      mother and her nurse, or between her father and me, or between the
      coachman and the cook. I particularly liked her parents, who were very
      unhappy on her account, and went to see them nearly every day. I dined
      with them quite frequently, which enabled me to remark that Bertha (they
      had called her Bertha) seemed to recognize the various dishes, and to
      prefer some to others. At that time she was twelve years old, but as fully
      formed in figure as a girl of eighteen, and taller than I was. Then the
      idea struck me of developing her greediness, and by this means of
      cultivating some slight power of discrimination in her mind, and to force
      her, by the diversity of flavors, if not to reason, at any rate to arrive
      at instinctive distinctions, which would of themselves constitute a kind
      of process that was necessary to thought. Later on, by appealing to her
      passions, and by carefully making use of those which could serve our
      purpose, we might hope to obtain a kind of reaction on her intellect, and
      by degrees increase the unconscious action of her brain.

“One day I put two plates before her, one of soup, and the other of
      very sweet vanilla cream. I made her taste each of them successively, and
      then I let her choose for herself, and she ate the plate of cream. In a
      short time I made her very greedy, so greedy that it appeared as if the
      only idea she had in her head was the desire for eating. She perfectly
      recognized the various dishes, and stretched out her hands toward those
      that she liked, and took hold of them eagerly, and she used to cry when
      they were taken from her. Then I thought I would try and teach her to come
      to the dining-room when the dinner bell rang. It took a long time, but I
      succeeded in the end. In her vacant intellect a vague correlation was
      established between sound and taste, a correspondence between the two
      senses, an appeal from one to the other, and consequently a sort of
      connection of ideas—if one can call that kind of instinctive hyphen
      between two organic functions an idea—and so I carried my
      experiments further, and taught her, with much difficulty, to recognize
      meal times by the clock.

“It was impossible for me for a long time to attract her attention
      to the hands, but I succeeded in making her remark the clockwork and the
      striking apparatus. The means I employed were very simple; I asked them
      not to have the bell rung for lunch, and everybody got up and went into
      the dining-room when the little brass hammer struck twelve o''clock, but I
      found great difficulty in making her learn to count the strokes. She ran
      to the door each time she heard the clock strike, but by degrees she
      learned that all the strokes had not the same value as far as regarded
      meals, and she frequently fixed her eyes, guided by her ears, on the dial
      of the clock.

“When I noticed that, I took care every day at twelve, and at six
      o''clock, to place my fingers on the figures twelve and six, as soon as the
      moment she was waiting for had arrived, and I soon noticed that she
      attentively followed the motion of the small brass hands, which I had
      often turned in her presence.

“She had understood! Perhaps I ought rather to say that she had
      grasped the idea. I had succeeded in getting the knowledge, or, rather,
      the sensation, of the time into her, just as is the case with carp, who
      certainly have no clocks, when they are fed every day exactly at the same
      time.

“When once I had obtained that result all the clocks and watches in
      the house occupied her attention almost exclusively. She spent her time in
      looking at them, listening to them, and in waiting for meal time, and once
      something very funny happened. The striking apparatus of a pretty little
      Louis XVI clock that hung at the head of her bed having got out of order,
      she noticed it. She sat for twenty minutes with her eyes on the hands,
      waiting for it to strike ten, but when the hands passed the figure she was
      astonished at not hearing anything; so stupefied was she, indeed, that she
      sat down, no doubt overwhelmed by a feeling of violent emotion such as
      attacks us in the face of some terrible catastrophe. And she had the
      wonderful patience to wait until eleven o''clock in order to see what would
      happen, and as she naturally heard nothing, she was suddenly either seized
      with a wild fit of rage at having been deceived and imposed upon by
      appearances, or else overcome by that fear which some frightened creature
      feels at some terrible mystery, and by the furious impatience of a
      passionate individual who meets with some obstacle; she took up the tongs
      from the fireplace and struck the clock so violently that she broke it to
      pieces in a moment.

“It was evident, therefore, that her, brain did act and calculate,
      obscurely it is true, and within very restricted limits, for I could never
      succeed in making her distinguish persons as she distinguished the time;
      and to stir her intellect, it was necessary to appeal to her passions, in
      the material sense of the word, and we soon had another, and alas! a very
      terrible proof of this!

“She had grown up into a splendid girl, a perfect type of a race, a
      sort of lovely and stupid Venus. She was sixteen, and I have rarely seen
      such perfection of form, such suppleness and such regular features. I said
      she was a Venus; yes, a fair, stout, vigorous Venus, with large, bright,
      vacant eyes, which were as blue as the flowers of the flax plant; she had
      a large mouth with full lips, the mouth of a glutton, of a sensualist, a
      mouth made for kisses. Well, one morning her father came into my
      consulting room with a strange look on his face, and, sitting down without
      even replying to my greeting, he said:

“''I want to speak to you about a very serious matter. Would it be
      possible—would it be possible for Bertha to marry?''

“''Yes, I know, I know,'' he replied. ''But reflect, doctor. Don''t you
      think—perhaps—we hoped—if she had children—it
      would be a great shock to her, but a great happiness, and—who knows
      whether maternity might not rouse her intellect?''

“I was in a state of great perplexity. He was right, and it was
      possible that such a new situation, and that wonderful instinct of
      maternity, which beats in the hearts of the lower animals as it does in
      the heart of a woman, which makes the hen fly at a dog''s jaws to defend
      her chickens, might bring about a revolution, an utter change in her
      vacant mind, and set the motionless mechanism of her thoughts in motion.
      And then, moreover, I immediately remembered a personal instance. Some
      years previously I had owned a spaniel bitch who was so stupid that I
      could do nothing with her, but when she had had puppies she became, if not
      exactly intelligent, yet almost like many other dogs who had not been
      thoroughly broken.

“As soon as I foresaw the possibility of this, the wish to get
      Bertha married grew in me, not so much out of friendship for her and her
      poor parents as from scientific curiosity. What would happen? It was a
      singular problem. I said in reply to her father:

“''Perhaps you are right. You might make the attempt, but you will
      never find a man to consent to marry her.''

“I was dumfounded, and said: ''Somebody really suitable? Some one of
      your own rank and position in society?''

“''I came on purpose to tell you, and to consult you. It is Monsieur
      Gaston du Boys de Lucelles.''

“I felt inclined to exclaim: ''The wretch!'' but I held my tongue, and
      after a few moments'' silence I said:

“Monsieur Gaston du Boys de Lucelles was a scapegrace of good
      family, who, after having spent all that he had inherited from his father,
      and having incurred debts in all kinds of doubtful ways, had been trying
      to discover some other means of obtaining money, and he had discovered
      this method. He was a good-looking young fellow, and in capital health,
      but fast; one of that odious race of provincial fast men, and he appeared
      to me to be as suitable as anyone, and could be got rid of later by making
      him an allowance. He came to the house to pay his addresses and to strut
      about before the idiot girl, who, however, seemed to please him. He
      brought her flowers, kissed her hands, sat at her feet, and looked at her
      with affectionate eyes; but she took no notice of any of his attentions,
      and did not make any distinction between him and the other persons who
      were about her.

“However, the marriage took place, and you may guess how my
      curiosity was aroused. I went to see Bertha the next day to try and
      discover from her looks whether any feelings had been awakened in her, but
      I found her just the same as she was every day, wholly taken up with the
      clock and dinner, while he, on the contrary, appeared really in love, and
      tried to rouse his wife''s spirits and affection by little endearments and
      such caresses as one bestows on a kitten. He could think of nothing
      better.

“I called upon the married couple pretty frequently, and I soon
      perceived that the young woman knew her husband, and gave him those eager
      looks which she had hitherto only bestowed on sweet dishes.

“She followed his movements, knew his step on the stairs or in the
      neighboring rooms, clapped her hands when he came in, and her face was
      changed and brightened by the flames of profound happiness and of desire.

“She loved him with her whole body and with all her soul to the very
      depths of her poor, weak soul, and with all her heart, that poor heart of
      some grateful animal. It was really a delightful and innocent picture of
      simple passion, of carnal and yet modest passion, such as nature had
      implanted in mankind, before man had complicated and disfigured it by all
      the various shades of sentiment. But he soon grew tired of this ardent,
      beautiful, dumb creature, and did not spend more than an hour during the
      day with her, thinking it sufficient if he came home at night, and she
      began to suffer in consequence. She used to wait for him from morning till
      night with her eyes on the clock; she did not even look after the meals
      now, for he took all his away from home, Clermont, Chatel-Guyon, Royat, no
      matter where, as long as he was not obliged to come home.

“She began to grow thin; every other thought, every other wish,
      every other expectation, and every confused hope disappeared from her
      mind, and the hours during which she did not see him became hours of
      terrible suffering to her. Soon he ceased to come home regularly of
      nights; he spent them with women at the casino at Royat and did not come
      home until daybreak. But she never went to bed before he returned. She
      remained sitting motionless in an easy-chair, with her eyes fixed on the
      hands of the clock, which turned so slowly and regularly round the china
      face on which the hours were painted.

“She heard the trot of his horse in the distance and sat up with a
      start, and when he came into the room she got up with the movements of an
      automaton and pointed to the clock, as if to say: ''Look how late it is!''

“And he began to be afraid of this amorous and jealous, half-witted
      woman, and flew into a rage, as brutes do; and one night he even went so
      far as to strike her, so they sent for me. When I arrived she was writhing
      and screaming in a terrible crisis of pain, anger, passion, how do I know
      what? Can one tell what goes on in such undeveloped brains?

“I calmed her by subcutaneous injections of morphine, and forbade
      her to see that man again, for I saw clearly that marriage would
      infallibly kill her by degrees.

“Then she went mad! Yes, my dear friend, that idiot went mad. She is
      always thinking of him and waiting for him; she waits for him all day and
      night, awake or asleep, at this very moment, ceaselessly. When I saw her
      getting thinner and thinner, and as she persisted in never taking her eyes
      off the clocks, I had them removed from the house. I thus made it
      impossible for her to count the hours, and to try to remember, from her
      indistinct reminiscences, at what time he used to come home formerly. I
      hope to destroy the recollection of it in time, and to extinguish that ray
      of thought which I kindled with so much difficulty.

“The other day I tried an experiment. I offered her my watch; she
      took it and looked at it for some time; then she began to scream terribly,
      as if the sight of that little object had suddenly awakened her memory,
      which was beginning to grow indistinct. She is pitiably thin now, with
      hollow and glittering eyes, and she walks up and down ceaselessly, like a
      wild beast in its cage; I have had gratings put on the windows, boarded
      them up half way, and have had the seats fixed to the floor so as to
      prevent her from looking to see whether he is coming.

The gloomy town looked like some ancient city. Behind it a green, wooded
      plain studded with towns and villages, and bathed in a soft blue haze,
      extended until it was lost in the distance. Far away, on my right, there
      was a range of lofty mountains with round summits, or else cut off flat,
      as if with a sword, and the doctor began to enumerate the villages, towns
      and hills, and to give me the history of all of them. But I did not listen
      to him; I was thinking of nothing but the madwoman, and I only saw her.
      She seemed to be hovering over that vast extent of country like a mournful
      ghost, and I asked him abruptly:

“He is living at Royat, on an allowance that they made him, and is
      quite happy; he leads a very fast life.”

As we were slowly going back, both of us silent and rather low-spirited,
      an English dogcart, drawn by a thoroughbred horse, came up behind us and
      passed us rapidly. The doctor took me by the arm.

I saw nothing except a gray felt hat, cocked over one ear above a pair of
      broad shoulders, driving off in a cloud of dust.

We never dreamed of such good fortune! The son of a provincial bailiff,
      Jean Marin had come, as do so many others, to study law in the Quartier
      Latin. In the various beer-houses that he had frequented he had made
      friends with several talkative students who spouted politics as they drank
      their beer. He had a great admiration for them and followed them
      persistently from cafe to cafe, even paying for their drinks when he had
      the money.

He became a lawyer and pleaded causes, which he lost. However, one morning
      he read in the papers that one of his former comrades of the Quartier had
      just been appointed deputy.

He again became his faithful hound, the friend who does the drudgery, the
      unpleasant tasks, for whom one sends when one has need of him and with
      whom one does not stand on ceremony. But it chanced through some
      parliamentary incident that the deputy became a minister. Six months later
      Jean Marin was appointed a state councillor.

He was so elated with pride at first that he lost his head. He would walk
      through the streets just to show himself off, as though one could tell by
      his appearance what position he occupied. He managed to say to the
      shopkeepers as soon as he entered a store, bringing it in somehow in the
      course of the most insignificant remarks and even to the news vendors and
      the cabmen:

Then, in consequence of his position as well as for professional reasons
      and as in duty bound through being an influential and generous man, he
      felt an imperious need of patronizing others. He offered his support to
      every one on all occasions and with unbounded generosity.

When he met any one he recognized on the boulevards he would advance to
      meet them with a charmed air, would take their hand, inquire after their
      health, and, without waiting for any questions, remark:

“You know I am state councillor, and I am entirely at your service.
      If I can be of any use to you, do not hesitate to call on me. In my
      position one has great influence.”

Then he would go into some cafe with the friend he had just met and ask
      for a pen and ink and a sheet of paper. “Just one, waiter; it is to
      write a letter of recommendation.”

And he wrote ten, twenty, fifty letters of recommendation a day. He wrote
      them to the Cafe Americain, to Bignon''s, to Tortoni''s, to the Maison
      Doree, to the Cafe Riche, to the Helder, to the Cafe Anglais, to the
      Napolitain, everywhere, everywhere. He wrote them to all the officials of
      the republican government, from the magistrates to the ministers. And he
      was happy, perfectly happy.

One morning as he was starting out to go to the council it began to rain.
      He hesitated about taking a cab, but decided not to do so and set out on
      foot.

The rain came down in torrents, swamping the sidewalks and inundating the
      streets. M. Marin was obliged to take shelter in a doorway. An old priest
      was standing there—an old priest with white hair. Before he became a
      councillor M. Marin did not like the clergy. Now he treated them with
      consideration, ever since a cardinal had consulted him on an important
      matter. The rain continued to pour down in floods and obliged the two men
      to take shelter in the porter''s lodge so as to avoid getting wet. M.
      Marin, who was always itching to talk so as to let people know who he was,
      remarked:

“It certainly is very disagreeable to have rain during the few days
      one spends in the capital. We officials who stay here the year round, we
      think nothing of it.”

The priest did not reply. He was looking at the street where the rain
      seemed to be falling less heavily. And with a sudden resolve he raised his
      cassock just as women raise their skirts in stepping across water.

“In that case, if you will allow me, Monsieur l''Abbe, I will offer
      you the shelter of my umbrella: As for me, I am going to the council. I am
      a councillor of state.”

M. Marin then took his arm and led him away. He directed him, watched over
      him and advised him.

“Be careful of that stream, Monsieur l''Abbe. And be very careful
      about the carriage wheels; they spatter you with mud sometimes from head
      to foot. Look out for the umbrellas of the people passing by; there is
      nothing more dangerous to the eyes than the tips of the ribs. Women
      especially are unbearable; they pay no heed to where they are going and
      always jab you in the face with the point of their parasols or umbrellas.
      And they never move aside for anybody. One would suppose the town belonged
      to them. They monopolize the pavement and the street. It is my opinion
      that their education has been greatly neglected.”

The priest did not reply. He walked along, slightly bent over, picking his
      steps carefully so as not to get mud on his boots or his cassock.

“Ali! Is it important business? Might I venture to ask what it is?
      If I can be of any service to you, you may command me.”

“Oh, it is a little personal matter; a little difficulty with—with
      my bishop. It would not interest you. It is a matter of internal
      regulation—an ecclesiastical affair.”

“But it is precisely the state council that regulates all those
      things. In that case, make use of me.”

“Yes, monsieur, it is to the council that I am going. You are a
      thousand times too kind. I have to see M. Lerepere and M. Savon and also
      perhaps M. Petitpas.”

“Why, those are my friends, Monsieur l''Abbe, my best friends,
      excellent colleagues, charming men. I will speak to them about you, and
      very highly. Count upon me.”

The cure thanked him, apologizing for troubling him, and stammered out a
      thousand grateful promises.

“Ah, you may be proud of having made a stroke of luck, Monsieur
      l''Abbe. You will see—you will see that, thanks to me, your affair
      will go along swimmingly.”

They reached the council hall. M. Marin took the priest into his office,
      offered him a chair in front of the fire and sat down himself at his desk
      and began to write.

“My dear colleague, allow me to recommend to you most highly a
      venerable and particularly worthy and deserving priest, M. L''Abbe——”

“M. l''Abbe Ceinture, who needs your good office in a little matter
      which he will communicate to you.

When he had written the three letters he handed them to his protege, who
      took his departure with many protestations of gratitude.

M. Marin attended to some business and then went home, passed the day
      quietly, slept well, woke in a good humor and sent for his newspapers.

“We shall never make an end of enumerating the misdeeds of the
      clergy. A certain priest, named Ceinture, convicted of conspiracy against
      the present government, accused of base actions to which we will not even
      allude, suspected besides of being a former Jesuit, metamorphosed into a
      simple priest, suspended by a bishop for causes that are said to be
      unmentionable and summoned to Paris to give an explanation of his conduct,
      has found an ardent defender in the man named Marin, a councillor of
      state, who was not afraid to give this frocked malefactor the warmest
      letters of recommendation to all the republican officials, his colleagues.

“We call the, attention of the ministry to the unheard of attitude
      of this councillor of state——”

M. Marin bounded out of bed, dressed himself and hastened to his
      colleague, Petitpas, who said to him:

“Why no—you see—I was deceived. He looked such an honest
      man. He played me a trick—a disgraceful trick! I beg that you will
      sentence him severely, very severely. I am going to write. Tell me to whom
      I should write about having him punished. I will go and see the
      attorney-general and the archbishop of Paris—yes, the archbishop.”

“Monseigneur, I have the honor to bring to your grace''s notice the
      fact that I have recently been made a victim of the intrigues and lies of
      a certain Abbe Ceinture, who imposed on my kind-heartedness.

“Bah!” exclaimed Karl Massouligny, “the question of
      complaisant husbands is a difficult one. I have seen many kinds, and yet I
      am unable to give an opinion about any of them. I have often tried to
      determine whether they are blind, weak or clairvoyant. I believe that
      there are some which belong to each of these categories.

“Let us quickly pass over the blind ones. They cannot rightly be
      called complaisant, since they do not know, but they are good creatures
      who cannot see farther than their nose. It is a curious and interesting
      thing to notice the ease with which men and women can, be deceived. We are
      taken in by the slightest trick of those who surround us, by our children,
      our friends, our servants, our tradespeople. Humanity is credulous, and in
      order to discover deceit in others, we do not display one-tenth the
      shrewdness which we use when we, in turn, wish to deceive some one else.

“Clairvoyant husbands may be divided into three classes: Those who
      have some interest, pecuniary, ambitious or otherwise, in their wife''s
      having love affairs. These ask only to safeguard appearances as much as
      possible, and they are satisfied.

“There are also those who are powerless, or, rather, tired, who flee
      from the duties of matrimony through fear of ataxia or apoplexy, who are
      satisfied to see a friend run these risks.

“But I once met a husband of a rare species, who guarded against the
      common accident in a strange and witty manner.

“In Paris I had made the acquaintance of an elegant, fashionable
      couple. The woman, nervous, tall, slender, courted, was supposed to have
      had many love adventures. She pleased me with her wit, and I believe that
      I pleased her also. I courted her, a trial courting to which she answered
      with evident provocations. Soon we got to tender glances, hand pressures,
      all the little gallantries which precede the final attack.

“Nevertheless, I hesitated. I consider that, as a rule, the majority
      of society intrigues, however short they may be, are not worth the trouble
      which they give us and the difficulties which may arise. I therefore
      mentally compared the advantages and disadvantages which I might expect,
      and I thought I noticed that the husband suspected me.

“One evening, at a ball, as I was saying tender things to the young
      woman in a little parlor leading from the big hall where the dancing was
      going on, I noticed in a mirror the reflection of some one who was
      watching me. It was he. Our looks met and then I saw him turn his head and
      walk away.

“''Nonsense! You are not the first one to pay attention to me. Every
      woman who is a little in view drags behind her a herd of admirers.''

“She thought for an instant and then continued: ''No. I do not think
      that I ever noticed any jealousy on his part.''

“From that day my courting became much more assiduous. The woman did
      not please me any more than before, but the probable jealousy of her
      husband tempted me greatly.

“As for her, I judged her coolly and clearly. She had a certain
      worldly charm, due to a quick, gay, amiable and superficial mind, but no
      real, deep attraction. She was, as I have already said, an excitable
      little being, all on the surface, with rather a showy elegance. How can I
      explain myself? She was an ornament, not a home.

“One day, after taking dinner with her, her husband said to me, just
      as I was leaving: ''My dear friend'' (he now called me ''friend''), ''we soon
      leave for the country. It is a great pleasure to my wife and myself to
      entertain people whom we like. We would be very pleased to have you spend
      a month with us. It would be very nice of you to do so.''

“A month later I arrived at their estate of Vertcresson, in
      Touraine. They were waiting for me at the station, five miles from the
      chateau. There were three of them, she, the husband and a gentleman
      unknown to me, the Comte de Morterade, to whom I was introduced. He
      appeared to be delighted to make my acquaintance, and the strangest ideas
      passed through my mind while we trotted along the beautiful road between
      two hedges. I was saying to myself: ''Let''s see, what can this mean? Here
      is a husband who cannot doubt that his wife and I are on more than
      friendly terms, and yet he invites me to his house, receives me like an
      old friend and seems to say: “Go ahead, my friend, the road is
      clear!”''

“Then I am introduced to a very pleasant gentleman, who seems
      already to have settled down in the house, and—and who is perhaps
      trying to get out of it, and who seems as pleased at my arrival as the
      husband himself.

“Is it some former admirer who wishes to retire? One might think so.
      But, then, would these two men tacitly have come to one of these infamous
      little agreements so common in society? And it is proposed to me that I
      should quietly enter into the pact and carry it out. All hands and arms
      are held out to me. All doors and hearts are open to me.

“And what about her? An enigma. She cannot be ignorant of
      everything. However—however—Well, I cannot understand it.

“The dinner was very gay and cordial. On leaving the table the
      husband and his friend began to play cards, while I went out on the porch
      to look at the moonlight with madame. She seemed to be greatly affected by
      nature, and I judged that the moment for my happiness was near. That
      evening she was really delightful. The country had seemed to make her more
      tender. Her long, slender waist looked pretty on this stone porch beside a
      great vase in which grew some flowers. I felt like dragging her out under
      the trees, throwing myself at her feet and speaking to her words of love.

“We returned to the house, and she gave us some tea. When the two
      men had finished playing cards, they were visibly tired. I had to go to my
      room. I did not get to sleep till late, and then I slept badly.

“An excursion was decided upon for the following afternoon, and we
      went in an open carriage to visit some ruins. She and I were in the back
      of the vehicle and they were opposite us, riding backward. The
      conversation was sympathetic and agreeable. I am an orphan, and it seemed
      to me as though I had just found my family, I felt so at home with them.

“Suddenly, as she had stretched out her foot between her husband''s
      legs, he murmured reproachfully: ''Louise, please don''t wear out your old
      shoes yourself. There is no reason for being neater in Paris than in the
      country.''

“I lowered my eyes. She was indeed wearing worn-out shoes, and I
      noticed that her stockings were not pulled up tight.

“She had blushed and hidden her foot under her dress. The friend was
      looking out in the distance with an indifferent and unconcerned look.

“The husband offered me a cigar, which I accepted. For a few days it
      was impossible for me to be alone with her for two minutes; he was with us
      everywhere. He was delightful to me, however.

“One morning he came to get me to take a walk before breakfast, and
      the conversation happened to turn on marriage. I spoke a little about
      solitude and about how charming life can be made by the affection of a
      woman. Suddenly he interrupted me, saying: ''My friend, don''t talk about
      things you know nothing about. A woman who has no other reason for loving
      you will not love you long. All the little coquetries which make them so
      exquisite when they do not definitely belong to us cease as soon as they
      become ours. And then—the respectable women—that is to say our
      wives—are—are not—in fact do not understand their
      profession of wife. Do you understand?''

“Two days after this conversation he called me to his room quite
      early, in order to show me a collection of engravings. I sat in an easy
      chair opposite the big door which separated his apartment from his wife''s,
      and behind this door I heard some one walking and moving, and I was
      thinking very little of the engravings, although I kept exclaiming: ''Oh,
      charming! delightful! exquisite!''

“In a large room, all in disorder, in the midst of skirts, collars,
      waists lying around on the floor, stood a tall, dried-up creature. The
      lower part of her body was covered with an old, worn-out silk petticoat,
      which was hanging limply on her shapeless form, and she was standing in
      front of a mirror brushing some short, sparse blond hairs. Her arms formed
      two acute angles, and as she turned around in astonishment I saw under a
      common cotton chemise a regular cemetery of ribs, which were hidden from
      the public gaze by well-arranged pads.

“The husband uttered a natural exclamation and came back, closing
      the doors, and said: ''Gracious! how stupid I am! Oh, how thoughtless! My
      wife will never forgive me for that!''

“I already felt like thanking him. I left three days later, after
      cordially shaking hands with the two men and kissing the lady''s fingers.
      She bade me a cold good-by.”

The defendants, Cesaire-Isidore Brument and Prosper-Napoleon Cornu,
      appeared before the Court of Assizes of the Seine-Inferieure, on a charge
      of attempted murder, by drowning, of Mme. Brument, lawful wife of the
      first of the aforenamed.

The two prisoners sat side by side on the traditional bench. They were two
      peasants; the first was small and stout, with short arms, short legs, and
      a round head with a red pimply face, planted directly on his trunk, which
      was also round and short, and with apparently no neck. He was a raiser of
      pigs and lived at Cacheville-la-Goupil, in the district of Criquetot.

Cornu (Prosper-Napoleon) was thin, of medium height, with enormously long
      arms. His head was on crooked, his jaw awry, and he squinted. A blue
      blouse, as long as a shirt, hung down to his knees, and his yellow hair,
      which was scanty and plastered down on his head, gave his face a worn-out,
      dirty look, a dilapidated look that was frightful. He had been nicknamed
      “the cure” because he could imitate to perfection the chanting
      in church, and even the sound of the serpent. This talent attracted to his
      cafe—for he was a saloon keeper at Criquetot—a great many
      customers who preferred the “mass at Cornu” to the mass in
      church.

Mme. Brument, seated on the witness bench, was a thin peasant woman who
      seemed to be always asleep. She sat there motionless, her hands crossed on
      her knees, gazing fixedly before her with a stupid expression.

“Well, then, Mme. Brument, they came into your house and threw you
      into a barrel full of water. Tell us the details. Stand up.”

She rose. She looked as tall as a flag pole with her cap which looked like
      a white skull cap. She said in a drawling tone:

“I was shelling beans. Just then they came in. I said to myself,
      ''What is the matter with them? They do not seem natural, they seem up to
      some mischief.'' They watched me sideways, like this, especially Cornu,
      because he squints. I do not like to see them together, for they are two
      good-for-nothings when they are in company. I said: ''What do you want with
      me?'' They did not answer. I had a sort of mistrust——”

“Well, Brument said to me, ''Do you wish to earn a hundred sous?''
      ''Yes,'' I replied, seeing that a hundred sous are not picked up in a
      horse''s tracks. Then he said: ''Open your eyes and do as I do,'' and he went
      to fetch the large empty barrel which is under the rain pipe in the
      corner, and he turned it over and brought it into my kitchen, and stuck it
      down in the middle of the floor, and then he said to me: ''Go and fetch
      water until it is full.''

“So I went to the pond with two pails and carried water, and still
      more water for an hour, seeing that the barrel was as large as a vat,
      saving your presence, m''sieu le president.

“All this time Brument and Cornu were drinking a glass, and then
      another glass, and then another. They were finishing their drinks when I
      said to them: ''You are full, fuller than this barrel.'' And Brument
      answered me. ''Do not worry, go on with your work, your turn will come,
      each one has his share.'' I paid no attention to what he said as he was
      full.

“And then Cornu gave me a hundred sous, not Brument, Cornu; it was
      Cornu gave them to me. And Brument said: ''Do you wish to earn a hundred
      sous more?'' ''Yes,'' I said, for I am not accustomed to presents like that.
      Then he said: ''Take off your clothes!

“A hundred sous is a hundred sous, and I have to undress myself; but
      I did not fancy undressing before those two good-for-nothings. I took off
      my cap, and then my jacket, and then my skirt, and then my sabots. Brument
      said, ''Keep on your stockings, also; we are good fellows.''

“So there I was, almost like mother Eve. And they got up from their
      chairs, but could not stand straight, they were so full, saving your
      presence, M''sieu le president.

“And then they took me, Brument by the head, and Cornu by the feet,
      as one might take, for instance, a sheet that has been washed. Then I
      began to bawl.

“And they lifted me up in the air and put me into the barrel, which
      was full of water, so that I had a check of the circulation, a chill to my
      very insides.

“And then Brument pushed down my head as if to drown me, so that the
      water ran into my nose, so that I could already see Paradise. And he
      pushed it down, and I disappeared.

“As for me, I took to my heels and ran as far as M. le cure''s. He
      lent me a skirt belonging to his servant, for I was almost in a state of
      nature, and he went to fetch Maitre Chicot, the country watchman who went
      to Criquetot to fetch the police who came to my house with me.

“Brument was bawling: ''It isn''t true, I tell you that there is at
      least a cubic metre in it. It is the method that was no good.''

“Cornu bawled: ''Four pails, that is almost half a cubic metre. You
      need not reply, that''s what it is.''

She sat down. The audience in the court room laughed. The jurors looked at
      one another in astonishment. The judge said:

“Defendant Cornu, you seem to have been the instigator of this
      infamous plot. What have you to say?”

“I will. Well, Brument came to my place about nine o''clock, and
      ordered two drinks, and said: ''There''s one for you, Cornu.'' I sat down
      opposite him and drank, and out of politeness, I offered him a glass. Then
      he returned the compliment and so did I, and so it went on from glass to
      glass until noon, when we were full.

“Then Brument began to cry. That touched me. I asked him what was
      the matter. He said: ''I must have a thousand francs by Thursday.'' That
      cooled me off a little, you understand. Then he said to me all at once: ''I
      will sell you my wife.''

“I was full, and I was a widower. You understand, that stirred me
      up. I did not know his wife, but she was a woman, wasn''t she? I asked him:
      ''How much would you sell her for?''

“He reflected, or pretended to reflect. When one is full one is not
      very clear-headed, and he replied: ''I will sell her by the cubic metre.''

“That did not surprise me, for I was as drunk as he was, and I knew
      what a cubic metre is in my business. It is a thousand litres, that suited
      me.

“But the price remained to be settled. All depends on the quality. I
      said: ''How much do you want a cubic metre?''

“I gave a ' WHERE id = '47483ce4-df10-44b3-81b8-ab924b78ab8b';
