UPDATE stories SET original_text = original_text || 'n of dissuasion.  There was sufficient light in
the room to enable the pig to detect this manœuvre, and the
vile temper, inherited from the drowned mother, found full
play.  Latimer bounded back into bed, and his conqueror,
after a few threatening snorts and champings of its jaws, resumed
its massage operations with renewed zeal.  During the long
wakeful hours which ensued Latimer tried to distract his mind
from his own immediate troubles by dwelling with decent sympathy
on the second housemaid’s bereavement, but he found himself
more often wondering how many Boy Scouts were sharing his Melton
overcoat.  The rôle of Saint Martin malgré lui
was not one which appealed to him.

Towards dawn the pigling fell into a happy slumber, and
Latimer might have followed its example, but at about the same
time Stupor Hartlepooli gave a rousing crow, clattered down to
the floor and forthwith commenced a spirited combat with his
reflection in the wardrobe mirror.  Remembering that the
bird was more or less under his care Latimer performed Hague
Tribunal offices by draping a bath-towel over the provocative
mirror, but the ensuing peace was local and short-lived. 
The deflected energies of the gamecock found new outlet in a
sudden and sustained attack on the sleeping and temporarily
inoffensive pigling, and the duel which followed was desperate
and embittered beyond any possibility of effective
intervention.  The feathered combatant had the advantage of
being able, when hard pressed, to take refuge on the bed, and
freely availed himself of this circumstance; the pigling never
quite succeeded in hurling himself on to the same eminence, but
it was not from want of trying.

Neither side could claim any decisive success, and the
struggle had been practically fought to a standstill by the time
that the maid appeared with the early morning tea.

The pigling, as though aware that it might have outstayed its
welcome, dashed out at the door, and the gamecock followed it at
a more dignified pace.

“If Miss Vera’s dog sees that pig—!”
exclaimed the maid, and hurried off to avert such a
catastrophe.

A cold suspicion was stealing over Latimer’s mind; he
went to the window and drew up the blind.  A light,
drizzling rain was falling, but there was not the faintest trace
of any inundation.

“I should not like to think of you as a deliberate
liar,” he observed coldly, “but one occasionally has
to do things one does not like.”

The season of strikes seemed to have run itself to a
standstill.  Almost every trade and industry and calling in
which a dislocation could possibly be engineered had indulged in
that luxury.  The last and least successful convulsion had
been the strike of the World’s Union of Zoological Garden
attendants, who, pending the settlement of certain demands,
refused to minister further to the wants of the animals committed
to their charge or to allow any other keepers to take their
place.  In this case the threat of the Zoological Gardens
authorities that if the men “came out” the animals
should come out also had intensified and precipitated the
crisis.  The imminent prospect of the larger carnivores, to
say nothing of rhinoceroses and bull bison, roaming at large and
unfed in the heart of London, was not one which permitted of
prolonged conferences.  The Government of the day, which
from its tendency to be a few hours behind the course of events
had been nicknamed the Government of the afternoon, was obliged
to intervene with promptitude and decision.  A strong force
of Bluejackets was despatched to Regent’s Park to take over
the temporarily abandoned duties of the strikers. 
Bluejackets were chosen in preference to land forces, partly on
account of the traditional readiness of the British Navy to go
anywhere and do anything, partly by reason of the familiarity of
the average sailor with monkeys, parrots, and other tropical
fauna, but chiefly at the urgent request of the First Lord of the
Admiralty, who was keenly desirous of an opportunity for
performing some personal act of unobtrusive public service within
the province of his department.

“If he insists on feeding the infant jaguar himself, in
defiance of its mother’s wishes, there may be another
by-election in the north,” said one of his colleagues, with
a hopeful inflection in his voice.  “By-elections are
not very desirable at present, but we must not be
selfish.”

As a matter of fact the strike collapsed peacefully without
any outside intervention.  The majority of the keepers had
become so attached to their charges that they returned to work of
their own accord.

And then the nation and the newspapers turned with a sense of
relief to happier things.  It seemed as if a new era of
contentment was about to dawn.  Everybody had struck who
could possibly want to strike or who could possibly be cajoled or
bullied into striking, whether they wanted to or not.  The
lighter and brighter side of life might now claim some
attention.  And conspicuous among the other topics that
sprang into sudden prominence was the pending Falvertoon divorce
suit.

The Duke of Falvertoon was one of those human hors
d’œuvres that stimulate the public appetite for
sensation without giving it much to feed on.  As a mere
child he had been precociously brilliant; he had declined the
editorship of the Anglian Review at an age when most boys
are content to have declined mensa, a table, and though he
could not claim to have originated the Futurist movement in
literature, his “Letters to a possible Grandson,”
written at the age of fourteen, had attracted considerable
notice.  In later days his brilliancy had been less
conspicuously displayed.  During a debate in the House of
Lords on affairs in Morocco, at a moment when that country, for
the fifth time in seven years, had brought half Europe to the
verge of war, he had interpolated the remark “a little Moor
and how much it is,” but in spite of the encouraging
reception accorded to this one political utterance he was never
tempted to a further display in that direction.  It began to
be generally understood that he did not intend to supplement his
numerous town and country residences by living overmuch in the
public eye.

And then had come the unlooked-for tidings of the imminent
proceedings for divorce.  And such a divorce!  There
were cross-suits and allegations and counter-allegations, charges
of cruelty and desertion, everything in fact that was necessary
to make the case one of the most complicated and sensational of
its kind.  And the number of distinguished people involved
or cited as witnesses not only embraced both political parties in
the realm and several Colonial governors, but included an exotic
contingent from France, Hungary, the United States of North
America, and the Grand Duchy of Baden.  Hotel accommodation
of the more expensive sort began to experience a strain on its
resources.  “It will be quite like the Durbar without
the elephants,” exclaimed an enthusiastic lady who, to do
her justice, had never seen a Durbar.  The general feeling
was one of thankfulness that the last of the strikes had been got
over before the date fixed for the hearing of the great suit.

As a reaction from the season of gloom and industrial strife
that had just passed away the agencies that purvey and
stage-manage sensations laid themselves out to do their level
best on this momentous occasion.  Men who had made their
reputations as special descriptive writers were mobilised from
distant corners of Europe and the further side of the Atlantic in
order to enrich with their pens the daily printed records of the
case; one word-painter, who specialised in descriptions of how
witnesses turn pale under cross-examination, was summoned
hurriedly back from a famous and prolonged murder trial in
Sicily, where indeed his talents were being decidedly
wasted.  Thumb-nail artists and expert kodak manipulators
were retained at extravagant salaries, and special dress
reporters were in high demand.  An enterprising Paris firm
of costume builders presented the defendant Duchess with three
special creations, to be worn, marked, learned, and extensively
reported at various critical stages of the trial; and as for the
cinematograph agents, their industry and persistence was
untiring.  Films representing the Duke saying good-bye to
his favourite canary on the eve of the trial were in readiness
weeks before the event was due to take place; other films
depicted the Duchess holding imaginary consultations with
fictitious lawyers or making a light repast off specially
advertised vegetarian sandwiches during a supposed luncheon
interval.  As far as human foresight and human enterprise
could go nothing was lacking to make the trial a success.

Two days before the case was down for hearing the advance
reporter of an important syndicate obtained an interview with the
Duke for the purpose of gleaning some final grains of information
concerning his Grace’s personal arrangements during the
trial.

“I suppose I may say this will be one of the biggest
affairs of its kind during the lifetime of a generation,”
began the reporter as an excuse for the unsparing minuteness of
detail that he was about to make quest for.

The baleful word flashed out in all its old hideous
familiarity.  Was there to be no end to its recurrence?

“Do you mean,” faltered the reporter, “that
you are contemplating a mutual withdrawal of the
charges?”

“But think of the arrangements that have been made, the
special reporting, the cinematographs, the catering for the
distinguished foreign witnesses, the prepared music-hall
allusions; think of all the money that has been
sunk—”

“Exactly,” said the Duke coldly, “the
Duchess and I have realised that it is we who provide the
material out of which this great far-reaching industry has been
built up.  Widespread employment will be given and enormous
profits made during the duration of the case, and we, on whom all
the stress and racket falls, will get—what?  An
unenviable notoriety and the privilege of paying heavy legal
expenses whichever way the verdict goes.  Hence our decision
to strike.  We don’t wish to be reconciled; we fully
realise that it is a grave step to take, but unless we get some
reasonable consideration out of this vast stream of wealth and
industry that we have called into being we intend coming out of
court and staying out.  Good afternoon.”

The news of this latest strike spread universal dismay. 
Its inaccessibility to the ordinary methods of persuasion made it
peculiarly formidable.  If the Duke and Duchess persisted in
being reconciled the Government could hardly be called on to
interfere.  Public opinion in the shape of social ostracism
might be brought to bear on them, but that was as far as coercive
measures could go.  There was nothing for it but a
conference, with powers to propose liberal terms.  As it
was, several of the foreign witnesses had already departed and
others had telegraphed cancelling their hotel arrangements.

The conference, protracted, uncomfortable, and occasionally
acrimonious, succeeded at last in arranging for a resumption of
litigation, but it was a fruitless victory.  The Duke, with
a touch of his earlier precocity, died of premature decay a
fortnight before the date fixed for the new trial.

It was autumn in London, that blessed season between the
harshness of winter and the insincerities of summer; a trustful
season when one buys bulbs and sees to the registration of
one’s vote, believing perpetually in spring and a change of
Government.

Morton Crosby sat on a bench in a secluded corner of Hyde
Park, lazily enjoying a cigarette and watching the slow grazing
promenade of a pair of snow-geese, the male looking rather like
an albino edition of the russet-hued female.  Out of the
corner of his eye Crosby also noted with some interest the
hesitating hoverings of a human figure, which had passed and
repassed his seat two or three times at shortening intervals,
like a wary crow about to alight near some possibly edible
morsel.  Inevitably the figure came to an anchorage on the
bench, within easy talking distance of its original
occupant.  The uncared-for clothes, the aggressive, grizzled
beard, and the furtive, evasive eye of the new-comer bespoke the
professional cadger, the man who would undergo hours of
humiliating tale-spinning and rebuff rather than adventure on
half a day’s decent work.

For a while the new-comer fixed his eyes straight in front of
him in a strenuous, unseeing gaze; then his voice broke out with
the insinuating inflection of one who has a story to retail well
worth any loiterer’s while to listen to.

“As far as I am concerned,” said Crosby,
“the strangeness has worn off in the course of thirty-six
years.”

“Ah,” said the greybeard, “I could tell you
things that you’d hardly believe.  Marvellous things
that have really happened to me.”

“Nowadays there is no demand for marvellous things that
have really happened,” said Crosby discouragingly;
“the professional writers of fiction turn these things out
so much better.  For instance, my neighbours tell me
wonderful, incredible things that their Aberdeens and chows and
borzois have done; I never listen to them.  On the other
hand, I have read ‘The Hound of the Baskervilles’
three times.”

“I am a prominent and I think I may say an influential
member of the Mussulman community of Eastern Persia,” said
Crosby, making an excursion himself into the realms of
fiction.

The greybeard was obviously disconcerted at this new check to
introductory conversation, but the defeat was only momentary.

“An Afghan!” said the other, smitten into
bewildered silence for a moment.  Then he recovered himself
and renewed his attack.

“Afghanistan.  Ah!  We’ve had some wars
with that country; now, I daresay, instead of fighting it we
might have learned something from it.  A very wealthy
country, I believe.  No real poverty there.”

He raised his voice on the word “poverty” with a
suggestion of intense feeling.  Crosby saw the opening and
avoided it.

“It possesses, nevertheless, a number of highly talented
and ingenious beggars,” he said; “if I had not spoken
so disparagingly of marvellous things that have really happened I
would tell you the story of Ibrahim and the eleven camel-loads of
blotting-paper.  Also I have forgotten exactly how it
ended.”

“My own life-story is a curious one,” said the
stranger, apparently stifling all desire to hear the history of
Ibrahim; “I was not always as you see me now.”

“We are supposed to undergo complete change in the
course of every seven years,” said Crosby, as an
explanation of the foregoing announcement.

“I mean I was not always in such distressing
circumstances as I am at present,” pursued the stranger
doggedly.

“That sounds rather rude,” said Crosby stiffly,
“considering that you are at present talking to a man
reputed to be one of the most gifted conversationalists of the
Afghan border.”

“I don’t mean in that way,” said the
greybeard hastily; “I’ve been very much interested in
your conversation.  I was alluding to my unfortunate
financial situation.  You mayn’t hardly believe it,
but at the present moment I am absolutely without a
farthing.  Don’t see any prospect of getting any
money, either, for the next few days.  I don’t suppose
you’ve ever found yourself in such a position,” he
added.

“In the town of Yom,” said Crosby, “which is
in Southern Afghanistan, and which also happens to be my
birthplace, there was a Chinese philosopher who used to say that
one of the three chiefest human blessings was to be absolutely
without money.  I forget what the other two were.”

“Ah, I daresay,” said the stranger, in a tone that
betrayed no enthusiasm for the philosopher’s memory;
“and did he practise what he preached?  That’s
the test.”

“Then I expect he had friends who would help him
liberally whenever he was in difficulties, such as I am in at
present.”

“In Yom,” said Crosby, “it is not necessary
to have friends in order to obtain help.  Any citizen of Yom
would help a stranger as a matter of course.”

“If someone, like me, for instance, who was in
undeserved difficulties, asked a citizen of that town you speak
of for a small loan to tide over a few days’
impecuniosity—five shillings, or perhaps a rather larger
sum—would it be given to him as a matter of
course?”

“There would be a certain preliminary,” said
Crosby; “one would take him to a wine-shop and treat him to
a measure of wine, and then, after a little high-flown
conversation, one would put the desired sum in his hand and wish
him good-day.  It is a roundabout way of performing a simple
transaction, but in the East all ways are roundabout.”

“Ah,” he exclaimed, with a thin sneer ringing
meaningly through his words, “I suppose you’ve given
up all those generous customs since you left your town. 
Don’t practise them now, I expect.”

“No one who has lived in Yom,” said Crosby
fervently, “and remembers its green hills covered with
apricot and almond trees, and the cold water that rushes down
like a caress from the upland snows and dashes under the little
wooden bridges, no one who remembers these things and treasures
the memory of them would ever give up a single one of its
unwritten laws and customs.  To me they are as binding as
though I still lived in that hallowed home of my
youth.”

“Then if I was to ask you for a small loan—”
began the greybeard fawningly, edging nearer on the seat and
hurriedly wondering how large he might safely make his request,
“if I was to ask you for, say—”

“At any other time, certainly,” said Crosby;
“in the months of November and December, however, it is
absolutely forbidden for anyone of our race to give or receive
loans or gifts; in fact, one does not willingly speak of
them.  It is considered unlucky.  We will therefore
close this discussion.”

“But it is still October!” exclaimed the
adventurer with an eager, angry whine, as Crosby rose from his
seat; “wants eight days to the end of the month!”

“The Afghan November began yesterday,” said Crosby
severely, and in another moment he was striding across the Park,
leaving his recent companion scowling and muttering furiously on
the seat.

“I don’t believe a word of his story,” he
chattered to himself; “pack of nasty lies from beginning to
end.  Wish I’d told him so to his face.  Calling
himself an Afghan!”

The snorts and snarls that escaped from him for the next
quarter of an hour went far to support the truth of the old
saying that two of a trade never agree.

Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of the small
wayside station and took a turn or two up and down its
uninteresting length, to kill time till the train should be
pleased to proceed on its way.  Then, in the roadway beyond,
she saw a horse struggling with a more than ample load, and a
carter of the sort that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the
animal that helps him to earn a living.  Lady Carlotta
promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a different
complexion on the struggle.  Certain of her acquaintances
were wont to give her plentiful admonition as to the
undesirability of interfering on behalf of a distressed animal,
such interference being “none of her business.” 
Only once had she put the doctrine of non-interference into
practice, when one of its most eloquent exponents had been
besieged for nearly three hours in a small and extremely
uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while Lady Carlotta,
on the other side of the fence, had proceeded with the
water-colour sketch she was engaged on, and refused to interfere
between the boar and his prisoner.  It is to be feared that
she lost the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady.  On
this occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to the
first sign of impatience it had shown throughout the journey, and
steamed off without her.  She bore the desertion with
philosophical indifference; her friends and relations were
thoroughly well used to the fact of her luggage arriving without
her.  She wired a vague non-committal message to her
destination to say that she was coming on “by another
train.”  Before she had time to think what her next
move might be she was confronted by an imposingly attired lady,
who seemed to be taking a prolonged mental inventory of her
clothes and looks.

“You must be Miss Hope, the governess I’ve come to
meet,” said the apparition, in a tone that admitted of very
little argument.

“It’s gone astray,” said the alleged
governess, falling in with the excellent rule of life that the
absent are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact,
behaved with perfect correctitude.  “I’ve just
telegraphed about it,” she added, with a nearer approach to
truth.

“How provoking,” said Mrs. Quabarl; “these
railway companies are so careless.  However, my maid can
lend you things for the night,” and she led the way to her
car.

During the drive to the Quabarl mansion Lady Carlotta was
impressively introduced to the nature of the charge that had been
thrust upon her; she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were
delicate, sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic
temperament highly developed, and that Viola was something or
other else of a mould equally commonplace among children of that
class and type in the twentieth century.

“I wish them not only to be taught,” said
Mrs. Quabarl, “but interested in what they
learn.  In their history lessons, for instance, you must try
to make them feel that they are being introduced to the
life-stories of men and women who really lived, not merely
committing a mass of names and dates to memory.  French, of
course, I shall expect you to talk at meal-times several days in
the week.”

Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was knocked off
her perch.  She was one of those imperfectly self-assured
individuals who are magnificent and autocratic as long as they
are not seriously opposed.  The least show of unexpected
resistance goes a long way towards rendering them cowed and
apologetic.  When the new governess failed to express
wondering admiration of the large newly-purchased and expensive
car, and lightly alluded to the superior advantages of one or two
makes which had just been put on the market, the discomfiture of
her patroness became almost abject.  Her feelings were those
which might have animated a general of ancient warfaring days, on
beholding his heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off
the field by slingers and javelin throwers.

At dinner that evening, although reinforced by her husband,
who usually duplicated her opinions and lent her moral support
generally, Mrs. Quabarl regained none of her lost ground. 
The governess not only helped herself well and truly to wine, but
held forth with considerable show of critical knowledge on
various vintage matters, concerning which the Quabarls were in no
wise able to pose as authorities.  Previous governesses had
limited their conversation on the wine topic to a respectful and
doubtless sincere expression of a preference for water. 
When this one went as far as to recommend a wine firm in whose
hands you could not go very far wrong Mrs. Quabarl thought it
time to turn the conversation into more usual channels.

“We got very satisfactory references about you from
Canon Teep,” she observed; “a very estimable man, I
should think.”

“Drinks like a fish and beats his wife, otherwise a very
lovable character,” said the governess imperturbably.

“One must in justice admit that there is some
provocation,” continued the romancer.  “Mrs.
Teep is quite the most irritating bridge-player that I have ever
sat down with; her leads and declarations would condone a certain
amount of brutality in her partner, but to souse her with the
contents of the only soda-water syphon in the house on a Sunday
afternoon, when one couldn’t get another, argues an
indifference to the comfort of others which I cannot altogether
overlook.  You may think me hasty in my judgments, but it
was practically on account of the syphon incident that I
left.”

Mr. Quabarl made a welcome diversion by asking what studies
the new instructress proposed to inaugurate on the morrow.

“Ah, history,” he observed sagely; “now in
teaching them history you must take care to interest them in what
they learn.  You must make them feel that they are being
introduced to the life-stories of men and women who really
lived—”

“Ah, yes,” said her listeners, thinking it
expedient to assume an acquaintance at least with the name.

“What are you children doing out here?” demanded
Mrs. Quabarl the next morning, on finding Irene sitting rather
glumly at the head of the stairs, while her sister was perched in
an attitude of depressed discomfort on the window-seat behind
her, with a wolf-skin rug almost covering her.

“We are having a history lesson,” came the
unexpected reply.  “I am supposed to be Rome, and
Viola up there is the she-wolf; not a real wolf, but the figure
of one that the Romans used to set store by—I forget
why.  Claude and Wilfrid have gone to fetch the shabby
women.”

“Yes, they’ve got to carry them off.  They
didn’t want to, but Miss Hope got one of father’s
fives-bats and said she’d give them a number nine spanking
if they didn’t, so they’ve gone to do it.”

A loud, angry screaming from the direction of the lawn drew
Mrs. Quabarl thither in hot haste, fearful lest the threatened
castigation might even now be in process of infliction.  The
outcry, however, came principally from the two small daughters of
the lodge-keeper, who were being hauled and pushed towards the
house by the panting and dishevelled Claude and Wilfrid, whose
task was rendered even more arduous by the incessant, if not very
effectual, attacks of the captured maidens’ small
brother.  The governess, fives-bat in hand, sat negligently
on the stone balustrade, presiding over the scene with the cold
impartiality of a Goddess of Battles.  A furious and
repeated chorus of “I’ll tell muvver” rose from
the lodge-children, but the lodge-mother, who was hard of
hearing, was for the moment immersed in the preoccupation of her
washtub.

After an apprehensive glance in the direction of the lodge
(the good woman was gifted with the highly militant temper which
is sometimes the privilege of deafness) Mrs. Quabarl flew
indignantly to the rescue of the struggling captives.

“Wilfrid!  Claude!  Let those children go at
once.  Miss Hope, what on earth is the meaning of this
scene?”

“Early Roman history; the Sabine Women, don’t you
know?  It’s the Schartz-Metterklume method to make
children understand history by acting it themselves; fixes it in
their memory, you know.  Of course, if, thanks to your
interference, your boys go through life thinking that the Sabine
women ultimately escaped, I really cannot be held
responsible.”

“You may be very clever and modern, Miss Hope,”
said Mrs. Quabarl firmly, “but I should like you to leave
here by the next train.  Your luggage will be sent after you
as soon as it arrives.”

“I’m not certain exactly where I shall be for the
next few days,” said the dismissed instructress of youth;
“you might keep my luggage till I wire my address. 
There are only a couple of trunks and some golf-clubs and a
leopard cub.”

“A leopard cub!” gasped Mrs. Quabarl.  Even
in her departure this extraordinary person seemed destined to
leave a trail of embarrassment behind her.

“Well, it’s rather left off being a cub;
it’s more than half-grown, you know.  A fowl every day
and a rabbit on Sundays is what it usually gets.  Raw beef
makes it too excitable.  Don’t trouble about getting
the car for me, I’m rather inclined for a walk.”

The advent of the genuine Miss Hope, who had made a mistake as
to the day on which she was due to arrive, caused a turmoil which
that good lady was quite unused to inspiring.  Obviously the
Quabarl family had been woefully befooled, but a certain amount
of relief came with the knowledge.

“How tiresome for you, dear Carlotta,” said her
hostess, when the overdue guest ultimately arrived; “how
very tiresome losing your train and having to stop overnight in a
strange place.”

“It’s not the daily grind that I complain
of,” said Blenkinthrope resentfully; “it’s the
dull grey sameness of my life outside of office hours. 
Nothing of interest comes my way, nothing remarkable or out of
the common.  Even the little things that I do try to find
some interest in don’t seem to interest other people. 
Things in my garden, for instance.”

“Did I tell you about that?” said Blenkinthrope;
“I was telling the others in the train this morning. 
I forgot if I’d told you.”

“To be exact you told me that it weighed just under two
pounds, but I took into account the fact that abnormal vegetables
and freshwater fish have an after-life, in which growth is not
arrested.”

“The fault is with the potato, not with us,” said
Gorworth; “we are not in the least interested in it because
it is not in the least interesting.  The men you go up in
the train with every day are just in the same case as yourself;
their lives are commonplace and not very interesting to
themselves, and they certainly are not going to wax enthusiastic
over the commonplace events in other men’s lives. 
Tell them something startling, dramatic, piquant that has
happened to yourself or to someone in your family, and you will
capture their interest at once.  They will talk about you
with a certain personal pride to all their acquaintances. 
‘Man I know intimately, fellow called Blenkinthrope, lives
down my way, had two of his fingers clawed clean off by a lobster
he was carrying home to supper.  Doctor says entire hand may
have to come off.’  Now that is conversation of a very
high order.  But imagine walking into a tennis club with the
remark: ‘I know a man who has grown a potato weighing two
and a quarter pounds.’”

“But hang it all, my dear fellow,” said
Blenkinthrope impatiently, “haven’t I just told you
that nothing of a remarkable nature ever happens to
me?”

“Invent something,” said Gorworth.  Since
winning a prize for excellence in Scriptural knowledge at a
preparatory school he had felt licensed to be a little more
unscrupulous than the circle he moved in.  Much might surely
be excused to one who in early life could give a list of
seventeen trees mentioned in the Old Testament.

“A snake got into your hen-run yesterday morning and
killed six out of seven pullets, first mesmerising them with its
eyes and then biting them as they stood helpless.  The
seventh pullet was one of that French sort, with feathers all
over its eyes, so it escaped the mesmeric snare, and just flew at
what it could see of the snake and pecked it to
pieces.”

“Thank you,” said Blenkinthrope stiffly;
“it’s a very clever invention.  If such a thing
had really happened in my poultry-run I admit I should have been
proud and interested to tell people about it.  But I’d
rather stick to fact, even if it is plain fact.”  All
the same his mind dwelt wistfully on the story of the Seventh
Pullet.  He could picture himself telling it in the train
amid the absorbed interest of his fellow-passengers. 
Unconsciously all sorts of little details and improvements began
to suggest themselves.

Wistfulness was still his dominant mood when he took his seat
in the railway carriage the next morning.  Opposite him sat
Stevenham, who had attained to a recognised brevet of importance
through the fact of an uncle having dropped dead in the act of
voting at a Parliamentary election.  That had happened three
years ago, but Stevenham was still deferred to on all questions
of home and foreign politics.

“Hullo, how’s the giant mushroom, or whatever it
was?” was all the notice Blenkinthrope got from his fellow
travellers.

Young Duckby, whom he mildly disliked, speedily monopolised
the general attention by an account of a domestic
bereavement.

“Had four young pigeons carried off last night by a
whacking big rat.  Oh, a monster he must have been; you
could tell by the size of the hole he made breaking into the
loft.”

No moderate-sized rat ever seemed to carry out any predatory
operations in these regions; they were all enormous in their
enormity.

“Pretty hard lines that,” continued Duckby, seeing
that he had secured the attention and respect of the company;
“four squeakers carried off at one swoop.  You’d
find it rather hard to match that in the way of unlooked-for bad
luck.”

“I had six pullets out of a pen of seven killed by a
snake yesterday afternoon,” said Blenkinthrope, in a voice
which he hardly recognised as his own.

“It fascinated them with its deadly, glittering eyes,
one after the other, and struck them down while they stood
helpless.  A bedridden neighbour, who wasn’t able to
call for assistance, witnessed it all from her bedroom
window.”

“The interesting part of it is about the seventh pullet,
the one that didn’t get killed,” resumed
Blenkinthrope, slowly lighting a cigarette.  His diffidence
had left him, and he was beginning to realise how safe and easy
depravity can seem once one has the courage to begin. 
“The six dead birds were Minorcas; the seventh was a Houdan
with a mop of feathers all over its eyes.  It could hardly
see the snake at all, so of course it wasn’t mesmerised
like the others.  It just could see something wriggling on
the ground, and went for it and pecked it to death.”

In the course of the next few days Blenkinthrope discovered
how little the loss of one’s self-respect affects one when
one has gained the esteem of the world.  His story found its
way into one of the poultry papers, and was copied thence into a
daily news-sheet as a matter of general interest.  A lady
wrote from the North of Scotland recounting a similar episode
which she had witnessed as occurring between a stoat and a blind
grouse.  Somehow a lie seems so much less reprehensible when
one can call it a lee.

For awhile the adapter of the Seventh Pullet story enjoyed to
the full his altered standing as a person of consequence, one who
had had some share in the strange events of his times.  Then
he was thrust once again into the cold grey background by the
sudden blossoming into importance of Smith-Paddon, a daily
fellow-traveller, whose little girl had been knocked down and
nearly hurt by a car belonging to a musical-comedy actress. 
The actress was not in the car at the time, but she was in
numerous photographs which appeared in the illustrated papers of
Zoto Dobreen inquiring after the well-being of Maisie, daughter
of Edmund Smith-Paddon, Esq.  With this new human interest
to absorb them the travelling companions were almost rude when
Blenkinthrope tried to explain his contrivance for keeping vipers
and peregrine falcons out of his chicken-run.

The ready affirmative coupled with the question betrayed a
significant shifting of the ethical standpoint.

It was a few days later that Blenkinthrope revealed a chapter
of family history to the customary gathering in the railway
carriage.

“Curious thing happened to my aunt, the one who lives in
Paris,” he began.  He had several aunts, but they were
all geographically distributed over Greater London.

“She was sitting on a seat in the Bois the other
afternoon, after lunching at the Roumanian Legation.”

Whatever the story gained in picturesqueness from the
dragging-in of diplomatic “atmosphere,” it ceased
from that moment to command any acceptance as a record of current
events.  Gorworth had warned his neophyte that this would be
the case, but the traditional enthusiasm of the neophyte had
triumphed over discretion.

“She was feeling rather drowsy, the effect probably of
the champagne, which she’s not in the habit of taking in
the middle of the day.”

A subdued murmur of admiration went round the company. 
Blenkinthrope’s aunts were not used to taking champagne in
the middle of the year, regarding it exclusively as a Christmas
and New Year accessory.

“Presently a rather portly gentleman passed by her seat
and paused an instant to light a cigar.  At that moment a
youngish man came up behind him, drew the blade from a
swordstick, and stabbed him half a dozen times through and
through.  ‘Scoundrel,’ he cried to his victim,
‘you do not know me.  My name is Henri
Leturc.’  The elder man wiped away some of the blood
that was spattering his clothes, turned to his assailant, and
said: ‘And since when has an attempted assassination been
considered an introduction?’  Then he finished
lighting his cigar and walked away.  My aunt had intended
screaming for the police, but seeing the indifference with which
the principal in the affair treated the matter she felt that it
would be an impertinence on her part to interfere.  Of
course I need hardly say she put the whole thing down to the
effects of a warm, drowsy afternoon and the Legation
champagne.  Now comes the astonishing part of my
story.  A fortnight later a bank manager was stabbed to
death with a swordstick in that very part of the Bois.  His
assassin was the son of a charwoman formerly working at the bank,
who had been dismissed from her job by the manager on account of
chronic intemperance.  His name was Henri Leturc.”

From that moment Blenkinthrope was tacitly accepted as the
Munchausen of the party.  No effort was spared to draw him
out from day to day in the exercise of testing their powers of
credulity, and Blenkinthrope, in the false security of an assured
and receptive audience, waxed industrious and ingenious in
supplying the demand for marvels.  Duckby’s satirical
story of a tame otter that had a tank in the garden to swim in,
and whined restlessly whenever the water-rate was overdue, was
scarcely an unfair parody of some of Blenkinthrope’s wilder
efforts.  And then one day came Nemesis.

Returning to his villa one evening Blenkinthrope found his
wife sitting in front of a pack of cards, which she was
scrutinising with unusual concentration.

“No, dear; this is the Death’s Head patience, the
most difficult of them all.  I’ve never got it to work
out, and somehow I should be rather frightened if I did. 
Mother only got it out once in her life; she was afraid of it,
too.  Her great-aunt had done it once and fallen dead from
excitement the next moment, and mother always had a feeling that
she would die if she ever got it out.  She died the same
night that she did it.  She was in bad health at the time,
certainly, but it was a strange coincidence.”

“Don’t do it if it frightens you,” was
Blenkinthrope’s practical comment as he left the
room.  A few minutes later his wife called to him.

“John, it gave me such a turn, I nearly got it
out.  Only the five of diamonds held me up at the end. 
I really thought I’d done it.”

“Why, you can do it,” said Blenkinthrope, who had
come back to the room; “if you shift the eight of clubs on
to that open nine the five can be moved on to the six.”

His wife made the suggested move with hasty, trembling
fingers, and piled the outstanding cards on to their respective
packs.  Then she followed the example of her mother and
great-grand-aunt.

Blenkinthrope had been genuinely fond of his wife, but in the
midst of his bereavement one dominant thought obtruded
itself.  Something sensational and real had at last come
into his life; no longer was it a grey, colourless record. 
The headlines which might appropriately describe his domestic
tragedy kept shaping themselves in his brain. 
“Inherited presentiment comes true.”  “The
Death’s Head patience: Card-game that justified its
sinister name in three generations.”  He wrote out a
full story of the fatal occurrence for the Essex Vedette,
the editor of which was a friend of his, and to another friend he
gave a condensed account, to be taken up to the office of one of
the halfpenny dailies.  But in both cases his reputation as
a romancer stood fatally in the way of the fulfilment of his
ambitions.  “Not the right thing to be Munchausening
in a time of sorrow” agreed his friends among themselves,
and a brief note of regret at the “sudden death of the wife
of our respected neighbour, Mr. John Blenkinthrope, from heart
failure,” appearing in the news column of the local paper
was the forlorn outcome of his visions of widespread
publicity.

Blenkinthrope shrank from the society of his erstwhile
travelling companions and took to travelling townwards by an
earlier train.  He sometimes tries to enlist the sympathy
and attention of a chance acquaintance in details of the
whistling prowess of his best canary or the dimensions of his
largest beetroot; he scarcely recognises himself as the man who
was once spoken about and pointed out as the owner of the Seventh
Pullet.

“You’ve just come back from Adelaide’s
funeral, haven’t you?” said Sir Lulworth to his
nephew; “I suppose it was very like most other
funerals?”

“You’ll do nothing of the sort.  It
wouldn’t be respectful either to your great-aunt’s
memory or to the lunch.  We begin with Spanish olives, then
a borshch, then more olives and a bird of some kind, and a rather
enticing Rhenish wine, not at all expensive as wines go in this
country, but still quite laudable in its way.  Now
there’s absolutely nothing in that menu that harmonises in
the least with the subject of your great-aunt Adelaide or her
funeral.  She was a charming woman, and quite as intelligent
as she had any need to be, but somehow she always reminded me of
an English cook’s idea of a Madras curry.”

“She used to say you were frivolous,” said
Egbert.  Something in his tone suggested that he rather
endorsed the verdict.

“I believe I once considerably scandalised her by
declaring that clear soup was a more important factor in life
than a clear conscience.  She had very little sense of
proportion.  By the way, she made you her principal heir,
didn’t she?”

“Yes,” said Egbert, “and executor as
well.  It’s in that connection that I particularly
want to speak to you.”

“Business is not my strong point at any time,”
said Sir Lulworth, “and certainly not when we’re on
the immediate threshold of lunch.”

“Then we can’t possibly speak about it now,”
said Sir Lulworth; “no one could talk seriously during a
borshch.  A beautifully constructed borshch, such as you are
going to experience presently, ought not only to banish
conversation but almost to annihilate thought.  Later on,
when we arrive at the second stage of olives, I shall be quite
ready to discuss that new book on Borrow, or, if you prefer it,
the present situation in the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg.  But
I absolutely decline to talk anything approaching business till
we have finished with the bird.”

For the greater part of the meal Egbert sat in an abstracted
silence, the silence of a man whose mind is focussed on one
topic.  When the coffee stage had been reached he launched
himself suddenly athwart his uncle’s reminiscences of the
Court of Luxemburg.

“I think I told you that great-aunt Adelaide had made me
her executor.  There wasn’t very much to be done in
the way of legal matters, but I had to go through her
papers.”

“Stacks of them, and most of them highly
uninteresting.  There was one packet, however, which I
thought might repay a careful perusal.  It was a bundle of
correspondence from her brother Peter.”

“Probably the simplest explanation was the correct
one,” said Sir Lulworth; “he slipped on the stone
staircase and fractured his skull in falling.”

Egbert shook his head.  “The medical evidence all
went to prove that the blow on the head was struck by some one
coming up behind him.  A wound caused by violent contact
with the steps could not possibly have been inflicted at that
angle of the skull.  They experimented with a dummy figure
falling in every conceivable position.”

“But the motive?” exclaimed Sir Lulworth;
“no one had any interest in doing away with him, and the
number of people who destroy Canons of the Established Church for
the mere fun of killing must be extremely limited.  Of
course there are individuals of weak mental balance who do that
sort of thing, but they seldom conceal their handiwork; they are
more generally inclined to parade it.”

“I know he was,” said Sir Lulworth, “simply
because he was about the only person on the premises at the time
of the tragedy.  But could anything be sillier than trying
to fasten a charge of murder on to Sebastien?  He had
nothing to gain, in fact, a good deal to lose, from the death of
his employer.  The Canon was paying him quite as good wages
as I was able to offer him when I took him over into my
service.  I have since raised them to something a little
more in accordance with his real worth, but at the time he was
glad to find a new place without troubling about an increase of
wages.  People were fighting rather shy of him, and he had
no friends in this country.  No; if anyone in the world was
interested in the prolonged life and unimpaired digestion of the
Canon it would certainly be Sebastien.”

“People don’t always weigh the consequences of
their rash acts,” said Egbert, “otherwise there would
be very few murders committed.  Sebastien is a man of hot
temper.”

“He is a southerner,” admitted Sir Lulworth;
“to be geographically exact I believe he hails from the
French slopes of the Pyrenees.  I took that into
consideration when he nearly killed the gardener’s boy the
other day for bringing him a spurious substitute for
sorrel.  One must always make allowances for origin and
locality and early environment; ‘Tell me your longitude and
I’ll know what latitude to allow you,’ is my
motto.”

“My dear Egbert, between nearly killing a
gardener’s boy and altogether killing a Canon there is a
wide difference.  No doubt you have often felt a temporary
desire to kill a gardener’s boy; you have never given way
to it, and I respect you for your self-control.  But I
don’t suppose you have ever wanted to kill an octogenarian
Canon.  Besides, as far as we know, there had never been any
quarrel or disagreement between the two men.  The evidence
at the inquest brought that out very clearly.”

“Ah!” said Egbert, with the air of a man coming at
last into a deferred inheritance of conversational importance,
“that is precisely what I want to speak to you
about.”

He pushed away his coffee cup and drew a pocket-book from his
inner breast-pocket.  From the depths of the pocket-book he
produced an envelope, and from the envelope he extracted a
letter, closely written in a small, neat handwriting.

“One of the Canon’s numerous letters to Aunt
Adelaide,” he explained, “written a few days before
his death.  Her memory was already failing when she received
it, and I daresay she forgot the contents as soon as she had read
it; otherwise, in the light of what subsequently happened, we
should have heard something of this letter before now.  If
it had been produced at the inquest I fancy it would have made
some difference in the course of affairs.  The evidence, as
you remarked just now, choked off suspicion against Sebastien by
disclosing an utter absence of anything that could be considered
a motive or provocation for the crime, if crime there
was.”

“It’s a long rambling affair, like most of his
letters in his later years,” said Egbert. 
“I’ll read the part that bears immediately on the
mystery.

“‘I very much fear I shall have to get rid of
Sebastien.  He cooks divinely, but he has the temper of a
fiend or an anthropoid ape, and I am really in bodily fear of
him.  We had a dispute the other day as to the correct sort
of lunch to be served on Ash Wednesday, and I got so irritated
and annoyed at his conceit and obstinacy that at last I threw a
cupful of coffee in his face and called him at the same time an
impudent jackanapes.  Very little of the coffee went
actually in his face, but I have never seen a human being show
such deplorable lack of self-control.  I laughed at the
threat of killing me that he spluttered out in his rage, and
thought the whole thing would blow over, but I have several times
since caught him scowling and muttering in a highly unpleasant
fashion, and lately I have fancied that he was dogging my
footsteps about the grounds, particularly when I walk of an
evening in the Italian Garden.’

“It was on the steps in the Italian Garden that the body
was found,” commented Egbert, and resumed reading.

Egbert paused for a moment at the conclusion of the extract;
then, as his uncle made no remark, he added: “If lack of
motive was the only factor that saved Sebastien from prosecution
I fancy this letter will put a different complexion on
matters.”

“Have you shown it to anyone else?” asked Sir
Lulworth, reaching out his hand for the incriminating piece of
paper.

“No,” said Egbert, handing it across the table,
“I thought I would tell you about it first.  Heavens,
what are you doing?”

Egbert’s voice rose almost to a scream.  Sir
Lulworth had flung the paper well and truly into the glowing
centre of the grate.  The small, neat handwriting shrivelled
into black flaky nothingness.

“What on earth did you do that for?” gasped
Egbert.  “That letter was our one piece of evidence to
connect Sebastien with the crime.”

Norman Gortsby sat on a bench in the Park, with his back to a
strip of bush-planted sward, fenced by the park railings, and the
Row fronting him across a wide stretch of carriage drive. 
Hyde Park Corner, with its rattle and hoot of traffic, lay
immediately to his right.  It was some thirty minutes past
six on an early March evening, and dusk had fallen heavily over
the scene, dusk mitigated by some faint moonlight and many street
lamps.  There was a wide emptiness over road and sidewalk,
and yet there were many unconsidered figures moving silently
through the half-light, or dotted unobtrusively on bench and
chair, scarcely to be distinguished from the shadowed gloom in
which they sat.

The scene pleased Gortsby and harmonised with his present
mood.  Dusk, to his mind, was the hour of the
defeated.  Men and women, who had fought and lost, who hid
their fallen fortunes and dead hopes as far as possible from the
scrutiny of the curious, came forth in this hour of gloaming,
when their shabby clothes and bowed shoulders and unhappy eyes
might pass unnoticed, or, at any rate, unrecognised.

The wanderers in the dusk did not choose to have strange looks
fasten on them, therefore they came out in this bat-fashion,
taking their pleasure sadly in a pleasure-ground that had emptied
of its rightful occupants.  Beyond the sheltering screen of
bushes and palings came a realm of brilliant lights and noisy,
rushing traffic.  A blazing, many-tiered stretch of windows
shone through the dusk and almost dispersed it, marking the
haunts of those other people, who held their own in life’s
struggle, or at any rate had not had to admit failure.  So
Gortsby’s imagination pictured things as he sat on his
bench in the almost deserted walk.  He was in the mood to
count himself among the defeated.  Money troubles did not
press on him; had he so wished he could have strolled into the
thoroughfares of light and noise, and taken his place among the
jostling ranks of those who enjoyed prosperity or struggled for
it.  He had failed in a more subtle ambition, and for the
moment he was heartsore and disillusionised, and not disinclined
to take a certain cynical pleasure in observing and labelling his
fellow wanderers as they went their ways in the dark stretches
between the lamp-lights.

On the bench by his side sat an elderly gentleman with a
drooping air of defiance that was probably the remaining vestige
of self-respect in an individual who had ceased to defy
successfully anybody or anything.  His clothes could
scarcely be called shabby, at least they passed muster in the
half-light, but one’s imagination could not have pictured
the wearer embarking on the purchase of a half-crown box of
chocolates or laying out ninepence on a carnation
buttonhole.  He belonged unmistakably to that forlorn
orchestra to whose piping no one dances; he was one of the
world’s lamenters who induce no responsive weeping. 
As he rose to go Gortsby imagined him returning to a home circle
where he was snubbed and of no account, or to some bleak lodging
where his ability to pay a weekly bill was the beginning and end
of the interest he inspired.  His retreating figure vanished
slowly into the shadows, and his place on the bench was taken
almost immediately by a young man, fairly well dressed but
scarcely more cheerful of mien than his predecessor.  As if
to emphasise the fact that the world went badly with him the
new-corner unburdened himself of an angry and very audible
expletive as he flung himself into the seat.

“You don’t seem in a very good temper,” said
Gortsby, judging that he was expected to take due notice of the
demonstration.

“You wouldn’t be in a good temper if you were in
the fix I’m in,” he said; “I’ve done the
silliest thing I’ve ever done in my life.”

“Came up this afternoon, meaning to stay at the
Patagonian Hotel in Berkshire Square,” continued the young
man; “when I got there I found it had been pulled down some
weeks ago and a cinema theatre run up on the site.  The taxi
driver recommended me to another hotel some way off and I went
there.  I just sent a letter to my people, giving them the
address, and then I went out to buy some soap—I’d
forgotten to pack any and I hate using hotel soap.  Then I
strolled about a bit, had a drink at a bar and looked at the
shops, and when I came to turn my steps back to the hotel I
suddenly realised that I didn’t remember its name or even
what street it was in.  There’s a nice predicament for
a fellow who hasn’t any friends or connections in
London!  Of course I can wire to my people for the address,
but they won’t have got my letter till to-morrow; meantime
I’m without any money, came out with about a shilling on
me, which went in buying the soap and getting the drink, and here
I am, wandering about with twopence in my pocket and nowhere to
go for the night.”

There was an eloquent pause after the story had been
told.  “I suppose you think I’ve spun you rather
an impossible yarn,” said the young man presently, with a
suggestion of resentment in his voice.

“Not at all impossible,” said Gortsby judicially;
“I remember doing exactly the same thing once in a foreign
capital, and on that occasion there were two of us, which made it
more remarkable.  Luckily we remembered that the hotel was
on a sort of canal, and when we struck the canal we were able to
find our way back to the hotel.”

The youth brightened at the reminiscence.  “In a
foreign city I wouldn’t mind so much,” he said;
“one could go to one’s Consul and get the requisite
help from him.  Here in one’s own land one is far more
derelict if one gets into a fix.  Unless I can find some
decent chap to swallow my story and lend me some money I seem
likely to spend the night on the Embankment.  I’m
glad, anyhow, that you don’t think the story outrageously
improbable.”

He threw a good deal of warmth into the last remark, as though
perhaps to indicate his hope that Gortsby did not fall far short
of the requisite decency.

The young man sat forward hurriedly, felt rapidly in the
pockets of his overcoat, and then jumped to his feet.

“To lose an hotel and a cake of soap on one afternoon
suggests wilful carelessness,” said Gortsby, but the young
man scarcely waited to hear the end of the remark.  He
flitted away down the path, his head held high, with an air of
somewhat jaded jauntiness.

“It was a pity,” mused Gortsby; “the going
out to get one’s own soap was the one convincing touch in
the whole story, and yet it was just that little detail that
brought him to grief.  If he had had the brilliant
forethought to provide himself with a cake of soap, wrapped and
sealed with all the solicitude of the chemist’s counter, he
would have been a genius in his particular line.  In his
particular line genius certainly consists of an infinite capacity
for taking precautions.”

With that reflection Gortsby rose to go; as he did so an
exclamation of concern escaped him.  Lying on the ground by
the side of the bench was a small oval packet, wrapped and sealed
with the solicitude of a chemist’s counter.  It could
be nothing else but a cake of soap, and it had evidently fallen
out of the youth’s overcoat pocket when he flung himself
down on the seat.  In another moment Gortsby was scudding
along the dusk-shrouded path in anxious quest for a youthful
figure in a light overcoat.  He had nearly given up the
search when he caught sight of the object of his pursuit standing
irresolutely on the border of the carriage drive, evidently
uncertain whether to strike across the Park or make for the
bustling pavements of Knightsbridge.  He turned round
sharply with an air of defensive hostility when he found Gortsby
hailing him.

“The important witness to the genuineness of your story
has turned up,” said Gortsby, holding out the cake of soap;
“it must have slid out of your overcoat pocket when you sat
down on the seat.  I saw it on the ground after you
left.  You must excuse my disbelief, but appearances were
really rather against you, and now, as I appealed to the
testimony of the soap I think I ought to abide by its
verdict.  If the loan of a sovereign is any good to
you—”

“Here is my card with my address,” continued
Gortsby; “any day this week will do for returning the
money, and here is the soap—don’t lose it again
it’s been a good friend to you.”

“Lucky thing your finding it,” said the youth, and
then, with a catch in his voice, he blurted out a word or two of
thanks and fled headlong in the direction of Knightsbridge.

“Poor boy, he as nearly as possible broke down,”
said Gortsby to himself.  “I don’t wonder
either; the relief from his quandary must have been acute. 
It’s a lesson to me not to be too clever in judging by
circumstances.”

As Gortsby retraced his steps past the seat where the little
drama had taken place he saw an elderly gentleman poking and
peering beneath it and on all sides of it, and recognised his
earlier fellow occupant.

“I hope you’ve come full of suggestions for
Christmas,” said Lady Blonze to her latest arrived guest;
“the old-fashioned Christmas and the up-to-date Christmas
are both so played out.  I want to have something really
original this year.”

“I was staying with the Mathesons last month,”
said Blanche Boveal eagerly, “and we had such a good
idea.  Every one in the house-party had to be a character
and behave consistently all the time, and at the end of the visit
one had to guess what every one’s character was.  The
one who was voted to have acted his or her character best got a
prize.”

“I was St. Francis of Assisi,” continued Blanche;
“we hadn’t got to keep to our right sexes.  I
kept getting up in the middle of a meal, and throwing out food to
the birds; you see, the chief thing that one remembers of St.
Francis is that he was fond of the birds.  Every one was so
stupid about it, and thought that I was the old man who feeds the
sparrows in the Tuileries Gardens.  Then Colonel Pentley was
the Jolly Miller on the banks of Dee.”

“If you could imagine all that you might as well imagine
cattle on the further bank and keep on calling them home,
Mary-fashion, across the sands of Dee.  Or you might change
the river to the Yarrow and imagine it was on the top of you, and
say you were Willie, or whoever it was, drowned in
Yarrow.”

“Of course it’s easy to make fun of it,”
said Blanche sharply, “but it was extremely interesting and
amusing.  The prize was rather a fiasco, though.  You
see, Millie Matheson said her character was Lady Bountiful, and
as she was our hostess of course we all had to vote that she had
carried out her character better than anyone.  Otherwise I
ought to have got the prize.”

Sir Nicholas was not so enthusiastic.  “Are you
quite sure, my dear, that you’re wise in doing this
thing?” he said to his wife when they were alone
together.  “It might do very well at the Mathesons,
where they had rather a staid, elderly house-party, but here it
will be a different matter.  There is the Durmot flapper,
for instance, who simply stops at nothing, and you know what Van
Tahn is like.  Then there is Cyril Skatterly; he has madness
on one side of his family and a Hungarian grandmother on the
other.”

“It’s the unknown that is to be dreaded,”
said Sir Nicholas.  “If Skatterly took it into his
head to represent a Bull of Bashan, well, I’d rather not be
here.”

“Of course we shan’t allow any Bible
characters.  Besides, I don’t know what the Bulls of
Bashan really did that was so very dreadful; they just came round
and gaped, as far as I remember.”

“My dear, you don’t know what Skatterly’s
Hungarian imagination mightn’t read into the part; it would
be small satisfaction to say to him afterwards:
‘You’ve behaved as no Bull of Bashan would have
behaved.’”

“Oh, you’re an alarmist,” said Lady Blonze;
“I particularly want to have this idea carried out. 
It will be sure to be talked about a lot.”

Dinner that evening was not a particularly lively affair; the
strain of trying to impersonate a self-imposed character or to
glean hints of identity from other people’s conduct acted
as a check on the natural festivity of such a gathering. 
There was a general feeling of gratitude and acquiescence when
good-natured Rachel Klammerstein suggested that there should be
an hour or two’s respite from “the game” while
they all listened to a little piano-playing after dinner. 
Rachel’s love of piano music was not indiscriminate, and
concentrated itself chiefly on selections rendered by her
idolised offspring, Moritz and Augusta, who, to do them justice,
played remarkably well.

The Klammersteins were deservedly popular as Christmas guests;
they gave expensive gifts lavishly on Christmas Day and New Year,
and Mrs. Klammerstein had already dropped hints of her intention
to present the prize for the best enacted character in the game
competition.  Every one had brightened at this prospect; if
it had fallen to Lady Blonze, as hostess, to provide the prize,
she would have considered that a little souvenir of some twenty
or twenty-five shillings’ value would meet the case,
whereas coming from a Klammerstein source it would certainly run
to several guineas.

The close time for impersonation efforts came to an end with
the final withdrawal of Moritz and Augusta from the piano. 
Blanche Boveal retired early, leaving the room in a series of
laboured leaps that she hoped might be recognised as a tolerable
imitation of Pavlova.  Vera Durmot, the sixteen-year-old
flapper, expressed her confident opinion that the performance was
intended to typify Mark Twain’s famous jumping frog, and
her diagnosis of the case found general acceptance.  Another
guest to set an example of early bed-going was Waldo Plubley, who
conducted his life on a minutely regulated system of time-tables
and hygienic routine.  Waldo was a plump, indolent young man
of seven-and-twenty, whose mother had early in his life decided
for him that he was unusually delicate, and by dint of much
coddling and home-keeping had succeeded in making him physically
soft and mentally peevish.  Nine hours’ unbroken
sleep, preceded by elaborate breathing exercises and other
hygienic ritual, was among the indispensable regulations which
Waldo imposed on himself, and there were innumerable small
observances which he exacted from those who were in any way
obliged to minister to his requirements; a special teapot for the
decoction of his early tea was always solemnly handed over to the
bedroom staff of any house in which he happened to be
staying.  No one had ever quite mastered the mechanism of
this precious vessel, but Bertie van Tahn was responsible for the
legend that its spout had to be kept facing north during the
process of infusion.

On this particular night the irreducible nine hours were
severely mutilated by the sudden and by no means noiseless
incursion of a pyjama-clad figure into Waldo’s room at an
hour midway between midnight and dawn.

“What is the matter?  What are you looking
for?” asked the awakened and astonished Waldo, slowly
recognising Van Tahn, who appeared to be searching hastily for
something he had lost.

“I can’t argue the matter at this hour of the
night,” said Bertie, and began hastily rummaging in the
chest of drawers.  Shirts and underwear went flying on to
the floor.

“I’ve only got your word for it,” said
Bertie, whisking most of the bedclothes on to the floor;
“if you weren’t concealing something you
wouldn’t be so agitated.”

Waldo was by this time convinced that Van Tahn was raving mad,
and made an anxious effort to humour him.

“Go back to bed like a dear fellow,” he pleaded,
“and your sheep will turn up all right in the
morning.”

“I daresay,” said Bertie gloomily, “without
their tails.  Nice fool I shall look with a lot of Manx
sheep.”

And by way of emphasising his annoyance at the prospect he
sent Waldo’s pillows flying to the top of the wardrobe.

“But why no tails?” asked Waldo, whose
teeth were chattering with fear and rage and lowered
temperature.

“My dear boy, have you never heard the ballad of Little
Bo-Peep?” said Bertie with a chuckle. 
“It’s my character in the Game, you know.  If I
didn’t go hunting about for my lost sheep no one would be
able to guess who I was; and now go to sleepy weeps like a good
child or I shall be cross with you.”

“I leave you to imagine,” wrote Waldo in the
course of a long letter to his mother, “how much sleep I
was able to recover that night, and you know how essential nine
uninterrupted hours of slumber are to my health.”

On the other hand he was able to devote some wakeful hours to
exercises in breathing wrath and fury against Bertie van
Tahn.

Breakfast at Blonzecourt was a scattered meal, on the
“come when you please” principle, but the house-party
was supposed to gather in full strength at lunch.  On the
day after the “Game” had been started there were,
however, some notable absentees.  Waldo Plubley, for
instance, was reported to be nursing a headache.  A large
breakfast and an “A.B.C.” had been taken up to his
room, but he had made no appearance in the flesh.

“I expect he’s playing up to some
character,” said Vera Durmot; “isn’t there a
thing of Molière’s, ‘Le Malade
Imaginaire’?  I expect he’s that.”

“But there are only three of them.  Besides,
they’ll want their lunch.  Hasn’t anyone seen
anything of them?”

“I saw you and Vera come back,” said Lady Blonze,
“but I didn’t see the Klammersteins.  Did you
put them down in the village?”

“We didn’t stop to consider that,” said
Skatterly; “we asked them to get out for a moment, on the
pretence that the car had stuck, and then we dashed off full
speed and left them there.”

“It’s something to do with Spanish history; we
don’t mind giving you that clue,” said Skatterly,
helping himself cheerfully to salad, and then Bertie van Tahn
broke forth into peals of joyous laughter.

“I’ve got it!  Ferdinand and Isabella
deporting the Jews!  Oh, lovely!  Those two have
certainly won the prize; we shan’t get anything to beat
that for thoroughness.”

Lady Blonze’s Christmas party was talked about and
written about to an extent that she had not anticipated in her
most ambitious moments.  The letters from Waldo’s
mother would alone have made it memorable.

Basset Harrowcluff returned to the home of his fathers, after
an absence of four years, distinctly well pleased with
himself.  He was only thirty-one, but he had put in some
useful service in an out-of-the-way, though not unimportant,
corner of the world.  He had quieted a province, kept open a
trade route, enforced the tradition of respect which is worth the
ransom of many kings in out-of-the-way regions, and done the
whole business on rather less expenditure than would be requisite
for organising a charity in the home country.  In Whitehall
and places where they think, they doubtless thought well of
him.  It was not inconceivable, his father allowed himself
to imagine, that Basset’s name might figure in the next
list of Honours.

Basset was inclined to be rather contemptuous of his
half-brother, Lucas, whom he found feverishly engrossed in the
same medley of elaborate futilities that had claimed his whole
time and energies, such as they were, four years ago, and almost
as far back before that as he could remember.  It was the
contempt of the man of action for the man of activities, and it
was probably reciprocated.  Lucas was an over-well nourished
individual, some nine years Basset’s senior, with a
colouring that would have been accepted as a sign of intensive
culture in an asparagus, but probably meant in this case mere
abstention from exercise.  His hair and forehead furnished a
recessional note in a personality that was in all other respects
obtrusive and assertive.  There was certainly no Semitic
blood in Lucas’s parentage, but his appearance contrived to
convey at least a suggestion of Jewish extraction.  Clovis
Sangrail, who knew most of his associates by sight, said it was
undoubtedly a case of protective mimicry.

Two days after Basset’s return, Lucas frisked in to
lunch in a state of twittering excitement that could not be
restrained even for the immediate consideration of soup, but had
to be verbally discharged in spluttering competition with
mouthfuls of vermicelli.

Basset gave a short laugh that would have done equally well as
a snort, if one had wanted to make the exchange.  His
half-brother was in the habit of discovering futilities that were
“simply It” at frequently recurring intervals. 
The discovery generally meant that he flew up to town, preceded
by glowingly-worded telegrams, to see some one connected with the
stage or the publishing world, got together one or two momentous
luncheon parties, flitted in and out of “Gambrinus”
for one or two evenings, and returned home with an air of subdued
importance and the asparagus tint slightly intensified.  The
great idea was generally forgotten a few weeks later in the
excitement of some new discovery.

“The inspiration came to me whilst I was
dressing,” announced Lucas; “it will be the
thing in the next music-hall revue.  All London will
go mad over it.  It’s just a couplet; of course there
will be other words, but they won’t matter. 
Listen:

A lifting, catchy sort of refrain, you see, and big-drum
business on the two syllables of bor-zoi.  It’s
immense.  And I’ve thought out all the business of it;
the singer will sing the first verse alone, then during the
second verse Cousin Teresa will walk through, followed by four
wooden dogs on wheels; Cæsar will be an Irish terrier, Fido
a black poodle, Jock a fox-terrier, and the borzoi, of course,
will be a borzoi.  During the third verse Cousin Teresa will
come on alone, and the dogs will be drawn across by themselves
from the opposite wing; then Cousin Teresa will catch on to the
singer and go off-stage in one direction, while the dogs’
procession goes off in the other, crossing en route, which is
always very effective.  There’ll be a lot of applause
there, and for the fourth verse Cousin Teresa will come on in
sables and the dogs will all have coats on.  Then I’ve
got a great idea for the fifth verse; each of the dogs will be
led on by a Nut, and Cousin Teresa will come on from the opposite
side, crossing en route, always effective, and then she turns
round and leads the whole lot of them off on a string, and all
the time every one singing like mad:

Tum-Tum!  Drum business on the two last syllables. 
I’m so excited, I shan’t sleep a wink to-night. 
I’m off to-morrow by the ten-fifteen.  I’ve
wired to Hermanova to lunch with me.”

If any of the rest of the family felt any excitement over the
creation of Cousin Teresa, they were signally successful in
concealing the fact.

“Poor Lucas does take his silly little ideas
seriously,” said Colonel Harrowcluff afterwards in the
smoking-room.

“Yes,” said his younger son, in a slightly less
tolerant tone, “in a day or two he’ll come back and
tell us that his sensational masterpiece is above the heads of
the public, and in about three weeks’ time he’ll be
wild with enthusiasm over a scheme to dramatise the poems of
Herrick or something equally promising.”

And then an extraordinary thing befell.  In defiance of
all precedent Lucas’s glowing anticipations were justified
and endorsed by the course of events.  If Cousin Teresa was
above the heads of the public, the public heroically adapted
itself to her altitude.  Introduced as an experiment at a
dull moment in a new revue, the success of the item was
unmistakable; the calls were so insistent and uproarious that
even Lucas’ ample devisings of additional
“business” scarcely sufficed to keep pace with the
demand.  Packed houses on successive evenings confirmed the
verdict of the first night audience, stalls and boxes filled
significantly just before the turn came on, and emptied
significantly after the last encore had been given. 
The manager tearfully acknowledged that Cousin Teresa was
It.  Stage hands and supers and programme sellers
acknowledged it to one another without the least
reservation.  The name of the revue dwindled to
secondary importance, and vast letters of electric blue blazoned
the words “Cousin Teresa” from the front of the great
palace of pleasure.  And, of course, the magic of the famous
refrain laid its spell all over the Metropolis.  Restaurant
proprietors were obliged to provide the members of their
orchestras with painted wooden dogs on wheels, in order that the
much-demanded and always conceded melody should be rendered with
the necessary spectacular effects, and the crash of bottles and
forks on the tables at the mention of the big borzoi usually
drowned the sincerest efforts of drum or cymbals.  Nowhere
and at no time could one get away from the double thump that
brought up the rear of the refrain; revellers reeling home at
night banged it on doors and hoardings, milkmen clashed their
cans to its cadence, messenger boys hit smaller messenger boys
resounding double smacks on the same principle.  And the
more thoughtful circles of the great city were not deaf to the
claims and significance of the popular melody.  An
enterprising and emancipated preacher discoursed from his pulpit
on the inner meaning of “Cousin Teresa,” and Lucas
Harrowcluff was invited to lecture on the subject of his great
achievement to members of the Young Mens’ Endeavour League,
the Nine Arts Club, and other learned and willing-to-learn
bodies.  In Society it seemed to be the one thing people
really cared to talk about; men and women of middle age and
average education might be seen together in corners earnestly
discussing, not the question whether Servia should have an outlet
on the Adriatic, or the possibilities of a British success in
international polo contests, but the more absorbing topic of the
problematic Aztec or Nilotic origin of the Teresa
motiv.

“Politics and patriotism are so boring and so out of
date,” said a revered lady who had some pretensions to
oracular utterance; “we are too cosmopolitan nowadays to be
really moved by them.  That is why one welcomes an
intelligible production like ‘Cousin Teresa,’ that
has a genuine message for one.  One can’t understand
the message all at once, of course, but one felt from the very
first that it was there.  I’ve been to see it eighteen
times and I’m going again to-morrow and on Thursday. 
One can’t see it often enough.”

“It would be rather a popular move if we gave this
Harrowcluff person a knighthood or something of the sort,”
said the Minister reflectively.

“Which?  There is only one, isn’t
there?” said the Minister; “the ‘Cousin
Teresa’ man, of course.  I think every one would be
pleased if we knighted him.  Yes, you can put him down on
the list of certainties—under the letter L.”

“The letter L,” said the secretary, who was new to
his job; “does that stand for Liberalism or
liberality?”

And thus, after a fashion, Colonel Harrowcluff’s
expectation of seeing his son’s name in the list of Honours
was gratified.

Sir Lulworth Quayne was making a leisurely progress through
the Zoological Society’s Gardens in company with his
nephew, recently returned from Mexico.  The latter was
interested in comparing and contrasting allied types of animals
occurring in the North American and Old World fauna.

“One of the most remarkable things in the wanderings of
species,” he observed, “is the sudden impulse to trek
and migrate that breaks out now and again, for no apparent
reason, in communities of hitherto stay-at-home
animals.”

“In human affairs the same phenomenon is occasionally
noticeable,” said Sir Lulworth; “perhaps the most
striking instance of it occurred in this country while you were
away in the wilds of Mexico.  I mean the wander fever which
suddenly displayed itself in the managing and editorial staffs of
certain London newspapers.  It began with the stampede of
the entire staff of one of our most brilliant and enterprising
weeklies to the banks of the Seine and the heights of
Montmartre.  The migration was a brief one, but it heralded
an era of restlessness in the Press world which lent quite a new
meaning to the phrase ‘newspaper circulation.’ 
Other editorial staffs were not slow to imitate the example that
had been set them.  Paris soon dropped out of fashion as
being too near home; Nürnberg, Seville, and Salonica became
more favoured as planting-out grounds for the personnel of not
only weekly but daily papers as well.  The localities were
perhaps not always well chosen; the fact of a leading organ of
Evangelical thought being edited for two successive fortnights
from Trouville and Monte Carlo was generally admitted to have
been a mistake.  And even when enterprising and adventurous
editors took themselves and their staffs further afield there
were some unavoidable clashings.  For instance, the
Scrutator, Sporting Bluff, and The
Damsels’ Own Paper all pitched on Khartoum for the same
week.  It was, perhaps, a desire to out-distance all
possible competition that influenced the management of the
Daily Intelligencer, one of the most solid and respected
organs of Liberal opinion, in its decision to transfer its
offices for three or four weeks from Fleet Street to Eastern
Turkestan, allowing, of course, a necessary margin of time for
the journey there and back.  This was, in many respects, the
most remarkable of all the Press stampedes that were experienced
at this time.  There was no make-believe about the
undertaking; proprietor, manager, editor, sub-editors,
leader-writers, principal reporters, and so forth, all took part
in what was popularly alluded to as the Drang nach Osten;
an intelligent and efficient office-boy was all that was left in
the deserted hive of editorial industry.”

“Well, you see,” said Sir Lulworth, “the
migration idea was falling somewhat into disrepute from the
half-hearted manner in which it was occasionally carried
out.  You were not impressed by the information that such
and such a paper was being edited and brought out at Lisbon or
Innsbruck if you chanced to see the principal leader-writer or
the art editor lunching as usual at their accustomed
restaurants.  The Daily Intelligencer was determined
to give no loophole for cavil at the genuineness of its
pilgrimage, and it must be admitted that to a certain extent the
arrangements made for transmitting copy and carrying on the usual
features of the paper during the long outward journey worked
smoothly and well.  The series of articles which commenced
at Baku on ‘What Cobdenism might do for the camel
industry’ ranks among the best of the recent contributions
to Free Trade literature, while the views on foreign policy
enunciated ‘from a roof in Yarkand’ showed at least
as much grasp of the international situation as those that had
germinated within half a mile of Downing Street.  Quite in
keeping, too, with the older and better traditions of British
journalism was the manner of the home-coming; no bombast, no
personal advertisement, no flamboyant interviews.  Even a
complimentary luncheon at the Voyagers’ Club' WHERE id = 'd00a72c9-4c8f-44a9-9e4f-e77bd3c50827';
