The wedding took place next day amidst great pomp and rejoicings.
Marzavan was not forgotten, but was given a lucrative post at court,
with a promise of further advancement.

The prince and princess were now entirely happy, and months slipped by
unconsciously in the enjoyment of each other''s society.

One night, however, Prince Camaralzaman dreamt that he saw his father
lying at the point of death, and saying:  "Alas! my son whom I loved so
tenderly, has deserted me and is now causing my death."

The princess said but little at the time, but next morning she went to
the king, and kissing his hand said:

"I have a favour to ask of your Majesty, and I beg you to believe that
it is in no way prompted by my husband.  It is that you will allow us
both to visit my father-in-law King Schahzaman."

Sorry though the king felt at the idea of parting with his daughter, he
felt her request to be so reasonable that he could not refuse it, and
made but one condition, which was that she should only spend one year
at the court of King Schahzaman, suggesting that in future the young
couple should visit their respective parents alternately.

The princess brought this good news to her husband, who thanked her
tenderly for this fresh proof of her affection.

All preparations for the journey were now pressed forwards, and when
all was ready the king accompanied the travellers for some days, after
which he took an affectionate leave of his daughter, and charging the
prince to take every care of her, returned to his capital.

The prince and princess journeyed on, and at the end of a month reached
a huge meadow interspersed with clumps of big trees which cast a most
pleasant shade.  As the heat was great, Camaralzaman thought it well to
encamp in this cool spot.  Accordingly the tents were pitched, and the
princess entering hers whilst the prince was giving his further orders,
removed her girdle, which she placed beside her, and desiring her women
to leave her, lay down and was soon asleep.

When the camp was all in order the prince entered the tent and, seeing
the princess asleep, he sat down near her without speaking.  His eyes
fell on the girdle which, he took up, and whilst inspecting the
precious stones set in it he noticed a little pouch sewn to the girdle
and fastened by a loop.  He touched it and felt something hard within.
Curious as to what this might be, he opened the pouch and found a
cornelian engraved with various figures and strange characters.

"This cornelian must be something very precious," thought he, "or my
wife would not wear it on her person with so much care."

In truth it was a talisman which the Queen of China had given her
daughter, telling her it would ensure her happiness as long as she
carried it about her.

The better to examine the stone the prince stepped to the open doorway
of the tent.  As he stood there holding it in the open palm of his
hand, a bird suddenly swooped down, picked the stone up in its beak and
flew away with it.

The bird having secured its prey flew off some yards and alighted on
the ground, holding the talisman it its beak.  Prince Camaralzaman
advanced, hoping the bird would drop it, but as soon as he approached
the thief fluttered on a little further still.  He continued his
pursuit till the bird suddenly swallowed the stone and took a longer
flight than before.  The prince then hoped to kill it with a stone, but
the more hotly he pursued the further flew the bird.

In this fashion he was led on by hill and dale through the entire day,
and when night came the tiresome creature roosted on the top of a very
high tree where it could rest in safety.

The prince in despair at all his useless trouble began to think whether
he had better return to the camp.  "But," thought he, "how shall I find
my way back?  Must I go up hill or down?  I should certainly lose my
way in the dark, even if my strength held out."  Overwhelmed by hunger,
thirst, fatigue and sleep, he ended by spending the night at the foot
of the tree.

Next morning Camaralzaman woke up before the bird left its perch, and
no sooner did it take flight than he followed it again with as little
success as the previous day, only stopping to eat some herbs and fruit
he found by the way.  In this fashion he spent ten days, following the
bird all day and spending the night at the foot of a tree, whilst it
roosted on the topmost bough.  On the eleventh day the bird and the
prince reached a large town, and as soon as they were close to its
walls the bird took a sudden and higher flight and was shortly
completely out of sight, whilst Camaralzaman felt in despair at having
to give up all hopes of ever recovering the talisman of the Princess
Badoura.

Much cast down, he entered the town, which was built near the sea and
had a fine harbour.  He walked about the streets for a long time, not
knowing where to go, but at length as he walked near the seashore he
found a garden door open and walked in.

The gardener, a good old man, who was at work, happened to look up,
and, seeing a stranger, whom he recognised by his dress as a Mussulman,
he told him to come in at once and to shut the door.

"Because," said the gardener, "I see that you are a stranger and a
Mussulman, and this town is almost entirely inhabited by idolaters, who
hate and persecute all of our faith.  It seems almost a miracle that
has led you to this house, and I am indeed glad that you have found a
place of safety."

Camaralzaman warmly thanked the kind old man for offering him shelter,
and was about to say more, but the gardener interrupted him with:

"Leave compliments alone.  You are weary and must be hungry.  Come in,
eat, and rest."  So saying he led the prince into his cottage, and
after satisfying his hunger begged to learn the cause of his arrival.

Camaralzaman told him all without disguise, and ended by inquiring the
shortest way to his father''s capital.  "For," added he, "if I tried to
rejoin the princess, how should I find her after eleven days''
separation.  Perhaps, indeed, she may be no longer alive!" At this
terrible thought he burst into tears.

The gardener informed Camaralzaman that they were quite a year''s land
journey to any Mahomedan country, but that there was a much shorter
route by sea to the Ebony Island, from whence the Isles of the Children
of Khaledan could be easily reached, and that a ship sailed once a year
for the Ebony Island by which he might get so far as his very home.

"If only you had arrived a few days sooner," he said, "you might have
embarked at once.  As it is you must now wait till next year, but if
you care to stay with me I offer you my house, such as it is, with all
my heart."

Prince Camaralzaman thought himself lucky to find some place of refuge,
and gladly accepted the gardener''s offer.  He spent his days working in
the garden, and his nights thinking of and sighing for his beloved wife.

On first waking she was much surprised not to find the prince near her.
She called her women and asked if they knew where he was, and whilst
they were telling her that they had seen him enter the tent, but had
not noticed his leaving it, she took up her belt and perceived that the
little pouch was open and the talisman gone.

She at once concluded that her husband had taken it and would shortly
bring it back.  She waited for him till evening rather impatiently, and
wondering what could have kept him from her so long.  When night came
without him she felt in despair and abused the talisman and its maker
roundly.  In spite of her grief and anxiety however, she did not lose
her presence of mind, but decided on a courageous, though very unusual
step.

Only the princess and her women knew of Camaralzaman''s disappearance,
for the rest of the party were sleeping or resting in their tents.
Fearing some treason should the truth be known, she ordered her women
not to say a word which would give rise to any suspicion, and proceeded
to change her dress for one of her husband''s, to whom, as has been
already said, she bore a strong likeness.

In this disguise she looked so like the prince that when she gave
orders next morning to break up the camp and continue the journey no
one suspected the change.  She made one of her women enter her litter,
whilst she herself mounted on horseback and the march began.

After a protracted journey by land and sea the princess, still under
the name and disguise of Prince Camaralzaman, arrived at the capital of
the Ebony Island whose king was named Armanos.

No sooner did the king hear that the ship which was just in port had on
board the son of his old friend and ally than he hurried to meet the
supposed prince, and had him and his retinue brought to the palace,
where they were lodged and entertained sumptuously.

After three days, finding that his guest, to whom he had taken a great
fancy, talked of continuing his journey, King Armanos said to him:

"Prince, I am now an old man, and unfortunately I have no son to whom
to leave my kingdom.  It has pleased Heaven to give me only one
daughter, who possesses such great beauty and charm that I could only
give her to a prince as highly born and as accomplished as yourself.
Instead, therefore, of returning to your own country, take my daughter
and my crown and stay with us.  I shall feel that I have a worthy
successor, and shall cheerfully retire from the fatigues of government."

The king''s offer was naturally rather embarrassing to the Princess
Badoura.  She felt that it was equally impossible to confess that she
had deceived him, or to refuse the marriage on which he had set his
heart; a refusal which might turn all his kindness to hatred and
persecution.

All things considered, she decided to accept, and after a few moments
silence said with a blush, which the king attributed to modesty:

"Sire, I feel so great an obligation for the good opinion your Majesty
has expressed for my person and of the honour you do me, that, though I
am quite unworthy of it, I dare not refuse.  But, sire, I can only
accept such an alliance if you give me your promise to assist me with
your counsels."

The marriage being thus arranged, the ceremony was fixed for the
following day, and the princess employed the intervening time in
informing the officers of her suite of what had happened, assuring them
that the Princess Badoura had given her full consent to the marriage.
She also told her women, and bade them keep her secret well.

King Armanos, delighted with the success of his plans, lost no time in
assembling his court and council, to whom he presented his successor,
and placing his future son-in-law on the throne made everyone do homage
and take oaths of allegiance to the new king.

At night the whole town was filled with rejoicings, and with much pomp
the Princess Haiatelnefous (this was the name of the king''s daughter)
was conducted to the palace of the Princess Badoura.

Now Badoura had thought much of the difficulties of her first interview
with King Armanos'' daughter, and she felt the only thing to do was at
once to take her into her confidence.

"Princess, I have a secret to tell you, and must throw myself on your
mercy.  I am not Prince Camaralzaman, but a princess like yourself and
his wife, and I beg you to listen to my story, then I am sure you will
forgive my imposture, in consideration of my sufferings."

She then related her whole history, and at its close Haiatelnefous
embraced her warmly, and assured her of her entire sympathy and
affection.

The two princesses now planned out their future action, and agreed to
combine to keep up the deception and to let Badoura continue to play a
man''s part until such time as there might be news of the real
Camaralzaman.

Whilst these things were passing in the Ebony Island Prince
Camaralzaman continued to find shelter in the gardeners cottage in the
town of the idolaters.

"To-day is a public holiday, and the people of the town not only do not
work themselves but forbid others to do so.  You had better therefore
take a good rest whilst I go to see some friends, and as the time is
near for the arrival of the ship of which I told you I will make
inquiries about it, and try to bespeak a passage for you." He then put
on his best clothes and went out, leaving the prince, who strolled into
the garden and was soon lost in thoughts of his dear wife and their sad
separation.

As he walked up and down he was suddenly disturbed in his reverie by
the noise two large birds were making in a tree.

Camaralzaman stood still and looked up, and saw that the birds were
fighting so savagely with beaks and claws that before long one fell
dead to the ground, whilst the conqueror spread his wings and flew
away.  Almost immediately two other larger birds, who had been watching
the duel, flew up and alighted, one at the head and the other at the
feet of the dead bird.  They stood there some time sadly shaking their
heads, and then dug up a grave with their claws in which they buried
him.

As soon as they had filled in the grave the two flew off, and ere long
returned, bringing with them the murderer, whom they held, one by a
wing and the other by a leg, with their beaks, screaming and struggling
with rage and terror.  But they held tight, and having brought him to
his victim''s grave, they proceeded to kill him, after which they tore
open his body, scattered the inside and once more flew away.

The prince, who had watched the whole scene with much interest, now
drew near the spot where it happened, and glancing at the dead bird he
noticed something red lying near which had evidently fallen out of its
inside.  He picked it up, and what was his surprise when he recognised
the Princess Badoura''s talisman which had been the cause of many
misfortunes.  It would be impossible to describe his joy; he kissed the
talisman repeatedly, wrapped it up, and carefully tied it round his
arm.  For the first time since his separation from the princess he had
a good night, and next morning he was up at day-break and went
cheerfully to ask what work he should do.

The gardener told him to cut down an old fruit tree which had quite
died away, and Camaralzaman took an axe and fell to vigorously.  As he
was hacking at one of the roots the axe struck on something hard.  On
pushing away the earth he discovered a large slab of bronze, under
which was disclosed a staircase with ten steps.  He went down them and
found himself in a roomy kind of cave in which stood fifty large bronze
jars, each with a cover on it.  The prince uncovered one after another,
and found them all filled with gold dust.  Delighted with his discovery
he left the cave, replaced the slab, and having finished cutting down
the tree waited for the gardener''s return.

The gardener had heard the night before that the ship about which he
was inquiring would start ere long, but the exact date not being yet
known he had been told to return next day for further information.  He
had gone therefore to inquire, and came back with good news beaming in
his face.

"My son," said he, "rejoice and hold yourself ready to start in three
days'' time.  The ship is to set sail, and I have arranged all about
your passage with the captain.

"You could not bring me better news," replied Camaralzaman, "and in
return I have something pleasant to tell you.  Follow me and see the
good fortune which has befallen you."

He then led the gardener to the cave, and having shown him the treasure
stored up there, said how happy it made him that Heaven should in this
way reward his kind host''s many virtues and compensate him for the
privations of many years.

"What do you mean?" asked the gardener.  "Do you imagine that I should
appropriate this treasure?  It is yours, and I have no right whatever
to it.  For the last eighty years I have dug up the ground here without
discovering anything.  It is clear that these riches are intended for
you, and they are much more needed by a prince like yourself than by an
old man like me, who am near my end and require nothing.  This treasure
comes just at the right time, when you are about to return to your own
country, where you will make good use of it."

But the prince would not hear of this suggestion, and finally after
much discussion they agreed to divide the gold.  When this was done the
gardener said:

"My son, the great thing now is to arrange how you can best carry off
this treasure as secretly as possible for fear of losing it.  There are
no olives in the Ebony Island, and those imported from here fetch a
high price.  As you know, I have a good stock of the olives which grew
in this garden.  Now you must take fifty jars, fill each half full of
gold dust and fill them up with the olives.  We will then have them
taken on board ship when you embark."

The prince took this advice, and spent the rest of the day filling the
fifty jars, and fearing lest the precious talisman might slip from his
arm and be lost again, he took the precaution of putting it in one of
the jars, on which he made a mark so as to be able to recognise it.
When night came the jars were all ready, and the prince and his host
went to bed.

Whether in consequence of his great age, or of the fatigues and
excitement of the previous day, I do not know, but the gardener passed
a very bad night.  He was worse next day, and by the morning of the
third day was dangerously ill.  At daybreak the ship''s captain and some
of his sailors knocked at the garden door and asked for the passenger
who was to embark.

"I am he," said Camaralzaman, who had opened the door.  "The gardener
who took my passage is ill and cannot see you, but please come in and
take these jars of olives and my bag, and I will follow as soon as I
have taken leave of him."

The sailors did as he asked, and the captain before leaving charged
Camaralzaman to lose no time, as the wind was fair, and he wished to
set sail at once.

As soon as they were gone the prince returned to the cottage to bid
farewell to his old friend, and to thank him once more for all his
kindness.  But the old man was at his last gasp, and had barely
murmured his confession of faith when he expired.

Camaralzaman was obliged to stay and pay him the last offices, so
having dug a grave in the garden he wrapped the kind old man up and
buried him.  He then locked the door, gave up the key to the owner of
the garden, and hurried to the quay only to hear that the ship had
sailed long ago, after waiting three hours for him.

It may well be believed that the prince felt in despair at this fresh
misfortune, which obliged him to spend another year in a strange and
distasteful country.  Moreover, he had once more lost the Princess
Badoura''s talisman, which he feared he might never see again.  There
was nothing left for him but to hire the garden as the old man had
done, and to live on in the cottage.  As he could not well cultivate
the garden by himself, he engaged a lad to help him, and to secure the
rest of the treasure he put the remaining gold dust into fifty more
jars, filling them up with olives so as to have them ready for
transport.

Whilst the prince was settling down to this second year of toil and
privation, the ship made a rapid voyage and arrived safely at the Ebony
Island.

As the palace of the new king, or rather of the Princess Badoura,
overlooked the harbour, she saw the ship entering it and asked what
vessel it was coming in so gaily decked with flags, and was told that
it was a ship from the Island of the Idolaters which yearly brought
rich merchandise.

The princess, ever on the look out for any chance of news of her
beloved husband, went down to the harbour attended by some officers of
the court, and arrived just as the captain was landing.  She sent for
him and asked many questions as to his country, voyage, what passengers
he had, and what his vessel was laden with.  The captain answered all
her questions, and said that his passengers consisted entirely of
traders who brought rich stuffs from various countries, fine muslins,
precious stones, musk, amber, spices, drugs, olives, and many other
things.

"I will take all you have on board.  Have them unloaded and we will
make our bargain at once, and tell the other merchants to let me see
all their best wares before showing them to other people."

"Sire," replied the captain, "I have on board fifty very large pots of
olives.  They belong to a merchant who was left behind, as in spite of
waiting for him he delayed so long that I was obliged to set sail
without him."

The captain accordingly sent his boat off to the ship and it soon
returned laden with the fifty pots of olives.  The princess asked what
they might be worth.

"Sire," replied the captain, "the merchant is very poor.  Your Majesty
will not overpay him if you give him a thousand pieces of silver."

"In order to satisfy him and as he is so poor," said the princess, "I
will order a thousand pieces of gold to be given you, which you will be
sure to remit to him."

So saying she gave orders for the payment and returned to the palace,
having the jars carried before her.  When evening came the Princess
Badoura retired to the inner part of the palace, and going to the
apartments of the Princess Haiatelnefous she had the fifty jars of
olives brought to her.  She opened one to let her friend taste the
olives and to taste them herself, but great was her surprise when, on
pouring some into a dish, she found them all powdered with gold dust.
"What an adventure! how extraordinary!" she cried.  Then she had the
other jars opened, and was more and more surprised to find the olives
in each jar mixed with gold dust.

But when at length her talisman was discovered in one of the jars her
emotion was so great that she fainted away.  The Princess Haiatelnefous
and her women hastened to restore her, and as soon as she recovered
consciousness she covered the precious talisman with kisses.

"You will have guessed, my dear, that it was the sight of this talisman
which has moved me so deeply.  This was the cause of my separation from
my dear husband, and now, I am convinced, it will be the means of our
reunion."

As soon as it was light next day the Princess Badoura sent for the
captain, and made further inquiries about the merchant who owned the
olive jars she had bought.

In reply the captain told her all he knew of the place where the young
man lived, and how, after engaging his passage, he came to be left
behind.

"If that is the case," said the princess, "you must set sail at once
and go back for him.  He is a debtor of mine and must be brought here
at once, or I will confiscate all your merchandise.  I shall now give
orders to have all the warehouses where your cargo is placed under the
royal seal, and they will only be opened when you have brought me the
man I ask for.  Go at once and obey my orders."

The captain had no choice but to do as he was bid, so hastily
provisioning his ship he started that same evening on his return voyage.

When, after a rapid passage, he gained sight of the Island of
Idolaters, he judged it better not to enter the harbour, but casting
anchor at some distance he embarked at night in a small boat with six
active sailors and landed near Camaralzaman''s cottage.

The prince was not asleep, and as he lay awake moaning over all the sad
events which had separated him from his wife, he thought he heard a
knock at the garden door.  He went to open it, and was immediately
seized by the captain and sailors, who without a word of explanation
forcibly bore him off to the boat, which took them back to the ship
without loss of time.  No sooner were they on board than they weighed
anchor and set sail.

Camaralzaman, who had kept silence till then, now asked the captain
(whom he had recognised) the reason for this abduction.

"Well, you must know better than I," said the captain.  "You will soon
see him now, and meantime be content where you are and have patience."

The return voyage was as prosperous as the former one, and though it
was night when the ship entered the harbour, the captain lost no time
in landing with his passenger, whom he conducted to the palace, where
he begged an audience with the king.

Directly the Princess Badoura saw the prince she recognised him in
spite of his shabby clothes.  She longed to throw herself on his neck,
but restrained herself, feeling it was better for them both that she
should play her part a little longer.  She therefore desired one of her
officers to take care of him and to treat him well.  Next she ordered
another officer to remove the seals from the warehouse, whilst she
presented the captain with a costly diamond, and told him to keep the
thousand pieces of gold paid for the olives, as she would arrange
matters with the merchant himself.

She then returned to her private apartments, where she told the
Princess Haiatelnefous all that had happened, as well as her plans for
the future, and begged her assistance, which her friend readily
promised.

Next morning she ordered the prince to be taken to the bath and clothed
in a manner suitable to an emir or governor of a province.  He was then
introduced to the council, where his good looks and grand air drew the
attention of all on him.

Princess Badoura, delighted to see him looking himself once more,
turned to the other emirs, saying:

"My lords, I introduce to you a new colleague, Camaralzaman, whom I
have known on my travels and who, I can assure you, you will find well
deserves your regard and admiration."

Camaralzaman was much surprised at hearing the king--whom he never
suspected of being a woman in disguise--asserting their acquaintance,
for he felt sure he had never seen her before.  However he received all
the praises bestowed on him with becoming modesty, and prostrating
himself, said:

"Sire, I cannot find words in which to thank your Majesty for the great
honour conferred on me.  I can but assure you that I will do all in my
power to prove myself worthy of it."

On leaving the council the prince was conducted to a splendid house
which had been prepared for him, where he found a full establishment
and well-filled stables at his orders.  On entering his study his
steward presented him with a coffer filled with gold pieces for his
current expenses.  He felt more and more puzzled by such good fortune,
and little guessed that the Princess of China was the cause of it.

After a few days the Princess Badoura promoted Camaralzaman to the post
of grand treasurer, an office which he filled with so much integrity
and benevolence as to win universal esteem.

He would now have thought himself the happiest of men had it not been
for that separation which he never ceased to bewail.  He had no clue to
the mystery of his present position, for the princess, out of
compliment to the old king, had taken his name, and was generally known
as King Armanos the younger, few people remembering that on her first
arrival she went by another name.

At length the princess felt that the time had come to put an end to her
own and the prince''s suspense, and having arranged all her plans with
the Princess Haiatelnefous, she informed Camaralzaman that she wished
his advice on some important business, and, to avoid being disturbed,
desired him to come to the palace that evening.

The prince was punctual, and was received in the private apartment,
when, having ordered her attendants to withdraw, the princess took from
a small box the talisman, and, handing it to Camaralzaman, said:  "Not
long ago an astrologer gave me this talisman.  As you are universally
well informed, you can perhaps tell me what is its use."

Camaralzaman took the talisman and, holding it to the light, cried with
surprise, "Sire, you ask me the use of this talisman.  Alas! hitherto
it has been only a source of misfortune to me, being the cause of my
separation from the one I love best on earth.  The story is so sad and
strange that I am sure your Majesty will be touched by it if you will
permit me to tell it you."

"I will hear it some other time," replied the princess.  "Meanwhile I
fancy it is not quite unknown to me.  Wait here for me.  I will return
shortly."

So saying she retired to another room, where she hastily changed her
masculine attire for that of a woman, and, after putting on the girdle
she wore the day they parted, returned to Camaralzaman.

The prince recognised her at once, and, embracing her with the utmost
tenderness, cried, "Ah, how can I thank the king for this delightful
surprise?"

"Do not expect ever to see the king again," said the princess, as she
wiped the tears of joy from her eyes, "in me you see the king.  Let us
sit down, and I will tell you all about it."

She then gave a full account of all her adventures since their parting,
and dwelt much on the charms and noble disposition of the Princess
Haiatelnefous, to whose friendly assistance she owed so much.  When she
had done she asked to hear the prince''s story, and in this manner they
spent most of the night.

Next morning the princess resumed her woman''s clothes, and as soon as
she was ready she desired the chief eunuch to beg King Armanos to come
to her apartments.

When the king arrived great was his surprise at finding a strange lady
in company of the grand treasurer who had no actual right to enter the
private apartment.  Seating himself he asked for the king.

"Sire," said the princess, "yesterday I was the king, to-day I am only
the Princess of China and wife to the real Prince Camaralzaman, son of
King Schahzaman, and I trust that when your Majesty shall have heard
our story you will not condemn the innocent deception I have been
obliged to practise."

At the close of her narrative the princess said, "Sire, as our religion
allows a man to have more than one wife, I would beg your Majesty to
give your daughter, the Princess Haiatelnefous, in marriage to Prince
Camaralzaman.  I gladly yield to her the precedence and title of Queen
in recognition of the debt of gratitude which I owe her."

King Armanos heard the princess with surprise and admiration, then,
turning to Camaralzaman, he said, "My son, as your wife, the Princess
Badoura (whom I have hitherto looked on as my son-in-law), consents to
share your hand and affections with my daughter, I have only to ask if
this marriage is agreeable to you, and if you will consent to accept
the crown which the Princess Badoura deserves to wear all her life, but
which she prefers to resign for love of you."

Accordingly Camaralzaman was duly proclaimed king, and as duly married
with all pomp to the Princess Haiatelnefous, with whose beauty,
talents, and affections he had every reason to be pleased.

The two queens lived in true sisterly harmony together, and after a
time each presented King Camaralzaman with a son, whose births were
celebrated throughout the kingdom with the utmost rejoicing.

Balsora was the capital of a kingdom long tributary to the caliph.
During the time of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid the king of Balsora,
who was his cousin, was called Zinebi.  Not thinking one vizir enough
for the administration of his estates he had two, named Khacan and
Saouy.

Khacan was kind, generous, and liberal, and took pleasure in obliging,
as far as in him lay, those who had business with him.  Throughout the
entire kingdom there was no one who did not esteem and praise him as he
deserved.

Saouy was quite a different character, and repelled everyone with whom
he came in contact; he was always gloomy, and, in spite of his great
riches, so miserly that he denied himself even the necessaries of life.
What made him particularly detested was the great aversion he had to
Khacan, of whom he never ceased to speak evil to the king.

One day, while the king amused himself talking with his two vizirs and
other members of the council, the conversation turned on female slaves.
While some declared that it sufficed for a slave to be beautiful,
others, and Khacan was among the number, maintained that beauty alone
was not enough, but that it must be accompanied by wit, wisdom,
modesty, and, if possible, knowledge.

The king not only declared himself to be of this opinion, but charged
Khacan to procure him a slave who should fulfil all these conditions.
Saouy, who had been of the opposite side, and was jealous of the honour
done to Khacan, said, "Sire, it will be very difficult to find a slave
as accomplished as your Majesty desires, and, if she is to be found,
she will be cheap if she cost less than 10,000 gold pieces."

"Saouy," answered the king, "you seem to find that a very great sum.
For you it may be so, but not for me."

And forthwith he ordered his grand treasurer, who was present, to send
10,000 gold pieces to Khacan for the purchase of the slave.

As soon, then, as Khacan returned home he sent for the dealers in
female slaves, and charged them directly they had found such a one as
he described to inform him.  They promised to do their utmost, and no
day passed that they did not bring a slave for his inspection but none
was found without some defect.

At length, early one morning, while Khacan was on his way to the king''s
palace, a dealer, throwing himself in his way, announced eagerly that a
Persian merchant, arrived late the previous evening, had a slave to
sell whose wit and wisdom were equal to her incomparable beauty.

Khacan, overjoyed at this news, gave orders that the slave should be
brought for his inspection on his return from the palace.  The dealer
appearing at the appointed hour, Khacan found the slave beautiful
beyond his expectations, and immediately gave her the name of "The Fair
Persian."

Being a man of great wisdom and learning, he perceived in the short
conversation he had with her that he would seek in vain another slave
to surpass her in any of the qualities required by the king, and
therefore asked the dealer what price the merchant put upon her.

"Sir," was the answer, "for less than 10,000 gold pieces he will not
let her go; he declares that, what with masters for her instruction,
and for bodily exercises, not to speak of clothing and nourishment, he
has already spent that sum upon her.  She is in every way fit to be the
slave of a king; she plays every musical instrument, she sings, she
dances, she makes verses, in fact there is no accomplishment in which
she does not excel."

Khacan, who was better able to judge of her merits than the dealer,
wishing to bring the matter to a conclusion, sent for the merchant, and
said to him, "It is not for myself that I wish to buy your slave, but
for the king.  Her price, however, is too high."

"Sir," replied the merchant, "I should esteem it an honour to present
her to his Majesty, did it become a merchant to do such a thing.  I ask
no more than the sum it has cost me to make her such as she is."

Khacan, not wishing to bargain, immediately had the sum counted out,
and given to the merchant, who before withdrawing said:

"Sir, as she is destined for the king, I would have you observe that
she is extremely tired with the long journey, and before presenting her
to his Majesty you would do well to keep her a fortnight in your own
house, and to see that a little care is bestowed upon her.  The sun has
tanned her complexion, but when she has been two or three times to the
bath, and is fittingly dressed, you will see how much her beauty will
be increased."

Khacan thanked the merchant for his advice, and determined to follow
it.  He gave the beautiful Persian an apartment near to that of his
wife, whom he charged to treat her as befitting a lady destined for the
king, and to order for her the most magnificent garments.

Before bidding adieu to the fair Persian, he said to her: "No happiness
can be greater than what I have procured for you; judge for yourself,
you now belong to the king.  I have, however, to warn you of one thing.
I have a son, who, though not wanting in sense, is young, foolish, and
headstrong, and I charge you to keep him at a distance."

Noureddin--for so the vizir''s son was named--went freely in and out of
his mother''s apartments.  He was young, well-made and agreeable, and
had the gift of charming all with whom he came in contact.  As soon as
he saw the beautiful Persian, though aware that she was destined for
the king, he let himself be carried away by her charms, and determined
at once to use every means in his power to retain her for himself.  The
Persian was equally captivated by Noureddin, and said to herself:  "The
vizir does me too great honour in buying me for the king.  I should
esteem myself very happy if he would give me to his son."

Noureddin availed himself of every opportunity to gaze upon her beauty,
to talk and laugh with her, and never would have left her side if his
mother had not forced him.

Some time having elapsed, on account of the long journey, since the
beautiful Persian had been to the bath, five or six days after her
purchase the vizir''s wife gave orders that the bath should be heated
for her, and that her own female slaves should attend her there, and
after-wards should array her in a magnificent dress that had been
prepared for her.

Her toilet completed, the beautiful Persian came to present herself to
the vizir''s wife, who hardly recognised her, so greatly was her beauty
increased.  Kissing her hand, the beautiful slave said: "Madam, I do
not know how you find me in this dress that you have had prepared for
me; your women assure me that it suits me so well that they hardly knew
me.  If it is the truth they tell me, and not flattery, it is to you I
owe the transformation."

"My daughter," answered the vizir''s wife, "they do not flatter you.  I
myself hardly recognised you.  The improvement is not due to the dress
alone, but largely to the beautifying effects of the bath.  I am so
struck by its results, that I would try it on myself."

Acting forthwith on this decision she ordered two little slaves during
her absence to watch over the beautiful Persian, and not to allow
Noureddin to enter should he come.

She had no sooner gone than he arrived, and not finding his mother in
her apartment, would have sought her in that of the Persian.  The two
little slaves barred the entrance, saying that his mother had given
orders that he was not to be admitted.  Taking each by an arm, he put
them out of the anteroom, and shut the door.  Then they rushed to the
bath, informing their mistress with shrieks and tears that Noureddin
had driven them away by force and gone in.

This news caused great consternation to the lady, who, dressing herself
as quickly as possible, hastened to the apartment of the fair Persian,
to find that Noureddin had already gone out.  Much astonished to see
the vizir''s wife enter in tears, the Persian asked what misfortune had
happened.

"What!" exclaimed the lady, "you ask me that, knowing that my son
Noureddin has been alone with you?"

"Certainly, but Noureddin has just been to tell me that his father has
changed his mind and has bestowed me upon him.  I believed him, and so
great is my affection for Noureddin that I would willingly pass my life
with him."

"Would to heaven," exclaimed the wife of the vizir, "that what you say
were true; but Noureddin has deceived you, and his father will
sacrifice him in vengeance for the wrong he has done."

Khacan, entering shortly after this, was much astonished to find his
wife and her slaves in tears, and the beautiful Persian greatly
perturbed.  He inquired the cause, but for some time no answer was
forthcoming.  When his wife was at length sufficiently calm to inform
him of what had happened, his rage and mortification knew no bounds.
Wringing his hands and rending his beard, he exclaimed:

"Wretched son! thou destroyest not only thyself but thy father.  The
king will shed not only thy blood but mine."  His wife tried to console
him, saying:  "Do not torment thyself.  With the sale of my jewels I
will obtain 10,000 gold pieces, and with this sum you will buy another
slave."

"Do not suppose," replied her husband, "that it is the loss of the
money that affects me.  My honour is at stake, and that is more
precious to me than all my wealth.  You know that Saouy is my mortal
enemy.  He will relate all this to the king, and you will see the
consequences that will ensue."

"My lord," said his wife, "I am quite aware of Saouy''s baseness, and
that he is capable of playing you this malicious trick.  But how can he
or any one else know what takes place in this house?  Even if you are
suspected and the king accuses you, you have only to say that, after
examining the slave, you did not find her worthy of his Majesty.
Reassure yourself, and send to the dealers, saying that you are not
satisfied, and wish them to find you another slave."

This advice appearing reasonable, Khacan decided to follow it, but his
wrath against his son did not abate.  Noureddin dared not appear all
that day, and fearing to take refuge with his usual associates in case
his father should seek him there, he spent the day in a secluded garden
where he was not known.  He did not return home till after his father
had gone to bed, and went out early next morning before the vizir
awoke, and these precautions he kept up during an entire month.

His mother, though knowing very well that he returned to the house
every evening, dare not ask her husband to pardon him.  At length she
took courage and said:

"My lord, I know that a son could not act more basely towards his
father than Noureddin has done towards you, but after all will you now
pardon him?  Do you not consider the harm you may be doing yourself,
and fear that malicious people, seeking the cause of your estrangement,
may guess the real one?"

"Madam," replied the vizir, "what you say is very just, but I cannot
pardon Noureddin before I have mortified him as he deserves."

"He will be sufficiently punished," answered the lady, "if you do as I
suggest.  In the evening, when he returns home, lie in wait for him and
pretend that you will slay him.  I will come to his aid, and while
pointing out that you only yield his life at my supplications, you can
force him to take the beautiful Persian on any conditions you please."
Khacan agreed to follow this plan, and everything took place as
arranged.  On Noureddin''s return Khacan pretended to be about to slay
him, but yielding to his wife''s intercession, said to his son:

"You owe your life to your mother.  I pardon you on her intercession,
and on the conditions that you take the beautiful Persian for your
wife, and not your slave, that you never sell her, nor put her away."

Noureddin, not hoping for so great indulgence, thanked his father, and
vowed to do as he desired.  Khacan was at great pains frequently to
speak to the king of the difficulties attending the commission he had
given him, but some whispers of what had actually taken place did reach
Saouy''s ears.

More than a year after these events the minister took a chill, leaving
the bath while still heated to go out on important business.  This
resulted in inflammation of the lungs, which rapidly increased.  The
vizir, feeling that his end was at hand, sent for Noureddin, and
charged him with his dying breath never to part with the beautiful
Persian.

Shortly afterwards he expired, leaving universal regret throughout the
kingdom; rich and poor alike followed him to the grave.  Noureddin
showed every mark of the deepest grief at his father''s death, and for
long refused to see any one.  At length a day came when, one of his
friends being admitted, urged him strongly to be consoled, and to
resume his former place in society.  This advice Noureddin was not slow
to follow, and soon he formed little society of ten young men all about
his own age, with whom he spent all his time in continual feasting and
merry-making.

Sometimes the fair Persian consented to appear at these festivities,
but she disapproved of this lavish expenditure, and did not scruple to
warn Noureddin of the probable consequences.  He, however, only laughed
at her advice, saying, that his father had always kept him in too great
constraint, and that now he rejoiced at his new-found liberty.

What added to the confusion in his affairs was that he refused to look
into his accounts with his steward, sending him away every time he
appeared with his book.

Not only did Noureddin''s friends constantly partake of his hospitality,
but in every way they took advantage of his generosity; everything of
his that they admired, whether land, houses, baths, or any other source
of his revenue, he immediately bestowed on them.  In vain the Persian
protested against the wrong he did himself; he continued to scatter
with the same lavish hand.

Throughout one entire year Noureddin did nothing but amuse himself, and
dissipate the wealth his father had taken such pains to acquire.  The
year had barely elapsed, when one day, as they sat at table, there came
a knock at the door.  The slaves having been sent away, Noureddin went
to open it himself.  One of his friends had risen at the same time, but
Noureddin was before him, and finding the intruder to be the steward,
he went out and closed the door.  The friend, curious to hear what
passed between them, hid himself behind the hangings, and heard the
following words:

"My lord," said the steward, "I beg a thousand pardons for interrupting
you, but what I have long foreseen has taken place.  Nothing remains of
the sums you gave me for your expenses, and all other sources of income
are also at end, having been transferred by you to others.  If you wish
me to remain in your service, furnish me with the necessary funds, else
I must withdraw."

The friend, who had been listening behind the curtain, immediately
hastened to communicate the news to the rest of the company.

Noureddin re-entering at that moment, they plainly saw, in spite of his
efforts to dissemble, that what they had heard was the truth.  One by
one they rose, and each with a different excuse left the room, till
presently he found himself alone, though little suspecting the
resolution his friends had taken.  Then, seeing the beautiful Persian,
he confided to her the statement of the steward, with many expressions
of regret for his own carelessness.

"Had I but followed your advice, beautiful Persian," he said, "all this
would not have happened, but at least I have this consolation, that I
have spent my fortune in the company of friends who will not desert me
in an hour of need.  To-morrow I will go to them, and amongst them they
will lend me a sum sufficient to start in some business."

Accordingly next morning early Noureddin went to seek his ten friends,
who all lived in the same street.  Knocking at the door of the first
and chief, the slave who opened it left him to wait in a hall while he
announced his visit to his master.  "Noureddin!" he heard him exclaim
quite audibly.  "Tell him, every time he calls, that I am not at home."
The same thing happened at the second door, and also at the third, and
so on with all the ten.  Noureddin, much mortified, recognised too late
that he had confided in false friends, who abandoned him in his hour of
need.  Overwhelmed with grief, he sought consolation from the beautiful
Persian.

"Alas, my lord," she said, "at last you are convinced of the truth of
what I foretold.  There is now no other resource left but to sell your
slaves and your furniture."

First then he sold the slaves, and subsisted for a time on the
proceeds, after that the furniture was sold, and as much of it was
valuable it sufficed for some time.  Finally this resource also came to
an end, and again he sought counsel from the beautiful Persian.

"My lord," she said, "I know that the late vizir, your father, bought
me for 10,000 gold pieces, and though I have diminished in value since,
I should still fetch a large sum.  Do not therefore hesitate to sell
me, and with the money you obtain go and establish yourself in business
in some distant town."

"Charming Persian," answered Noureddin, "how could I be guilty of such
baseness?  I would die rather than part from you whom I love better
than my life."

"My lord," she replied, "I am well aware of your love for me, which is
only equalled by mine for you, but a cruel necessity obliges us to seek
the only remedy."

Noureddin, convinced at length of the truth of her words, yielded, and
reluctantly led her to the slave market, where, showing her to a dealer
named Hagi Hassan, he inquired her value.

Taking them into a room apart, Hagi Hassan exclaimed as soon as she had
unveiled, "My lord, is not this the slave your father bought for 10,000
pieces?"

On learning that it was so, he promised to obtain the highest possible
price for her.  Leaving the beautiful Persian shut up in the room
alone, he went out to seek the slave merchants, announcing to them that
he had found the pearl among slaves, and asking them to come and put a
value upon her.  As soon as they saw her they agreed that less than
4,000 gold pieces could not be asked.  Hagi Hassan, then closing the
door upon her, began to offer her for sale--calling out: "Who will bid
4,000 gold pieces for the Persian slave?"

Before any of the merchants had bid, Saouy happened to pass that way,
and judging that it must be a slave of extraordinary beauty, rode up to
Hagi Hassan and desired to see her.  Now it was not the custom to show
a slave to a private bidder, but as no one dared to disobey the vizir
his request was granted.

As soon as Saouy saw the Persian he was so struck by her beauty, that
he immediately wished to possess her, and not knowing that she belonged
to Noureddin, he desired Hagi Hassan to send for the owner and to
conclude the bargain at once.

Hagi Hassan then sought Noureddin, and told him that his slave was
going far below her value, and that if Saouy bought her he was capable
of not paying the money.  "What you must do," he said, "is to pretend
that you had no real intention of selling your slave, and only swore
you would in a fit of anger against her.  When I present her to Saouy
as if with your consent you must step in, and with blows begin to lead
her away."

Noureddin did as Hagi Hassan advised, to the great wrath of Saouy, who
riding straight at him endeavoured to take the beautiful Persian from
him by force.  Noureddin letting her go, seized Saouy''s horse by the
bridle, and, encouraged by the applause of the bystanders, dragged him
to the ground, beat him severely, and left him in the gutter streaming
with blood.  Then, taking the beautiful Persian, he returned home
amidst the acclamations of the people, who detested Saouy so much that
they would neither interfere in his behalf nor allow his slaves to
protect him.

Covered from head to foot with mire and streaming with blood he rose,
and leaning on two of his slaves went straight to the palace, where he
demanded an audience of the king, to whom he related what had taken
place in these words:

"May it please your Majesty, I had gone to the slave market to buy
myself a cook.  While there I heard a slave being offered for 4,000
pieces.  Asking to see her, I found she was of incomparable beauty, and
was being sold by Noureddin, the son of your late vizir, to whom your
Majesty will remember giving a sum of 10,000 gold pieces for the
purchase of a slave.  This is the identical slave, whom instead of
bringing to your Majesty he gave to his own son.  Since the death of
his father this Noureddin has run through his entire fortune, has sold
all his possessions, and is now reduced to selling the slave.  Calling
him to me, I said:  "Noureddin, I will give you 10,000 gold pieces for
your slave, whom I will present to the king.  I will interest him at
the same time in your behalf, and this will be worth much more to you
than what extra money you might obtain from the merchants."  "Bad old
man," he exclaimed, "rather than sell my slave to you I would give her
to a Jew." "But, Noureddin," I remonstrated, "you do not consider that
in speaking thus you wrong the king, to whom your father owed
everything." This remonstrance only irritated him the more.  Throwing
himself on me like a madman, he tore me from my horse, beat me to his
heart''s content, and left me in the state your Majesty sees."

The king''s wrath was kindled against Noureddin.  He ordered the captain
of the guard to take with him forty men, to pillage Noureddin''s house,
to rase it to the ground, and to bring Noureddin and the slave to him.
A doorkeeper, named Sangiar, who had been a slave of Khacan''s, hearing
this order given, slipped out of the king''s apartment, and hastened to
warn Noureddin to take flight instantly with the beautiful Persian.
Then, presenting him with forty gold pieces, he disappeared before
Noureddin had time to thank him.

As soon, then, as the fair Persian had put on her veil they fled
together, and had the good fortune to get out of the town without being
observed.  At the mouth of the Euphrates they found a ship just about
to start for Bagdad.  They embarked, and immediately the anchor was
raised and they set sail.

When the captain of the guard reached Noureddin''s house he caused his
soldiers to burst open the door and to enter by force, but no trace was
to be found of Noureddin and his slave, nor could the neighbours give
any information about them.  When the king heard that they had escaped,
he issued a proclamation that a reward of 1,000 gold pieces would be
given to whoever would bring him Noureddin and the slave, but that, on
the contrary, whoever hid them would be severely punished.  Meanwhile
Noureddin and the fair Persian had safely reached Bagdad.  When the
vessel had come to an anchor they paid five gold pieces for their
passage and went ashore.  Never having been in Bagdad before, they did
not know where to seek a lodging.  Wandering along the banks of the
Tigris, they skirted a garden enclosed by a high wall.  The gate was
shut, but in front of it was an open vestibule with a sofa on either
side.  "Here," said Noureddin, "let us pass the night," and reclining
on the sofas they soon fell asleep.

Now this garden belonged to the Caliph.  In the middle of it was a vast
pavilion, whose superb saloon had eighty windows, each window having a
lustre, lit solely when the Caliph spent the evening there.  Only the
door-keeper lived there, an old soldier named Scheih Ibrahim, who had
strict orders to be very careful whom he admitted, and never to allow
any one to sit on the sofas by the door.  It happened that evening that
he had gone out on an errand.  When he came back and saw two persons
asleep on the sofas he was about to drive them out with blows, but
drawing nearer he perceived that they were a handsome young man and
beautiful young woman, and decided to awake them by gentler means.
Noureddin, on being awoke, told the old man that they were strangers,
and merely wished to pass the night there.  "Come with me," said Scheih
Ibrahim, "I will lodge you better, and will show you a magnificent
garden belonging to me." So saying the doorkeeper led the way into the
Caliph''s garden, the beauties of which filled them with wonder and
amazement.  Noureddin took out two gold pieces, and giving them to
Scheih Ibrahim said,

"I beg you to get us something to eat that we may make merry together."
Being very avaricious, Scheih Ibrahim determined to spend only the
tenth part of the money and to keep the rest to himself.  While he was
gone Noureddin and the Persian wandered through the gardens and went up
the white marble staircase of the pavilion as far as the locked door of
the saloon.  On the return of Scheih Ibrahim they begged him to open
it, and to allow them to enter and admire the magnificence within.
Consenting, he brought not only the key, but a light, and immediately
unlocked the door.  Noureddin and the Persian entering, were dazzled
with the magnificence they beheld.  The paintings and furniture were of
astonishing beauty, and between each window was a silver arm holding a
candle.

Scheih Ibrahim spread the table in front of a sofa, and all three ate
together.  When they had finished eating Noureddin asked the old man to
bring them a bottle of wine.

"Heaven forbid," said Scheih Ibrahim, "that I should come in contact
with wine!  I who have four times made the pilgrimage to Mecca, and
have renounced wine for ever."

"You would, however, do us a great service in procuring us some," said
Noureddin.  "You need not touch it yourself.  Take the ass which is
tied to the gate, lead it to the nearest wine-shop, and ask some
passer-by to order two jars of wine; have them put in the ass''s
panniers, and drive him before you.  Here are two pieces of gold for
the expenses."

At sight of the gold, Scheih Ibrahim set off at once to execute the
commission.  On his return, Noureddin said:  "We have still need of
cups to drink from, and of fruit, if you can procure us some." Scheih
Ibrahim disappeared again, and soon returned with a table spread with
cups of gold and silver, and every sort of beautiful fruit.  Then he
withdrew, in spite of repeated invitations to remain.

Noureddin and the beautiful Persian, finding the wine excellent, drank
of it freely, and while drinking they sang.  Both had fine voices, and
Scheih Ibrahim listened to them with great pleasure--first from a
distance, then he drew nearer, and finally put his head in at the door.
Noureddin, seeing him, called to him to come in and keep them company.
At first the old man declined, but was persuaded to enter the room, to
sit down on the edge of the sofa nearest the door, and at last to draw
closer and to seat himself by the beautiful Persian, who urged him so
persistently to drink her health that at length he yielded, and took
the cup she offered.

Now the old man only made a pretence of renouncing wine; he frequented
wine-shops like other people, and had taken none of the precautions
Noureddin had proposed.  Having once yielded, he was easily persuaded
to take a second cup, and a third, and so on till he no longer knew
what he was doing.  Till near midnight they continued drinking,
laughing, and singing together.

About that time the Persian, perceiving that the room was lit by only
one miserable tallow candle, asked Scheih Ibrahim to light some of the
beautiful candles in the silver arms.

"Light them yourself," answered the old man; "you are younger than I,
but let five or six be enough."

She did not stop, however, till she had lit all the eighty, but Scheih
Ibrahim was not conscious of this, and when, soon after that, Noureddin
proposed to have some of the lustres lit, he answered:

The Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid, chancing at that moment to open a window
in the saloon of his palace looking on the garden, was surprised to see
the pavilion brilliantly illuminated.  Calling the grand-vizir, Giafar,
he said to him:

When the vizir saw that it was as the Caliph said, he trembled with
fear, and immediately invented an excuse.

"Commander of the Faithful," he said, "I must tell you that four or
five days ago Scheih Ibrahim told me that he wished to have an assembly
of the ministers of his mosque, and asked permission to hold it in the
pavilion.  I granted his request, but forgot since to mention it to
your Majesty."

"Giafar," replied the Caliph, "you have committed three faults--first,
in giving the permission; second, in not mentioning it to me; and
third, in not investigating the matter more closely.  For punishment I
condemn you to spend the rest of the night with me in company of these
worthy people.  While I dress myself as a citizen, go and disguise
yourself, and then come with me."

When they reached the garden gate they found it open, to the great
indignation of the Caliph.  The door of the pavilion being also open,
he went softly upstairs, and looked in at the half-closed door of the
saloon.  Great was his surprise to see Scheih Ibrahim, whose sobriety
he had never doubted, drinking and singing with a young man and a
beautiful lady.  The Caliph, before giving way to his anger, determined
to watch and see who the people were and what they did.

Presently Scheih Ibrahim asked the beautiful Persian if anything were
wanting to complete her enjoyment of the evening.

Scheih Ibrahim immediately took a lute from a cup-board and gave it to
the Persian, who began to play on it, singing the while with such skill
and taste that the Caliph was enchanted.  When she ceased he went
softly downstairs and said to the vizir:

"Never have I heard a finer voice, nor the lute better played.  I am
determined to go in and make her play to me."

"Commander of the Faithful," said the vizir, "if Scheih Ibrahim
recognises you he will die of fright."

"I should be sorry for that," answered the Caliph, "and I am going to
take steps to prevent it.  Wait here till I return."

Now the Caliph had caused a bend in the river to form a lake in his
garden.  There the finest fish in the Tigris were to be found, but
fishing was strictly forbidden.  It happened that night, however, that
a fisherman had taken advantage of the gate being open to go in and
cast his nets.  He was just about to draw them when he saw the Caliph
approaching.  Recognising him at once in spite of his disguise, he
threw himself at his feet imploring forgiveness.

The fisherman did as he was told, and produced five or six fine fish,
of which the Caliph took the two largest.  Then he desired the
fisherman to change clothes with him, and in a few minutes the Caliph
was transformed into a fisherman, even to the shoes and the turban.
Taking the two fish in his hand, he returned to the vizir, who, not
recognising him, would have sent him about his business.  Leaving the
vizir at the foot of the stairs, the Caliph went up and knocked at the
door of the saloon.  Noureddin opened it, and the Caliph, standing on
the threshold, said:

"Scheih Ibrahim, I am the fisher Kerim.  Seeing that you are feasting
with your friends, I bring you these fish."

Noureddin and the Persian said that when the fishes were properly
cooked and dressed they would gladly eat of them.  The Caliph then
returned to the vizir, and they set to work in Scheih Ibrahim''s house
to cook the fish, of which they made so tempting a dish that Noureddin
and the fair Persian ate of it with great relish.  When they had
finished Noureddin took thirty gold pieces (all that remained of what
Sangiar had given him) and presented them to the Caliph, who, thanking
him, asked as a further favour if the lady would play him one piece on
the lute.  The Persian gladly consented, and sang and played so as to
delight the Caliph.

Noureddin, in the habit of giving to others whatever they admired,
said, "Fisherman, as she pleases you so much, take her; she is yours."

The fair Persian, astounded that he should wish to part from her, took
her lute, and with tears in her eyes sang her reproaches to its music.

The Caliph (still in the character of fisherman) said to him, "Sir, I
perceive that this fair lady is your slave.  Oblige me, I beg you, by
relating your history."

Noureddin willingly granted this request, and recounted everything from
the purchase of the slave down to the present moment.

"Then, if you will listen to me," said the Caliph, "you will
immediately return to Balsora.  I will give you a letter to the king,
which will ensure you a good reception from him."

"It is an unheard-of thing," said Noureddin, "that a fisherman should
be in correspondence with a king."

"Let not that astonish you," answered the Caliph; "we studied together,
and have always remained the best of friends, though fortune, while
making him a king, left me a humble fisherman."

The Caliph then took a sheet of paper, and wrote the following letter,
at the top of which he put in very small characters this formula to
show that he must be implicitly obeyed:--"In the name of the Most
Merciful God.

"Haroun-al-Raschid, son of Mahdi, sends this letter to Mohammed Zinebi,
his cousin.  As soon as Noureddin, son of the Vizir Khacan, bearer of
this letter, has given it to thee, and thou hast read it, take off thy
royal mantle, put it on his shoulders, and seat him in thy place
without fail.  Farewell."

The Caliph then gave this letter to Noureddin, who immediately set off,
with only what little money he possessed when Sangiar came to his
assistance.  The beautiful Persian, inconsolable at his departure, sank
on a sofa bathed in tears.

When Noureddin had left the room, Scheih Ibrahim, who had hitherto kept
silence, said:  "Kerim, for two miserable fish thou hast received a
purse and a slave.  I tell thee I will take the slave, and as to the
purse, if it contains silver thou mayst keep one piece, if gold then I
will take all and give thee what copper pieces I have in my purse."

Now here it must be related that when the Caliph went upstairs with the
plate of fish he ordered the vizir to hasten to the palace and bring
back four slaves bearing a change of raiment, who should wait outside
the pavilion till the Caliph should clap his hands.

Still personating the fisherman, the Caliph answered: "Scheih Ibrahim,
whatever is in the purse I will share equally with you, but as to the
slave I will keep her for myself.  If you do not agree to these
conditions you shall have nothing."

The old man, furious at this insolence as he considered it, took a cup
and threw it at the Caliph, who easily avoided a missile from the hand
of a drunken man.  It hit against the wall, and broke into a thousand
pieces.  Scheih Ibrahim, still more enraged, then went out to fetch a
stick.  The Caliph at that moment clapped his hands, and the vizir and
the four slaves entering took off the fisherman''s dress and put on him
that which they had brought.

When Scheih Ibrahim returned, a thick stick in his hand, the Caliph was
seated on his throne, and nothing remained of the fisherman but his
clothes in the middle of the room.  Throwing himself on the ground at
the Caliph''s feet, he said:  "Commander of the Faithful, your miserable
slave has offended you, and craves forgiveness."

The Caliph came down from his throne, and said:  "Rise, I forgive
thee." Then turning to the Persian he said:  "Fair lady, now you know
who I am; learn also that I have sent Noureddin to Balsora to be king,
and as soon as all necessary preparations are made I will send you
there to be queen.  Meanwhile I will give you an apartment in my
palace, where you will be treated with all honour."

At this the beautiful Persian took courage, and the Caliph was as good
as his word, recommending her to the care of his wife Zobeida.

Noureddin made all haste on his journey to Balsora, and on his arrival
there went straight to the palace of the king, of whom he demanded an
audience.  It was immediately granted, and holding the letter high
above his head he forced his way through the crowd.  While the king
read the letter he changed colour.  He would instantly have executed
the Caliph''s order, but first he showed the letter to Saouy, whose
interests were equally at stake with his own.  Pretending that he
wished to read it a second time, Saouy turned aside as if to seek a
better light; unperceived by anyone he tore off the formula from the
top of the letter, put it to his mouth, and swallowed it.  Then,
turning to the king, he said:

"Your majesty has no need to obey this letter.  The writing is indeed
that of the Caliph, but the formula is absent.  Besides, he has not
sent an express with the patent, without which the letter is useless.
Leave all to me, and I will take the consequences."

The king not only listened to the persuasions of Saouy, but gave
Noureddin into his hands.  Such a severe bastinado was first
administered to him, that he was left more dead than alive; then Saouy
threw him into the darkest and deepest dungeon, and fed him only on
bread and water.  After ten days Saouy determined to put an end to
Noureddin''s life, but dared not without the king''s authority.  To gain
this end, he loaded several of his own slaves with rich gifts, and
presented himself at their head to the king, saying that they were from
the new king on his coronation.

"Sire," said Saouy, "I thank your Majesty for the justice you do me.  I
would further beg, as Noureddin publicly affronted me, that the
execution might be in front of the palace, and that it might be
proclaimed throughout the city, so that no one may be ignorant of it."

The king granted these requests, and the announcement caused universal
grief, for the memory of Noureddin''s father was still fresh in the
hearts of his people.  Saouy, accompanied by twenty of his own slaves,
went to the prison to fetch Noureddin, whom he mounted on a wretched
horse without a saddle.  Arrived at the palace, Saouy went in to the
king, leaving Noureddin in the square, hemmed in not only by Saouy''s
slaves but by the royal guard, who had great difficulty in preventing
the people from rushing in and rescuing Noureddin.  So great was the
indignation against Saouy that if anyone had set the example he would
have been stoned on his way through the streets.  Saouy, who witnessed
the agitation of the people from the windows of the king''s privy
chambers, called to the executioner to strike at once.  The king,
however, ordered him to delay; not only was he jealous of Saouy''s
interference, but he had another reason.  A troop of horsemen was seen
at that moment riding at full gallop towards the square.  Saouy
suspected who they might be, and urged the king to give the signal for
the execution without delay, but this the king refused to do till he
knew who the horsemen were.

Now, they were the vizir Giafar and his suite arriving at full speed
from Bagdad.  For several days after Noureddin''s departure with the
letter the Caliph had forgotten to send the express with the patent,
without which the letter was useless.  Hearing a beautiful voice one
day in the women''s part of the palace uttering lamentations, he was
informed that it was the voice of the fair Persian, and suddenly
calling to mind the patent, he sent for Giafar, and ordered him to make
for Balsora with the utmost speed--if Noureddin were dead, to hang
Saouy; if he were still alive, to bring him at once to Bagdad along
with the king and Saouy.

Giafar rode at full speed through the square, and alighted at the steps
of the palace, where the king came to greet him.  The vizir''s first
question was whether Noureddin were still alive.  The king replied that
he was, and he was immediately led forth, though bound hand and foot.
By the vizir''s orders his bonds were immediately undone, and Saouy was
tied with the same cords.  Next day Giafar returned to Bagdad, bearing
with him the king, Saouy, and Noureddin.

When the Caliph heard what treatment Noureddin had received, he
authorised him to behead Saouy with his own hands, but he declined to
shed the blood of his enemy, who was forthwith handed over to the
executioner.  The Caliph also desired Noureddin to reign over Balsora,
but this, too, he declined, saying that after what had passed there he
preferred never to return, but to enter the service of the Caliph.  He
became one of his most intimate courtiers, and lived long in great
happiness with the fair Persian.  As to the king, the Caliph contented
himself with sending him back to Balsora, with the recommendation to be
more careful in future in the choice of his vizir.

There once lived a poor tailor, who had a son called Aladdin, a
careless, idle boy who would do nothing but play all day long in the
streets with little idle boys like himself.  This so grieved the father
that he died; yet, in spite of his mother''s tears and prayers, Aladdin
did not mend his ways.  One day, when he was playing in the streets as
usual, a stranger asked him his age, and if he were not the son of
Mustapha the tailor.

On this the stranger, who was a famous African magician, fell on his
neck and kissed him, saying:  "I am your uncle, and knew you from your
likeness to my brother.  Go to your mother and tell her I am coming."

However, she prepared supper, and bade Aladdin seek his uncle, who came
laden with wine and fruit.  He presently fell down and kissed the place
where Mustapha used to sit, bidding Aladdin''s mother not to be
surprised at not having seen him before, as he had been forty years out
of the country.  He then turned to Aladdin, and asked him his trade, at
which the boy hung his head, while his mother burst into tears.  On
learning that Aladdin was idle and would learn no trade, he offered to
take a shop for him and stock it with merchandise.  Next day he bought
Aladdin a fine suit of clothes, and took him all over the city, showing
him the sights, and brought him home at nightfall to his mother, who
was overjoyed to see her son so fine.

Next day the magician led Aladdin into some beautiful gardens a long
way outside the city gates.  They sat down by a fountain, and the
magician pulled a cake from his girdle, which he divided between them.
They then journeyed onwards till they almost reached the mountains.
Aladdin was so tired that he begged to go back, but the magician
beguiled him with pleasant stories, and led him on in spite of himself.

"We will go no farther," said the false uncle.  "I will show you
something wonderful; only do you gather up sticks while I kindle a
fire."

When it was lit the magician threw on it a powder he had about him, at
the same time saying some magical words.  The earth trembled a little
and opened in front of them, disclosing a square flat stone with a
brass ring in the middle to raise it by.  Aladdin tried to run away,
but the magician caught him and gave him a blow that knocked him down.

"What have I done, uncle?" he said piteously; whereupon the magician
said more kindly:  "Fear nothing, but obey me.  Beneath this stone lies
a treasure which is to be yours, and no one else may touch it, so you
must do exactly as I tell you."

At the word treasure, Aladdin forgot his fears, and grasped the ring as
he was told, saying the names of his father and grandfather.  The stone
came up quite easily and some steps appeared.

"Go down," said the magician; "at the foot of those steps you will find
an open door leading into three large halls.  Tuck up your gown and go
through them without touching anything, or you will die instantly.
These halls lead into a garden of fine fruit trees.  Walk on till you
come to a niche in a terrace where stands a lighted lamp.  Pour out the
oil it contains and bring it to me."

Aladdin found everything as the magician had said, gathered some fruit
off the trees, and, having got the lamp, arrived at the mouth of the
cave.  The magician cried out in a great hurry:

"Make haste and give me the lamp."  This Aladdin refused to do until he
was out of the cave.  The magician flew into a terrible passion, and
throwing some more powder on the fire, he said something, and the stone
rolled back into its place.

The magician left Persia for ever, which plainly showed that he was no
uncle of Aladdin''s, but a cunning magician who had read in his magic
books of a wonderful lamp, which would make him the most powerful man
in the world.  Though he alone knew where to find it, he could only
receive it from the hand of another.  He had picked out the foolish
Aladdin for this purpose, intending to get the lamp and kill him
afterwards.

For two days Aladdin remained in the dark, crying and lamenting.  At
last he clasped his hands in prayer, and in so doing rubbed the ring,
which the magician had forgotten to take from him.  Immediately an
enormous and frightful genie rose out of the earth, saying:

Aladdin fearlessly replied:  "Deliver me from this place!" whereupon
the earth opened, and he found himself outside.  As soon as his eyes
could bear the light he went home, but fainted on the threshold.  When
he came to himself he told his mother what had passed, and showed her
the lamp and the fruits he had gathered in the garden, which were in
reality precious stones.  He then asked for some food.

"Alas! child," she said, "I have nothing in the house, but I have spun
a little cotton and will go and sell it."

Aladdin bade her keep her cotton, for he would sell the lamp instead.
As it was very dirty she began to rub it, that it might fetch a higher
price.  Instantly a hideous genie appeared, and asked what she would
have.  She fainted away, but Aladdin, snatching the lamp, said boldly:

The genie returned with a silver bowl, twelve silver plates containing
rich meats, two silver cups, and two bottles of wine.  Aladdin''s
mother, when she came to herself, said:

So they sat at breakfast till it was dinner-time, and Aladdin told his
mother about the lamp.  She begged him to sell it, and have nothing to
do with devils.

"No," said Aladdin, "since chance has made us aware of its virtues, we
will use it and the ring likewise, which I shall always wear on my
finger."  When they had eaten all the genie had brought, Aladdin sold
one of the silver plates, and so on till none were left.  He then had
recourse to the genie, who gave him another set of plates, and thus
they lived for many years.

One day Aladdin heard an order from the Sultan proclaimed that everyone
was to stay at home and close his shutters while the princess, his
daughter, went to and from the bath.  Aladdin was seized by a desire to
see her face, which was very difficult, as she always went veiled.  He
hid himself behind the door of the bath, and peeped through a chink.
The princess lifted her veil as she went in, and looked so beautiful
that Aladdin fell in love with her at first sight.  He went home so
changed that his mother was frightened.  He told her he loved the
princess so deeply that he could not live without her, and meant to ask
her in marriage of her father.  His mother, on hearing this, burst out
laughing, but Aladdin at last prevailed upon her to go before the
Sultan and carry his request.  She fetched a napkin and laid in it the
magic fruits from the enchanted garden, which sparkled and shone like
the most beautiful jewels.  She took these with her to please the
Sultan, and set out, trusting in the lamp.  The grand-vizir and the
lords of council had just gone in as she entered the hall and placed
herself in front of the Sultan.  He, however, took no notice of her.
She went every day for a week, and stood in the same place.

When the council broke up on the sixth day the Sultan said to his
vizir:  "I see a certain woman in the audience-chamber every day
carrying something in a napkin.  Call her next time, that I may find
out what she wants."

Next day, at a sign from the vizir, she went up to the foot of the
throne, and remained kneeling till the Sultan said to her: "Rise, good
woman, and tell me what you want."

She hesitated, so the Sultan sent away all but the vizir, and bade her
speak freely, promising to forgive her beforehand for anything she
might say.  She then told him of her son''s violent love for the
princess.

"I prayed him to forget her," she said, "but in vain; he threatened to
do some desperate deed if I refused to go and ask your Majesty for the
hand of the princess.  Now I pray you to forgive not me alone, but my
son Aladdin."

The Sultan asked her kindly what she had in the napkin, whereupon she
unfolded the jewels and presented them.

He was thunderstruck, and turning to the vizir said:  "What sayest
thou?  Ought I not to bestow the princess on one who values her at such
a price?"

The vizir, who wanted her for his own son, begged the Sultan to
withhold her for three months, in the course of which he hoped his son
would contrive to make him a richer present.  The Sultan granted this,
and told Aladdin''s mother that, though he consented to the marriage,
she must not appear before him again for three months.

Aladdin waited patiently for nearly three months, but after two had
elapsed his mother, going into the city to buy oil, found everyone
