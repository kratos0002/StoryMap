UPDATE stories SET original_text = original_text || ' I perceived the great viaduct of Point du Jour which
      blocked the river. It was the end of Paris, the beginning of the country,
      and behind the double row of arches the Seine, suddenly spreading out as
      though it had regained space and liberty, became all at once the peaceful
      river which flows through the plains, alongside the wooded hills, amid the
      meadows, along the edge of the forests.

After passing between two islands the Swallow went round a curved verdant
      slope dotted with white houses. A voice called out: “Bas Meudon”
      and a little further on, “Sevres,” and still further, “Saint-Cloud.”

I had brought with me a map of the environs of Paris, so that I might not
      lose my way amid the paths which cross in every direction these little
      forests where Parisians take their outings.

As soon as I was unperceived I began to study my guide, which seemed to be
      perfectly clear. I was to turn to the right, then to the left, then again
      to the left and I should reach Versailles by evening in time for dinner.

I walked slowly beneath the young leaves, drinking in the air, fragrant
      with the odor of young buds and sap. I sauntered along, forgetful of musty
      papers, of the offices, of my chief, my colleagues, my documents, and
      thinking of the good things that were sure to come to me, of all the
      veiled unknown contained in the future. A thousand recollections of
      childhood came over me, awakened by these country odors, and I walked
      along, permeated with the fragrant, living enchantment, the emotional
      enchantment of the woods warmed by the sun of June.

At times I sat down to look at all sorts of little flowers growing on a
      bank, with the names of which I was familiar. I recognized them all just
      as if they were the ones I had seen long ago in the country. They were
      yellow, red, violet, delicate, dainty, perched on long stems or close to
      the ground. Insects of all colors and shapes, short, long, of peculiar
      form, frightful, and microscopic monsters, climbed quietly up the stalks
      of grass which bent beneath their weight.

In front of me lay an enchanting pathway and through its somewhat scanty
      foliage the sun poured down drops of light on the marguerites which grew
      there. It stretched out interminably, quiet and deserted, save for an
      occasional big wasp, who would stop buzzing now and then to sip from a
      flower, and then continue his way.

All at once I perceived at the end of the path two persons, a man and a
      woman, coming towards me. Annoyed at being disturbed in my quiet walk, I
      was about to dive into the thicket, when I thought I heard someone calling
      me. The woman was, in fact, shaking her parasol, and the man, in his shirt
      sleeves, his coat over one arm, was waving the other as a signal of
      distress.

I went towards them. They were walking hurriedly, their faces very red,
      she with short, quick steps and he with long strides. They both looked
      annoyed and fatigued.

“Can you tell me, monsieur, where we are? My fool of a husband made
      us lose our way, although he pretended he knew the country perfectly.”

“Mon Dieu, mon Dieu, mon Dieu!” she repeated, shrugging her
      shoulders, and in that tone of sovereign contempt assumed by women to
      express their exasperation.

As for him, he was perspiring and wiping his forehead. It was assuredly a
      little Parisian bourgeois couple. The man seemed cast down, exhausted and
      distressed.

“It was I! Ah, it is my fault now! Was it I who wanted to go out
      without getting any information, pretending that I knew how to find my
      way? Was it I who wanted to take the road to the right on top of the hill,
      insisting that I recognized the road? Was it I who undertook to take
      charge of Cachou—”

She had not finished speaking when her husband, as if he had suddenly gone
      crazy, gave a piercing scream, a long, wild cry that could not be
      described in any language, but which sounded like ''tuituit''.

“No, really, some people are so stupid and they pretend they know
      everything. Was it I who took the train to Dieppe last year instead of the
      train to Havre—tell me, was it I? Was it I who bet that M.
      Letourneur lived in Rue des Martyres? Was it I who would not believe that
      Celeste was a thief?”

She went on, furious, with a surprising flow of language, accumulating the
      most varied, the most unexpected and the most overwhelming accusations
      drawn from the intimate relations of their daily life, reproaching her
      husband for all his actions, all his ideas, all his habits, all his
      enterprises, all his efforts, for his life from the time of their marriage
      up to the present time.

“But, my dear, it is useless—before monsieur. We are making
      ourselves ridiculous. This does not interest monsieur.”

And he cast mournful glances into the thicket as though he sought to sound
      its peaceful and mysterious depths, in order to flee thither, to escape
      and hide from all eyes, and from time to time he uttered a fresh scream, a
      prolonged and shrill “tuituit.” I took this to be a nervous
      affection.

The young woman, suddenly turning towards me: and changing her tone with
      singular rapidity, said:

“If monsieur will kindly allow us, we will accompany him on the
      road, so as not to lose our way again, and be obliged, possibly, to sleep
      in the wood.”

I bowed. She took my arm and began to talk about a thousand things —about
      herself, her life, her family, her business. They were glovers in the Rue
      Saint-Lazare.

Her husband walked beside her, casting wild glances into the thick wood
      and screaming “tuituit” every few moments.

“Yes. He was just a year old. He had never been outside the shop. I
      wanted to take him to have a run in the woods. He had never seen the grass
      nor the leaves and he was almost wild. He began to run about and bark and
      he disappeared in the wood. I must also add that he was greatly afraid of
      the train. That may have driven him mad. I kept on calling him, but he has
      not come back. He will die of hunger in there.”

“If you had left his chain on, it would not have happened. When
      people are as stupid as you are they do not keep a dog.”

She stopped short, and looking into his eyes as if she were going to tear
      them out, she began again to cast in his face innumerable reproaches.

It was growing dark. The cloud of vapor that covers the country at dusk
      was slowly rising and there was a poetry in the air, induced by the
      peculiar and enchanting freshness of the atmosphere that one feels in the
      woods at nightfall.

“That was all that was lacking. How stupid you are! how stupid you
      are! Is it possible that I could have married such an idiot! Well, go and
      look for it, and see that you find it. I am going on to Versailles with
      monsieur. I do not want to sleep in the wood.”

He turned back and, stooping down as he searched the ground with anxious
      eyes, he moved away, screaming “tuituit” every few moments.

We could see him for some time until the growing darkness concealed all
      but his outline, but we heard his mournful “tuituit,” shriller
      and shriller as the night grew darker.

As for me, I stepped along quickly and happily in the soft twilight, with
      this little unknown woman leaning on my arm. I tried to say pretty things
      to her, but could think of nothing. I remained silent, disturbed,
      enchanted.

Our path was suddenly crossed by a high road. To the right I perceived a
      town lying in a valley.

“No, indeed. This is very funny and I am very hungry. I am really
      quite calm. My husband will find his way all right. It is a treat to me to
      be rid of him for a few hours.”

We went into a restaurant beside the water and I ventured to ask for a
      private compartment. We had some supper. She sang, drank champagne,
      committed all sorts of follies.

Eight hours of railway travel induce sleep for some persons and insomnia
      for others; with me, any journey prevents my sleeping on the following
      night.

At about five o''clock I arrived at the estate of Abelle, which belongs to
      my friends, the Murets d''Artus, to spend three weeks there. It is a pretty
      house, built by one of their grandfathers in the style of the latter half
      of the last century. Therefore it has that intimate character of dwellings
      that have always been inhabited, furnished and enlivened by the same
      people. Nothing changes; nothing alters the soul of the dwelling, from
      which the furniture has never been taken out, the tapestries never
      unnailed, thus becoming worn out, faded, discolored, on the same walls.
      None of the old furniture leaves the place; only from time to time it is
      moved a little to make room for a new piece, which enters there like a
      new-born infant in the midst of brothers and sisters.

The house is on a hill in the center of a park which slopes down to the
      river, where there is a little stone bridge. Beyond the water the fields
      stretch out in the distance, and here one can see the cows wandering
      around, pasturing on the moist grass; their eyes seem full of the dew,
      mist and freshness of the pasture. I love this dwelling, just as one loves
      a thing which one ardently desires to possess. I return here every autumn
      with infinite delight; I leave with regret.

After I had dined with this friendly family, by whom I was received like a
      relative, I asked my friend, Paul Muret: “Which room did you give me
      this year?”

An hour later, followed by her three children, two little girls and a boy,
      Madame Muret d''Artus installed me in Aunt Rose''s room, where I had not yet
      slept.

When I was alone I examined the walls, the furniture, the general aspect
      of the room, in order to attune my mind to it. I knew it but little, as I
      had entered it only once or twice, and I looked indifferently at a pastel
      portrait of Aunt Rose, who gave her name to the room.

This old Aunt Rose, with her curls, looking at me from behind the glass,
      made very little impression on my mind. She looked to me like a woman of
      former days, with principles and precepts as strong on the maxims of
      morality as on cooking recipes, one of these old aunts who are the bugbear
      of gaiety and the stern and wrinkled angel of provincial families.

I never had heard her spoken of; I knew nothing of her life or of her
      death. Did she belong to this century or to the preceding one? Had she
      left this earth after a calm or a stormy existence? Had she given up to
      heaven the pure soul of an old maid, the calm soul of a spouse, the tender
      one of a mother, or one moved by love? What difference did it make? The
      name alone, “Aunt Rose,” seemed ridiculous, common, ugly.

I picked up a candle and looked at her severe face, hanging far up in an
      old gilt frame. Then, as I found it insignificant, disagreeable, even
      unsympathetic, I began to examine the furniture. It dated from the period
      of Louis XVI, the Revolution and the Directorate. Not a chair, not a
      curtain had entered this room since then, and it gave out the subtle odor
      of memories, which is the combined odor of wood, cloth, chairs, hangings,
      peculiar to places wherein have lived hearts that have loved and suffered.

I retired but did not sleep. After I had tossed about for an hour or two,
      I decided to get up and write some letters.

I opened a little mahogany desk with brass trimmings, which was placed
      between the two windows, in hope of finding some ink and paper; but all I
      found was a quill-pen, very much worn, and chewed at the end. I was about
      to close this piece of furniture, when a shining spot attracted my
      attention it looked like the yellow head of a nail. I scratched it with my
      finger, and it seemed to move. I seized it between two finger-nails, and
      pulled as hard as I could. It came toward me gently. It was a long gold
      pin which had been slipped into a hole in the wood and remained hidden
      there.

Why? I immediately thought that it must have served to work some spring
      which hid a secret, and I looked. It took a long time. After about two
      hours of investigation, I discovered another hole opposite the first one,
      but at the bottom of a groove. Into this I stuck my pin: a little shelf
      sprang toward my face, and I saw two packages of yellow letters, tied with
      a blue ribbon.

I raised my eyes to the portrait of Aunt Rose, and as I looked at her
      severe, wrinkled face, I thought of all those women''s souls which we do
      not know, and which we suppose to be so different from what they really
      are, whose inborn and ingenuous craftiness we never can penetrate, their
      quiet duplicity; and a verse of De Vigny returned to my memory:

The old-fashioned chateau was built on a wooded knoll in the midst of tall
      trees with dark-green foliage; the park extended to a great distance, in
      one direction to the edge of the forest, in another to the distant
      country. A few yards from the front of the house was a huge stone basin
      with marble ladies taking a bath; other, basins were seen at intervals
      down to the foot of the slope, and a stream of water fell in cascades from
      one basin to another.

From the manor house, which preserved the grace of a superannuated
      coquette, down to the grottos incrusted with shell-work, where slumbered
      the loves of a bygone age, everything in this antique demesne had retained
      the physiognomy of former days. Everything seemed to speak still of
      ancient customs, of the manners of long ago, of former gallantries, and of
      the elegant trivialities so dear to our grandmothers.

In a parlor in the style of Louis XV, whose walls were covered with
      shepherds paying court to shepherdesses, beautiful ladies in hoop-skirts,
      and gallant gentlemen in wigs, a very old woman, who seemed dead as soon
      as she ceased to move, was almost lying down in a large easy-chair, at
      each side of which hung a thin, mummy-like hand.

Her dim eyes were gazing dreamily toward the distant horizon as if they
      sought to follow through the park the visions of her youth. Through the
      open window every now and then came a breath of air laden with the odor of
      grass and the perfume of flowers. It made her white locks flutter around
      her wrinkled forehead and old memories float through her brain.

Beside her, on a tapestried stool, a young girl, with long fair hair
      hanging in braids down her back, was embroidering an altar-cloth. There
      was a pensive expression in her eyes, and it was easy to see that she was
      dreaming, while her agile fingers flew over her work.

“Berthe, read me something out of the newspapers, that I may still
      know sometimes what is going on in the world.”

“Yes, yes, darling. Are there no love stories? Is gallantry, then,
      dead in France, that they no longer talk about abductions or adventures as
      they did formerly?”

And Berthe commenced. It was a case of vitriol throwing. A wife, in order
      to avenge herself on her husband''s mistress, had burned her face and eyes.
      She had left the Court of Assizes acquitted, declared to be innocent, amid
      the applause of the crowd.

“''Gloomy Drama. A shop girl, no longer young, allowed herself to be
      led astray by a young man. Then, to avenge herself on her lover, whose
      heart proved fickle, she shot him with a revolver. The unhappy man is
      maimed for life. The jury, all men of moral character, condoning the
      illicit love of the murderess, honorably acquitted her.''”

“Why, you people are mad nowadays. You are mad! The good God has
      given you love, the only enchantment in life. Man has added to this
      gallantry the only distraction of our dull hours, and here you are mixing
      up with it vitriol and revolvers, as if one were to put mud into a flagon
      of Spanish wine.”

“But, grandmamma, this woman avenged herself. Remember she was
      married, and her husband deceived her.”

The grandmother''s heart, which had its birth in the great age of
      gallantry, gave a sudden leap.

“It is love that is sacred,” she said. “Listen, child,
      to an old woman who has seen three generations, and who has had a long,
      long experience of men and women. Marriage and love have nothing in
      common. We marry to found a family, and we form families in order to
      constitute society. Society cannot dispense with marriage. If society is a
      chain, each family is a link in that chain. In order to weld those links,
      we always seek metals of the same order. When we marry, we must bring
      together suitable conditions; we must combine fortunes, unite similar
      races and aim at the common interest, which is riches and children. We
      marry only once my child, because the world requires us to do so, but we
      may love twenty times in one lifetime because nature has made us like
      this. Marriage, you see, is law, and love is an instinct which impels us,
      sometimes along a straight, and sometimes along a devious path. The world
      has made laws to combat our instincts—it was necessary to make them;
      but our instincts are always stronger, and we ought not to resist them too
      much, because they come from God; while the laws only come from men. If we
      did not perfume life with love, as much love as possible, darling, as we
      put sugar into drugs for children, nobody would care to take it just as it
      is.”

The grandmother raised her trembling hands toward Heaven, as if again to
      invoke the defunct god of gallantries. She exclaimed indignantly:

“You have become a race of serfs, a race of common people. Since the
      Revolution, it is impossible any longer to recognize society. You have
      attached big words to every action, and wearisome duties to every corner
      of existence; you believe in equality and eternal passion. People have
      written poetry telling you that people have died of love. In my time
      poetry was written to teach men to love every woman. And we! when we liked
      a gentleman, my child, we sent him a page. And when a fresh caprice came
      into our hearts, we were not slow in getting rid of the last Lover—unless
      we kept both of them.”

The old woman smiled a keen smile, and a gleam of roguery twinkled in her
      gray eye, the intellectual, skeptical roguery of those people who did not
      believe that they were made of the same clay as the rest, and who lived as
      masters for whom common beliefs were not intended.

The grandmother ceased to smile. If she had kept in her soul some of
      Voltaire''s irony, she had also a little of Jean Jacques''s glowing
      philosophy: “No honor! because we loved, and dared to say so, and
      even boasted of it? But, my child, if one of us, among the greatest ladies
      in France, had lived without a lover, she would have had the entire court
      laughing at her. Those who wished to live differently had only to enter a
      convent. And you imagine, perhaps, that your husbands will love but you
      alone, all their lives. As if, indeed, this could be the case. I tell you
      that marriage is a thing necessary in order that society should exist, but
      it is not in the nature of our race, do you understand? There is only one
      good thing in life, and that is love. And how you misunderstand it! how
      you spoil it! You treat it as something solemn like a sacrament, or
      something to be bought, like a dress.”

And, on her knees, with tears in her eyes, she prayed to Heaven to bestow
      on her a great passion, one sole, eternal passion in accordance with the
      dream of modern poets, while the grandmother, kissing her on the forehead,
      quite imbued still with that charming, healthy reason with which gallant
      philosophers tinctured the thought of the eighteenth century, murmured:

They had been great friends all winter in Paris. As is always the case,
      they had lost sight of each other after leaving school, and had met again
      when they were old and gray-haired. One of them had married, but the other
      had remained in single blessedness.

M. de Meroul lived for six months in Paris and for six months in his
      little chateau at Tourbeville. Having married the daughter of a
      neighboring squire, he had lived a good and peaceful life in the
      indolence of a man who has nothing to do. Of a calm and quiet disposition,
      and not over-intelligent he used to spend his time quietly regretting the
      past, grieving over the customs and institutions of the day and
      continually repeating to his wife, who would lift her eyes, and sometimes
      her hands, to heaven, as a sign of energetic assent: “Good gracious!
      What a government!”

Madame de Meroul resembled her husband intellectually as though she had
      been his sister. She knew, by tradition, that one should above all respect
      the Pope and the King!

And she loved and respected them from the bottom of her heart, without
      knowing them, with a poetic fervor, with an hereditary devotion, with the
      tenderness of a wellborn woman. She was good to, the marrow of her bones.
      She had had no children, and never ceased mourning the fact.

On meeting his old friend, Joseph Mouradour, at a ball, M. de Meroul was
      filled with a deep and simple joy, for in their youth they had been
      intimate friends.

After the first exclamations of surprise at the changes which time had
      wrought in their bodies and countenances, they told each other about their
      lives since they had last met.

Joseph Mouradour, who was from the south of France, had become a
      government official. His manner was frank; he spoke rapidly and without
      restraint, giving his opinions without any tact. He was a Republican, one
      of those good fellows who do not believe in standing on ceremony, and who
      exercise an almost brutal freedom of speech.

He came to his friend''s house and was immediately liked for his easy
      cordiality, in spite of his radical ideas. Madame de Meroul would exclaim:

Monsieur de Meroul would say to his friend in a serious and confidential
      tone of voice; “You have no idea the harm that you are doing your
      country.” He loved him all the same, for nothing is stronger than
      the ties of childhood taken up again at a riper age. Joseph Mouradour
      bantered the wife and the husband, calling them “my amiable snails,”
      and sometimes he would solemnly declaim against people who were behind the
      times, against old prejudices and traditions.

When he was once started on his democratic eloquence, the couple, somewhat
      ill at ease, would keep silent from politeness and good-breeding; then the
      husband would try to turn the conversation into some other channel in
      order to avoid a clash. Joseph Mouradour was only seen in the intimacy of
      the family.

Summer came. The Merouls had no greater pleasure than to receive their
      friends at their country home at Tourbeville. It was a good, healthy
      pleasure, the enjoyments of good people and of country proprietors. They
      would meet their friends at the neighboring railroad station and would
      bring them back in their carriage, always on the lookout for compliments
      on the country, on its natural features, on the condition of the roads, on
      the cleanliness of the farm-houses, on the size of the cattle grazing in
      the fields, on everything within sight.

They would call attention to the remarkable speed with which their horse
      trotted, surprising for an animal that did heavy work part of the year
      behind a plow; and they would anxiously await the opinion of the newcomer
      on their family domain, sensitive to the least word, and thankful for the
      slightest good intention.

Husband and wife had come to the train, delighted to welcome him to their
      home. As soon as he saw them, Joseph Mouradour jumped from the train with
      a briskness which increased their satisfaction. He shook their hands,
      congratulated them, overwhelmed them with compliments.

All the way home he was charming, remarking on the height of the trees,
      the goodness of the crops and the speed of the horse.

When he stepped on the porch of the house, Monsieur de Meroul said, with a
      certain friendly solemnity:

“Thanks, my friend; I expected as much. Anyhow, I never stand on
      ceremony with my friends. That''s how I understand hospitality.”

Then he went upstairs to dress as a farmer, he said, and he came back all
      togged out in blue linen, with a little straw hat and yellow shoes, a
      regular Parisian dressed for an outing. He also seemed to become more
      vulgar, more jovial, more familiar; having put on with his country clothes
      a free and easy manner which he judged suitable to the surroundings. His
      new manners shocked Monsieur and Madame de Meroul a little, for they
      always remained serious and dignified, even in the country, as though
      compelled by the two letters preceding their name to keep up a certain
      formality even in the closest intimacy.

After lunch they all went out to visit the farms, and the Parisian
      astounded the respectful peasants by his tone of comradeship.

In the evening the priest came to dinner, an old, fat priest, accustomed
      to dining there on Sundays, but who had been especially invited this day
      in honor of the new guest.

Joseph, on seeing him, made a wry face. Then he observed him with
      surprise, as though he were a creature of some peculiar race, which he had
      never been able to observe at close quarters. During the meal he told some
      rather free stories, allowable in the intimacy of the family, but which
      seemed to the Merouls a little out of place in the presence of a minister
      of the Church. He did not say, “Monsieur l''abbe,” but simply,
      “Monsieur.” He embarrassed the priest greatly by philosophical
      discussions about diverse superstitions current all over the world. He
      said: “Your God, monsieur, is of those who should be respected, but
      also one of those who should be discussed. Mine is called Reason; he has
      always been the enemy of yours.”

The Merouls, distressed, tried to turn the trend of the conversation. The
      priest left very early.

“Well, that''s pretty good! As if I would be on my guard with a
      shaveling! And say, do me the pleasure of not imposing him on me any more
      at meals. You can both make use of him as much as you wish, but don''t
      serve him up to your friends, hang it!”

“Yes, I know; they have to be treated like ''rosieres.'' But let them
      respect my convictions, and I will respect theirs!”

As soon as Madame de Meroul entered the parlor, the next morning, she
      noticed in the middle of the table three newspapers which made her start
      the Voltaire, the Republique-Francaise and the Justice. Immediately Joseph
      Mouradour, still in blue, appeared on the threshold, attentively reading
      the Intransigeant. He cried:

He read it aloud, emphasizing the parts which especially pleased him, so
      carried away by enthusiasm that he did not notice his friend''s entrance.
      Monsieur de Meroul was holding in his hand the Gaulois for himself, the
      Clarion for his wife.

The fiery prose of the master writer who overthrew the empire, spouted
      with violence, sung in the southern accent, rang throughout the peaceful
      parsons seemed to spatter the walls and century-old furniture with a hail
      of bold, ironical and destructive words.

The man and the woman, one standing, the other sitting, were listening
      with astonishment, so shocked that they could not move.

Then, suddenly, he noticed the two sheets which his friend was carrying,
      and he, in turn, stood speechless from surprise. Quickly walking toward
      him he demanded angrily:

“Your papers! What are you doing—making fun of me? You will do
      me the pleasure of reading mine; they will limber up your ideas, and as
      for yours—there! that''s what I do with them.”

And before his astonished host could stop him, he had seized the two
      newspapers and thrown them out of the window. Then he solemnly handed the
      Justice to Madame de Meroul, the Voltaire to her husband, while he sank
      down into an arm-chair to finish reading the Intransigeant.

The couple, through delicacy, made a pretense of reading a little, they
      then handed him back the Republican sheets, which they handled gingerly,
      as though they might be poisoned.

In truth, at the end of a week he ruled the house. He had closed the door
      against the priest, whom Madame de Meroul had to visit secretly; he had
      forbidden the Gaulois and the Clarion to be brought into the house, so
      that a servant had to go mysteriously to the post-office to get them, and
      as soon as he entered they would be hidden under sofa cushions; he
      arranged everything to suit himself—always charming, always
      good-natured, a jovial and all-powerful tyrant.

Other friends were expected, pious and conservative friends. The unhappy
      couple saw the impossibility of having them there then, and, not knowing
      what to do, one evening they announced to Joseph Mouradour that they would
      be obliged to absent themselves for a few days, on business, and they
      begged him to stay on alone. He did not appear disturbed, and answered:

“Very well, I don''t mind! I will wait here as long as you wish. I
      have already said that there should be no formality between friends. You
      are perfectly right-go ahead and attend to your business. It will not
      offend me in the least; quite the contrary, it will make me feel much more
      completely one of the family. Go ahead, my friends, I will wait for you!”

How often we hear people say, “He is charming, that man, but he is a
      girl, a regular girl.” They are alluding to the effeminates, the
      bane of our land.

For we are all girl-like men in France—that is, fickle, fanciful,
      innocently treacherous, without consistency in our convictions or our
      will, violent and weak as women are.

But the most irritating of girl—men is assuredly the Parisian and
      the boulevardier, in whom the appearance of intelligence is more marked
      and who combines in himself all the attractions and all the faults of
      those charming creatures in an exaggerated degree in virtue of his
      masculine temperament.

Our Chamber of Deputies is full of girl-men. They form the greater number
      of the amiable opportunists whom one might call “The Charmers.”
      These are they who control by soft words and deceitful promises, who know
      how to shake hands in such a manner as to win hearts, how to say “My
      dear friend” in a certain tactful way to people he knows the least,
      to change his mind without suspecting it, to be carried away by each new
      idea, to be sincere in their weathercock convictions, to let themselves be
      deceived as they deceive others, to forget the next morning what he
      affirmed the day before.

The newspapers are full of these effeminate men. That is probably where
      one finds the most, but it is also where they are most needed. The Journal
      des Debats and the Gazette de France are exceptions.

Assuredly, every good journalist must be somewhat effeminate—that
      is, at the command of the public, supple in following unconsciously the
      shades of public opinion, wavering and varying, sceptical and credulous,
      wicked and devout, a braggart and a true man, enthusiastic and ironical,
      and always convinced while believing in nothing.

Foreigners, our anti-types, as Mme. Abel called them, the stubborn English
      and the heavy Germans, regard us with a certain amazement mingled with
      contempt, and will continue to so regard us till the end of time. They
      consider us frivolous. It is not that, it is that we are girls. And that
      is why people love us in spite of our faults, why they come back to us
      despite the evil spoken of us; these are lovers'' quarrels! The effeminate
      man, as one meets him in this world, is so charming that he captivates you
      after five minutes'' chat. His smile seems made for you; one cannot believe
      that his voice does not assume specially tender intonations on their
      account. When he leaves you it seems as if one had known him for twenty
      years. One is quite ready to lend him money if he asks for it. He has
      enchanted you, like a woman.

If he commits any breach of manners towards you, you cannot bear any
      malice, he is so pleasant when you next meet him. If he asks your pardon
      you long to ask pardon of him. Does he tell lies? You cannot believe it.
      Does he put you off indefinitely with promises that he does not keep? One
      lays as much store by his promises as though he had moved heaven and earth
      to render them a service.

When he admires anything he goes into such raptures that he convinces you.
      He once adored Victor Hugo, whom he now treats as a back number. He would
      have fought for Zola, whom he has abandoned for Barbey and d''Aurevilly.
      And when he admires, he permits no limitation, he would slap your face for
      a word. But when he becomes scornful, his contempt is unbounded and allows
      of no protest.

“Then you are angry with Julia?” “I slapped her face.”
      “What had she done?” “She told Pauline that I had no
      money thirteen months out of twelve, and Pauline told Gontran—you
      understand.” “You were living together in the Rue Clanzel?”
      “We lived together four years in the Rue Breda; we quarrelled about
      a pair of stockings that she said I had worn —it wasn''t true—silk
      stockings that she had bought at Mother Martin''s. Then I gave her a
      pounding and she left me at once. I met her six months ago and she asked
      me to come and live with her, as she has rented a flat that is twice too
      large.”

One goes on one''s way and hears no more. But on the following Sunday as
      one is on the way to Saint Germain two young women get into the same
      railway carriage. One recognizes one of them at once; it is Julia''s enemy.
      The other is Julia!

The girl-man has his friendships of this kind. For three months he cannot
      bear to leave his old Jack, his dear Jack. There is no one but Jack in the
      world. He is the only one who has any intelligence, any sense, any talent.
      He alone amounts to anything in Paris. One meets them everywhere together,
      they dine together, walk about in company, and every evening walk home
      with each other back and forth without being able to part with one
      another.

“There is a drinker, a sorry fellow, a scoundrel for you. I know him
      well, you may be sure. And he is not even honest, and ill-bred,”
      etc., etc.

But one morning one hears that they have fought a duel, then embraced each
      other, amid tears, on the duelling ground.

Just now they are the dearest friends in the world, furious with each
      other half the year, abusing and loving each other by turns, squeezing
      each other''s hands till they almost crush the bones, and ready to run each
      other through the body for a misunderstanding.

For the relations of these effeminate men are uncertain. Their temper is
      by fits and starts, their delight unexpected, their affection
      turn-about-face, their enthusiasm subject to eclipse. One day they love
      you, the next day they will hardly look at you, for they have in fact a
      girl''s nature, a girl''s charm, a girl''s temperament, and all their
      sentiments are like the affections of girls.

It is the dear little Toutou whom they hug, feed with sugar, allow to
      sleep on the pillow, but whom they would be just as likely to throw out of
      a window in a moment of impatience, whom they turn round like a sling,
      holding it by the tail, squeeze in their arms till they almost strangle
      it, and plunge, without any reason, in a pail of cold water.

Then, what a strange thing it is when one of these beings falls in love
      with a real girl! He beats her, she scratches him, they execrate each
      other, cannot bear the sight of each other and yet cannot part, linked
      together by no one knows what mysterious psychic bonds. She deceives him,
      he knows it, sobs and forgives her. He despises and adores her without
      seeing that she would be justified in despising him. They are both
      atrociously unhappy and yet cannot separate. They cast invectives,
      reproaches and abominable accusations at each other from morning till
      night, and when they have reached the climax and are vibrating with rage
      and hatred, they fall into each other''s arms and kiss each other ardently.

The girl-man is brave and a coward at the same time. He has, more than
      another, the exalted sentiment of honor, but is lacking in the sense of
      simple honesty, and, circumstances favoring him, would defalcate and
      commit infamies which do not trouble his conscience, for he obeys without
      questioning the oscillations of his ideas, which are always impulsive.

To him it seems permissible and almost right to cheat a haberdasher. He
      considers it honorable not to pay his debts, unless they are gambling
      debts—that is, somewhat shady. He dupes people whenever the laws of
      society admit of his doing so. When he is short of money he borrows in all
      ways, not always being scrupulous as to tricking the lenders, but he
      would, with sincere indignation, run his sword through anyone who should
      suspect him of only lacking in politeness.

The humid gray sky seemed to weigh down on the vast brown plain. The odor
      of autumn, the sad odor of bare, moist lands, of fallen leaves, of dead
      grass made the stagnant evening air more thick and heavy. The peasants
      were still at work, scattered through the fields, waiting for the stroke
      of the Angelus to call them back to the farmhouses, whose thatched roofs
      were visible here and there through the branches of the leafless trees
      which protected the apple-gardens against the wind.

At the side of the road, on a heap of clothes, a very small boy seated
      with his legs apart was playing with a potato, which he now and then let
      fall on his dress, whilst five women were bending down planting slips of
      colza in the adjoining plain. With a slow, continuous movement, all along
      the mounds of earth which the plough had just turned up, they drove in
      sharp wooden stakes and in the hole thus formed placed the plant, already
      a little withered, which sank on one side; then they patted down the earth
      and went on with their work.

A man who was passing, with a whip in his hand, and wearing wooden shoes,
      stopped near the child, took it up and kissed it. Then one of the women
      rose up and came across to him. She was a big, red haired girl, with large
      hips, waist and shoulders, a tall Norman woman, with yellow hair in which
      there was a blood-red tint.

And they stared at each other. He held the child in his arms all the time.
      He kissed it once more and then put it down again on the woman''s clothes.

In the distance, between two farm-houses, could be seen a plough drawn by
      a horse and driven by a man. They moved on very gently, the horse, the
      plough and the laborer, in the dim evening twilight.

The young man pointed toward the child whom he had just put back on the
      ground, then with a glance he drew her attention to the man drawing the
      plough yonder there.

“Faith, every one knows it well—that it is Victor''s. And what
      about it after all? I made a slip. Am I the only woman that did? My mother
      also made a slip before me, and then yours did the same before she married
      your dad! Who is it that hasn''t made a slip in the country? I made a slip
      with Victor because he took advantage of me while I was asleep in the
      barn, it''s true, and afterward it happened between us when I wasn''t
      asleep. I certainly would have married him if he weren''t a servant man. Am
      I a worse woman for that?”

“As for me, I like you just as you are, with or without the child.
      It''s only my father that opposes me. All the same, I''ll see about settling
      the business.”

And he set forth with his heavy peasant''s tread, while the girl, with her
      hands on her hips, turned round to plant her colza.

In fact, the man who thus went off, Cesaire Houlbreque, the son of deaf
      old Amable Houlbreque, wanted to marry, in spite of his father, Celeste
      Levesque, who had a child by Victor Lecoq, a mere laborer on her parents''
      farm, who had been turned out of doors for this act.

The hierarchy of caste, however, does not exist in the country, and if the
      laborer is thrifty, he becomes, by taking a farm in his turn, the equal of
      his former master.

So Cesaire Houlbieque went off, his whip under his arm, brooding over his
      own thoughts and lifting up one after the other his heavy wooden shoes
      daubed with clay. Certainly he desired to marry Celeste Levesque. He
      wanted her with her child because she was the wife he wanted. He could not
      say why, but he knew it, he was sure of it. He had only to look at her to
      be convinced of it, to feel quite queer, quite stirred up, simply stupid
      with happiness. He even found a pleasure in kissing the little boy,
      Victor''s little boy, because he belonged to her.

And he gazed, without hate, at the distant outline of the man who was
      driving his plough along the horizon.

But old Amable did not want this marriage. He opposed it with the
      obstinacy of a deaf man, with a violent obstinacy.

“I''ll take good care of you, daddy. I tell you she''s a good girl and
      strong, too, and also thrifty.”

And nothing could get the better of him, nothing could make him waver. One
      hope only was left to Cesaire. Old Amable was afraid of the cure through
      the apprehension of death which he felt drawing nigh; he had not much fear
      of God, nor of the Devil, nor of Hell, nor of Purgatory, of which he had
      no conception, but he dreaded the priest, who represented to him burial,
      as one might fear the doctors through horror of diseases. For the last
      tight days Celeste, who knew this weakness of the old man, had been urging
      Cesaire to go and find the cure, but Cesaire always hesitated, because he
      had not much liking for the black robe, which represented to him hands
      always stretched out for collections or for blessed bread.

However, he had made up his mind, and he proceeded toward the presbytery,
      thinking in what manner he would speak about his case.

The Abbe Raffin, a lively little priest, thin and never shaved, was
      awaiting his dinner-hour while warming his feet at his kitchen fire.

The man remained standing, intimidated, holding his cap in one hand and
      his whip in the other.

Cesaire looked at the housekeeper, an old woman who dragged her feet while
      putting on the cover for her master''s dinner at the corner of the table in
      front of the window.

Thereupon the Abbe Raffin carefully surveyed his peasant. He saw his
      confused countenance, his air of constraint, his wandering eyes, and he
      gave orders to the housekeeper in these words:

The young fellow still hesitated, looked down at his wooden shoes, moved
      about his cap, then, all of a sudden, he made up his mind:

In the peasant''s mind every effort of religion consisted in loosening the
      purse strings, in emptying the pockets of men in order to fill the
      heavenly coffer. It was a kind of huge commercial establishment, of which
      the cures were the clerks; sly, crafty clerks, sharp as any one must be
      who does business for the good God at the expense of the country people.

He knew full well that the priests rendered services, great services to
      the poorest, to the sick and dying, that they assisted, consoled,
      counselled, sustained, but all this by means of money, in exchange for
      white pieces, for beautiful glittering coins, with which they paid for
      sacraments and masses, advice and protection, pardon of sins and
      indulgences, purgatory and paradise according to the yearly income and the
      generosity of the sinner.

He held on lease a little farm, quite small, for they were not rich, his
      father and he. Alone with a female servant, a little girl of fifteen, who
      made the soup, looked after the fowls, milked the cows and churned the
      butter, they lived frugally, though Cesaire was a good cultivator. But
      they did not possess either sufficient lands or sufficient cattle to earn
      more than the indispensable.

The old man no longer worked. Sad, like all deaf people, crippled with
      pains, bent double, twisted, he went through the fields leaning on his
      stick, watching the animals and the men with a hard, distrustful eye.
      Sometimes he sat down on the side of the road and remained there without
      moving for hours, vaguely pondering over the things that had engrossed his
      whole life, the price of eggs, and corn, the sun and the rain which spoil
      the crops or make them grow. And, worn out with rheumatism, his old limbs
      still drank in the humidity of the soul, as they had drunk in for the past
      sixty years, the moisture of the walls of his low house thatched with damp
      straw.

He came back at the close of the day, took his place at the end of the
      table in the kitchen and when the earthen bowl containing the soup had
      been placed before him he placed round it his crooked fingers, which
      seemed to have kept the round form of the bowl and, winter and summer, he
      warmed his hands, before commencing to eat, so as to lose nothing, not
      even a particle of the heat that came from the fire, which costs a great
      deal, neither one drop of soup into which fat and salt have to be put, nor
      one morsel of bread, which comes from the wheat.

Then he climbed up a ladder into a loft, where he had his straw-bed, while
      his son slept below stairs at the end of a kind of niche near the
      chimneypiece and the servant shut herself up in a kind of cellar, a black
      hole which was formerly used to store the potatoes.

Cesaire and his father scarcely ever talked to each other. From time to
      time only, when there was a question of selling a crop or buying a calf,
      the young man would ask his father''s advice, and, making a
      speaking-trumpet of his two hands, he would bawl out his views into his
      ear, and old Amable either approved of them or opposed them in a slow,
      hollow voice that came from the depths of his stomach.

So one evening Cesaire, approaching him as if about to discuss the
      purchase of a horse or a heifer, communicated to him at the top of his
      voice his intention to marry Celeste Levesque.

Then the father got angry. Why? On the score of morality? No, certainly.
      The virtue of a girl is of slight importance in the country. But his
      avarice, his deep, fierce instinct for saving, revolted at the idea that
      his son should bring up a child which he had not begotten himself. He had
      thought suddenly, in one second, of the soup the little fellow would
      swallow before becoming useful on the farm. He had calculated all the
      pounds of bread, all the pints of cider that this brat would consume up to
      his fourteenth year, and a mad anger broke loose from him against Cesaire,
      who had not bestowed a thought on all this.

Thereupon Cesaire began to enumerate his reasons, to speak about Celeste''s
      good qualities, to prove that she would be worth a thousand times what the
      child would cost. But the old man doubted these advantages, while he could
      have no doubts as to the child''s existence; and he replied with emphatic
      repetition, without giving any further explanation:

“I will not have it! I will not have it! As long as I live, this
      won''t be done!” And at this point they had remained for the last
      three months without one or the other giving in, resuming at least once a
      week the same discussion, with the same arguments, the same words, the
      same gestures and the same fruitlessness.

On arriving home the peasant found his father already seated at table, for
      he came late through his visit to the presbytery.

They dined in silence, face to face, ate a little bread and butter after
      the soup and drank a glass of cider. Then they remained motionless in
      their chairs, with scarcely a glimmer of light, the little servant girl
      having carried off the candle in order to wash the spoons, wipe the
      glasses and cut the crusts of bread to be ready for next morning''s
      breakfast.

There was a knock, at the door, which was immediately opened, and the
      priest appeared. The old man raised toward him an anxious eye full of
      suspicion, and, foreseeing danger, he was getting ready to climb up his
      ladder when the Abbe Raffin laid his hand on his shoulder and shouted
      close to his temple:

Cesaire had disappeared, taking advantage of the door being open. He did
      not want to listen, for he was afraid and did not want his hopes to
      crumble slowly with each obstinate refusal of his father. He preferred to
      learn the truth at once, good or bad, later on; and he went out into the
      night. It was a moonless, starless night, one of those misty nights when
      the air seems thick with humidity. A vague odor of apples floated through
      the farmyard, for it was the season when the earliest applies were
      gathered, the “early ripe,” as they are called in the cider
      country. As Cesaire passed along by the cattlesheds the warm smell of
      living beasts asleep on manure was exhaled through the narrow windows, and
      he heard the stamping of the horses, who were standing at the end of the
      stable, and the sound of their jaws tearing and munching the hay on the
      racks.

He went straight ahead, thinking about Celeste. In this simple nature,
      whose ideas were scarcely more than images generated directly by objects,
      thoughts of love only formulated themselves by calling up before the mind
      the picture of a big red-haired girl standing in a hollow road and
      laughing, with her hands on her hips.

It was thus he saw her on the day when he first took a fancy for her. He
      had, however, known her from infancy, but never had he been so struck by
      her as on that morning. They had stopped to talk for a few minutes and
      then he went away, and as he walked along he kept repeating:

When he saw her again he felt something tickling the end of his throat, as
      if a cock''s feather had been driven through his mouth into his chest, and
      since then, every time he found himself near her, he was astonished at
      this nervous tickling which always commenced again.

In three months he made up his mind to marry her, so much did she please
      him. He could not have said whence came this power over him, but he
      explained it in these words:

“I am possessed by her,” as if the desire for this girl within
      him were as dominating as one of the powers of hell. He scarcely bothered
      himself about her transgression. It was a pity, but, after all, it did her
      no harm, and he bore no grudge against Victor Lecoq.

But if the cure should not succeed, what was he to do? He did not dare to
      think of it, the anxiety was such a torture to him.

He reached the presbytery and seated himself near the little gateway to
      wait for the priest''s return.

He was there perhaps half an hour when he heard steps on the road, and
      although the night was very dark, he presently distinguished the still
      darker shadow of the cassock.

He rose up, his legs giving way under him, not even venturing to speak,
      not daring to ask a question.

“Why, yes. Come and look me up to-morrow at midday in order to
      settle about the publication of the banns.”

“True-true-true, Monsieur le Cure, on the word of an honest man,
      you''ll see me to-morrow-at your sermon.”

The wedding took place in the middle of December. It was simple, the
      bridal pair not being rich. Cesaire, attired in new clothes, was ready
      since eight o''clock in the morning to go and fetch his betrothed and bring
      her to the mayor''s office, but it was too early. He seated himself before
      the kitchen table and waited for the members of the family and the friends
      who were to accompany him.

For the last eight days it had been snowing, and the brown earth, the
      earth already fertilized by the autumn sowing, had become a dead white,
      sleeping under a great sheet of ice.

It was cold in the thatched houses adorned with white caps, and the round
      apples in the trees of the enclosures seemed to be flowering, covered with
      white as they had been in the pleasant month of their blossoming.

This day the big clouds to the north, the big great snow clouds, had
      disappeared and the blue sky showed itself above the white earth on which
      the rising sun cast silvery reflections.

The door opened, two women entered, peasant women in their Sunday clothes,
      the aunt and the cousin of the bridegroom; then three men, his cousins;
      then a woman who was a neighbor. They sat down on chairs and remained,
      motionless and silent, the women on one side of the kitchen, the men on
      the other, suddenly seized with timidity, with that embarrassed sadness
      which takes possession of people assembled for a ceremony. One of the
      cousins soon asked:

Those rose up. Then Cesaire, whom a feeling of uneasiness had taken
      possession of, climbed up the ladder of the loft to see whether his father
      was ready. The old man, always as a rule an early riser, had not yet made
      his appearance. His son found him on his bed of straw, wrapped up in his
      blanket, with his eyes open and a malicious gleam in them.

And he stooped toward the old man, pulled off his blanket, caught him by
      the arm and lifted him up. But old Amable began to whine, “Ooh! ooh!
      ooh! What suffering! Ooh! I can''t. My back is stiffened up. The cold wind
      must have rushed in through this cursed roof.”

“Well, you''ll get no dinner, as I''m having a spread at Polyte''s inn.
      This will teach you what comes of acting mulishly.”

The men had turned up the bottoms of their trousers so as not to get them
      wet in the snow. The women held up their petticoats and showed their lean
      ankles with gray woollen stockings and their bony shanks resembling
      broomsticks. And they all moved forward with a swinging gait, one behind
      the other, without uttering a word, moving cautiously, for fear of losing
      the road which was-hidden beneath the flat, uniform, uninterrupted stretch
      of snow.

As they approached the farmhouses they saw one or two persons waiting to
      join them, and the procession went on without stopping and wound its way
      forward, following the invisible outlines of the road, so that it
      resembled a living chaplet of black beads undulating through the white
      countryside.

In front of the bride''s door a large group was stamping up and down the
      open space awaiting the bridegroom. When he appeared they gave him a loud
      greeting, and presently Celeste came forth from her room, clad in a blue
      dress, her shoulders covered with a small red shawl and her head adorned
      with orange flowers.

They directed their steps toward the mayor''s office. Behind the pair about
      to be wedded a peasant woman carried Victor''s child, as if it were going
      to be baptized; and the peasants, in pairs now, with arms linked,
      walked through the snow with the movements of a sloop at sea.

After having been united by the mayor in the little municipal house the
      pair were made one by the cure, in his turn, in the modest house of God.
      He blessed their union by promising them fruitfulness, then he preached to
      them on the matrimonial virtues, the simple and healthful virtues of the
      country, work, concord and fidelity, while the child, who was cold, began
      to fret behind the bride.

As soon as the couple reappeared on the threshold of the church shots were
      discharged from the ditch of the cemetery. Only the barrels of the guns
      could be seen whence came forth rapid jets of smoke; then a head could be
      seen gazing at the procession. It was Victor Lecoq celebrating the
      marriage of his old sweetheart, wishing her happiness and sending her his
      good wishes with explosions of powder. He had employed some friends of
      his, five or six laboring men, for these salvos of musketry. It was
      considered a nice attention.

The repast was given in Polyte Cacheprune''s inn. Twenty covers were laid
      in the great hall where people dined on market days, and the big leg of
      mutton turning before the spit, the fowls browned under their own gravy,
      the chitterlings sputtering over the bright, clear fire filled the house
      with a thick odor of live coal sprinkled with fat—the powerful,
      heavy odor of rustic fare.

They sat down to table at midday and the soup was poured at once into the
      plates. All faces had already brightened up; mouths opened to utter loud
      jokes and eyes were laughing with knowing winks. They were going to amuse
      themselves and no mistake.

The door opened, and old Amable appeared. He seemed in a bad humor and his
      face wore a scowl as he dragged himself forward on his sticks, whining at
      every step to indicate his suffering. As soon as they saw him they stopped
      talking, but suddenly his neighbor, Daddy Malivoire, a big joker, who knew
      all the little tricks and ways of people, began to yell, just as Cesaire
      used to do, by making a speaking-trumpet of his hands.

“Hallo, my cute old boy, you have a good nose on you to be able to
      smell Polyte''s cookery from your own house!”

A roar of laughter burst forth from the throats of those present.
      Malivoire, excited by his success, went on:

“There''s nothing for the rheumatics like a chitterling poultice! It
      keeps your belly warm, along with a glass of three-six!”

The men uttered shouts, banged the table with their fists, laughed,
      bending on one side and raising up their bodies again as if they were
      working a pump. The women clucked like hens, while the servants wriggled,
      standing against the walls. Old Amable was the only one that did not
      laugh, and, without making any reply, waited till they made room for him.

They found a place for him in the middle of the table, facing his
      daughter-in-law, and, as soon as he was seated, he began to eat. It was
      his son who was paying, after all; it was right he should take his share.
      With each ladleful of soup that went into his stomach, with each mouthful
      of bread or meat crushed between his gums, with each glass of cider or
      wine that flowed through his gullet he thought he was regaining something
      of his own property, getting back a little of his money which all those
      gluttons were devouring, saving in fact a portion of his own means. And he
      ate in silence with the obstinacy of a miser who hides his coppers, with
      the same gloomy persistence with which he formerly performed his daily
      labors.

But all of a sudden he noticed at the end of the table Celeste''s child on
      a woman''s lap, and his eye remained fixed on the little boy. He went on
      eating, with his glance riveted on the youngster, into whose mouth the
      woman who minded him every now and then put a little morsel which he
      nibbled at. And the old man suffered more from the few mouthfuls sucked by
      this little chap than from all that the others swallowed.

Celeste took her child in her arms, and they went on slowly through the
      pale night whitened by the snow. The deaf old man, three-fourths tipsy,
      and even more malicious under the influence of drink, refused to go
      forward. Several times he even sat down with the object of making his
      daughter-in-law catch cold, and he kept whining, without uttering a word,
      giving vent to a sort of continuous groaning as if he were in pain.

When they reached home he at once climbed up to his loft, while Cesaire
      made a bed for the child near the deep niche where he was going to lie
      down with his wife. But as the newly wedded pair could not sleep
      immediately, they heard the old man for a long time moving about on his
      bed of straw, and he even talked aloud several times, whether it was that
      he was dreaming or that he let his thoughts escape through his mouth, in
      spite of himself, not being able to keep them back, under the obsession of
      a fixed idea.

When he came down his ladder next morning he saw his daughter-in-law
      looking after the housekeeping.

And she placed at the end of the table the round black earthen bowl filled
      with steaming liquid. He sat down without giving any answer, seized the
      hot bowl, warmed his hands with it in his customary fashion, and, as it
      was very cold, even pressed it against his breast to try to make a little
      of the living heat of the boiling liquid enter into him, into his old body
      stiffened by so many winters.

Then he took his sticks and went out into the fields, covered with ice,
      till it was time for dinner, for he had seen Celeste''s youngster still
      asleep in a big soap-box.

He did not take his place in the household. He lived in the thatched
      house, as in bygone days, but he seemed not to belong to it any longer, to
      be no longer interested in anything, to look upon those people, his son,
      the wife and the child as strangers whom he did not know, to whom he never
      spoke.

Then the early spring made the seeds sprout forth again, and the peasants
      once more, like laborious ants, passed their days in the fields, toiling
      from morning till night, under the wind and under the rain, along the
      furrows of brown earth which brought forth the bread of men.

The year promised well for the newly married pair. The crops grew thick
      and strong. There were no late frosts, and the apples bursting into bloom
      scattered on the grass their rosy white snow which promised a hail of
      fruit for the autumn.

Cesaire toiled hard, rose early and left off work late, in order to save
      the expense of a hired man.

Nevertheless one evening he came home so fatigued that he had to get to
      bed without supper. He rose up next morning at the usual hour, but he
      could not eat, in spite of his fast on the previous night, and he had to
      come back to the house in the middle of the afternoon in order to go to
      bed again. In the course of the night he began to cough; he turned round
      on his straw couch, feverish, with his forehead burning, his tongue dry
      and his throat parched by a burning thirst.

However, at daybreak he went toward his grounds, but next morning the
      doctor had to be sent for and pronounced him very ill with inflammation of
      the lungs.

And he no longer left the dark recess in which he slept. He could be heard
      coughing, gasping and tossing about in this hole. In order to see him, to
      give his medicine and to apply cupping-glasses they had to-bring a candle
      to the entrance. Then one could see his narrow head with his long matted
      beard underneath a thick lacework of spiders'' webs, which hung and floated
      when stirred by the air. And the hands of the sick man seemed dead under
      the dingy sheets.

Celeste watched him with restless activity, made him take physic, applied
      blisters to him, went back and forth in the house, while old Amable
      remained at the edge of his loft, watching at a distance the gloomy cavern
      where his son lay dying. He did not come near him, through hatred of the
      wife, sulking like an ill-tempered dog.

Six more days passed, then one morning, as Celeste, who now slept on the
      ground on two loose bundles of straw, was going to see whether her man was
      better, she no longer heard his rapid breathing from the interior of his
      recess. Terror stricken, she asked:

He did not answer. She put out her hand to touch him, and the flesh on his
      face felt cold as ice. She uttered a great cry, the long cry of a woman
      overpowered with fright. He was dead.

At this cry the deaf old man appeared at the top of his ladder, and when
      he saw Celeste rushing to call for help, he quickly descended, placed his
      hand on his son''s face, and suddenly realizing what had happened, went to
      shut the door from the inside, to prevent the wife from re-entering and
      resuming possession of the dwelling, since his son was no longer living.

Some of the neighbors arrived, called out and knocked. He did not hear
      them. One of them broke the glass of the window and jumped into the room.
      Others followed. The door was opened again and Celeste reappeared, all in
      tears, with swollen face and bloodshot eyes. Then old Amable, vanquished,
      without uttering a word, climbed back to his loft.

The funeral took place next morning. Then, after the ceremony, the
      father-in-law and the daughter-in-law found themselves alone in the
      farmhouse with the child.

It was the usual dinner hour. She lighted the fire, made some soup and
      placed the plates on the table, while the old man sat on the chair waiting
      without appearing to look at her. When the meal was ready she bawled in
      his ear—

“Come, daddy, you must eat.” He rose up, took his seat at the
      end of the table, emptied his soup bowl, masticated his bread and butter,
      drank his two glasses of cider and then took himself off.

It was one of those warm days, one of those enjoyable days when life
      ferments, pulsates, blooms all over the surface of the soil.

Old Amable pursued a little path across the fields. He looked at the young
      wheat and the young oats, thinking that his son was now under the earth,
      his poor boy! He walked along wearily, dragging his legs after him in a
      limping fashion. And, as he was all alone in the plain, all alone under
      the blue sky, in the midst of the growing crops, all alone with the larks
      which he saw hovering above his head, without hearing their light song, he
      began to weep as he proceeded on his way.

Then he sat down beside a pond and remained there till evening, gazing at
      the little birds that came there to drink. Then, as the night was falling,
      he returned to the house, supped without saying a word and climbed up to
      his loft. And his life went on as in the past. Nothing was changed, except
      that his son Cesaire slept in the cemetery.

What could he, an old man, do? He could work no longer; he was now good
      for nothing except to swallow the soup prepared by his daughter-in-law.
      And he ate it in silence, morning and evening, watching with an eye of
      rage the little boy also taking soup, right opposite him, at the other
      side of the table. Then he would go out, prowl about the fields after the
      fashion of a vagabond, hiding behind the barns where he would sleep for an
      hour or two as if he were afraid of being seen and then come back at the
      approach of night.

But Celeste''s mind began to be occupied by graver anxieties. The farm
      needed a man to look after it and cultivate it. Somebody should be there
      always to go through the fields, not a mere hired laborer, but a regular
      farmer, a master who understood the business and would take an interest in
      the farm. A lone woman could not manage the farming, watch the price of
      corn and direct the sale and purchase of cattle. Then ideas came into her
      head, simple practical ideas, which she had turned over in her head at
      night. She could not marry again before the end of the year, and it was
      necessary at once to take care of pressing interests, immediate interests.

Only one man could help her out of her difficulties, Victor Lecoq, the
      father of her child. He was strong and understood farming; with a little
      money in his pocket he would make an excellent cultivator. She was aware
      of his skill, having known him while he was working on her parents'' farm.

So one morning, seeing him passing along the road with a cart of manure,
      she went out to meet him. When he perceived her, he drew up his horses and
      she said to him as if she had met him the night before:

“Oh, I''d be all right, only that I''m alone in the house, which
      bothers me on account of the farm.”

Then they remained chatting for a long time, leaning against the wheel of
      the heavy cart. The man every now and then lifted up his cap to scratch
      his forehead and began thinking, while she, with flushed cheeks, went on
      talking warmly, told him about her views, her plans; her projects for the
      future. At last he said in a low tone:

This particular Sunday was the day of the village festival, the annual
      festival in honor of the patron saint, which in Normandy is called the
      assembly.

For the last eight days quaint-looking vehicles in which live the families
      of strolling fair exhibitors, lottery managers, keepers of shooting
      galleries and other forms of amusement or exhibitors of curiosities whom
      the peasants call “wonder-makers” could be seen coming along
      the roads drawn slowly by gray or sorrel horses.

The dirty wagons with their floating curtains, accompanied by a
      melancholy-looking dog, who trotted, with his head down, between the
      wheels, drew up one after the other on the green in front of the town
      hall. Then a tent was erected in front of each ambulant abode, and inside
      this tent could be seen, through the holes in the canvas, glittering
      things which excited the envy or the curiosity of the village youngsters.

As soon as the morning of the fete arrived all the booths were opened,
      displaying their splendors of glass or porcelain, and the peasants on
      their way to mass looked with genuine satisfaction at these modest shops
      which they saw again, nevertheless, each succeeding year.

Early in the afternoon there was a crowd on the green. From every
      neighboring village the farmers arrived, shaken along with their wives and
      children in the two-wheeled open chars-a-bancs, which rattled along,
      swaying like cradles. They unharnessed at their friends'' houses and the
      farmyards were filled with strange-looking traps, gray, high, lean,
      crooked, like long-clawed creatures from the depths of the sea. And each
      family, with the youngsters in front and the grown-up ones behind, came to
      the assembly with tranquil steps, smiling countenances and open hands, big
      hands, red and bony, accustomed to work and apparently tired of their
      temporary rest.

A clown was blowing a trumpet. The barrel-organ accompanying the carrousel
      sent through the air its shrill jerky notes. The lottery-wheel made a
      whirring sound like that of cloth tearing, and every moment the crack of
      the rifle could be heard. And the slow-moving throng passed on quietly in
      front of the booths resembling paste in a fluid condition, with the
      motions of a flock of sheep and the awkwardness of heavy animals who had
      escaped by chance.

The girls, holding one another''s arms in groups of six or eight, were
      singing; the youths followed them, making jokes, with their caps over
      their ears and their blouses stiffened with starch, swollen out like blue
      balloons.

Old Amable himself, wearing his old-fashioned green frock coat, had wished
      to see the assembly, for he never failed to attend on such an occasion.

He looked at the lotteries, stopped in front of the shooting galleries to
      criticize the shots and interested himself specially in a very simple game
      which consisted in throwing a big wooden ball into the open mouth of a
      mannikin carved and painted on a board.

They drank one glass of brandy, then two, then three, and old Amable once
      more began wandering through the assembly. His thoughts became slightly
      confused, he smiled without knowing why, he smiled in front of the
      lotteries, in front of the wooden horses and especially in front of the
      killing game. He remained there a long time, filled with delight, when he
      saw a holiday-maker knocking down the gendarme or the cure, two
      authorities whom he instinctively distrusted. Then he went back to the inn
      and drank a glass of cider to cool himself. It was late, night came on. A
      neighbor came to warn him:

Then he set out on his way to the farmhouse. A soft shadow, the warm
      shadow of a spring night, was slowly descending on the earth.

When he reached the front door he thought he saw through the window which
      was lighted up two persons in the house. He stopped, much surprised, then
      he went in, and he saw Victor Lecoq seated at the table, with a plate
      filled with potatoes before him, taking his supper in the very same place
      where his son had sat.

And he turned round suddenly as if he wanted to go away. The night was
      very dark now. Celeste started up and shouted at him:

He complied through inertia and sat down, watching in turn the man, the
      woman and the child. Then he began to eat quietly as on ordinary days.

Victor Lecoq seemed quite at home, talked from time to time to Celeste,
      took up the child in his lap and kissed him. And Celeste again served him
      with food, poured out drink for him and appeared happy while speaking to
      him. Old Amable''s eyes followed them attentively, though he could not hear
      what they were saying.

When he had finished supper (and he had scarcely eaten anything, there was
      such a weight at his heart) he rose up, and instead of ascending to his
      loft as he did every night he opened the gate of the yard and went out
      into the open air.

Then she saw after the house, washed the plates and wiped the table, while
      the man quietly took off his clothes. Then he slipped into the dark and
      hollow bed in which she had slept with Cesaire.

The yard gate opened and old Amable again appeared. As soon as he entered
      the house he looked round on every side with the air of an old dog on the
      scent. He was in search of Victor Lecoq. As he did not see him, he took
      the candle off the table and approached the dark niche in which his son
      had died. In the interior of it he perceived the man lying under the bed
      clothes and already asleep. Then the deaf man noiselessly turned round,
      put back the candle and went out into the yard.

Celeste had finished her work. She put her son into his bed, arranged
      everything and waited for her father-in-law''s return before lying down
      herself.

“It''s over an hour since he went out. We ought to see whether he
      fell asleep on the bench outside the door.”

She rose up, took the light and went out, shading the light with her hand
      in order to see through the darkness.

She saw nothing in front of the door, nothing on the bench, nothing on the
      dung heap, where the old man used sometimes to sit in hot weather.

But, just as she was on the point of going in again, she chanced to raise
      her eyes toward the big apple tree, which sheltered the entrance to the
      farmyard, and suddenly she saw two feet—two feet at the height of
      her face belonging to a man who was hanging.

He ran out in his shirt. She could not utter another word, and turning
      aside her head so as not to see, she pointed toward the tree with her
      outstretched arm.

Not understanding what she meant, he took the candle in order to find out,
      and in the midst of the foliage lit up from below he saw old Amable
      hanging high up with a stable-halter round his neck.

Victor ran to fetch a bill-hook, climbed up the tree and cut the halter.
      But the old man was already cold and his tongue protruded horribly with a
      frightful grimace.

The old ship''s surgeon, holding out his glass, watched it as it slowly
      filled with the golden liquid. Then, holding it in front of his eyes, he
      let the light from the lamp stream through it, smelled it, tasted a few
      drops and smacked his lips with relish. Then he said:

“Ah! the charming poison! Or rather the seductive murderer, the
      delightful destroyer of peoples!

“You people do not know it the way I do. You may have read that
      admirable book entitled L''Assommoir, but you have not, as I have, seen
      alcohol exterminate a whole tribe of savages, a little kingdom of negroes—alcohol
      calmly unloaded by the barrel by red-bearded English seamen.

“Right near here, in a little village in Brittany near Pont-l''Abbe,
      I once witnessed a strange and terrible tragedy caused by alcohol. I was
      spending my vacation in a little country house left me by my father. You
      know this flat coast where the wind whistles day and night, where one
      sees, standing or prone, these giant rocks which in the olden times were
      regarded as guardians, and which still retain something majestic and
      imposing about them. I always expect to see them come to life and start to
      walk across the country with the slow and ponderous tread of giants, or to
      unfold enormous granite wings and fly toward the paradise of the Druids.

“Everywhere is the sea, always ready on the slightest provocation to
      rise in its anger and shake its foamy mane at those bold enough to brave
      its wrath.

“And the men who travel on this terrible sea, which, with one motion
      of its green back, can overturn and swallow up their frail barks—they
      go out in the little boats, day and night, hardy, weary and drunk. They
      are often drunk. They have a saying which says: ''When the bottle is full
      you see the reef, but when it is empty you see it no more.''

“Go into one of their huts; you will never find the father there. I' WHERE id = '6b5a5bab-cb6d-4c60-9071-cb95b01bf8ca';
