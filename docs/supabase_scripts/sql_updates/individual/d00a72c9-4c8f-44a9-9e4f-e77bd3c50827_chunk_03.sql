courteously declined.  Indeed, it began to be felt that the
self-effacement of the returned pressmen was being carried to a
pedantic length.  Foreman compositors, advertisement clerks,
and other members of the non-editorial staff, who had, of course,
taken no part in the great trek, found it as impossible to get
into direct communication with the editor and his satellites now
that they had returned as when they had been excusably
inaccessible in Central Asia.  The sulky, overworked
office-boy, who was the one connecting link between the editorial
brain and the business departments of the paper, sardonically
explained the new aloofness as the ‘Yarkand
manner.’  Most of the reporters and sub-editors seemed
to have been dismissed in autocratic fashion since their return
and new ones engaged by letter; to these the editor and his
immediate associates remained an unseen presence, issuing its
instructions solely through the medium of curt typewritten
notes.  Something mystic and Tibetan and forbidden had
replaced the human bustle and democratic simplicity of
pre-migration days, and the same experience was encountered by
those who made social overtures to the returned wanderers. 
The most brilliant hostess of Twentieth Century London flung the
pearl of her hospitality into the unresponsive trough of the
editorial letter-box; it seemed as if nothing short of a Royal
command would drag the hermit-souled revenants from their
self-imposed seclusion.  People began to talk unkindly of
the effect of high altitudes and Eastern atmosphere on minds and
temperaments unused to such luxuries.  The Yarkand manner
was not popular.”

“Ah!” said Sir Lulworth, “that was the
exciting thing.  In home affairs, social questions, and the
ordinary events of the day not much change was noticeable. 
A certain Oriental carelessness seemed to have crept into the
editorial department, and perhaps a note of lassitude not
unnatural in the work of men who had returned from what had been
a fairly arduous journey.  The aforetime standard of
excellence was scarcely maintained, but at any rate the general
lines of policy and outlook were not departed from.  It was
in the realm of foreign affairs that a startling change took
place.  Blunt, forcible, outspoken articles appeared,
couched in language which nearly turned the autumn
manœuvres of six important Powers into mobilisations. 
Whatever else the Daily Intelligencer had learned in the
East, it had not acquired the art of diplomatic ambiguity. 
The man in the street enjoyed the articles and bought the paper
as he had never bought it before; the men in Downing Street took
a different view.  The Foreign Secretary, hitherto accounted
a rather reticent man, became positively garrulous in the course
of perpetually disavowing the sentiments expressed in the
Daily Intelligencer’s leaders; and then one day the
Government came to the conclusion that something definite and
drastic must be done.  A deputation, consisting of the Prime
Minister, the Foreign Secretary, four leading financiers, and a
well-known Nonconformist divine, made its way to the offices of
the paper.  At the door leading to the editorial department
the way was barred by a nervous but defiant office-boy.

“‘We insist on seeing the editor or some
responsible person,’ said the Prime Minister, and the
deputation forced its way in.  The boy had spoken truly;
there was no one to be seen.  In the whole suite of rooms
there was no sign of human life.

“In answer to the shower of questions the boy unlocked a
drawer and produced a strange-looking envelope, which bore a
Khokand postmark, and a date of some seven or eight months
back.  It contained a scrap of paper on which was written
the following message:

“‘Entire party captured by brigand
tribe on homeward journey.  Quarter of million demanded as
ransom, but would probably take less.  Inform Government,
relations, and friends.’

“There followed the signatures of the principal members
of the party and instructions as to how and where the money was
to be paid.

“The letter had been directed to the
office-boy-in-charge, who had quietly suppressed it.  No one
is a hero to one’s own office-boy, and he evidently
considered that a quarter of a million was an unwarrantable
outlay for such a doubtfully advantageous object as the
repatriation of an errant newspaper staff.  So he drew the
editorial and other salaries, forged what signatures were
necessary, engaged new reporters, did what sub-editing he could,
and made as much use as possible of the large accumulation of
special articles that was held in reserve for emergencies. 
The articles on foreign affairs were entirely his own
composition.

“Of course the whole thing had to be kept as quiet as
possible; an interim staff, pledged to secrecy, was appointed to
keep the paper going till the pining captives could be sought
out, ransomed, and brought home, in twos and threes to escape
notice, and gradually things were put back on their old
footing.  The articles on foreign affairs reverted to the
wonted traditions of the paper.”

“But,” interposed the nephew, “how on earth
did the boy account to the relatives all those months for the
non-appearance—”

“That,” said Sir Lulworth, “was the most
brilliant stroke of all.  To the wife or nearest relative of
each of the missing men he forwarded a letter, copying the
handwriting of the supposed writer as well as he could, and
making excuses about vile pens and ink; in each letter he told
the same story, varying only the locality, to the effect that the
writer, alone of the whole party, was unable to tear himself away
from the wild liberty and allurements of Eastern life, and was
going to spend several months roaming in some selected
region.  Many of the wives started off immediately in
pursuit of their errant husbands, and it took the Government a
considerable time and much trouble to reclaim them from their
fruitless quests along the banks of the Oxus, the Gobi Desert,
the Orenburg steppe, and other outlandish places.  One of
them, I believe, is still lost somewhere in the Tigris
Valley.”

Sophie Chattel-Monkheim was a Socialist by conviction and a
Chattel-Monkheim by marriage.  The particular member of that
wealthy family whom she had married was rich, even as his
relatives counted riches.  Sophie had very advanced and
decided views as to the distribution of money: it was a pleasing
and fortunate circumstance that she also had the money. 
When she inveighed eloquently against the evils of capitalism at
drawing-room meetings and Fabian conferences she was conscious of
a comfortable feeling that the system, with all its inequalities
and iniquities, would probably last her time.  It is one of
the consolations of middle-aged reformers that the good they
inculcate must live after them if it is to live at all.

On a certain spring evening, somewhere towards the
dinner-hour, Sophie sat tranquilly between her mirror and her
maid, undergoing the process of having her hair built into an
elaborate reflection of the prevailing fashion.  She was
hedged round with a great peace, the peace of one who has
attained a desired end with much effort and perseverance, and who
has found it still eminently desirable in its attainment. 
The Duke of Syria had consented to come beneath her roof as a
guest, was even now installed beneath her roof, and would shortly
be sitting at her dining-table.  As a good Socialist, Sophie
disapproved of social distinctions, and derided the idea of a
princely caste, but if there were to be these artificial
gradations of rank and dignity she was pleased and anxious to
have an exalted specimen of an exalted order included in her
house-party.  She was broad-minded enough to love the sinner
while hating the sin—not that she entertained any warm
feeling of personal affection for the Duke of Syria, who was a
comparative stranger, but still, as Duke of Syria, he was very,
very welcome beneath her roof.  She could not have explained
why, but no one was likely to ask her for an explanation, and
most hostesses envied her.

“You must surpass yourself to-night, Richardson,”
she said complacently to her maid; “I must be looking my
very best.  We must all surpass ourselves.”

The maid said nothing, but from the concentrated look in her
eyes and the deft play of her fingers it was evident that she was
beset with the ambition to surpass herself.

Richardson held a hurried conference with an invisible
messenger at the door; when she returned there was noticeable a
curious listlessness in place of her hitherto alert manner.

“Yes, madame.  Before he became an omelette
specialist he was a valet, and he was one of the strike-breakers
in the great strike at Lord Grimford’s two years ago. 
As soon as the household staff here learned that you had engaged
him they resolved to ‘down tools’ as a protest. 
They haven’t got any grievance against you personally, but
they demand that Gaspare should be immediately
dismissed.”

“But,” protested Sophie, “he is the only man
in England who understands how to make a Byzantine
omelette.  I engaged him specially for the Duke of
Syria’s visit, and it would be impossible to replace him at
short notice.  I should have to send to Paris, and the Duke
loves Byzantine omelettes.  It was the one thing we talked
about coming from the station.”

“This is too awful,” said Sophie; “a strike
of servants at a moment like this, with the Duke of Syria staying
in the house.  Something must be done immediately. 
Quick, finish my hair and I’ll go and see what I can do to
bring them round.”

“I can’t finish your hair, madame,” said
Richardson quietly, but with immense decision.  “I
belong to the union and I can’t do another
half-minute’s work till the strike is settled. 
I’m sorry to be disobliging.”

“But this is inhuman!” exclaimed Sophie
tragically; “I’ve always been a model mistress and
I’ve refused to employ any but union servants, and this is
the result.  I can’t finish my hair myself; I
don’t know how to.  What am I to do?  It’s
wicked!”

“Wicked is the word,” said Richardson;
“I’m a good Conservative and I’ve no patience
with this Socialist foolery, asking your pardon.  It’s
tyranny, that’s what it is, all along the line, but
I’ve my living to make, same as other people, and
I’ve got to belong to the union.  I couldn’t
touch another hair-pin without a strike permit, not if you was to
double my wages.”

“Here’s a nice affair,” she screamed,
“a strike of household servants without a moment’s
warning, and I’m left like this!  I can’t appear
in public in this condition.”

“Dinner!” snorted Catherine, “what on earth
is the good of dinner when none of us will be able to appear at
it?  Look at your hair—and look at me! or rather,
don’t.”

“I know it’s difficult to manage without a maid;
can’t your husband be any help to you?” asked Sophie
despairingly.

“Henry?  He’s in worse case than any of
us.  His man is the only person who really understands that
ridiculous new-fangled Turkish bath that he insists on taking
with him everywhere.”

“Surely he could do without a Turkish bath for one
evening,” said Sophie; “I can’t appear without
hair, but a Turkish bath is a luxury.”

“My good woman,” said Catherine, speaking with a
fearful intensity, “Henry was in the bath when the strike
started.  In it, do you understand?  He’s there
now.”

“He doesn’t know how to.  Every time he pulls
the lever marked ‘release’ he only releases hot
steam.  There are two kinds of steam in the bath,
‘bearable’ and ‘scarcely bearable’; he
has released them both.  By this time I’m probably a
widow.”

“I simply can’t send away Gaspare,” wailed
Sophie; “I should never be able to secure another omelette
specialist.”

“Any difficulty that I may experience in securing
another husband is of course a trifle beneath anyone’s
consideration,” said Catherine bitterly.

Sophie capitulated.  “Go,” she said to
Richardson, “and tell the Strike Committee, or whoever are
directing this affair, that Gaspare is herewith dismissed. 
And ask Gaspare to see me presently in the library, when I will
pay him what is due to him and make what excuses I can; and then
fly back and finish my hair.”

Some half an hour later Sophie marshalled her guests in the
Grand Salon preparatory to the formal march to the
dining-room.  Except that Henry Malsom was of the ripe
raspberry tint that one sometimes sees at private theatricals
representing the human complexion, there was little outward sign
among those assembled of the crisis that had just been
encountered and surmounted.  But the tension had been too
stupefying while it lasted not to leave some mental effects
behind it.  Sophie talked at random to her illustrious
guest, and found her eyes straying with increasing frequency
towards the great doors through which would presently come the
blessed announcement that dinner was served.  Now and again
she glanced mirror-ward at the reflection of her wonderfully
coiffed hair, as an insurance underwriter might gaze thankfully
at an overdue vessel that had ridden safely into harbour in the
wake of a devastating hurricane.  Then the doors opened and
the welcome figure of the butler entered the room.  But he
made no general announcement of a banquet in readiness, and the
doors closed behind him; his message was for Sophie alone.

“There is no dinner, madame,” he said gravely;
“the kitchen staff have ‘downed tools.’ 
Gaspare belongs to the Union of Cooks and Kitchen Employees, and
as soon as they heard of his summary dismissal at a
moment’s notice they struck work.  They demand his
instant reinstatement and an apology to the union.  I may
add, madame, that they are very firm; I’ve been obliged
even to hand back the dinner rolls that were already on the
table.”

After the lapse of eighteen months Sophie Chattel-Monkheim is
beginning to go about again among her old haunts and associates,
but she still has to be very careful.  The doctors will not
let her attend anything at all exciting, such as a drawing-room
meeting or a Fabian conference; it is doubtful, indeed, whether
she wants to.

“It’s a good thing that Saint Valentine’s
Day has dropped out of vogue,” said Mrs. Thackenbury;
“what with Christmas and New Year and Easter, not to speak
of birthdays, there are quite enough remembrance days as it
is.  I tried to save myself trouble at Christmas by just
sending flowers to all my friends, but it wouldn’t work;
Gertrude has eleven hot-houses and about thirty gardeners, so it
would have been ridiculous to send flowers to her, and Milly has
just started a florist’s shop, so it was equally out of the
question there.  The stress of having to decide in a hurry
what to give to Gertrude and Milly just when I thought I’d
got the whole question nicely off my mind completely ruined my
Christmas, and then the awful monotony of the letters of thanks:
‘Thank you so much for your lovely flowers.  It was so
good of you to think of me.’  Of course in the
majority of cases I hadn’t thought about the recipients at
all; their names were down in my list of ‘people who must
not be left out.’  If I trusted to remembering them
there would be some awful sins of omission.”

“The trouble is,” said Clovis to his aunt,
“all these days of intrusive remembrance harp so
persistently on one aspect of human nature and entirely ignore
the other; that is why they become so perfunctory and
artificial.  At Christmas and New Year you are emboldened
and encouraged by convention to send gushing messages of
optimistic goodwill and servile affection to people whom you
would scarcely ask to lunch unless some one else had failed you
at the last moment; if you are supping at a restaurant on New
Year’s Eve you are permitted and expected to join hands and
sing ‘For Auld Lang Syne’ with strangers whom you
have never seen before and never want to see again.  But no
licence is allowed in the opposite direction.”

“There is no outlet for demonstrating your feelings
towards people whom you simply loathe.  That is really the
crying need of our modern civilisation.  Just think how
jolly it would be if a recognised day were set apart for the
paying off of old scores and grudges, a day when one could lay
oneself out to be gracefully vindictive to a carefully treasured
list of ‘people who must not be let off.’  I
remember when I was at a private school we had one day, the last
Monday of the term I think it was, consecrated to the settlement
of feuds and grudges; of course we did not appreciate it as much
as it deserved, because, after all, any day of the term could be
used for that purpose.  Still, if one had chastised a
smaller boy for being cheeky weeks before, one was always
permitted on that day to recall the episode to his memory by
chastising him again.  That is what the French call
reconstructing the crime.”

“I should call it reconstructing the punishment,”
said Mrs. Thackenbury; “and, anyhow, I don’t see how
you could introduce a system of primitive schoolboy vengeance
into civilised adult life.  We haven’t outgrown our
passions, but we are supposed to have learned how to keep them
within strictly decorous limits.”

“Of course the thing would have to be done furtively and
politely,” said Clovis; “the charm of it would be
that it would never be perfunctory like the other thing. 
Now, for instance, you say to yourself: ‘I must show the
Webleys some attention at Christmas, they were kind to dear
Bertie at Bournemouth,’ and you send them a calendar, and
daily for six days after Christmas the male Webley asks the
female Webley if she has remembered to thank you for the calendar
you sent them.  Well, transplant that idea to the other and
more human side of your nature, and say to yourself: ‘Next
Thursday is Nemesis Day; what on earth can I do to those odious
people next door who made such an absurd fuss when Ping Yang bit
their youngest child?’  Then you’d get up
awfully early on the allotted day and climb over into their
garden and dig for truffles on their tennis court with a good
gardening fork, choosing, of course, that part of the court that
was screened from observation by the laurel bushes.  You
wouldn’t find any truffles but you would find a great
peace, such as no amount of present-giving could ever
bestow.”

“I shouldn’t,” said Mrs. Thackenbury, though
her air of protest sounded a bit forced; “I should feel
rather a worm for doing such a thing.”

“You exaggerate the power of upheaval which a worm would
be able to bring into play in the limited time available,”
said Clovis; “if you put in a strenuous ten minutes with a
really useful fork, the result ought to suggest the operations of
an unusually masterful mole or a badger in a hurry.”

“Of course they would,” said Clovis; “that
would be half the satisfaction of the thing, just as you like
people at Christmas to know what presents or cards you’ve
sent them.  The thing would be much easier to manage, of
course, when you were on outwardly friendly terms with the object
of your dislike.  That greedy little Agnes Blaik, for
instance, who thinks of nothing but her food, it would be quite
simple to ask her to a picnic in some wild woodland spot and lose
her just before lunch was served; when you found her again every
morsel of food could have been eaten up.”

“It would require no ordinary human strategy to lose
Agnes Blaik when luncheon was imminent: in fact, I don’t
believe it could be done.”

“Then have all the other guests, people whom you
dislike, and lose the luncheon.  It could have been sent by
accident in the wrong direction.”

“For them, but not for you,” said Clovis;
“you would have had an early and comforting lunch before
you started, and you could improve the occasion by mentioning in
detail the items of the missing banquet—the lobster Newburg
and the egg mayonnaise, and the curry that was to have been
heated in a chafing-dish.  Agnes Blaik would be delirious
long before you got to the list of wines, and in the long
interval of waiting, before they had quite abandoned hope of the
lunch turning up, you could induce them to play silly games, such
as that idiotic one of ‘the Lord Mayor’s
dinner-party,’ in which every one has to choose the name of
a dish and do something futile when it is called out.  In
this case they would probably burst into tears when their dish is
mentioned.  It would be a heavenly picnic.”

Mrs. Thackenbury was silent for a moment; she was probably
making a mental list of the people she would like to invite to
the Duke Humphrey picnic.  Presently she asked: “And
that odious young man, Waldo Plubley, who is always coddling
himself—have you thought of anything that one could do to
him?”  Evidently she was beginning to see the
possibilities of Nemesis Day.

“If there was anything like a general observance of the
festival,” said Clovis, “Waldo would be in such
demand that you would have to bespeak him weeks beforehand, and
even then, if there were an east wind blowing or a cloud or two
in the sky he might be too careful of his precious self to come
out.  It would be rather jolly if you could lure him into a
hammock in the orchard, just near the spot where there is a
wasps’ nest every summer.  A comfortable hammock on a
warm afternoon would appeal to his indolent tastes, and then,
when he was getting drowsy, a lighted fusee thrown into the nest
would bring the wasps out in an indignant mass, and they would
soon find a ‘home away from home’ on Waldo’s
fat body.  It takes some doing to get out of a hammock in a
hurry.”

“Waldo is one of those people who would be enormously
improved by death,” said Clovis; “but if you
didn’t want to go as far as that, you could have some wet
straw ready to hand, and set it alight under the hammock at the
same time that the fusee was thrown into the nest; the smoke
would keep all but the most militant of the wasps just outside
the stinging line, and as long as Waldo remained within its
protection he would escape serious damage, and could be
eventually restored to his mother, kippered all over and swollen
in places, but still perfectly recognisable.”

It was the season of sales.  The august establishment of
Walpurgis and Nettlepink had lowered its prices for an entire
week as a concession to trade observances, much as an
Arch-duchess might protestingly contract an attack of influenza
for the unsatisfactory reason that influenza was locally
prevalent.  Adela Chemping, who considered herself in some
measure superior to the allurements of an ordinary bargain sale,
made a point of attending the reduction week at Walpurgis and
Nettlepink’s.

Which showed that beneath her surface strength of character
there flowed a gracious undercurrent of human weakness.

With a view to providing herself with a male escort Mrs.
Chemping had invited her youngest nephew to accompany her on the
first day of the shopping expedition, throwing in the additional
allurement of a cinematograph theatre and the prospect of light
refreshment.  As Cyprian was not yet eighteen she hoped he
might not have reached that stage in masculine development when
parcel-carrying is looked on as a thing abhorrent.

“Meet me just outside the floral department,” she
wrote to him, “and don’t be a moment later than
eleven.”

Cyprian was a boy who carried with him through early life the
wondering look of a dreamer, the eyes of one who sees things that
are not visible to ordinary mortals, and invests the commonplace
things of this world with qualities unsuspected by plainer
folk—the eyes of a poet or a house agent.  He was
quietly dressed—that sartorial quietude which frequently
accompanies early adolescence, and is usually attributed by
novel-writers to the influence of a widowed mother.  His
hair was brushed back in a smoothness as of ribbon seaweed and
seamed with a narrow furrow that scarcely aimed at being a
parting.  His aunt particularly noted this item of his
toilet when they met at the appointed rendezvous, because he was
standing waiting for her bareheaded.

“You are not going to be what they call a Nut, are
you?” she inquired with some anxiety, partly with the idea
that a Nut would be an extravagance which her sister’s
small household would scarcely be justified in incurring, partly,
perhaps, with the instinctive apprehension that a Nut, even in
its embryo stage, would refuse to carry parcels.

“I didn’t bring a hat,” he said,
“because it is such a nuisance when one is shopping; I mean
it is so awkward if one meets anyone one knows and has to take
one’s hat off when one’s hands are full of
parcels.  If one hasn’t got a hat on one can’t
take it off.”

“It is more orthodox to wear a hat,” she observed,
and then turned her attention briskly to the business in
hand.

“We will go first to the table-linen counter,” she
said, leading the way in that direction; “I should like to
look at some napkins.”

The wondering look deepened in Cyprian’s eyes as he
followed his aunt; he belonged to a generation that is supposed
to be over-fond of the rôle of mere spectator, but looking
at napkins that one did not mean to buy was a pleasure beyond his
comprehension.  Mrs. Chemping held one or two napkins up to
the light and stared fixedly at them, as though she half expected
to find some revolutionary cypher written on them in scarcely
visible ink; then she suddenly broke away in the direction of the
glassware department.

“Millicent asked me to get her a couple of decanters if
there were any going really cheap,” she explained on the
way, “and I really do want a salad bowl.  I can come
back to the napkins later on.”

She handled and scrutinised a large number of decanters and a
long series of salad bowls, and finally bought seven
chrysanthemum vases.

“No one uses that kind of vase nowadays,” she
informed Cyprian, “but they will do for presents next
Christmas.”

Two sunshades that were marked down to a price that Mrs.
Chemping considered absurdly cheap were added to her
purchases.

“One of them will do for Ruth Colson; she is going out
to the Malay States, and a sunshade will always be useful
there.  And I must get her some thin writing paper.  It
takes up no room in one’s baggage.”

Mrs. Chemping bought stacks of writing paper; it was so cheap,
and it went so flat in a trunk or portmanteau.  She also
bought a few envelopes—envelopes somehow seemed rather an
extragavance compared with notepaper.

“We haven’t any mauve,” said the assistant,
“but we’ve two shades of green and a darker shade of
grey.”

Cyprian behaved in an exemplary fashion in the refreshment
department, and cheerfully accepted a fish cake and a mince pie
and a small cup of coffee as adequate restoratives after two
hours of concentrated shopping.  He was adamant, however, in
resisting his aunt’s suggestion that a hat should be bought
for him at the counter where men’s headwear was being
disposed of at temptingly reduced prices.

“I’ve got as many hats as I want at home,”
he said, “and besides, it rumples one’s hair so,
trying them on.”

Perhaps he was going to develop into a Nut after all.  It
was a disquieting symptom that he left all the parcels in charge
of the cloak-room attendant.

“We shall be getting more parcels presently,” he
said, “so we need not collect these till we have finished
our shopping.”

His aunt was doubtfully appeased; some of the pleasure and
excitement of a shopping expedition seemed to evaporate when one
was deprived of immediate personal contact with one’s
purchases.

“I’m going to look at those napkins again,”
she said, as they descended the stairs to the ground floor. 
“You need not come,” she added, as the dreaming look
in the boy’s eyes changed for a moment into one of mute
protest, “you can meet me afterwards in the cutlery
department; I’ve just remembered that I haven’t a
corkscrew in the house that can be depended on.”

Cyprian was not to be found in the cutlery department when his
aunt in due course arrived there, but in the crush and bustle of
anxious shoppers and busy attendants it was an easy matter to
miss anyone.  It was in the leather goods department some
quarter of an hour later that Adela Chemping caught sight of her
nephew, separated from her by a rampart of suit-cases and
portmanteaux and hemmed in by the jostling crush of human beings
that now invaded every corner of the great shopping
emporium.  She was just in time to witness a pardonable but
rather embarrassing mistake on the part of a lady who had
wriggled her way with unstayable determination towards the
bareheaded Cyprian, and was now breathlessly demanding the sale
price of a handbag which had taken her fancy.

“There now,” exclaimed Adela to herself,
“she takes him for one of the shop assistants because he
hasn’t got a hat on.  I wonder it hasn’t
happened before.”

Perhaps it had.  Cyprian, at any rate, seemed neither
startled nor embarrassed by the error into which the good lady
had fallen.  Examining the ticket on the bag, he announced
in a clear, dispassionate voice:

“Black seal, thirty-four shillings, marked down to
twenty-eight.  As a matter of fact, we are clearing them out
at a special reduction price of twenty-six shillings.  They
are going off rather fast.”

“Will you take it as it is?” asked Cyprian;
“it will be a matter of a few minutes to get it wrapped up,
there is such a crush.”

“Never mind, I’ll take it as it is,” said
the purchaser, clutching her treasure and counting the money into
Cyprian’s palm.

When she next came across Cyprian he was standing in the crowd
that pushed and jostled around the counters of the book
department.  The dream look was deeper than ever in his
eyes.  He had just sold two books of devotion to an elderly
Canon.

“I’ve just been to see old Betsy Mullen,”
announced Vera to her aunt, Mrs. Bebberly Cumble; “she
seems in rather a bad way about her rent.  She owes about
fifteen weeks of it, and says she doesn’t know where any of
it is to come from.”

“Betsy Mullen always is in difficulties with her rent,
and the more people help her with it the less she troubles about
it,” said the aunt.  “I certainly am not going
to assist her any more.  The fact is, she will have to go
into a smaller and cheaper cottage; there are several to be had
at the other end of the village for half the rent that she is
paying, or supposed to be paying, now.  I told her a year
ago that she ought to move.”

“But she wouldn’t get such a nice garden anywhere
else,” protested Vera, “and there’s such a
jolly quince tree in the corner.  I don’t suppose
there’s another quince tree in the whole parish.  And
she never makes any quince jam; I think to have a quince tree and
not to make quince jam shows such strength of character. 
Oh, she can’t possibly move away from that
garden.”

“When one is sixteen,” said Mrs. Bebberly Cumble
severely, “one talks of things being impossible which are
merely uncongenial.  It is not only possible but it is
desirable that Betsy Mullen should move into smaller quarters;
she has scarcely enough furniture to fill that big
cottage.”

“As far as value goes,” said Vera after a short
pause, “there is more in Betsy’s cottage than in any
other house for miles round.”

“I’m not talking about anything that belongs to
Betsy herself,” said Vera darkly; “but, of course,
you don’t know what I know, and I don’t suppose I
ought to tell you.”

“You must tell me at once,” exclaimed the aunt,
her senses leaping into alertness like those of a terrier
suddenly exchanging a bored drowsiness for the lively
anticipation of an immediate rat hunt.

“I’m perfectly certain that I oughtn’t to
tell you anything about it,” said Vera, “but, then, I
often do things that I oughtn’t to do.”

“I should be the last person to suggest that you should
do anything that you ought not to do to—” began Mrs.
Bebberly Cumble impressively.

“And I am always swayed by the last person who speaks to
me,” admitted Vera, “so I’ll do what I ought
not to do and tell you.”

Mrs. Bebberley Cumble thrust a very pardonable sense of
exasperation into the background of her mind and demanded
impatiently:

“It’s hardly fair to say that I’ve
made a fuss about it,” said Vera; “this is the first
time I’ve mentioned the matter, but there’s been no
end of trouble and mystery and newspaper speculation about
it.  It’s rather amusing to think of the columns of
conjecture in the Press and the police and detectives hunting
about everywhere at home and abroad, and all the while that
innocent-looking little cottage has held the secret.”

“You don’t mean to say it’s the Louvre
picture, La Something or other, the woman with the smile, that
disappeared about two years ago?” exclaimed the aunt with
rising excitement.

“Oh no, not that,” said Vera, “but something
quite as important and just as mysterious—if anything,
rather more scandalous.”

“Of course Betsy hasn’t an idea as to what they
are,” said Vera; “she just knows that they are
something valuable and that she must keep quiet about them. 
I found out quite by accident what they were and how they came to
be there.  You see, the people who had them were at their
wits’ end to know where to stow them away for safe keeping,
and some one who was motoring through the village was struck by
the snug loneliness of the cottage and thought it would be just
the thing.  Mrs. Lamper arranged the matter with Betsy and
smuggled the things in.”

“I am quite aware that she takes soup and flannel and
improving literature to the poorer cottagers,” said Mrs.
Bebberly Cumble, “but that is hardly the same sort of thing
as disposing of stolen goods, and she must have known something
about their history; anyone who reads the papers, even casually,
must have been aware of the theft, and I should think the things
were not hard to recognise.  Mrs. Lamper has always had the
reputation of being a very conscientious woman.”

“Of course she was screening some one else,” said
Vera.  “A remarkable feature of the affair is the
extraordinary number of quite respectable people who have
involved themselves in its meshes by trying to shield
others.  You would be really astonished if you knew some of
the names of the individuals mixed up in it, and I don’t
suppose a tithe of them know who the original culprits were; and
now I’ve got you entangled in the mess by letting you into
the secret of the cottage.”

“You most certainly have not entangled me,” said
Mrs. Bebberly Cumble indignantly.  “I have no
intention of shielding anybody.  The police must know about
it at once; a theft is a theft, whoever is involved.  If
respectable people choose to turn themselves into receivers and
disposers of stolen goods, well, they’ve ceased to be
respectable, that’s all.  I shall telephone
immediately—”

“Oh, aunt,” said Vera reproachfully, “it
would break the poor Canon’s heart if Cuthbert were to be
involved in a scandal of this sort.  You know it
would.”

“Of course I know you think a lot of him, and that
he’s engaged to marry Beatrice, and that it will be a
frightfully good match, and that he’s your ideal of what a
son-in-law ought to be.  All the same, it was
Cuthbert’s idea to stow the things away in the cottage, and
it was his motor that brought them.  He was only doing it to
help his friend Pegginson, you know—the Quaker man, who is
always agitating for a smaller Navy.  I forget how he got
involved in it.  I warned you that there were lots of quite
respectable people mixed up in it, didn’t I? 
That’s what I meant when I said it would be impossible for
old Betsy to leave the cottage; the things take up a good bit of
room, and she couldn’t go carrying them about with her
other goods and chattels without attracting notice.  Of
course if she were to fall ill and die it would be equally
unfortunate.  Her mother lived to be over ninety, she tells
me, so with due care and an absence of worry she ought to last
for another dozen years at least.  By that time perhaps some
other arrangements will have been made for disposing of the
wretched things.”

“The wedding isn’t till next year,” said
Vera, in recounting the story to her best girl friend, “and
meanwhile old Betsy is living rent free, with soup twice a week
and my aunt’s doctor to see her whenever she has a finger
ache.”

“Oh, about the jewels?  I invented that
part,” explained Vera; “I mean the mystery was where
old Betsy’s arrears of rent were to come from; and she
would have hated leaving that jolly quince tree.”

“I don’t specialise in it,” said Clovis;
“it’s all right while you’re doing it, but the
after-effects are sometimes so disconcerting—the mute
reproachful looks of the people you’ve aided and abetted in
matrimonial experiments.  It’s as bad as selling a man
a horse with half a dozen latent vices and watching him discover
them piecemeal in the course of the hunting season.  I
suppose you’re thinking of the Coulterneb girl. 
She’s certainly jolly, and quite all right as far as looks
go, and I believe a certain amount of money adheres to her. 
What I don’t see is how you will ever manage to propose to
her.  In all the time I’ve known her I don’t
remember her to have stopped talking for three consecutive
minutes.  You’ll have to race her six times round the
grass paddock for a bet, and then blurt your proposal out before
she’s got her wind back.  The paddock is laid up for
hay, but if you’re really in love with her you won’t
let a consideration of that sort stop you, especially as
it’s not your hay.”

“I think I could manage the proposing part right
enough,” said Hugo, “if I could count on being left
alone with her for four or five hours.  The trouble is that
I’m not likely to get anything like that amount of
grace.  That fellow Lanner is showing signs of interesting
himself in the same quarter.  He’s quite
heartbreakingly rich and is rather a swell in his way; in fact,
our hostess is obviously a bit flattered at having him
here.  If she gets wind of the fact that he’s inclined
to be attracted by Betty Coulterneb she’ll think it a
splendid match and throw them into each other’s arms all
day long, and then where will my opportunities come in?  My
one anxiety is to keep him out of the girl’s way as much as
possible, and if you could help me—”

“If you want me to trot Lanner round the countryside,
inspecting alleged Roman remains and studying local methods of
bee culture and crop raising, I’m afraid I can’t
oblige you,” said Clovis.  “You see, he’s
taken something like an aversion to me since the other night in
the smoking-room.”

“He trotted out some well-worn chestnut as the latest
thing in good stories, and I remarked, quite innocently, that I
never could remember whether it was George II. or James II. who
was so fond of that particular story, and now he regards me with
politely-draped dislike.  I’ll do my best for you, if
the opportunity arises, but it will have to be in a roundabout,
impersonal manner.”

“It’s so nice having Mr. Lanner here,”
confided Mrs. Olston to Clovis the next afternoon;
“he’s always been engaged when I’ve asked him
before.  Such a nice man; he really ought to be married to
some nice girl.  Between you and me, I have an idea that he
came down here for a certain reason.”

“For what he can get?” said the hostess
with a touch of indignation in her voice; “what do you
mean?  He’s a very rich man.  What should he want
to get here?”

“He has one ruling passion,” said Clovis,
“and there’s something he can get here that is not to
be had for love nor for money anywhere else in the country, as
far as I know.”

“Egg-collecting,” said Clovis.  “He has
agents all over the world getting rare eggs for him, and his
collection is one of the finest in Europe; but his great ambition
is to collect his treasures personally.  He stops at no
expense nor trouble to achieve that end.”

“Good heavens!  The buzzards, the rough-legged
buzzards!” exclaimed Mrs. Olston; “you don’t
think he’s going to raid their nest?”

“What do you think yourself?” asked Clovis;
“the only pair of rough-legged buzzards known to breed in
this country are nesting in your woods.  Very few people
know about them, but as a member of the league for protecting
rare birds that information would be at his disposal.  I
came down in the train with him, and I noticed that a bulky
volume of Dresser’s ‘Birds of Europe’ was one
of the requisites that he had packed in his travelling-kit. 
It was the volume dealing with short-winged hawks and
buzzards.”

“This is appalling,” said Mrs. Olston; “my
husband would never forgive me if anything happened to those
birds.  They’ve been seen about the woods for the last
year or two, but this is the first time they’ve
nested.  As you say, they are almost the only pair known to
be breeding in the whole of Great Britain; and now their nest is
going to be harried by a guest staying under my roof.  I
must do something to stop it.  Do you think if I appealed to
him—”

“There is a story going about, which I fancy is true in
most of its details, of something that happened not long ago
somewhere on the coast of the Sea of Marmora, in which our friend
had a hand.  A Syrian nightjar, or some such bird, was known
to be breeding in the olive gardens of a rich Armenian, who for
some reason or other wouldn’t allow Lanner to go in and
take the eggs, though he offered cash down for the
permission.  The Armenian was found beaten nearly to death a
day or two later, and his fences levelled.  It was assumed
to be a case of Mussulman aggression, and noted as such in all
the Consular reports, but the eggs are in the Lanner
collection.  No, I don’t think I should appeal to his
better feelings if I were you.”

“I must do something,” said Mrs. Olston tearfully;
“my husband’s parting words when he went off to
Norway were an injunction to see that those birds were not
disturbed, and he’s asked about them every time he’s
written.  Do suggest something.”

“No; round Lanner.  He can’t find his way
through those woods by night, and you could arrange that you or
Evelyn or Jack or the German governess should be by his side in
relays all day long.  A fellow guest he could get rid of,
but he couldn’t very well shake off members of the
household, and even the most determined collector would hardly go
climbing after forbidden buzzards’ eggs with a German
governess hanging round his neck, so to speak.”

Lanner, who had been lazily watching for an opportunity for
prosecuting his courtship of the Coulterneb girl, found presently
that his chances of getting her to himself for ten minutes even
were non-existent.  If the girl was ever alone he never
was.  His hostess had changed suddenly, as far as he was
concerned, from the desirable type that lets her guests do
nothing in the way that best pleases them, to the sort that drags
them over the ground like so many harrows.  She showed him
the herb garden and the greenhouses, the village church, some
water-colour sketches that her sister had done in Corsica, and
the place where it was hoped that celery would grow later in the
year.

He was shown all the Aylesbury ducklings and the row of wooden
hives where there would have been bees if there had not been bee
disease.  He was also taken to the end of a long lane and
shown a distant mound whereon local tradition reported that the
Danes had once pitched a camp.  And when his hostess had to
desert him temporarily for other duties he would find Evelyn
walking solemnly by his side.  Evelyn was fourteen and
talked chiefly about good and evil, and of how much one might
accomplish in the way of regenerating the world if one was
thoroughly determined to do one’s utmost.  It was
generally rather a relief when she was displaced by Jack, who was
nine years old, and talked exclusively about the Balkan War
without throwing any fresh light on its political or military
history.  The German governess told Lanner more about
Schiller than he had ever heard in his life about any one person;
it was perhaps his own fault for having told her that he was not
interested in Goethe.  When the governess went off picket
duty the hostess was again on hand with a not-to-be-gainsaid
invitation to visit the cottage of an old woman who remembered
Charles James Fox; the woman had been dead for two or three
years, but the cottage was still there.  Lanner was called
back to town earlier than he had originally intended.

Hugo did not bring off his affair with Betty Coulterneb. 
Whether she refused him or whether, as was more generally
supposed, he did not get a chance of saying three consecutive
words, has never been exactly ascertained.  Anyhow, she is
still the jolly Coulterneb girl.

“Ronnie is a great trial to me,” said Mrs. Attray
plaintively.  “Only eighteen years old last February
and already a confirmed gambler.  I am sure I don’t
know where he inherits it from; his father never touched cards,
and you know how little I play—a game of bridge on
Wednesday afternoons in the winter, for three-pence a hundred,
and even that I shouldn’t do if it wasn’t that Edith
always wants a fourth and would be certain to ask that detestable
Jenkinham woman if she couldn’t get me.  I would much
rather sit and talk any day than play bridge; cards are such a
waste of time, I think.  But as to Ronnie, bridge and
baccarat and poker-patience are positively all that he thinks
about.  Of course I’ve done my best to stop it;
I’ve asked the Norridrums not to let him play cards when
he’s over there, but you might as well ask the Atlantic
Ocean to keep quiet for a crossing as expect them to bother about
a mother’s natural anxieties.”

“My dear,” said Mrs. Attray, “I don’t
want to offend them.  After all, they are my landlords and I
have to look to them for anything I want done about the place;
they were very accommodating about the new roof for the orchid
house.  And they lend me one of their cars when mine is out
of order; you know how often it gets out of order.”

“I don’t know how often,” said Eleanor,
“but it must happen very frequently.  Whenever I want
you to take me anywhere in your car I am always told that there
is something wrong with it, or else that the chauffeur has got
neuralgia and you don’t like to ask him to go
out.”

“He suffers quite a lot from neuralgia,” said Mrs.
Attray hastily.  “Anyhow,” she continued,
“you can understand that I don’t want to offend the
Norridrums.  Their household is the most rackety one in the
county, and I believe no one ever knows to an hour or two when
any particular meal will appear on the table or what it will
consist of when it does appear.”

“Still,” pursued Mrs. Attray, “whatever
their own home life may be, as landlords and neighbours they are
considerate and obliging, so I don’t want to quarrel with
them.  Besides, if Ronnie didn’t play cards there
he’d be playing somewhere else.”

“Firm?  I am firm,” exclaimed Mrs. Attray;
“I am more than firm—I am farseeing.  I’ve
done everything I can think of to prevent Ronnie from playing for
money.  I’ve stopped his allowance for the rest of the
year, so he can’t even gamble on credit, and I’ve
subscribed a lump sum to the church offertory in his name instead
of giving him instalments of small silver to put in the bag on
Sundays.  I wouldn’t even let him have the money to
tip the hunt servants with, but sent it by postal order.  He
was furiously sulky about it, but I reminded him of what happened
to the ten shillings that I gave him for the Young Men’s
Endeavour League ‘Self-Denial Week.’”

“Well, Ronnie did some preliminary endeavouring with it,
on his own account, in connection with the Grand National. 
If it had come off, as he expressed it, he would have given the
League twenty-five shillings and netted a comfortable commission
for himself; as it was, that ten shillings was one of the things
the League had to deny itself.  Since then I’ve been
careful not to let him have a penny piece in his
hands.”

“My dear, he’s done all that is to be done in that
direction already.  He’s got rid of his wrist-watch
and his hunting flask and both his cigarette cases, and I
shouldn’t be surprised if he’s wearing imitation-gold
sleeve links instead of those his Aunt Rhoda gave him on his
seventeenth birthday.  He can’t sell his clothes, of
course, except his winter overcoat, and I’ve locked that up
in the camphor cupboard on the pretext of preserving it from
moth.  I really don’t see what else he can raise money
on.  I consider that I’ve been both firm and
farseeing.”

“He was there yesterday afternoon and stayed to
dinner,” said Mrs. Attray.  “I don’t quite
know when he came home, but I fancy it was late.”

“Then depend on it he was gambling,” said Eleanor,
with the assured air of one who has few ideas and makes the most
of them.  “Late hours in the country always mean
gambling.”

“He can’t gamble if he has no money and no chance
of getting any,” argued Mrs. Attray; “even if one
plays for small stakes one must have a decent prospect of paying
one’s losses.”

“He may have sold some of the Amherst pheasant
chicks,” suggested Eleanor; “they would fetch about
ten or twelve shillings each, I daresay.”

“Ronnie wouldn’t do such a thing,” said Mrs.
Attray; “and anyhow I went and counted them this morning
and they’re all there.  No,” she continued, with
the quiet satisfaction that comes from a sense of painstaking and
merited achievement, “I fancy that Ronnie had to content
himself with the rôle of onlooker last night, as far as the
card-table was concerned.”

“Is that clock right?” asked Eleanor, whose eyes
had been straying restlessly towards the mantel-piece for some
little time; “lunch is usually so punctual in your
establishment.”

“Three minutes past the half-hour,” exclaimed Mrs.
Attray; “cook must be preparing something unusually
sumptuous in your honour.  I am not in the secret;
I’ve been out all the morning, you know.”

Eleanor smiled forgivingly.  A special effort by Mrs.
Attray’s cook was worth waiting a few minutes for.

As a matter of fact, the luncheon fare, when it made its tardy
appearance, was distinctly unworthy of the reputation which the
justly-treasured cook had built up for herself.  The soup
alone would have sufficed to cast a gloom over any meal that it
had inaugurated, and it was not redeemed by anything that
followed.  Eleanor said little, but when she spoke there was
a hint of tears in her voice that was far more eloquent than
outspoken denunciation would have been, and even the insouciant
Ronald showed traces of depression when he tasted the rognons
Saltikoff.

“Not quite the best luncheon I’ve enjoyed in your
house,” said Eleanor at last, when her final hope had
flickered out with the savoury.

“My dear, it’s the worst meal I’ve sat down
to for years,” said her hostess; “that last dish
tasted principally of red pepper and wet toast.  I’m
awfully sorry.  Is anything the matter in the kitchen,
Pellin?” she asked of the attendant maid.

“Well, ma’am, the new cook hadn’t hardly
time to see to things properly, coming in so sudden—”
commenced Pellin by way of explanation.

“What on earth do you mean?  What is Colonel
Norridrum’s cook doing in my kitchen—and where is my
cook?”

“Perhaps I can explain better than Pellin can,”
said Ronald hurriedly; “the fact is, I was dining at the
Norridrums’ yesterday, and they were wishing they had a
swell cook like yours, just for to-day and to-morrow, while
they’ve got some gourmet staying with them: their own cook
is no earthly good—well, you’ve seen what she turns
out when she’s at all flurried.  So I thought it would
be rather sporting to play them at baccarat for the loan of our
cook against a money stake, and I lost, that’s all.  I
have had rotten luck at baccarat all this year.”

The remainder of his explanation, of how he had assured the
cooks that the temporary transfer had his mother’s
sanction, and had smuggled the one out and the other in during
the maternal absence, was drowned in the outcry of scandalised
upbraiding.

“If I had sold the woman into slavery there
couldn’t have been a bigger fuss about it,” he
confided afterwards to Bertie Norridrum, “and Eleanor
Saxelby raged and ramped the louder of the two.  I tell you
what, I’ll bet you two of the Amherst pheasants to five
shillings that she refuses to have me as a partner at the croquet
tournament.  We’re drawn together, you
know.”

Marion Eggelby sat talking to Clovis on the only subject that
she ever willingly talked about—her offspring and their
varied perfections and accomplishments.  Clovis was not in
what could be called a receptive mood; the younger generation of
Eggelby, depicted in the glowing improbable colours of parent
impressionism, aroused in him no enthusiasm.  Mrs. Eggelby,
on the other hand, was furnished with enthusiasm enough for
two.

“You would like Eric,” she said, argumentatively
rather than hopefully.  Clovis had intimated very
unmistakably that he was unlikely to care extravagantly for
either Amy or Willie.  “Yes, I feel sure you would
like Eric.  Every one takes to him at once.  You know,
he always reminds me of that famous picture of the youthful
David—I forget who it’s by, but it’s very well
known.”

“That would be sufficient to set me against him, if I
saw much of him,” said Clovis.  “Just imagine at
auction bridge, for instance, when one was trying to concentrate
one’s mind on what one’s partner’s original
declaration had been, and to remember what suits one’s
opponents had originally discarded, what it would be like to have
some one persistently reminding one of a picture of the youthful
David.  It would be simply maddening.  If Eric did that
I should detest him.”

“None of my children have been brought up to play card
games,” said Mrs. Eggelby; “draughts and halma and
those sorts of games I encourage.  Eric is considered quite
a wonderful draughts-player.”

“You are strewing dreadful risks in the path of your
family,” said Clovis; “a friend of mine who is a
prison chaplain told me that among the worst criminal cases that
have come under his notice, men condemned to death or to long
periods of penal servitude, there was not a single
bridge-player.  On the other hand, he knew at least two
expert draughts-players among them.”

“I really don’t see what my boys have got to do
with the criminal classes,” said Mrs. Eggelby
resentfully.  “They have been most carefully brought
up, I can assure you that.”

“That shows that you were nervous as to how they would
turn out,” said Clovis.  “Now, my mother never
bothered about bringing me up.  She just saw to it that I
got whacked at decent intervals and was taught the difference
between right and wrong; there is some difference, you know, but
I’ve forgotten what it is.”

“Well, you see, I took up natural history and a whole
lot of other subjects at the same time, and one can’t
remember everything, can one?  I used to know the difference
between the Sardinian dormouse and the ordinary kind, and whether
the wry-neck arrives at our shores earlier than the cuckoo, or
the other way round, and how long the walrus takes in growing to
maturity; I daresay you knew all those sorts of things once, but
I bet you’ve forgotten them.”

“The fact that we’ve both forgotten them proves
that they are important,” said Clovis; “you must have
noticed that it’s always the important things that one
forgets, while the trivial, unnecessary facts of life stick in
one’s memory.  There’s my cousin, Editha
Clubberley, for instance; I can never forget that her birthday is
on the 12th of October.  It’s a matter of utter
indifference to me on what date her birthday falls, or whether
she was born at all; either fact seems to me absolutely trivial,
or unnecessary—I’ve heaps of other cousins to go on
with.  On the other hand, when I’m staying with
Hildegarde Shrubley I can never remember the important
circumstance whether her first husband got his unenviable
reputation on the Turf or the Stock Exchange, and that
uncertainty rules Sport and Finance out of the conversation at
once.  One can never mention travel, either, because her
second husband had to live permanently abroad.”

“No one who knows Hildegarde could possibly accuse her
of moving in a circle,” said Clovis; “her view of
life seems to be a non-stop run with an inexhaustible supply of
petrol.  If she can get some one else to pay for the petrol
so much the better.  I don’t mind confessing to you
that she has taught me more than any other woman I can think
of.”

“What kind of knowledge?” demanded Mrs. Eggelby,
with the air a jury might collectively wear when finding a
verdict without leaving the box.

“Well, among other things, she’s introduced me to
at least four different ways of cooking lobster,” said
Clovis gratefully.  “That, of course, wouldn’t
appeal to you; people who abstain from the pleasures of the
card-table never really appreciate the finer possibilities of the
dining-table.  I suppose their powers of enlightened
enjoyment get atrophied from disuse.”

“I daresay, if we knew more of her history, we should
find out that she’d often been ill before eating the
lobster.  Aren’t you concealing the fact that
she’d had measles and influenza and nervous headache and
hysteria, and other things that aunts do have, long before she
ate the lobster?  Aunts that have never known a day’s
illness are very rare; in fact, I don’t personally know of
any.  Of course if she ate it as a child of two weeks old it
might have been her first illness—and her last.  But
if that was the case I think you should have said so.”

“I must be going,” said Mrs. Eggelby, in a tone
which had been thoroughly sterilised of even perfunctory
regret.

“I have so enjoyed our little talk about Eric,” he
said; “I quite look forward to meeting him some
day.”

“Good-bye,” said Mrs. Eggelby frostily; the
supplementary remark which she made at the back of her throat
was—

Kenelm Jerton entered the dining-hall of the Golden Galleon
Hotel in the full crush of the luncheon hour.  Nearly every
seat was occupied, and small additional tables had been brought
in, where floor space permitted, to accommodate latecomers, with
the result that many of the tables were almost touching each
other.  Jerton was beckoned by a waiter to the only vacant
table that was discernible, and took his seat with the
uncomfortable and wholly groundless idea that nearly every one in
the room was staring at him.  He was a youngish man of
ordinary appearance, quiet of dress and unobtrusive of manner,
and he could never wholly rid himself of the idea that a fierce
light of public scrutiny beat on him as though he had been a
notability or a super-nut.  After he had ordered his lunch
there came the unavoidable interval of waiting, with nothing to
do but to stare at the flower-vase on his table and to be stared
at (in imagination) by several flappers, some maturer beings of
the same sex, and a satirical-looking Jew.  In order to
carry off the situation with some appearance of unconcern he
became spuriously interested in the contents of the
flower-vase.

“What is the name of these roses, d’you
know?” he asked the waiter.  The waiter was ready at
all times to conceal his ignorance concerning items of the
wine-list or menu; he was frankly ignorant as to the specific
name of the roses.

The voice came from a pleasant-faced, well-dressed young woman
who was sitting at a table that almost touched
Jerton’s.  He thanked her hurriedly and nervously for
the information, and made some inconsequent remark about the
flowers.

“It is a curious thing,” said the young woman,
that, “I should be able to tell you the name of those roses
without an effort of memory, because if you were to ask me my
name I should be utterly unable to give it to you.”

Jerton had not harboured the least intention of extending his
thirst for name-labels to his neighbour.  After her rather
remarkable announcement, however, he was obliged to say something
in the way of polite inquiry.

“Yes,” answered the lady, “I suppose it is a
case of partial loss of memory.  I was in the train coming
down here; my ticket told me that I had come from Victoria and
was bound for this place.  I had a couple of five-pound
notes and a sovereign on me, no visiting cards or any other means
of identification, and no idea as to who I am.  I can only
hazily recollect that I have a title; I am Lady
Somebody—beyond that my mind is a blank.”

“That is what I didn’t know.  I knew the name
of this hotel and made up my mind to come here, and when the
hotel porter who meets the trains asked if I had any luggage I
had to invent a dressing-bag and dress-basket; I could always
pretend that they had gone astray.  I gave him the name of
Smith, and presently he emerged from a confused pile of luggage
and passengers with a dressing-bag and dress-basket labelled
Kestrel-Smith.  I had to take them; I don’t see what
else I could have done.”

“Of course it was dreadful arriving at a strange hotel
with the name of Kestrel-Smith, but it would have been worse to
have arrived without luggage.  Anyhow, I hate causing
trouble.”

Jerton had visions of harassed railway officials and
distraught Kestrel-Smiths, but he made no attempt to clothe his
mental picture in words.  The lady continued her story.

“Naturally, none of my keys would fit the things, but I
told an intelligent page boy that I had lost my key-ring, and he
had the locks forced in a twinkling.  Rather too
intelligent, that boy; he will probably end in Dartmoor. 
The Kestrel-Smith toilet tools aren’t up to much, but they
are better than nothing.”

“If you feel sure that you have a title,” said
Jerton, “why not get hold of a peerage and go right through
it?”

“I tried that.  I skimmed through the list of the
House of Lords in ‘Whitaker,’ but a mere printed
string of names conveys awfully little to one, you know.  If
you were an army officer and had lost your identity you might
pore over the Army List for months without finding out who your
were.  I’m going on another tack; I’m trying to
find out by various little tests who I am not—that
will narrow the range of uncertainty down a bit.  You may
have noticed, for instance, that I’m lunching principally
off lobster Newburg.”

“It’s an extravagance, because it’s one of
the most expensive dishes on the menu, but at any rate it proves
that I’m not Lady Starping; she never touches shell-fish,
and poor Lady Braddleshrub has no digestion at all; if I am
her I shall certainly die in agony in the course of the
afternoon, and the duty of finding out who I am will devolve on
the press and the police and those sort of people; I shall be
past caring.  Lady Knewford doesn’t know one rose from
another and she hates men, so she wouldn’t have spoken to
you in any case; and Lady Mousehilton flirts with every man she
meets—I haven’t flirted with you, have I?”

“Oh, but, of course, there are heaps of them that I
couldn’t possibly be—women who’ve got
grandchildren or sons old enough to have celebrated their coming
of age.  I’ve only got to consider the ones about my
own age.  I tell you how you might help me this afternoon,
if you don’t mind; go through any of the back numbers of
Country Life and those sort of papers that you can find in
the smoking-room, and see if you come across my portrait with
infant son or anything of that sort.  It won’t take
you ten minutes.  I’ll meet you in the lounge about
tea-time.  Thanks awfully.”

And the Fair Unknown, having graciously pressed Jerton into
the search for her lost identity, rose and left the room. 
As she passed the young man’s table she halted for a moment
and whispered:

“Did you notice that I tipped the waiter a
shilling?  We can cross Lady Ulwight off the list; she would
have died rather than do that.”

At five o’clock Jerton made his way to the hotel lounge;
he had spent a diligent but fruitless quarter of an hour among
the illustrated weeklies in the smoking-room.  His new
acquaintance was seated at a small tea-table, with a waiter
hovering in attendance.

“Only negative information.  I’m not Lady
Befnal.  She disapproves dreadfully of any form of gambling,
so when I recognised a well-known book maker in the hotel lobby I
went and put a tenner on an unnamed filly by William the Third
out of Mitrovitza for the three-fifteen race.  I suppose the
fact of the animal being nameless was what attracted
me.”

“No, came in fourth, the most irritating thing a horse
can do when you’ve backed it win or place.  Anyhow, I
know now that I’m not Lady Befnal.”

“Well, yes, it has rather cleared me out,”
admitted the identity-seeker; “a florin is about all
I’ve got left on me.  The lobster Newburg made my
lunch rather an expensive one, and, of course, I had to tip that
boy for what he did to the Kestrel-Smith locks.  I’ve
got rather a useful idea, though.  I feel certain that I
belong to the Pivot Club; I’ll go back to town and ask the
hall porter there if there are any letters for me.  He knows
all the members by sight, and if there are any letters or
telephone messages waiting for me of course that will solve the
problem.  If he says there aren’t any I shall say:
‘You know who I am, don’t you?’ so I’ll
find out anyway.”

“Of course,” said the lady, when he hinted at the
obstacle, “there’s my fare back to town, and my bill
here and cabs and things.  If you’ll lend me three
pounds that ought to see me through comfortably.  Thanks
ever so.  Then there is the question of that luggage: I
don’t want to be saddled with that for the rest of my
life.  I’ll have it brought down to the hall and you
can pretend to mount guard over it while I’m writing a
letter.  Then I shall just slip away to the station, and you
can wander off to the smoking-room, and they can do what they
like with the things.  They’ll advertise them after a
bit and the owner can claim them.”

Jerton acquiesced in the manœuvre, and duly mounted
guard over the luggage while its temporary owner slipped
unobtrusively out of the hotel.  Her departure was not,
however, altogether unnoticed.  Two gentlemen were strolling
past Jerton, and one of them remarked to the other:

His promenade carried him out of earshot at the critical
moment when he was about to disclose the elusive identity. 
The Lady Who?  Jerton could scarcely run after a total
stranger, break into his conversation, and ask him for
information concerning a chance passer-by.  Besides, it was
desirable that he should keep up the appearance of looking after
the luggage.  In a minute or two, however, the important
personage, the man who knew, came strolling back alone. 
Jerton summoned up all his courage and waylaid him.

“I think I heard you say you knew the lady who went out
of the hotel a few minutes ago, a tall lady, dressed in
grey.  Excuse me for asking if you could tell me her name;
I’ve been talking to her for half an hour;
she—er—she knows all my people and seems to know me,
so I suppose I’ve met her somewhere before, but I’m
blest if I can put a name to her.  Could
you—?”

“Yes, she’s the Lady Champion at golf in my part
of the world.  An awful good sort, and goes about a good
deal in Society, but she has an awkward habit of losing her
memory every now and then, and gets into all sorts of
fixes.  She’s furious, too, if you make any allusion
to it afterwards.  Good day, sir.”

The stranger passed on his way, and before Jerton had had time
to assimilate his information he found his whole attention
centred on an angry-looking lady who was making loud and
fretful-seeming inquiries of the hotel clerks.

“Has any luggage been brought here from the station by
mistake, a dress-basket and dressing-case, with the name
Kestrel-Smith?  It can’t be traced anywhere.  I
saw it put in at Victoria, that I’ll swear. 
Why—there is my luggage! and the locks have been tampered
with!”

Theophil Eshley was an artist by profession, a cattle painter
by force of environment.  It is not to be supposed that he
lived on a ranche or a dairy farm, in an atmosphere pervaded with
horn and hoof, milking-stool, and branding-iron.  His home
was in a park-like, villa-dotted district that only just escaped
the reproach of being suburban.  On one side of his garden
there abutted a small, picturesque meadow, in which an
enterprising neighbour pastured some small picturesque cows of
the Channel Island persuasion.  At noonday in summertime the
cows stood knee-deep in tall meadow-grass under the shade of a
group of walnut trees, with the sunlight falling in dappled
patches on their mouse-sleek coats.  Eshley had conceived
and executed a dainty picture of two reposeful milch-cows in a
setting of walnut tree and meadow-grass and filtered sunbeam, and
the Royal Academy had duly exposed the same on the walls of its
Summer Exhibition.  The Royal Academy encourages orderly,
methodical habits in its children.  Eshley had painted a
successful and acceptable picture of cattle drowsing
picturesquely under walnut trees, and as he had begun, so, of
necessity, he went on.  His “Noontide Peace,” a
study of two dun cows under a walnut tree, was followed by
“A Mid-day Sanctuary,” a study of a walnut tree, with
two dun cows under it.  In due succession there came
“Where the Gad-Flies Cease from Troubling,”
“The Haven of the Herd,” and “A-dream in
Dairyland,” studies of walnut trees and dun cows.  His
two attempts to break away from his own tradition were signal
failures: “Turtle Doves alarmed by Sparrow-hawk” and
“Wolves on the Roman Campagna” came back to his
studio in the guise of abominable heresies, and Eshley climbed
back into grace and the public gaze with “A Shaded Nook
where Drowsy Milkers Dream.”

On a fine afternoon in late autumn he was putting some
finishing touches to a study of meadow weeds when his neighbour,
Adela Pingsford, assailed the outer door of his studio with loud
peremptory knockings.

“Oh, I don’t know what kind,” snapped the
lady.  “A common or garden ox, to use the slang
expression.  It is the garden part of it that I object
to.  My garden has just been put straight for the winter,
and an ox roaming about in it won’t improve matters. 
Besides, there are the chrysanthemums just coming into
flower.”

“I imagine it came in by the gate,” said the lady
impatiently; “it couldn’t have climbed the walls, and
I don’t suppose anyone dropped it from an aeroplane as a
Bovril advertisement.  The immediately important question is
not how it got in, but how to get it out.”

“If it was anxious to go,” said Adela Pingsford
rather angrily, “I should not have come here to chat with
you about it.  I’m practically all alone; the
housemaid is having her afternoon out and the cook is lying down
with an attack of neuralgia.  Anything that I may have
learned at school or in after life about how to remove a large ox
from a small garden seems to have escaped from my memory
now.  All I could think of was that you were a near
neighbour and a cattle painter, presumably more or less familiar
with the subjects that you painted, and that you might be of some
slight assistance.  Possibly I was mistaken.”

“I paint dairy cows, certainly,” admitted Eshley,
“but I cannot claim to have had any experience in
rounding-up stray oxen.  I’ve seen it done on a cinema
film, of course, but there were always horses and lots of other
accessories; besides, one never knows how much of those pictures
are faked.”

Adela Pingsford said nothing, but led the way to her
garden.  It was normally a fair-sized garden, but it looked
small in comparison with the ox, a huge mottled brute, dull red
about the head and shoulders, passing to dirty white on the
flanks and hind-quarters, with shaggy ears and large blood-shot
eyes.  It bore about as much resemblance to the dainty
paddock heifers that Eshley was accustomed to paint as the chief
of a Kurdish nomad clan would to a Japanese tea-shop girl. 
Eshley stood very near the gate while he studied the
animal’s appearance and demeanour.  Adela Pingsford
continued to say nothing.

“How observant you are,” said Adela
bitterly.  “You seem to notice everything.  As a
matter of fact, it has got six chrysanthemums in its mouth at the
present moment.”

The necessity for doing something was becoming
imperative.  Eshley took a step or two in the direction of
the animal, clapped his hands, and made noises of the
“Hish” and “Shoo” variety.  If the
ox heard them it gave no outward indication of the fact.

“If any hens should ever stray into my garden,”
said Adela, “I should certainly send for you to frighten
them out.  You ‘shoo’ beautifully. 
Meanwhile, do you mind trying to drive that ox away?  That
is a Mademoiselle Louise Bichot that he’s begun on
now,” she added in icy calm, as a glowing orange head was
crushed into the huge munching mouth.

“Since you have been so frank about the variety of the
chrysanthemum,” said Eshley, “I don’t mind
telling you that this is an Ayrshire ox.”

The icy calm broke down; Adela Pingsford used language that
sent the artist instinctively a few feet nearer to the ox. 
He picked up a pea-stick and flung it with some determination
against the animal’s mottled flanks.  The operation of
mashing Mademoiselle Louise Bichot into a petal salad was
suspended for a long moment, while the ox gazed with concentrated
inquiry at the stick-thrower.  Adela gazed with equal
concentration and more obvious hostility at the same focus. 
As the beast neither lowered its head nor stamped its feet Eshley
ventured on another javelin exercise with another
pea-stick.  The ox seemed to realise at once that it was to
go; it gave a hurried final pluck at the bed where the
chrysanthemums had been, and strode swiftly up the garden. 
Eshley ran to head it towards the gate, but only succeeded in
quickening its pace from a walk to a lumbering trot.  With
an air of inquiry, but with no real hesitation, it crossed the
tiny strip of turf that the charitable called the croquet lawn,
and pushed its way through the open French window into the
morning-room.  Some chrysanthemums and other autumn herbage
stood about the room in vases, and the animal resumed its
browsing operations; all the same, Eshley fancied that the
beginnings of a hunted look had come into its eyes, a look that
counselled respect.  He discontinued his attempt to
interfere with its choice of surroundings.

“Mr. Eshley,” said Adela in a shaking voice,
“I asked you to drive that beast out of my garden, but I
did not ask you to drive it into my house.  If I must have
it anywhere on the premises I prefer the garden to the
morning-room.”

“Cattle drives are not in my line,” said Eshley;
“if I remember I told you so at the outset.” 
“I quite agree,” retorted the lady, “painting
pretty pictures of pretty little cows is what you’re suited
for.  Perhaps you’d like to do a nice sketch of that
ox making itself at home in my morning-room?”

But the artist marched out of the garden.  In a couple of
minutes he returned, laden with easel, sketching-stool, and
painting materials.

“Do you mean to say that you’re going to sit
quietly down and paint that brute while it’s destroying my
morning-room?” gasped Adela.

“I don’t see what standing you have in the
matter,” said the artist; “you can hardly pretend
that it’s your ox, even by adoption.”

“You seem to forget that the cook has neuralgia,”
said Eshley; “she may be just dozing off into a merciful
sleep and your outcry will waken her.  Consideration for
others should be the guiding principle of people in our station
of life.”

“The man is mad!” exclaimed Adela
tragically.  A moment later it was Adela herself who
appeared to go mad.  The ox had finished the vase-flowers
and the cover of “Israel Kalisch,” and appeared to be
thinking of leaving its rather restricted quarters.  Eshley
noticed its restlessness and promptly flung it some bunches of
Virginia creeper leaves as an inducement to continue the
sitting.

“I forget how the proverb runs,” he observed;
“of something about ‘better a dinner of herbs than a
stalled ox where hate is.’  We seem to have all the
ingredients for the proverb ready to hand.”

“I shall go to the Public Library and get them to
telephone for the police,” announced Adela, and, raging
audibly, she departed.

Some minutes later the ox, awakening probably to the suspicion
that oil cake and chopped mangold was waiting for it in some
appointed byre, stepped with much precaution out of the
morning-room, stared with grave inquiry at the no longer
obtrusive and pea-stick-throwing human, and then lumbered heavily
but swiftly out of the garden.  Eshley packed up his tools
and followed the animal’s example and
“Larkdene” was left to neuralgia and the cook.

The episode was the turning-point in Eshley’s artistic
career.  His remarkable picture, “Ox in a
morning-room, late autumn,” was one of the sensations and
successes of the next Paris Salon, and when it was subsequently
exhibited at Munich it was bought by the Bavarian Government, in
the teeth of the spirited bidding of three meat-extract
firms.  From that moment his success was continuous and
assured, and the Royal Academy was thankful, two years later, to
give a conspicuous position on its walls to his large canvas
“Barbary Apes Wrecking a Boudoir.”

Eshley presented Adela Pingsford with a new copy of
“Israel Kalisch,” and a couple of finely flowering
plants of Madame Adnré Blusset, but nothing in the
nature of a real reconciliation has taken place between them.

It was a hot afternoon, and the railway carriage was
correspondingly sultry, and the next stop was at Templecombe,
nearly an hour ahead.  The occupants of the carriage were a
small girl, and a smaller girl, and a small boy.  An aunt
belonging to the children occupied one corner seat, and the
further corner seat on the opposite side was occupied by a
bachelor who was a stranger to their party, but the small girls
and the small boy emphatically occupied the compartment. 
Both the aunt and the children were conversational in a limited,
persistent way, reminding one of the attentions of a housefly
that refuses to be discouraged.  Most of the aunt’s
remarks seemed to begin with “Don’t,” and
nearly all of the children’s remarks began with
“Why?”  The bachelor said nothing out
loud.  “Don’t, Cyril, don’t,”
exclaimed the aunt, as the small boy began smacking the cushions
of the seat, producing a cloud of dust at each blow.

The child moved reluctantly to the window.  “Why
are those sheep being driven out of that field?” he
asked.

“But there is lots of grass in that field,”
protested the boy; “there’s nothing else but grass
there.  Aunt, there’s lots of grass in that
field.”

“Oh, look at those cows!” exclaimed the
aunt.  Nearly every field along the line had contained cows
or bullocks, but she spoke as though she were drawing attention
to a rarity.

The frown on the bachelor’s face was deepening to a
scowl.  He was a hard, unsympathetic man, the aunt decided
in her mind.  She was utterly unable to come to any
satisfactory decision about the grass in the other field.

The smaller girl created a diversion by beginning to recite
“On the Road to Mandalay.”  She only knew the
first line, but she put her limited knowledge to the fullest
possible use.  She repeated the line over and over again in
a dreamy but resolute and very audible voice; it seemed to the
bachelor as though some one had had a bet with her that she could
not repeat the line aloud two thousand times without
stopping.  Whoever it was who had made the wager was likely
to lose his bet.

“Come over here and listen to a story,” said the
aunt, when the bachelor had looked twice at her and once at the
communication cord.

The children moved listlessly towards the aunt’s end of
the carriage.  Evidently her reputation as a story-teller
did not rank high in their estimation.

In a low, confidential voice, interrupted at frequent
intervals by loud, petulant questionings from her listeners, she
began an unenterprising and deplorably uninteresting story about
a little girl who was good, and made friends with every one on
account of her goodness, and was finally saved from a mad bull by
a number of rescuers who admired her moral character.

“Wouldn’t they have saved her if she hadn’t
been good?” demanded the bigger of the small girls. 
It was exactly the question that the bachelor ha' WHERE id = 'd00a72c9-4c8f-44a9-9e4f-e77bd3c50827';
