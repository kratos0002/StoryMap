woods. On the open moor the chase is not always
successful. Not seldom one may drive ponies
from miles away to within sight of the open gate,
and then something may arouse their mistrust,
may cause them to break away, and the work has
to be done over again. But, all things considered,
the chase on the moor is a picnic compared with
driving ponies out of the woods. In the open one
has the great advantage of being able to view oneâs
quarry from a distance, and formulate beforehand
a plan of campaign. But in the woods one must
search and search until the ponies are chanced
upon, and then stick tenaciously to their heels
until a capture is effected. In the denser parts,
one may beat about all day, and although the
ponies may be near, and even heard and seen, yet
they may change their ground so evasively that
night may fall and still find them uncaptured.

It was not raining much when the colt-hunter
and his boy rode out one morning, but the sky
gave every promise of a downpour later on.
âWet skins for us to-day, Tom,â said his father,
as he donned an old mackintosh, and a wide-brimmed
hat, which would divert the rain from
his neck. Like other people who are out in all
weathers, he had no use for caps, which in heavy
rain let the water trickle down oneâs back. Both
riders had bread and cheese in their pockets, for
they might be out all day, if they were not
fortunate in the chase. It had been arranged that
they should meet the agister, who wished their
help in locating and catching some yearlings and
older ponies. At this time of the year ponies are
caught in some numbers, and sent to the autumn
and winter sales.

The colt-hunter, by long experience and a
good memory for the forms and hues of ponies,
knew most of the many hundreds in the forest,
and their pedigrees. He was acquainted also with
the likely places where a wanted pony might be
found at any time of the year.

The hunters, with a cheery good-bye to Mother
and Molly, rode some distance across the moorland
and through the rides in the woods, skirted bogs,
and then made their way up a stone-strewn hillpath
to the south, past the spot where the young
airman, flying from the training-ground on Beaulieu
Heath, had stooped at a great white cross of
gravel, marked out on the hillside, and had nose-dived
to the ground, crumpling up his machine
and breathing his last in the arms of a visitor
camping near by. Father and son rode across the
barren plateau of Blackdown; to the east the
great tumulus stood dark and plain on the skyline,
but in front of them Wood Fidley was almost
obscured by driving clouds of rain-mist coming
from the south-west.

When they reached the main road, they found
the agister waiting for them. He had on his
buckled hat, but his official coat was hidden under
his horsemanâs cloak. He also foreboded bad
weather and a long drive through the woods.
They crossed the roadânow firm and smooth,
very unlike its stone-strewn surface during a dry
summerâtook a winding path over the moors,
and so into the woods.

The colt-hunter led the way into the deepest
recesses, where great oaks and beeches leaned
one against the other, while the ground was encumbered
with undergrowth. As they slowed
down to a walk, they saw ponies, half-hidden by
the bushes, stealing away. âThereâs one of
those weâre after,â said the agister, âand thereâs
another.â

Skewbald was not one of the wanted animals,
but of course he was not to know that, and made
off with the rest. It was now raining hard, the
wood full of driving mist, and the going very
heavy. The fugitives had the best of it, for the
ridden ponies sank below their fetlocks in the
wetter parts, while fallen branches, tangles of
briers and brambles, and drooping holly boughs
impeded their progress.

Tomâs pony, as keen as her rider, and not so
heavily weighted, made but little of the heavy
ground. She made straight for the fugitives
directly she heard or saw them, without waiting
for Tomâs directing hand on the reins, and several
times he was literally pulled from the saddle by
projecting boughs of holly, thorn, or oak. But
he held on to his mount, though torn, scratched,
and wet through. Then, when separated from
the other riders, he saw his opportunity, for he
came upon Skewbald and a wanted yearling which
had got away from them earlier in the day,
sheltering behind some dense holly bushes. Off
they went, with Tom close on their heels, and
after some amount of twisting and turning, the
fugitives came out on a grassy drive, with a gate
at the far end.

Skewbald made the pace for his companion, and
Tom put on a last spurt, trying to get even with
his quarry. Skewbald, as he approached the
barrier, glanced back at his pursuer, then, acting
under an overmastering impulse to escape, went
at the gate, cleared it, and was at once lost to
sight in a forest enclosure. Tom went right on,
charging full tilt into the other pony, which he
pinned against the gate, nearly knocking the wind
out of both animals. Before the yearling had
recovered himself Tom had him haltered, and a
safe prisoner.

In the New Year Skewbald again used his
jumping powers, and this time saved his life thereby.
He was feeding with two other young ponies
in a rough part of the forest, when a stray hound,
a deserter from the kennels, alarmed them. The
intruder, perhaps wishing for company, ran towards
them, but the ponies, not relishing his
advances, set off at a trot. The hound followed,
and the trot became a gallop. It chanced that
an artillery company, training in the forest, had
dug some pits which had not yet been filled in.
The ponies are, as a rule, quite able to take care
of themselves. They have a good sense of geography
and know the dangerous spots, as bogs
and pits, but, being driven away from the
training-ground, they were unaware of the existence
of the excavations.

As Skewbald fled, through gorse, tall heather,
and bog myrtle, the pony in front of him disappeared
with a cry, and, the next moment, he
found himself at the edge of a deep and wide pit,
with no time to turn. But the accident to his
companion had given him that fraction of a second
of preparation which was enough for his nerve
and muscle. He made a spasmodic leap, and just
managed to land his heels on the far side. The
third also leapt, but fell short.

When the hound, hearing the poniesâ moans,
looked down, he fled with a yelp of dismay. Later,
the huntsmen, searching for the truant, found
the two ponies, one dead and the other
grievously hurt.

In the rougher corners of the forest are the tents
of the gipsies, kept by authority as far as possible
from the more frequented beauty spots. One
comes across these encampments in little groups
of two or three wigwams, each being built on the
same principleâa framework of rods bent semi-circularly,
over which are thrown blankets and
any odd lengths of stuff that can be so used. At
one end is the âbaulkââa square tapering tower
of blanket or canvas open to the sky. This is the
chimney, the fire being built on the ground inside,
so that the inmates can prepare their food in the
dry, and enjoy the heat radiating into the tent
proper. Generally there is another tent beyond
the fire, so that the baulk is in the middle of the
erection.

On a fine Sunday, one sees the weekly wash
drying and bleaching on the bushes, children playing
with the dogs, the women cooking and the
men in their best clothes. Many before and after
Borrow, looking at the gipsy, have been impressed
by his fixity of type, his adherence to his mode of
life in a country gradually losing its open spaces,
and maintaining himself in face of restrictive and
sometimes oppressive regulations. To many the
standing marvel is that he can live at all outdoors,
not only in summer heat, but when frost is in
the earth, or when the ground shakes like a quagmire
and the ditches run like rivers. But nowadays
millions of men who came through the war
remember how in the course of their training, or
under the actual conditions of warfare, they slept
outdoors without even a gipsy tent, by fair and
foul, in wet and cold, and remember, too, their
astonishment that they suffered no harm, and,
bullets apart, thrived on the rÃ©gime.

But the gipsy has this in common with the town
dweller, that he, too, gets his living there; to the
town he must go to sell his produce or manufacture,
his flower or fern roots, his brooms, mats,
baskets, etc., and therefore a cart of some sort
is almost a necessity, and to draw the cart, a pony.
The forest pony is thus of great importance to the
forest gipsy; she is hardy, gets her own living, is
cheap to buy when young, and is a source of
wealth. Every forest gipsy is a potential breeder
and dealer; the pony is at once his passion and his
temptation. If he has no ponies to sell at the
autumn sales, there is less money to tide over the
winter.

Therefore the ponies wandering at will, unnoted
by their owners, as free to wander as the
wild creatures, have a great interest for the gipsy,
who regards the products of the forest as his lawful
tribute. The ploverâs eggs, the rabbit, hedgehog
and squirrel, the flowers and ferns, either
supply him with food or put money in his
pocket. But the pony is marked and tail-cut,
plain signs that it is the acknowledged and registered
property of its owner, and not to be appropriated
with impunity. Of course, by far the
greater number of gipsies are strictly honest in
regard to ponies, having learned like the rest of
us, from experience, that honesty is the best
policy; but to some an unmarked yearling pony
must be a temptation, when a branding-iron is
always present in the shape of any iron bar handy,
to be thrust in the fire kept constantly burning.

One autumn, on the edge of the forest just
outside a sheltering wood a small encampment
consisting of three gipsy tents and a caravan
nestled. As night fell the noise of people talking
and children playing ceased, for the gipsies go
early to bed, and rise betimes. The evening meal
had been eaten, the youngsters snuggled to sleep
in corners, and only a few men and women sat
around their fires smoking, for most had had a
long day going to town to sell their wares, and
were glad to seek repose.

Behind the tents, in a little blind lane with high
hedges ending at a gate, a mare was tethered.
She had been deprived of her foal and grieved
noisily, whinnying loudly ever and again. Away
on the moor ponies were grazing, and hearing the
repeated call of the bereaved mother, they put up
their heads for a moment. At last Skewbald,
now a two-year-old, and another pony of the same
age, a dull bay, could stand it no longer, and
sidled away from the herd in the direction of the
call. As they approached the silent tents, the
bay whinnied, and the mare responded so appealingly
that the two quickened their pace to a trot.
A big lad, lounging by the fire in the nearest tent,
looked out as they passed, and then crawled away
silently.

Skewbald and his companion went right up to
the mare, which tried hard to get away from her
tether, whinnying repeatedly, so that the two-year-olds
did not notice several dark figures creeping
towards them in the obscurity of the ditch.
But when a man stumbled, the two ponies made
off up the lane, only to be brought up short by
the gate. Their pursuers, close at their heels,
threw themselves at their necks, and soon the two
were haltered and secured.

An older man came out and examined the
captives. Then in no measured terms he abused
the captors for troubling to tie up a pony marked
like the skewbald, an animal of such striking
colour and pattern, and probably well known to
commoner, keeper, and agister. It was as good
as giving themselves up to the police to have it in
their possession for a moment, and he ordered the
crestfallen young fellows to release it at once.
This was done, and, with a stripe on his flank to
help him along, Skewbald was turned loose, and
made off towards the herd. Then the man gave
his attention to the bay, and pronounced him
ordinary enough to keep. But what were the
marks, if any? A lantern was brought, and the
capitals C. F. were found on the shoulder. A bar
was heated and it was not difficult to convert the
marks into O. E., though much to the discomfort
of the young bay. His tail marks were cut right
away as well. Then it was mooted whether the
pony should not be taken off at once, but this was
pronounced against, as likely to arouse the suspicion
of the police, if met with on the way. In
a day or two a huckster would come along with a
string of ponies, and among them the bay would
not attract notice.

But unfortunately for the gipsies, the agister of
the district, in tall hat with buckle in front, and
green coat with brass buttons, happened to ride by
next morning, on his way to clip the tails of some
ponies lately caught in.

As he passed, he noticed a young bay tied up
behind a tent. Now, the agister knew all the
ponies of his district, and many others in the other
districts as well. Ponies were a passion with him.
He knew them not only by their brands and their
colours, but by their shapes, gait, and size. A
pony once seen by him was never forgotten, and
he could recognize a wanted animal more than
half a mile away. He paused and scrutinized the
bay. Yes, that was Charles Finchâs two-year-old.
He had known it since its birth, and could not be
mistaken. Its tail was short, but not cut after the
fashion of any of the three forest districtsâin
itself a suspicious circumstance. He went closer
and read the letters O. E. No one he knew of in
the forest used such a brand. He got off his pony
and pressed his thumb in the lowest arm of the E,
and the pony winced.

That was enough for the agister, who turned to
several lowering but silent lads and men collected
in a group. âWho claims this pony?â he asked.
There was no answer. âI am positive itâs Charles
Finchâs pony. I shall take it with me if no one
objects;â and he tied the pony to his own, and
trotted away.

After he had done his business, he took the
pony to its owner, who, of course, recognized it
at once. âNow,â said the agister, âthis must
be stopped, or some rogues will give the gipsies
a bad name. Itâs your duty to prosecute the men
where I found the pony.â More he urged of
similar argument on old Finch, who heard him in
silence, and then flatly declined to take any proceedings
whatever, âI got the pony back, thanks
to ye; and much obleeged, Iâm sure. But I does
business with the gipsies, and most of âem are a
pretty good sort, and stick to their bargain. If I
prosecuted eâer a one of them, we should never get
on again. Iâm out for peace and quietness with
my neighbours, and I shanât let a pony come
between us.â And though the agister, having to
take an official view of the matter, protested, at
heart he felt there was much to be said for the
old manâs decision.

One wet afternoon towards the end of September,
the colt-hunter was in his stable mending some
harness. A yell from his youngest boy made him
jump, and he half-rose to see what was the matter,
but turned to his work again, as the boyâs little
sister let forth a shriek of delight. âUp to some
lark,â he muttered, then started, as both children
shouted at the top of their voices, âPeter!
Peter!â At the same instant the gate slammed,
the sound of a heavy boot was heard, and the man
tumbled outside, with the harness in his hand, to
find himself face to face with his eldest son in full
kit, tin hat, rifle and bandolier, and slung around
with billycans, etc., his boots still coated with
the white slime of the French hills.

âPeter!â âFather!â came out at one breath,
and as they grasped hands, their faces came together,
and they kissedâan odd thing, perhaps,
for forest men to do, but a son coming home from
the war unexpectedly was a thrilling moment, and
apt to break down even the reserve of a lifetime.
Peter, never forgotten for a single day, though
not always mentioned by his parents, suddenly
appearing, as if from the skies, was enough to
make his father gasp, unable to utter more than,
âWell, lad!â Then Mother, apprised, came
rushing forth, full of joy, and yet of wrath at not
being the first to salute her firstborn. She hugged
and kissed him until he begged for mercy. âThe
ladâs tired, Mother,â said the father; âletâs in,
soâs he can get his things off, and have a wash;â
and Peter wanted this last badly. How the
youngsters revelled in the tin hat and its dents,
while the father spent some time cleaning his sonâs
boots. âQuite a bit of France,â he said, as he
carefully swept the chalk off the bench into an
empty matchbox.

You should have seen Peter eat, when he got
among his motherâs tarts and cakes. It appeared
that he had the usual fourteen daysâ leave, of
which some time had already expired since he left
Havre. âWhat a shame!â exclaimed his mother.
âHowever, we wonât think of going away yet;â
and everyone was happy, though later on, as Peter
inquired for first one and then another of his old
schoolfellows, faces fell, and answer was made
sadly. After tea Peter felt a bit sleepy, so the
youngsters were sent off to play elsewhere, while
he stretched himself on a couch before the fire.
He had to be wakened for supper, but he didnât
mind, and said he would rather be called anything
than late for meals.

The next morning, of course, Peter wanted a
mount, and inquired what ponies were about.
âYou know the three in the stable,â said his
father; âand thereâs a blue roan mare in the
paddock, but sheâs not properly broken in yet, and
youâll find her rather skittish.â Whereupon
Peter, like a true forest lad, declared she would
be just the thing for him, and with the aid of his
two brothers, drove her into the yard and secured
her.

When he mounted in the paddock, the mare
treated him to a few plunges, which he did not
repress too sternly; and once out in the open,
went off at a great pace, her rider leaving her to go
where she listed, sure that she would keep away
from unsafe ground. But after letting off her
steam with a good run over the heavy ground, the
mare slackened her speed, and Peter could take
stock of the old familiar sights and sounds. Perhaps
the forest never looks so lovely as in autumn,
and especially when well soaked. The heather
still purpled the moorâa rich purplish-brown
flecked here and there with jewel-like pools. Towards
the uplands, and in the woods, the wet
bracken had changed its usual autumnal orange
for a rich sienna. Once Peter glimpsed a pony,
all deep chestnut, with mane and tail of the same,
a âself-colouredâ animal, hardly visible against
a bank of bracken. Only its movements betrayed
it, and then its foal, dark of hue, was discovered
where before it had been âlostâ in the obscurity
of a holly-brake.

Out in the open, the lad took all to his heart,
its beauty and its appeal. A green woodpecker
loped away from an ant heap where it had been
probing, and a covey of partridges scattered from
the ponyâs hoofs. The forest ponies, singly or in
groups, gave life and focus to the landscape, and
Peter saw that it was good.

Then as the mare started to run again, his hat
was twitched from his head by a holly-branch. He
reined the pony in, and essayed to pick up the hat
with his whip, but having no crook to the butt,
could not manage it. âHold on, old girl,â he
said, dismounting. But it was precisely at this
moment that Skewbald, now a three-year-old,
grazing at a little distance by himself, and feeling
lonely, gave vent to a loud call. The grey
whinnied, and began to move off, just as Peter
retrieved his hat, then, as he pulled on the reins,
she kicked sharply, getting the lad on the right
shin. There was a sharp crack, and Peter let go
the reins with a grunt, stood motionless a moment,
and then slithered gently to the ground. As he
did so and disturbed the broken leg, he shouted
with pain, and the mare, already making off, increased
her pace, the reins dangling from her
neck.

A girl was bowling along a forest road on a
bicycle. Joan Barton, V.A.D. nurse in the forest
hospital, had changed out of her uniform, and was
taking advantage of her spell off to get some open-air
exercise. She admitted to herself, as she spun
along, that her own Surrey commons, beautiful as
they are, could not compare in extent and wildness
with the forest. She noted how the road
wound, and led the eye over the moors and hills,
and what a fine surface mere sand and gravel
made, resilient and mudless in spite of recent heavy
rain. As the forest people say, the more it rains,
the better the going. Much better than in dry
weather, when the surface gets loose and covered
with stones.

Presently a grey pony, saddled yet riderless,
and standing by a dead tree a little from the road,
caught her eye.

She looked right and left for a rider, but saw
no one. Then, acting on an impulse, she got off
her bicycle, and went up to the pony. It moved
as she came close, and she saw that the reins were
held on a snag. âFunny way to tie up a pony,â
she said half-aloud; she knew something about
horses, and had acted as groom in a remount
stable while waiting for a vacancy in a hospital.

Some distance away was a herd of ponies
scattered over the moor. Among them she noticed
one patterned in bright chestnut and white, with
the passing thought, that she had not before seen
this striking coloration among all the forest pony
hues. She went to her bicycle and stood scrutinizing
the landscape, but she saw no one. Then her
attention was drawn to a patch of white like a
piece of paper dangling on a bush. But as she
looked she saw the white patch wave to and fro
like a flag, and with a sudden jump of the heart
she realized that it was a flag, and spelling out
letters. She knew the code, being an enthusiastic
leader of Girl Guides, and watched the flag spell
out the letters h-e-l-p. That was enough for Joan.
Close to where she stood, a pony track meandered
in the direction of the signal, and mounting her
bicycle she bumped along it, almost falling off in
her anxiety to watch the flag. It disappeared, but
again showed itself wagging to and fro, then
wavered and fell. She had to get off her bicycle,
and pushed it hurriedly along. There behind a bush
lay Peter, his face wrinkled with pain, yet full of
relief at the welcome sound of the girlâs approach.
He was the first to speak. âMorning, miss;â
and he made shift to smile. âMy pony got me
on the right tibia. But a clean fracture, I think.â
Peter got this out all in a breath. He had had
enough warning of the girlâs approach to concoct
his speech, and was rather proud of his knowledge
of anatomy picked up in the first-aid class. Joan
smiled too, pleased to find her new patient collected
and cheerful. âBeen here long?â she
asked. âNot more than an hour, miss. I live
over there,â he went on, âbut itâs a matter of
three or four miles away.â âAll right,â said
Joan, âbut your leg had better go in some sort
of splints before we can think of your being
moved.â

Then in response to a certain shade of anxiety
on Peterâs face, she added, âItâs all right, I wonât
hurt you more than I can help. Iâm a nurse at a
V.A.D. hospital.â âA nurse,â chortled Peter;
âit seems Iâm having all the luck.â

âWell,â she laughed, âit doesnât seem like it.
I donât think Iâll take the puttee off. Iâll look
for some stuff for splints.â She hunted round for
some straight sticks, and Peter lent her his great
knife, which he had to open for her, so that she
could remove the knots. Then she put on the
splints, using Peterâs other puttee. âDonât be
afraid to make a noise if I hurt you,â she said,
but Peter made no sign of pain except for a grunt
or two. As she worked she talked. âIt was
clever of you to signal,â she remarked. âCleverer
of you, miss, to see and understand,â responded
Peter; ââ¯âtwas a good job Mother put out white
hankies for me this morning. My khaki ones went
into the washtub.â

Joan told him of the grey pony on the hill, and
Peter recounted the cause of his accident. âHow
long, nurse, before Iâm able to go back?â he
asked.

âYouâll not be much use under two months.
Your stay in Blighty will be longer than you
expected.â

âWhatâll my sergeant say?â chuckled Peter.
Joan made a cushion of bracken for the injured
leg and put another armful under his head.
âNow,â she said, âIâll go back to the road for
help.â

âBut whatâs that, nurse?â exclaimed Peter,
and Joan also heard a manâs call. A moment later
a waggon laden with logs emerged from a wood,
some distance away, a man and a boy in attendance.
Joan ran across to them, and explained the
situation. âWhy, that must be young Peter,â
said the man; âI met him yesterday, all loaded
up, on his way home. Weâll do what we can,
miss, but our wood-waggon ainât no use, you see,
for itâs got no bottom. Whatâll we do about
shifting him on to the road?â

But the boy was not a Scout for nothing. This
was his moment, and he made the most of it.
âWhy, dad,â he said, âthatâs easy. You cuts
down two poles, and I gets them two sacks weâve
got on the seat, and makes holes in the corners.
Then we puts the poles through the holes to make
a stretcher, and carries him up to the road.â The
elders agreed that this was feasible, but without
enthusiasm, for fear of engendering pride in the
young.

The man got his axe and cut down two young
birches, remarking that he sâposed âtheyâ
wouldnât mind his cutting green wood for once,
while Joan and the boy prepared the sacks. When
the stretcher was ready, they laid it on the ground
beside Peter, and carefully placed him in it, packing
his legs and feet with bracken, so that the
injured limb should not be jolted.

Then the man taking the poles at the head, and
Joan and the boy a pole each at the other end,
they marched slowly up the hill, Peter insisting
on their keeping step, and giving an imitation of
his sergeantâs pronunciation. Once, as they
crossed a little forest bridge, he gave the order,
âBreak step,â but they refused, for fear of jarring
his leg, whereupon he promised them all C.B.

When nearly at the road, they heard the noise
of an approaching car, and all shouted together,
the boy nearly letting go in the excitement of the
moment. The driver both heard and saw. He
stopped, and matters were soon arranged. The
patient was carefully deposited in the car with
Joan as attendant. The boy was to go back to
fetch Joanâs bicycle and ride it to the hospital,
then, returning, would ride the grey mare back to
Peterâs home. Joan was much averse to this
arrangement, protesting that the pony had done
enough mischief already that day. But the boy
grinned, for he could ride anything in the forest
barebacked, and his family mantelpiece was
adorned with cups and trophies won in the forest
junior competitions. Remarking that he wouldnât
âcome to no harm,â he dashed down the hill
for the bicycle, while the man, after seeing that
the grey pony was properly tied, returned to his
waiting team.

Then came Armistice Day, or rather, in this
quiet corner of Britain, Armistice Night, for in
the forest was not to be seen such ebullition of
spirits as in Regent Street, where, for instance,
two middle-aged clergymen, with ribbons in their
clerical hats, danced along the pavement playing
tin whistle-pipes. But a great fire was to be lit
on the hill above Peterâs home, and all that afternoon
men and boys had been carting up logs and
branches gleaned from the woods.

Most of the local forest people were there, including
Tom, Molly, and the two small children.
Peter, now getting about with a stick, having discarded
his crutches, was sent up in the pony-trap,
the hill being deemed too steep for him.

When the fire died down and people were beginning
to disperse, a girl wheeling a bicycle
passed Peter and his family. Tom let out a shout:
âMiss Barton!â and she stopped. She had seen
Peter several times since he had left hospital;
indeed, he said his leg wouldnât get well unless
she continued to take a friendly interest in his case.
So she had paid visits, when not on duty, Peter
and she sitting in the porch, looking on to the
forest, talking and reading.

Peter was saying that the hill was too steep and
rough to cycle down at night, and his leg felt well
enough for him to walk down if Miss Barton would
lend him an arm in case he stumbled. Tom would
walk the bicycle down, which he was glad to do,
though directly he was out of sight he got on, and
nearly came a cropper avoiding some people going
home.

So Joan and Peter went down together, taking
a little path he knew of, and on the way they saw
the dim forms of ponies on either side, all with
heads down, browsing. Only one, the nearest,
looked up, and snorted as they passed. It was
Skewbald, and Peter suddenly found his tongue,
for neither he nor Joan had had much to say to
one another.

âWhy, thatâs the beggar that upset my applecart,â
he said, and proceeded to narrate for the
twentieth time how the call of the three-year-old
had caused his accident. Then with a flash of
inspiration he continued: âLucky for me that he
called when he did.â

âYes,â said Joan, though she felt in her bones
what was coming; âyou mean he got you a long
leave.â

âI mean,â declared Peter, though his heart
thumped, and he had a strange difficulty in articulating,
âthat if it hadnât happened, we might
never have met.â And so on, but as this is a tale
about ponies and not people, it will suffice to say
that before they reached the bottom of the hill,
they were Joan and Peter to one another, and that
soon after Peter was demobilized the wedding
took place.

The summer had been hot and rainless, and the
beginning of August found the moorland of the
forest drier than the oldest commoner had known
it. Boggy places which had formerly to be skirted
with care were now firm under foot. The tussock
grass was white and sear, the fern orange and
brown, while the leaves of the oaks were eaten
by myriads of caterpillars into delicate lace-like
filigree.

The blackberries withered without ripening,
except where they grew in the meadow bottoms,
still green, though the streams dwindled, until in
the gravelly, quick-running parts, there was
hardly enough water for the troutlets to scuttle
past into the deeper pools.

One midday, on the road between Southampton
and Lymington, a tramping sailor was resting by
the roadside. He lit his pipe, and being a careful
man, blew at the match before he threw it down.
Then he rose, and continued his journey. But
the end of the match still glowed, and the dry
grass in contact with it, fanned by the wind, began
to smoke, and then to ignite with a tiny flame,
which crawled along the ground, until it came to
the dry stump of a fir, its base littered with bits
of bark and dead branches. These sputtered, and
the fire began to spread. The wayfarer had passed
on unheeding, for he was facing the wind, and
therefore received no warning of what was happening
behind him.

Down under the big trees the colt-hunter and
his two boys were cutting the fern for stable
bedding. He had the right to get all he wanted,
though authority decreed that he was not to pick
and choose, not to cut only where the fern grew
thick and tall. He must clear his way steadily,
even where it was sparse and stunted. This year
it was pretty short everywhere. The man used a
scythe, the boys were armed with sickles. At
intervals they drew the fodder into small heaps
for carting.

The father straightened himself and sniffed.
âSeems like burning. Another heath fire, I
expect. Glad if it burnt up the gorse, but sometimes
it burns up other things.â âWhat things,
dad?â asked the younger boy. âTrees which we
want for firewood, and barns, ricks, and sometimes
homes. Run up the hill, sonny, and see if you can
make out whereabouts the fire is.â The boy did
not run; it was too hot. As he walked away, a
shrill whinny was heard, then repeated again and
again. âMy word!â exclaimed the man; âthat
pony is some excited. Seems as if it came from
the farm. Whatâs a forest stallion doing there?â
Just then in the quiet air a prolonged whistle was
heard. The father laid his scythe at the foot of a
tree. âCome on, Tom. Somethingâs the matter,
or mother wouldnât have blown the whistle.â It
was an agreed-on signal. Back the two went, and
the younger boy caught them up, saying he had
seen a great cloud of smoke, and it seemed right
over the house.

âNonsense,â said his father; âmore like five
miles away.â They walked quickly along the
forest avenue of gnarled oaks, tall beeches, and
odds and ends of hollies of no especial shape.
âLook at all those ponies outside the gate!â exclaimed
Tom. There was a restless, pawing, snorting,
whinnying troop of mares and youngsters,
but all with head over or turned towards the closed
gate. When the three reached the farm, they saw
Skewbald standing on the straw heap, surrounded
by pigs, poultry, and ducks. Mother was standing
at the garden gate with the baby in her arms. The
skewbald whinnied when he saw the arrivals and
stamped impatiently. The man sniffed again
and muttered: âThat fire seems closer than I
thought. Howâd he get in?â he called. âHe
jumped it,â his wife replied. âI saw him.â

They opened the gate, and the ponies surged
in after them. Tom ran to slide back the big
door, and had just time to flatten himself against
the wall, when Skewbald thundered past, followed
by the herd, right across the meadow to the ford,
which they crossed. Then they turned, faced the
wind, and snuffed the air.

âBoys,â the father was saying, âthis fire must
be nearer than we want. The smokeâs getting
thicker every minute. Both of you get a broom,
and letâs get beyond the wood.â

The homestead was enclosed to the south-west
by groves of hollies and a plantation of firs. If
these began to burn, sparks might set the thatched
roof and hayricks on fire. Beyond the wood was
a level tract of heather and gorse. The fire might
not have caught this, and there might yet be time
to stop it spreading to the wood. When they got
beyond the trees, the gorse bushes at the far end
of the open space were burning with a loud crackling,
and on the ground a line of smoke, with here
and there a sputter of flame, showed that the fire
was crawling towards them.

Then commenced a fight with the advancing
enemy, in the face of sparks and thick, pungent
smoke. The boys worked bravely, but the wind
fanned the embers, and, often, after they had
beaten down the flames they had to run back, and
put out a fresh outburst. Then, where the grass
and heather was longer, the fire began to burn
more vigorously.

âGet back, boys; weâll wait and fight it where
itâs shorter,â said the father. âHooray!â Tom
exclaimed; âhere they come!â First a man on
a pony, then a boy on a bicycle, two more friendly
helpers in a trap, all coming to help as fast as they
could; and later, a motor-car from the big house
on a hill miles away, and crammed with helpers,
hooted its arrival.

Some had brooms or beaters, and some took
branches, but all fell to with a will, yet as
they worked, the cloud of smoke seemed to get
blacker and heavier. Instead of mounting into
the sky like a pillar of cloud, it hung about their
heads until they could hardly breathe. The sky
became black, and still the fire defied their efforts.

A boy looked up and yelled, âRain!â He had
felt a drop on his face. Someone felt another, but
they were not leaving anything to chance, and
smacked steadily away at the smouldering
herbage.

Then the rain began to come down steadily until
everyone had a wet shirt. When the danger was
over the volunteers began to move off, saying they
must be going, in spite of entreaties to come back
to the farmstead. They knew that the wife with
her baby would be sore put to it to entertain so
many. But one or two who lived farther off were
persuaded to come along, and to these the colt-hunter
expatiated a dozen times on the fortunate
circumstance of the ponies running from the fire,
and taking the road through the wood to the farm.
As Tom said, the skewbald rang the firebell for
them.

Skewbald, now a four-year-old, had in late
August succeeded to the leadership of the company
with which he had been running. The
stallion which had lorded it over the herd had
been âcaught in,â and Skewbald had stepped
into his place as the acknowledged superior of the
young males. It was destined to be a temporary
supremacy, for, as a skewbald, he could not be
welcomed as a breeding stallion; his coloration
was too pronounced. Self-coloured browns and
bays were considered to be truer to the forest type.
Skewbaldâs lot was to be that of a pit pony.

No young stallion challenged him to battle
twice, for Skewbald possessed, besides strength,
a spirit, a quickness of movement together with a
power of deciding rapidly, and when roused, a
fighting temper which boded ill for an enemy.

As a future pit pony he had the merit of not
being too tall, but he was perfectly proportioned,
and his carriage and ease of movement proclaimed
his fitness as an instrument of strength and speed.

Patterned as he was in bold chestnut and cream-white,
his coat did not show the high lights
rippling over the muscles of a bay or black, but the
slinging of his barrel between his shoulders and
flanks, the arch of his neck and withers, the action
of his fore-legs, and the tension of his hocks,
marked him as beyond the ordinary.

His mane, very bushy, and like his tail waved
as with a ladyâs curling-irons, was white nearly to
the regions of his ears, where it turned to chestnut
with an intervening streak of purplish-black. His
long, ample tail, carried in a drooping curve, was
white above and dark below. His on-side had one
great chestnut patch covering most of his barrel
and flank, and extending below the hock. From
a distance, this side was deceptive, because the
great brown blotch looked like a pony standing
end on. The offside had the neck and face chestnut,
and a spot of the same on his barrel smaller in
area than on the other side, and leaving his hind-leg
white.

But although he looked and acted like a born
leader, kept the yearlings and two-year-olds in
their places, rounded up the mares and saw that
all were on the move when the herd was changing
quarters, and, last but not least, glanced continually
round the horizon for enemies in the shape of
agisters or other colt-hunters, it must not be supposed
that he decided all the movements of his
company.

Some of the mares were years older than he, and
knew the forest infinitely betterâthe grassy lawns
and bottoms, the bare âplains,â wind-swept in
hot weather, and the great woods with sheltered
recesses in drenching rain. So they, as a rule,
took the initiative and decided when to move and
where to go. But the direction once indicated,
Skewbald took charge and acted as convoy.

In the herd was an old rusty-black mare with
white forehead blaze and off hind-sock. She had
been broken in for riding and was shod, as might
be seen by her footprints, the imprint of the
double line of the shoe showing out among the
single, nearly circular curves of the unshod
ponies.

In her time she had assisted in the âcatching
inâ of many a pony, and now that she was again
in the forest, although she had lost the timidity
of the uncaught beasts, she made up for this by
the wiliness of one who knew the ways of man.
Time and time again the colt-hunters wished her
far away, when they found her in company with
ponies they wanted. They might manÅuvre the
group at a gentle trot across the moor, but just as
they approached a tempting open gateway, the
mare would check, toss her head, snort, and break
away at a gallop, followed by the rest, in spite of
shouts and cracking of whips.

She was also a persistent wanderer, a âlane
haunter,â âlane creeperâ or âromeoâ (an
atrocious Forest pun)âthat is, a pony which
escapes from the forest into the lanes to munch
the sweet grass of the hedgerows. This is considered
one of the worst vices in a forest pony,
because she leads others with her. Then the
agister may impound the culprits, and the owners
have to pay for any depredations, as fence-breaking
and crop-spoiling, that may have been committed.
Prizes are offered for well-bred ponies
in good condition, but are likely to be withheld
unless the agister certifies that the selected beasts
are no âlane haunters.â Some think that the
introduction of alien blood has brought into
existence a type of animal unsuited to the rigours
of the forest, too delicate to flourish on the meagre
fare, and therefore inclined to wander away in
search of richer food.

By a mischance, the mareâs last foal had died
soon after birth, and because of this, perhaps, she
was this season unsettled, restless, and still more
inclined to wander. The summer, too, had been
hot and dry, so the forest pasturage was meagre
and scanty, the ponies having to search continually
for their fare.

Whereas a herd keeps usually within an area of
four or five square miles, this mare, whether owing
to the above reasons or her innate tendency to
wander, during this season kept the company on
the move by her restlessness and persistence, so
that without hurry, or causing fatigue to the
youngest, and feeding as they went, the forest
was explored from end to end. She was Skewbaldâs
favourite mare; when she went ahead, he
followed, and the herd fell in behind, in the usual
column of route.

She knew the forest roads and lanes both as a
riding pony and a âlane creeper,â the short-cuts,
the hunting bridges, the deep recesses of the
woods, and the narrow winding pony paths across
the upland âplains,â as if she had the ordnance
map in her head.

After whiling away a hot afternoon cooling
their fetlocks at Potterne Ford, the herd spent
the evening on Blackdown near the great round
barrow, and in the early morning, before dawn,
the mare led the way southward over bare ridge
and through thick woods, until coming out on
the Beaulieu road they found the manor gate left
open by a sleepy carter, and trooped down in the
early morning, past Beaulieu Abbey gateway,
pausing at the margin of the beautiful estuary
with its wooded banks, and yachts anchored at
the bend. All was quiet except for the yelping
of a few black-headed gulls questing for food
among the pools, fringed with tawny seaweed left
by the tide.

Skewbald advanced to sample the water, then
snorted with disgust, and retreated, driving his
company on to the road again. The old mare had
a good drinking-place in mind, and led them
up the street until they were stopped by Hatchet
Gate. The gatekeeper, just getting up, heard the
clatter of hoofs. âMore lane haunters,â she
said; âI must let them into the forest again, or
they will get into trouble.â She hastened down,
the herd passed through, trotted on to Hatchet
Pond and slaked their thirst.

They spent some days on the great aerodrome
of Beaulieu Heath, whence, in the days of war,
the aeroplanes buzzed on their way across Blackdown
to attack an imaginary enemy plane marked
as a cross of white gravel on the ground. Now all
was quiet, rows of huts and buildings stood silent
and deserted. The lane creeper took the road
again and led the troop towards Lymington.
Down the hill they went, past the monument to
the gallant admiral of the many virtues duly set
forth, and hesitated at the toll-bridge, where the
collector, waiting awhile to see if any human was
following with the toll dues, drove them back.
They turned up the road bordering the left bank
of the Lymington River, and soon found themselves
in the forest again, but on the other side,
for they forded the river, went over Sandy Down
and crossed the Brockenhurst road, where a sorrel
mare nearly lost her foal, which insisted on nosing
a chunk of bread oblivious of a charabanc of excursionists.
They scattered over Setley Plain,
where are the two tumuli with intersecting rings,
and crossing under the railway, wandered about
the uplands above Sway, with its tall tower, a
landmark visible far out to sea. Here, sunning
themselves by a narrow forest railway bridge,
they encountered another herd, a mere group,
with that rarest of forest poniesâa white stallionâin
charge. He was white, of course, because
of his age; his backbone stood up and his ribs
showed; but though he snuffed the air, there was
no trouble, for the old fellow had no thought of
showing fight, nor was this the season for dissension.
All Skewbald wanted, for his part, was to
get his company over the bridge, and when the
others understood this, they made way willingly
enough.

The wanderers straggled with many stoppages
over the great open moors and uplands of the
Rhinefield Walk. In the forest a âwalkâ is not
a pathway, but a district of several square miles,
formerly presided over by a ranger, an office now
abolished.

They crossed Black Knowl, forded the pretty
stream gurgling over its gravelled bed, and were
soon cropping the fine greensward of beautiful
Balmer Lawn. Here Skewbald had a tussle with
a young iron grey who thought the lawn belonged
to him. After a short passage of arms, Skewbald
disabused him of this notion, and the youngster
retired hurriedly.

The herd wandered through the picturesque
drives leading from the lawn, and drank at the
little pond on the golf-links, set like a jewel on
the breast of the moor.

The young grey stallion had some cause for
jealousy, for Skewbald noticed a white mare with
a great blotch of jet black on her neck and fore-quarters,
and she took his eye, being spotted himself;
but she refused to leave her beloved pastures;
she was no wanderer, and never had been known
to stray more than half a mile from her birthplace,
a field by the lawn.

Then rain came at last, and the mare crossed
the river again and led her party into the woods.
They wandered through the glade of the Queen
Bower, with its great beeches, crossed the Blackwater,
and so into the thick woods of Vinney
Ridge. Here they had a fright one midday, for
the baying of hounds, tootling of horns, and
tramping of hoofs dismayed all but the old mare,
who had often ridden with the buck-hounds. She
led her party, which were inclined to scatter,
down a drive away from the noise. Later in the
week the rain ceased, and leaving the woods, they
crossed the Ober and slowly climbed the hill to
Wilverley Post, the young foals even daring to
rub themselves against the âNaked Manââa
dead tree reduced to a bare trunk and a couple
of armlike branches stretched out imploringly.
Here they crossed the black tarred road between
Southampton and Bournemouth. It was Sunday
afternoon and the cars were almost in procession,
so numerous were they, the noisy little sidecar
predominating; but the ponies took small account
of wheels. Horns might blow and chauffeurs
curse, but the mares, and especially the foals,
were not to be hurried. As the herd crossed head
to tail, so that there was not room for even a
motor-cycle to pass, the road looked like Piccadilly
at its narrowest part, when the policemen
stop the traffic. All sorts of cars were there,
from Fords to a Rolls-Royce; great charabancs
full of trippers, who threw crumpled paper balls
at the ponies to hurry them up, but without avail,
and the drivers, remembering the warning signs
put up by the R.S.P.C.A., had to curb their
impatience until the last foal had crossed.

The ponies spread themselves over Clay Hill,
went down into the bottoms and up by the steep
road from Holmsley Station into Burley, and
drank at the pond fringed with hollies, on the
golf-links, where one Christmas the scarlet berries
hid the leaves, as the golfers, if they notice such
things, can testify.

They cropped the lawn outside the school,
until the noise of the children coming out sent
them into the woods. They missed Burley,
fortunately, for one of the old forest pounds
stands close by, crossed the road at Vereley,
passed the gipsy encampment, and then reaching
another black road leading to Ringwood, spread
out over the open ground of Picket Post, one of
the finest spots in the forest, because of its altitude
and its views towards the sea. Here one can
see clearly the flanks of the forest hills rising from
the level bottom like hills out of a lake. The
ponies munched the sweet grass on the lawn with
its beautiful little tumulus crowned with hollies,
but unfortunately dwarfed by the great modern
house close by.

Then the unsatisfied maternal instincts of the
old mare surged up within her, an irresistible
impulse to action, and she did what horses, dogs,
and other animals will doâset her face towards
her birthplace. She had been born at Brook, and
old memories of her present surroundings may
have suggested to her the route to the village.
At any rate, the herd were soon travelling slowly
to the north-east. Over Handy Cross Plain they
went, through Kingâs Garden and so to Stoney
Cross, where, from the hill leading down to the
dell of the Rufus Stone, one gets the fine view
across to Brook and beyond.

The mare wandered about several days visiting
the haunts of her youth; then again her
loss came upon her, and she started off across
country, for the spot where last she had seen
her foal.

All this time the wanderings of the ponies had
not been unnoted. People owning ponies had
seen them here and there, and in passing a friendâs
house would call and remark, âI saw your chestnut
mare over by Castle Malwood the other day,â
or the owner of Skewbald might be greeted with,
âYour four-year-old seems a bit of a wanderer.â
If the herd strayed on to a public road where
the agisters might catch them, and involve their
owners in expense, a forest man would spend a
little time chivying them back into the forest.
So they had committed no damage in their fleeting
disappearances from the forest proper. They
had not been impounded, and apparently they
were free as air, yet the owner of any pony there,
with a little trouble and inquiry, could ascertain
its whereabouts and could get it either personally
or by deputy.

The herd came back over Emery Down, the
great gaps in its wooded sides showing where the
Canadian gangs had cleared the timber during
the war. Cleared it in a lazy way, the forest
men remarked, for instead of bending to cut
the tree at its base, they had left many stumps
waist-high. But then, timber is cheap in the
West.

Missing Lyndhurst, by devious ways the ponies
came out on the golf-links, where a yearling got
a smack on the flank from the ball of an impatient
golfer. They crossed the road, and tried the
sweet grass of Pondhead. It was a bright Saturday
afternoon, and a boy with a camera, catching
sight of Skewbald, tried for a snapshot. He
stalked him backwards and forwards, manÅuvring
for a good pose and lighting, until the stallion got
suspicious and annoyed. Disdaining the bridge,
he jumped the streamlet, mounted the hill a few
paces, and called loudly. The mares, not unmindful
of the intruder with his flashing camera,
understood. Without undue haste they gathered
their foals, crossed the little bridge and took the
path up the hill, Skewbald standing sentinel until
he saw they were all on the move, then, pressing
forward, he overtook the head of the column, and
led the way.

Soon there was a quarter of a mile of ponies of
all colours, following the meanderings of the
path, the mares with lowered heads, foals trotting
to left and right. Last of all went an old white
mare with a black sucker silhouetted against her
side. It was a pretty picture. Even in the distance
the energetic action of Skewbald could be
noted; his tossing mane proclaimed him the
leader. It was a picture, and the boy could not
help snapping it, although he knew the distance
was too great.

The old mare no longer led the way, for the
herd had reached its home pasturage. Indeed,
Skewbaldâs owner had already noted his return.
The ponies crossed the road looking down on
Longwater, and passed a night among the lush
bottoms. The next day they wandered eastwards
over Matley Heath. As they approached
the railway embankment to cross under the forest
viaduct, they passed an area of a few acres, which
would have looked strangely familiar to millions
of men of military age. During the war the
trench mortar force had used the place as a training-ground,
and at every few yards a hole gaped,
several feet across and a yard deep.

It was early in September, and Skewbaldâs
owner, who had seen him only once during the
summer, but had had reports of his having been
found in various parts of the forest from agisters
and keepers, decided that he would âcatch inâ
the four-year-old, and get a good price for him
as a pit pony. He settled to do the job himself,
and, with two neighbours who volunteered
to give up a Saturday afternoon, started off in
the direction where the herd had been seen last.
It was fine and clear (âvisibility very goodâ),
and Skewbald was plainly in view more than a
mile away. The ponies were scattered along a
ridge above a narrow valley, the floor of which
was largely occupied by a deep bog.

It was decided to keep out of sight as long as
possible, and come at the stallion from over the
hill, in the hope that he could be driven down to
the bog and surrounded.

But if the horsemen could see Skewbald at a
distance, because of his bold colouring, he could
detect them by reason of his good sight, and
though they had apparently gone right away, he
remained uneasy, marching from one mare to
another. Presently he heard the muffled beat of
hoofs on turf, and called loudly to his companions.
When the three hunters reached the crest of
the hill and looked down, Skewbald and several
mares, with their offspring, were trotting away
towards the head of the valley.

There was nothing for the hunters to do but to
go for it at their best speed. Skewbald, they
knew, like any stallion true to his herd, would not
leave the mares, if he could help it. When they
tired was the chance to get him. But as the
horsemen galloped, the trot of the fugitives
changed to the quicker step also, and though the
riders gained on the herd, Skewbald was always
on the far side, protected, as it were, by the
column of mares, foals, and younger ponies.

Some of the foals soon stopped, and, with their
mothers, fell out of the chase. The other mares
and youngsters carried on, and the pursuit went
on along the ridge, until the bog was turned, and
Skewbald led the way back on the other side.
Then the ponies with him began to slacken, and
the pursuersâ hopes ran high, but Skewbald increased
his speed, and leaving his fatigued company,
galloped on alone. Some little distance
ahead, the bog narrowed considerably, and here a
causeway of gravel had been constructed. Along
this the stallion dashed, and ascended the hill to
where the rest of his leaderless herd had collected.
They began to move as he approached, and
stretching into a gallop, they went with him, this
time down the valley, and being untired, began
to increase the distance from their pursuers.
âHang it!â cried the owner; âwhen these
are tired, and he gets to the other lot after
theyâve breathed, he may keep this up all the
evening.â

Then things happened. One of the riders
essayed to cut off a corner by crossing a marshy
bit. His pony hesitated, and when struck, put
her feet together and shot her rider into the bog.
The others halted, and with shouts of laughter,
watched the muddy figure thrashing about, then,
as he sank deeper, hastily took measures to help
him out. They tossed him a rope and fastened
their end to one of the ponies. Then chaffing
him about keeping his legs straight, they shouted,
âHold tight, Jim!â and setting the pony going,
out came the man with a great squelch. âWell,â
said Jim, as he looked at himself ruefully, âmy
own fault entirely. I ought to have known better
than beat a forest pony baulking at boggy
ground.â

It was getting late, and Skewbald was out of
sight. They decided to abandon the chase and
try again another day.

Then the rain came, filling the bogs and flooding
the streams, and the ponies, according to their
habit, left the open moorlands for the woods,
where they were invisible, save to the forest
keepers, clad in khaki with brass buttons bearing
the crown and stirrup, the latter device derived
from the gigantic stirrup hanging in the court hall
at Lyndhurst.

Skewbaldâs owner made inquiries. A keeper
had seen the stallion in a great wood of oaks and
beeches. The next Saturday afternoon the three
riders again set off. The rain had ceased, and the
sun shone, although the going was heavy. In
the woods the forest paths were churned into
quagmires, but on pony-back it does not matter
if the forest be a bit damp. The ponyâs legs get
the mud.

Skewbaldâs company were grazing in the open,
but in the shelter of the wood, bordered with
groves of silver birches. From afar the hunters
thought out a plan of action. âBest go back,â
said one, âand come at them from behind.
Pâraps we can drive them down the moor and
away from the woods.â As the riders, after a
long detour, were approaching their quarry,
having got almost to the confines of the wood,
a party of jays set up a clamour. âNo use going
quietly now,â grumbled the leader; âbetter
push on as fast as we can.â The ponies had heard
the raucous noise of the jays, and then the trample
of hoofs. When the hunters emerged from the
wood, they were in time to see the last of the herd
dashing in among the trees, hundreds of yards
ahead.

âCome on, lads,â was the cry, and the pursuers
did their best to overtake the fugitives,
who had chosen their country with skill, for they
had fled into a great wood with plenty of undergrowth,
and trees so thick that no background of
sky gave the ponies away. Hollies grew in dense
masses, and clinging honeysuckle and brier impeded
progress. Quick going was impossible, and
every dense brake had to be examined for a lurking
beast. Mares and colts they overtook, and
once they thought they had found Skewbald, but
it was an old white mare running among the trees.
As they got nearer the river, the wood grew wilder
and more difficult, while their ponies sunk below
the fetlocks in the soft stuff. âLetâs go into the
drive and see if we can head them off,â suggested
a faint-hearted one. In the sticky drive were
more ponies, but no Skewbald. With the old
black mare he was sheltering behind a thick clump
of hollies, ready, if he heard the riders approaching,
to move quietly off.

Night came on and the riders gave up the chase in
disgust, vowing that they had had the worst of luck.

After this, the services of the colt-hunter were
sought. He listened to the tale of Skewbaldâs
evasions. âSeems a speedy one, and artful.
Iâll get him, never fear.â

The next morning, the colt-hunter, going out
to shoot a rabbit for dinner, was delighted to see
Skewbald with his mares, placidly wandering on
the moor outside his holding. The rabbit must
wait, and he returned to collect his two helpers
and get the ponies ready. When the three were
mounted, he sent the boy and girl by a circuitous
route to get behind the herd. He himself rode
through the gate which opened on the moor, and
went towards the woods, as being the most
difficult part of the country.

Presently, as he watched the herd, he saw the
stallion raise his head, and a moment later Tom
appeared on the ridge beyond the moor, and came
down the hill at a trot. Skewbald called to his
mares, and set off at a gallop towards the far end
of the moor, where it was crossed by the stream.
The man saw the herd rapidly dwindling in the
distance, and noted with satisfaction that the boy
made no attempt to rush the fugitives, but contented
himself with trotting along the edge of the
moor in the direction they had taken. âSaving
his mount,â the father muttered, and then heard
faint sounds in the distance, which he knew came
from Molly, who had crossed the stream, and with
shouts and gestures was stopping the fugitives.
The ponies halted; then, as their new pursuer
rode at them, they turned, and fled in the opposite
direction. Skewbald had an eye to the hill, its
summit covered with trees, but Tom on guard
saw a suggestion of breaking away, and stopped
it with waving arms and fiendish yells. As the
ponies, apparently free from strenuous pursuit,
slackened to a trot, the colt-hunter met them,
and turning them, quietly followed. Tom and his
sister closed in, and the ponies, in an invisible
net, were shepherded towards the gate, left wide
open. Skewbald, restless and suspicious, turned
and faced the riders gently trotting towards him
at some distance. This left the old âlane
haunterâ in front, and as she approached the
opening, she shied, and broke away, keeping near
the hedge, where there was no rider to forestall
her. The herd turned also, and prepared to
follow, but an unexpected intervention checked
them. The two smallest children had been
awakened by the bustle of getting the ponies
ready, and guessed what was afoot. They had
not been asked to help, but thinking there might
be some fun, they dressed, slipped out, and hid
in the hollies a hundred feet from the gate. As
the mare came towards them they darted out,
and, brandishing sticks, rushed at the herd, meanwhile
letting off blood-curdling shrieks. The old
mare, indeed, used to children, brushed past, but
the ponies following were brought to a standstill,
and as the youngsters jumped into the air, their
arms and legs going all ways at once, making of
themselves frantic instruments of movement and
sound, the nerves of the ponies failed them, Skewbald
turning tail with the rest, and the three
riders, closing in, had no difficulty in passing their
quarry through the gate and into the paddock.
âWell done, kids!â called the father. âClose
the gate! Letâs ride âem into the yard before
they know where they are.â But Skewbald had
turned after passing through the gate, and the
herd was now at the far end of the field. The
hunters tried all ways to get the ponies into the
stable yard, but in vain; they tore past the inviting
opening, but enter they would not. Then
the mare left outside, hearing the trampling of
hoofs, and feeling lonely, gave a loud whinny.
Skewbald caught it amid the noise of tumult. He
broke from the herd, dashed across the field,
through the gravelly ford, then, as he neared the
gate, collected himself, cleared it at a bound, and
joined his partner.

âMy word!â exclaimed the colt-hunter, with
a rueful laugh. âCanât that skewbald jump!
One of you open the gate so that the other ponies
can get back into the forest again. All our
trouble for nothing. Well, weâd better go and
have breakfast.â

The colt-hunter began to fear that his old skill
was deserting him, for in spite of his efforts, the
four-year-old was not yet in the stable yard. At
the first opportunity, the man went out again, this
time alone. The old mare gave the alarm, on
seeing him, and the whole herd was soon trotting
away from their pursuer, who, as they were going
directly from his open gate, refrained from pressing
them too closely, hoping that he might be
able to turn them before long. But the mare led
the way right across the open ground towards the
river where it flowed between densely wooded
banks. They entered the wood, and the pursuer
increased his pace, for in such country unridden
ponies can move much more quickly than a rider.
Directly he got into the deep wood, he had to
twist, and break back for feasible routes, and go
slowly for fear of being wiped off his seat by a
branch. He passed several of the ponies, but
they were not what he sought, and as he got
deeper in the recesses of the wood, he became
puzzled. After some tedious wandering, scratched
and torn by holly, brier, and bramble, he confessed
himself at a loss. âThey may have crossed
the stream again,â he considered. âThis thick
stuff is the worst of all to find him in. I wish I
had my old dog.â Nell had had to be destroyed,
after an accident, but when in her prime had
shown a capacity for following the fugitives as
they threaded through the woods, and on reaching
them, by barking loudly, indicated their
position to the pursuers. The man gave up the
chase reluctantly, promising himself to try again.

He did so the next evening with his boy and
girl. The herd was in sight a mile down the moor.
âWhen we get near them,â said the father, âwe
must hustle, and head them off from the woods.â
But the ponies took the alarm at sight of the
riders, and the old mare, without waiting for the
chase to become hot, set off at full speed for the
woods, followed by Skewbald and a few other
ponies. âWe shall lose them,â said the colt-hunter,
and sure enough, after much wandering
and thrashing the woods, darkness set in, and the
hunters returned, weary and empty-handed.

Again and again they tried to head off Skewbald
from his protector. The mare, from being
disturbed, got so nervous that, at the first sight
of the hunters, she would dart for the coverts,
followed by Skewbald. The colt-hunter cudgelled
his brains in vain for a plan to secure the stallion,
and began to sigh for the good old days when the
forest men, mounted and blowing horns, encircled
a wide area, then with outcry and galloping,
drove all the ponies grazing therein into a
great pound. But, as he said, that would have
made an end of his bread and cheese.

The sun, breaking through the mist of a September
morning, shone on a grassy knoll by a
great wood, where a man was cooking his breakfast.
He was tall, ruddy, with a clear-cut profile
and black hair cut close at the back. He wore a
soft shirt, breeches, and stout boots. His wide-brimmed
hat, jacket, and a towel hung on a bush
close by. As he made his preparations he whistled
âThe Star-Spangled Banner.â

Breakfast in the woods presupposes camping;
no tent, however, showed itself, but a few paces
off was an erection in the form of a lean-to, of
dead branches interlaced with brushwood, and the
whole well thatched with heather and bracken.
Looking up from within, no peep of sky could be
seen; the shack was, in fact, watertight.

The breakfast utensils were placed on a newspaper
spread on the turf. A fire of sticks crackled
in a hollow. Three aluminium saucepans were on
the fire, and the man was stirring porridge in one.
âNearly ready,â he muttered; ânow for the
bacon.â He opened a package, took out two
rashers, placed them in a small frying-pan, took
the porridge-pan off the fire, removed the detachable
handle and fitted the latter to the frying-pan,
which he placed on the fire, now a mass of
glowing embers.

Then he found sugar, poured in milk from an
aluminium milk-can, and ate his porridge out of
the pan while watching the rashers. When these
were turned, he took an egg from each of two
egg-shaped aluminium cases, broke the shells,
and poured the contents on the rashers. When
cooked to a turn, he took the frying-pan off the
fire, and ate the bacon and eggs out of it. Then
one of the remaining saucepans boiled, and he
made coffee. The bread and coffee he took out
of waterproof bags, butter from a small aluminium
box. His first course had been of blackberries
picked from a bush near by. Blackberries are not
plentiful in the New Forest, but occasionally they
are found of a size and lusciousness rarely equalled
elsewhere.

After finishing his breakfast, he took out a
cigar, and began to smoke. As he mused he
talked to himself for company. âGuess this is
some quiet spot: not many birds except woodpeckers,
jays, stonechats, and meadow-pipits,
though I saw a whinchat, a redstart, and two
wheatears yesterday. But I expect they were on
migration. Nothing much to be heard in English
woods after the first week in June. And except
for the kingfisher, they canât hold a candle for
colour against our cardinals and bluebirds.

âAnd no beasts worth mentioning. No bears,
wolves, moose, or porcupines, and only rarely
one sees a fox or a hedgehog. Of course, the deer
show themselves now and then, and there are
always the ponies. A viper here and there, perhaps,
but no rattlers.

âWell, thank goodness, there are no mosquitoes,
and however warm it is, the heat doesnât
amount to much. And the views! Superb!
That walk over Emery Down was delightful. I
wish Sadie was here. Plenty of room in that shack,
and how she would enjoy it. Hard lines, marrying,
and having to leave oneâs wife almost on the
church step.â Here he broke off, and took out
a letter, which he read as one does when there is
no need to hurry, turning back occasionally to
earlier passages, though the letter already seemed
well thumbed. Then he replaced the missiveâwhich
was a long one, and called forth a smile
now and thenâin its envelope, and set himself to
wash up, grumbling at the tenacity of the
remnant of porridge; for once he had forgotten to
fill the pan with water. The bacon rinds and
crumbs he left for any furred or feathered epicures
which might be about; the egg-shells, tea-leaves,
and other rubbish he put down a hole.

Then he began to pack. He had no blankets,
heavy and not too efficient conservators of heat.
His only bed covering was an eiderdown quilt,
which went into marvellously small compass. He
had no less than three air-pillowsâa tiny one for
his head, one in the form of a ring for his hip, and
a pleated one for his shoulder. These and a pair
of plimsolls, with his sleeping suit, went into his
ground-sheet, which he rolled into a long bundle
round a light fishing-rod, with a strap attached to
either end so that he could sling it like a rifle.

The other details of his equipmentâbath and
bucket, of the thinnest and lightest material,
which had been emptied of water and hung up to
dry; milk-can, collapsible cup, plates, saucepans,
each of which he wrapped in paper before putting
one within the other, not forgetting to place the
handle insideâwent into his waterproof knapsack
with food-bag, tins, etc. In a little bag he
put comb, brush, and mirror, all of diminutive
proportions, from which the greater part of the
handles had been removed, in order to reduce
weight, for this was a walking tour, where every
ounce makes a difference. Even a pocket Primus
would have added too much to the burden of the
day. And in the forest, firewood is plentiful.

Once he ceased packing and raised a tiny prism
glass of the most recent pattern, which was slung
round his neck, quickly to his eye, in order to
identify a passing bird. âHave learned quite a
lot about English birds,â he said to himself.
âWhen I go back I shall be able to tell the
Western Reserve Ornithological something about
the English warblers. The nightingaleâs song is
very fine, Iâll admit, especially at night, but give
me the blackcap in clear daylight. He beats the
band.â

When everything was packed, he turned towards
the shack. âBetter leave it as it is,â he
muttered; âI might come back this way and put
in another night.â

As he turned into the woodland path, the
bushes parted and a man dressed in tattered khaki
emerged. He carried a coil of rope over his
shoulder and in his hand a stout cudgel. âGot
the time on ye, sir?â he asked. The camper took
out a gold watch. âI make it nine oâclock. But
I should have thought that you forest men were
in no need of watches with the sun shining.â
âOh, ay!â muttered the man in khaki evasively.
âAh, whatâs this?â he exclaimed, pointing to
the shack. âSleeping rough? Why, thatâs
punishable at the magistratesâ court,â he added
with a grin. âNot at all,â said the other. âI
have my permission, duly signed from Lyndhurst,
to camp in the forest, also a licence to fish in the
streams, although up to the present Iâve caught
nothing but minnows. This is how we camp out
West. Saves lugging a tent about.â âOh,â
said the man in khaki, âyou be an Amurrican;
I thought so, by your twang. What puzzles me,â
he continued, âis why you should be tramping
about here. Most of the Yankees at Winchester
never set foot in the forest. They see it all from
the car. But,â with a sneer, âpâraps you canât
afford it?â The American noticed, but answered
with a smile: âWhy, friend, I could afford it
very well, but all my life I have loved open spaces
and fresh air, and I like to do things for myself.
I am what you might call a cattle-farmer, and
have a ranch in the West.â

âIndeed,â said the other, âand how many
cattle might ye own?â âWell, I am not sure,
anyway,â answered the American, âbut I suppose,
if things are going all right, that my men
have charge of 10,000 head of stock.â âWell,
Iâm ââ,â exclaimed his questioner. âAnd to
think, if youâre worth all that money, you care
to sleep on damp ground with a bit of brushwood
overhead.â

âI said just now,â laughed the other, âthat
Iâm used to outdoor life. When I came over with
my regiment, we were sent to the camp at Winchester.
You know that city?â and the other
nodded. He did not deem it necessary to say that
the last stay he put in there was in the city gaol.
âWell, I got interested in this locality, because
there seemed room to move in it, as there is at
home; and in my spare time I used to come down
here and look about me. Then one afternoon
when I was sitting in the cathedral, while
hundreds of our men, from all over the States,
were being taken round in parties to see the
sights, I had some talk with a man and a boy who
looked in. They were cycling with camping
luggage, and were to spend a holiday in the forest.
I guess they were some novices, for I went outside
to see them off. Never saw such poor, ill-used,
overladen bicycles before or since. Afterwards
I got my knock in the big push, and they
sent me to the hospital at Brockenhurst, where
I saw more of the forest. Just now family
business is keeping me in London, so I thought I
would spend a few days down here, in my own
way.â

The man in khaki became effusive. He thrust
out a dirty tattered sleeve. âWe ought to be
pals, mister. See my wound stripes? Wipers,
Loos. Been through the lot and glad to be back
for good. I suppose you canât raise a drink for a
pore comrade? You gentlemen generally have
a whisky-flask on you.â

âNo, my friend,â replied the American.
âYouâll find no intoxicating liquor in this outfit.
Iâm a prohibitionist, what you call a teetotaller.â
Then, as waves of incredulity, derision, and horror
crossed the otherâs face, he added: âYouâll find
a lot more of us across the Pond. And now,
friend,â he continued, âIâve told you as much
about myself as if you were an agister, as I think
you call him. Why do you appear, like a jack-in-the-box,
and so anxious to know the time?â

âNot much of an agister,â grumbled the man.
âMiserable cusses, I calls âem, interfering with
a pore manâs living. I comes from Romsey way,
but settled down here since the war. A suspicious
lot,â he added surlily. âI drives cattle, carts
wood, breaks in horses, and thatâs what Iâm going
to do this morning,â and he held out the rope.
âAh,â said the American, âthat reminds me of
home. None of my cowboys ride anywhere without
a coil hanging to their saddles. They never
know when they may want to rope a steer or a
mustang.â âWell,â said the man in khaki,
âIâve heerâd tell that the forest people used ropes
in the old days, but they never do now.â

While talking, they had reached the edge of
the wood, and the road, thick with dust, lay before
them. âWell, friend,â said the American,
âyouâll be taking the road; I wish you good-day.
I am keeping to the forest paths.â

âWhy, mister,â said the man with the rope,
âyouâll lose yourself.â âNot with a good English
ordnance map,â answered the other, taking
from his breast pocket a folded map. As he did
so, a bulky pocket-book fell to the ground.
âThanks, donât trouble,â as the man in khaki
made a movement, and bending down himself,
picked up and restored his property to his pocket.

But the man with the cudgel was not to be
shaken off. In spite of the Americanâs obvious
reluctance to have his company, he declared that
he had plenty of time and that he would see him
a piece of the way. Once started, the intruder
on the visitorâs privacy became boastful of his
prowess and that of his companions in arms, and
began to decry the American forces, but his
hearer good-humouredly parried his clumsy onslaughts.

As they passed over the moor they came upon
a group of ponies. It was Skewbaldâs herd. He
was grazing, and as the two men passed within a
short distance, he raised his head and looked at
them. But, as they were on foot, and seemed to
have no ill designs on ponies, he turned again to
his own business.

âNow, mister,â said the man with the rope,
âyou Amurricans talk very big about lassooing
wild steers and hosses. What about giving us a
show of your skill? Letâs see you catch one of
these ponies.â

âNo, friend,â replied the American, putting
aside the proffered coil; âI donât rope other
peopleâs beasts without their permission, nor do
I wish to show off.â âAll right, mister, donât be
huffy about it,â said the man; âbut that there
stallionââindicating Skewbaldââis worth five
bob to me, if you can rope him. Joe Smith has
been wild to get him for weeks past, but the
skewbald has gone away every time. Only a rope
will get him. You might help a pore man,â he
urged with garrulous earnestness.

âWell,â hesitated the other, âthe ground is
soft, and I am not likely to hurt him, but this
rope is all wrong and may put me off. However,
I can try.â They walked on a little and the
American stopped and deposited his luggage at
the foot of a holly. He tied the noose and re-coiled
the rope to his liking. Then they walked back so
as to pass within a few yards of the stallion. The
man in khaki walked a pace or so behind the
other, gripping his cudgel. He breathed heavily,
looked around him and seemed excited. The
stallion raised his head suspiciously, turned, and
at the same moment the rope shot out and encircled
his neck. Before the pony knew what was
happening to him, the American, bending down,
was taking several turns of the rope round a
stump.

Then two things happened. The stallion,
making off, was brought up short and fell on his
side, half-choked by the tightening of the rope,
and at the same moment, the cudgel fell with a
thud on the head of the man bending at the rope.
He fell forward on his face without a cry. His
assailant looked around hurriedly, then took the
gold watch, pocket-book and loose cash, and
having picked up his stick, was making off without
a second glance at his victim.

But Skewbald struggling on the ground caught
his eye. âWhy,â he muttered, âI nearly forgot
the rope. Good job I didnât quite. Might have
give me away.â He dropped the cudgel, unwound
the rope from the stump, and approached
the stallion.

Directly the pressure of the noose was removed
from the ponyâs windpipe, he revived, and rose
to his feet breathing hard. Then as the man
reached him and took hold of the noose, he reared,
pulling his liberator off his feet, to fall beneath the
plunging hoofs. The stallion, seeing a persecutor
lying prostrate, and being full of anger at his
treatment, with a scream of fury, flew at him,
kicking and biting. Then he seized an arm in his
teeth ' WHERE id = '2caf1b69-d04b-48c2-a2b1-056af69d7ee4';
