UPDATE stories SET original_text = original_text || 'n the little village of Etretat, the men, who are all seafaring
      folk, go every year to Newfoundland to fish for cod. One night the little
      son of one of these fishermen woke up with a start, crying out that his
      father was dead. The child was quieted, and again he woke up exclaiming
      that his father was drowned. A month later the news came that his father
      had, in fact, been swept off the deck of his smack by a billow. The widow
      then remembered how her son had woke up and spoken of his father''s death.
      Everyone said it was a miracle, and the affair caused a great sensation.
      The dates were compared, and it was found that the accident and the dream
      were almost coincident, whence they concluded that they had happened on
      the same night and at the same hour. And there is a mystery of magnetism.”

“Perfectly, monsieur. I have discovered the secret. The circumstance
      surprised me and even perplexed me very much; but you see, I do not
      believe on principle. Just as others begin by believing, I begin by
      doubting; and when I cannot understand, I continue to deny that there can
      be any telepathic communication between souls; certain that my own
      intelligence will be able to explain it. Well, I kept on inquiring into
      the matter, and by dint of questioning all the wives of the absent seamen,
      I was convinced that not a week passed without one of them, or one of
      their children dreaming and declaring when they woke up that the father
      was drowned. The horrible and continual fear of this accident makes them
      always talk about it. Now, if one of these frequent predictions coincides,
      by a very simple chance, with the death of the person referred to, people
      at once declare it to be a miracle; for they suddenly lose sight of all
      the other predictions of misfortune that have remained unfulfilled. I have
      myself known fifty cases where the persons who made the prediction forgot
      all about it a week afterwards. But, if, then one happens to die, then
      the recollection of the thing is immediately revived, and people are ready
      to believe in the intervention of God, according to some, and magnetism,
      according to others.”

“Oh! my second story is a very delicate matter to relate. It
      happened to myself, and so I don''t place any great value on my own view of
      the matter. An interested party can never give an impartial opinion.
      However, here it is:

“Among my acquaintances was a young woman on whom I had never
      bestowed a thought, whom I had never even looked at attentively, never
      taken any notice of.

“I classed her among the women of no importance, though she was not
      bad-looking; she appeared, in fact, to possess eyes, a nose, a mouth, some
      sort of hair—just a colorless type of countenance. She was one of
      those beings who awaken only a chance, passing thought, but no special
      interest, no desire.

“Well, one night, as I was writing some letters by my fireside
      before going to bed, I was conscious, in the midst of that train of
      sensuous visions that sometimes pass through one''s brain in moments of
      idle reverie, of a kind of slight influence, passing over me, a little
      flutter of the heart, and immediately, without any cause, without any
      logical connection of thought, I saw distinctly, as if I were touching
      her, saw from head to foot, and disrobed, this young woman to whom I had
      never given more than three seconds'' thought at a time. I suddenly
      discovered in her a number of qualities which I had never before observed,
      a sweet charm, a languorous fascination; she awakened in me that sort of
      restless emotion that causes one to pursue a woman. But I did not think of
      her long. I went to bed and was soon asleep. And I dreamed.

“You have all had these strange dreams which make you overcome the
      impossible, which open to you double-locked doors, unexpected joys,
      tightly folded arms?

“Which of us in these troubled, excising, breathless slumbers, has
      not held, clasped, embraced with rapture, the woman who occupied his
      thoughts? And have you ever noticed what superhuman delight these happy
      dreams give us? Into what mad intoxication they cast you! with what
      passionate spasms they shake you! and with what infinite, caressing,
      penetrating tenderness they fill your heart for her whom you hold clasped
      in your arms in that adorable illusion that is so like reality!

“All this I felt with unforgettable violence. This woman was mine,
      so much mine that the pleasant warmth of her skin remained in my fingers,
      the odor of her skin, in my brain, the taste of her kisses, on my lips,
      the sound of her voice lingered in my ears, the touch of her clasp still
      clung to me, and the burning charm of her tenderness still gratified my
      senses long after the delight but disillusion of my awakening.

“When the day dawned she haunted me, possessed me, filled my senses
      to such an extent that I was not one second without thinking of her.

“At last, not knowing what to do, I dressed myself and went to call
      on her. As I went upstairs to her apartment, I was so overcome by emotion
      that I trembled, and my heart beat rapidly.

“I entered the apartment. She rose the moment she heard my name
      mentioned; and suddenly our eyes met in a peculiar fixed gaze.

“I sat down. I stammered out some commonplaces which she seemed not
      to hear. I did not know what to say or do. Then, abruptly, clasping my
      arms round her, my dream was realized so suddenly that I began to doubt
      whether I was really awake. We were friends after this for two years.”

“The conclusion I draw from it—well, by Jove, the conclusion
      is that it was just a coincidence! And then—who can tell? Perhaps it
      was some glance of hers which I had not noticed and which came back that
      night to me through one of those mysterious and unconscious —recollections
      that often bring before us things ignored by our own consciousness,
      unperceived by our minds!”

“Call it whatever you like,” said one of his table companions,
      when the story was finished; “but if you don''t believe in magnetism
      after that, my dear boy, you are an ungrateful fellow!”

All Veziers-le-Rethel had followed the funeral procession of M.
      Badon-Leremince to the grave, and the last words of the funeral oration
      pronounced by the delegate of the district remained in the minds of all:
      “He was an honest man, at least!”

An honest man he had been in all the known acts of his life, in his words,
      in his examples, his attitude, his behavior, his enterprises, in the cut
      of his beard and the shape of his hats. He never had said a word that did
      not set an example, never had given an alms without adding a word of
      advice, never had extended his hand without appearing to bestow a
      benediction.

He left two children, a boy and a girl. His son was counselor general, and
      his daughter, having married a lawyer, M. Poirel de la Voulte, moved in
      the best society of Veziers.

As soon as the ceremony was over, the son, daughter and son-in-law
      returned to the house of mourning, and, shutting themselves in the
      library, they opened the will, the seals of which were to be broken by
      them alone and only after the coffin had been placed in the ground. This
      wish was expressed by a notice on the envelope.

M. Poirel de la Voulte tore open the envelope, in his character of a
      lawyer used to such operations, and having adjusted his spectacles, he
      read in a monotonous voice, made for reading the details of contracts:

M. Poirel de la Voulte raised his spectacles with a motion that was
      peculiar to him whenever he finished reading a contract; and the three
      heirs of the defunct looked at one another without speaking, pale and
      motionless.

The other two bent their heads in sign of assent. He lighted a candle,
      carefully separated the pages containing the damaging confession from
      those relating to the disposition of money, then he held them over the
      candle and threw them into the fireplace.

And they watched the white sheets as they burned, till they were presently
      reduced to little crumbling black heaps. And as some words were still
      visible in white tracing, the daughter, with little strokes of the toe of
      her shoe, crushed the burning paper, mixing it with the old ashes in the
      fireplace.

Then all three stood there watching it for some time, as if they feared
      that the destroyed secret might escape from the fireplace.

I recalled this horrible story, the events of which occurred long ago, and
      this horrible woman, the other day at a fashionable seaside resort, where
      I saw on the beach a well-known young, elegant and charming Parisienne,
      adored and respected by everyone.

I had been invited by a friend to pay him a visit in a little provincial
      town. He took me about in all directions to do the honors of the place,
      showed me noted scenes, chateaux, industries, ruins. He pointed out
      monuments, churches, old carved doorways, enormous or distorted trees, the
      oak of St. Andrew, and the yew tree of Roqueboise.

When I had exhausted my admiration and enthusiasm over all the sights, my
      friend said with a distressed expression on his face, that there was
      nothing left to look at. I breathed freely. I would now be able to rest
      under the shade of the trees. But, all at once, he uttered an exclamation:

“She is an abominable woman,” he replied, “a regular
      demon, a being who voluntarily brings into the world deformed, hideous,
      frightful children, monstrosities, in fact, and then sells them to showmen
      who exhibit such things.

“These exploiters of freaks come from time to time to find out if
      she has any fresh monstrosity, and if it meets with their approval they
      carry it away with them, paying the mother a compensation.

“You think I am joking, romancing, exaggerating. No, my friend; I am
      telling you the truth, the exact truth.

He took me into one of the suburbs. The woman lived in a pretty little
      house by the side of the road. It was attractive and well kept. The garden
      was filled with fragrant flowers. One might have supposed it to be the
      residence of a retired lawyer.

A maid ushered us into a sort of little country parlor, and the wretch
      appeared. She was about forty. She was a tall, big woman with hard
      features, but well formed, vigorous and healthy, the true type of a robust
      peasant woman, half animal, and half woman.

“They tell me that your last child is just like an ordinary child,
      that he does not resemble his brothers at all,” replied my friend.
      “I wanted to be sure of that. Is it true?”

“Oh, no, oh, no, my poor sir! He is perhaps even uglier than the
      rest. I have no luck, no luck!

“They are all like that, it is heartbreaking! How can the good God
      be so hard on a poor woman who is all alone in the world, how can He?”
      She spoke hurriedly, her eyes cast down, with a deprecating air as of a
      wild beast who is afraid. Her harsh voice became soft, and it seemed
      strange to hear those tearful falsetto tones issuing from that big, bony
      frame, of unusual strength and with coarse outlines, which seemed fitted
      for violent action, and made to utter howls like a wolf.

I fancied she colored up. I may have been deceived. After a few moments of
      silence, she said in a louder tone:

“Why do you not wish to show it to us?” replied my friend.
      “There are many people to whom you will show it; you know whom I
      mean.”

She gave a start, and resuming her natural voice, and giving free play to
      her anger, she screamed:

“Was that why you came here? To insult me? Because my children are
      like animals, tell me? You shall not see him, no, no, you shall not see
      him! Go away, go away! I do not know why you all try to torment me like
      that.”

She walked over toward us, her hands on her hips. At the brutal tone of
      her voice, a sort of moaning, or rather a mewing, the lamentable cry of an
      idiot, came from the adjoining room. I shivered to the marrow of my bones.
      We retreated before her.

“Take care, Devil” (they called her the Devil); said my
      friend, “take care; some day you will get yourself into trouble
      through this.”

She was about to attack us, but we fled, saddened at what we had seen.
      When we got outside, my friend said:

And this is what he told me as we walked along the white high road, with
      ripe crops on either side of it which rippled like the sea in the light
      breeze that passed over them.

“This woman was once a servant on a farm. She was an honest girl,
      steady and economical. She was never known to have an admirer, and never
      suspected of any frailty. But she went astray, as so many do.

“She soon found herself in trouble, and was tortured with fear and
      shame. Wishing to conceal her misfortune, she bound her body tightly with
      a corset of her own invention, made of boards and cord. The more she
      developed, the more she bound herself with this instrument of torture,
      suffering martyrdom, but brave in her sorrow, not allowing anyone to see,
      or suspect, anything. She maimed the little unborn being, cramping it with
      that frightful corset, and made a monster of it. Its head was squeezed and
      elongated to a point, and its large eyes seemed popping out of its head.
      Its limbs, exaggeratedly long, and twisted like the stalk of a vine,
      terminated in fingers like the claws of a spider. Its trunk was tiny, and
      round as a nut.

“The child was born in an open field, and when the weeders saw it,
      they fled away, screaming, and the report spread that she had given birth
      to a demon. From that time on, she was called ''the Devil.''

“She was driven from the farm, and lived on charity, under a cloud.
      She brought up the monster, whom she hated with a savage hatred, and would
      have strangled, perhaps, if the priest had not threatened her with arrest.

“One day some travelling showmen heard about the frightful creature,
      and asked to see it, so that if it pleased them they might take it away.
      They were pleased, and counted out five hundred francs to the mother. At
      first, she had refused to let them see the little animal, as she was
      ashamed; but when she discovered it had a money value, and that these
      people were anxious to get it, she began to haggle with them, raising her
      price with all a peasant''s persistence.

“She made them draw up a paper, in which they promised to pay her
      four hundred francs a year besides, as though they had taken this
      deformity into their employ.

“Incited by the greed of gain, she continued to produce these
      phenomena, so as to have an assured income like a bourgeoise.

“Some of them were long, some short, some like crabs-all
      bodies-others like lizards. Several died, and she was heartbroken.

“The law tried to interfere, but as they had no proof they let her
      continue to produce her freaks.

“She has at this moment eleven alive, and they bring in, on an
      average, counting good and bad years, from five to six thousand francs a
      year. One, alone, is not placed, the one she was unwilling to show us. But
      she will not keep it long, for she is known to all the showmen in the
      world, who come from time to time to see if she has anything new.

My friend was silent. A profound disgust stirred my heart, and a feeling
      of rage, of regret, to think that I had not strangled this brute when I
      had the opportunity.

I had forgotten this story, when I saw on the beach of a fashionable
      resort the other day, an elegant, charming, dainty woman, surrounded by
      men who paid her respect as well as admiration.

I was walking along the beach, arm in arm with a friend, the resident
      physician. Ten minutes later, I saw a nursemaid with three children, who
      were rolling in the sand. A pair of little crutches lay on the ground, and
      touched my sympathy. I then noticed that these three children were all
      deformed, humpbacked, or crooked; and hideous.

I was filled with pity for her, as well as for them, and exclaimed:
      “Oh, the poor mother! How can she ever laugh!”

“Do not pity her, my friend. Pity the poor children,” replied
      the doctor. “This is the consequence of preserving a slender figure
      up to the last. These little deformities were made by the corset. She
      knows very well that she is risking her life at this game. But what does
      she care, as long as he can be beautiful and have admirers!”

And then I recalled that other woman, the peasant, the “Devil,”
      who sold her children, her monsters.

When I arrived, they gave me a princely reception, which at once awakened
      suspicion in my mind. They fired off rifles, embraced me, made much of me,
      as if they expected to have great fun at my expense.

During the dinner the mirth was excessive, exaggerated, in fact. I
      thought: “Here are people who have more than their share of
      amusement, and apparently without reason. They must have planned some good
      joke. Assuredly I am to be the victim of the joke. Attention!”

During the entire evening every one laughed in an exaggerated fashion. I
      scented a practical joke in the air, as a dog scents game. But what was
      it? I was watchful, restless. I did not let a word, or a meaning, or a
      gesture escape me. Every one seemed to me an object of suspicion, and I
      even looked distrustfully at the faces of the servants.

They called to me: “Good-night.” I entered the apartment, shut
      the door, and remained standing, without moving a single step, holding the
      wax candle in my hand.

I heard laughter and whispering in the corridor. Without doubt they were
      spying on me. I cast a glance round the walls, the furniture, the ceiling,
      the hangings, the floor. I saw nothing to justify suspicion. I heard
      persons moving about outside my door. I had no doubt they were looking
      through the keyhole.

Then I went across to the mantelpiece and lighted all the wax candles that
      were on it. After that I cast another glance around me without discovering
      anything. I advanced with short steps, carefully examining the apartment.
      Nothing. I inspected every article, one after the other. Still nothing. I
      went over to the window. The shutters, large wooden shutters, were open. I
      shut them with great care, and then drew the curtains, enormous velvet
      curtains, and placed a chair in front of them, so as to have nothing to
      fear from outside.

Then I cautiously sat down. The armchair was solid. I did not venture to
      get into the bed. However, the night was advancing; and I ended by coming
      to the conclusion that I was foolish. If they were spying on me, as I
      supposed, they must, while waiting for the success of the joke they had
      been preparing for me, have been laughing immoderately at my terror. So I
      made up my mind to go to bed. But the bed was particularly
      suspicious-looking. I pulled at the curtains. They seemed to be secure.

All the same, there was danger. I was going perhaps to receive a cold
      shower both from overhead, or perhaps, the moment I stretched myself out,
      to find myself sinking to the floor with my mattress. I searched in my
      memory for all the practical jokes of which I ever had experience. And I
      did not want to be caught. Ah! certainly not! certainly not! Then I
      suddenly bethought myself of a precaution which I considered insured
      safety. I caught hold of the side of the mattress gingerly, and very
      slowly drew it toward me. It came away, followed by the sheet and the rest
      of the bedclothes. I dragged all these objects into the very middle of the
      room, facing the entrance door. I made my bed over again as best I could
      at some distance from the suspected bedstead and the corner which had
      filled me with such anxiety. Then I extinguished all the candles, and,
      groping my way, I slipped under the bed clothes.

For at least another hour I remained awake, starting at the slightest
      sound. Everything seemed quiet in the chateau. I fell asleep.

I must have been in a deep sleep for a long time, but all of a sudden I
      was awakened with a start by the fall of a heavy body tumbling right on
      top of my own, and, at the same time, I received on my face, on my neck,
      and on my chest a burning liquid which made me utter a howl of pain. And a
      dreadful noise, as if a sideboard laden with plates and dishes had fallen
      down, almost deafened me.

I was smothering beneath the weight that was crushing me and preventing me
      from moving. I stretched out my hand to find out what was the nature of
      this object. I felt a face, a nose, and whiskers. Then, with all my
      strength, I launched out a blow at this face. But I immediately received a
      hail of cuffings which made me jump straight out of the soaked sheets, and
      rush in my nightshirt into the corridor, the door of which I found open.

Oh, heavens! it was broad daylight. The noise brought my friends hurrying
      into my apartment, and we found, sprawling over my improvised bed, the
      dismayed valet, who, while bringing me my morning cup of tea, had tripped
      over this obstacle in the middle of the floor and fallen on his stomach,
      spilling my breakfast over my face in spite of himself.

The precautions I had taken in closing the shutters and going to sleep in
      the middle of the room had only brought about the practical joke I had
      been trying to avoid.

“Hello! there''s Milial!” said somebody near me. I looked at
      the man who had been pointed out as I had been wishing for a long time to
      meet this Don Juan.

He was no longer young. His gray hair looked a little like those fur
      bonnets worn by certain Northern peoples, and his long beard, which fell
      down over his chest, had also somewhat the appearance of fur. He was
      talking to a lady, leaning toward her, speaking in a low voice and looking
      at her with an expression full of respect and tenderness.

I knew his life, or at least as much as was known of it. He had loved
      madly several times, and there had been certain tragedies with which his
      name had been connected. When I spoke to women who were the loudest in his
      praise, and asked them whence came this power, they always answered, after
      thinking for a while: “I don''t know—he has a certain charm
      about him.”

He was certainly not handsome. He had none of the elegance that we ascribe
      to conquerors of feminine hearts. I wondered what might be his hidden
      charm. Was it mental? I never had heard of a clever saying of his. In his
      glance? Perhaps. Or in his voice? The voices of some beings have a certain
      irresistible attraction, almost suggesting the flavor of things good to
      eat. One is hungry for them, and the sound of their words penetrates us
      like a dainty morsel. A friend was passing. I asked him: “Do you
      know Monsieur Milial?”

A minute later we were shaking hands and talking in the doorway. What he
      said was correct, agreeable to hear; it contained no irritable thought.
      The voice was sweet, soft, caressing, musical; but I had heard others much
      more attractive, much more moving. One listened to him with pleasure, just
      as one would look at a pretty little brook. No tension of the mind was
      necessary in order to follow him, no hidden meaning aroused curiosity, no
      expectation awoke interest. His conversation was rather restful, but it
      did not awaken in one either a desire to answer, to contradict or to
      approve, and it was as easy to answer him as it was to listen to him. The
      response came to the lips of its own accord, as soon as he had finished
      talking, and phrases turned toward him as if he had naturally aroused
      them.

One thought soon struck me. I had known him for a quarter of an hour, and
      it seemed as if he were already one of my old friends, that I had known
      all about him for a long time; his face, his gestures, his voice, his
      ideas. Suddenly, after a few minutes of conversation, he seemed already to
      be installed in my intimacy. All constraint disappeared between us, and,
      had he so desired, I might have confided in him as one confides only in
      old friends.

Certainly there was some mystery about him. Those barriers that are closed
      between most people and that are lowered with time when sympathy, similar
      tastes, equal intellectual culture and constant intercourse remove
      constraint—those barriers seemed not to exist between him and me,
      and no doubt this was the case between him and all people, both men and
      women, whom fate threw in his path.

After half an hour we parted, promising to see each other often, and he
      gave me his address after inviting me to take luncheon with him in two
      days.

I forgot what hour he had stated, and I arrived too soon; he was not yet
      home. A correct and silent domestic showed me into a beautiful, quiet,
      softly lighted parlor. I felt comfortable there, at home. How often I have
      noticed the influence of apartments on the character and on the mind!
      There are some which make one feel foolish; in others, on the contrary,
      one always feels lively. Some make us sad, although well lighted and
      decorated in light-colored furniture; others cheer us up, although hung
      with sombre material. Our eye, like our heart, has its likes and dislikes,
      of which it does not inform us, and which it secretly imposes on our
      temperament. The harmony of furniture, walls, the style of an ensemble,
      act immediately on our mental state, just as the air from the woods, the
      sea or the mountains modifies our physical natures.

I sat down on a cushion-covered divan and felt myself suddenly carried and
      supported by these little silk bags of feathers, as if the outline of my
      body had been marked out beforehand on this couch.

Then I looked about. There was nothing striking about the room;
      every-where were beautiful and modest things, simple and rare furniture,
      Oriental curtains which did not seem to come from a department store but
      from the interior of a harem; and exactly opposite me hung the portrait of
      a woman. It was a portrait of medium size, showing the head and the upper
      part of the body, and the hands, which were holding a book. She was young,
      bareheaded; ribbons were woven in her hair; she was smiling sadly. Was it
      because she was bareheaded, was it merely her natural expression? I never
      have seen a portrait of a lady which seemed so much in its place as that
      one in that dwelling. Of all those I knew I have seen nothing like that
      one. All those that I know are on exhibition, whether the lady be dressed
      in her gaudiest gown, with an attractive headdress and a look which shows
      that she is posing first of all before the artist and then before those
      who will look at her or whether they have taken a comfortable attitude in
      an ordinary gown. Some are standing majestically in all their beauty,
      which is not at all natural to them in life. All of them have something, a
      flower or, a jewel, a crease in the dress or a curve of the lip, which one
      feels to have been placed there for effect by the artist. Whether they
      wear a hat or merely their hair one can immediately notice that they are
      not entirely natural. Why? One cannot say without knowing them, but the
      effect is there. They seem to be calling somewhere, on people whom they
      wish to please and to whom they wish to appear at their best advantage;
      and they have studied their attitudes, sometimes modest, Sometimes
      haughty.

What could one say about this one? She was at home and alone. Yes, she was
      alone, for she was smiling as one smiles when thinking in solitude of
      something sad or sweet, and not as one smiles when one is being watched.
      She seemed so much alone and so much at home that she made the whole large
      apartment seem absolutely empty. She alone lived in it, filled it, gave it
      life. Many people might come in and converse, laugh, even sing; she would
      still be alone with a solitary smile, and she alone would give it life
      with her pictured gaze.

That look also was unique. It fell directly on me, fixed and caressing,
      without seeing me. All portraits know that they are being watched, and
      they answer with their eyes, which see, think, follow us without leaving
      us, from the very moment we enter the apartment they inhabit. This one did
      not see me; it saw nothing, although its look was fixed directly on me. I
      remembered the surprising verse of Baudelaire:

They did indeed attract me in an irresistible manner; those painted eyes
      which had lived, or which were perhaps still living, threw over me a
      strange, powerful spell. Oh, what an infinite and tender charm, like a
      passing breeze, like a dying sunset of lilac rose and blue, a little sad
      like the approaching night, which comes behind the sombre frame and out of
      those impenetrable eyes! Those eyes, created by a few strokes from a
      brush, hide behind them the mystery of that which seems to be and which
      does not exist, which can appear in the eyes of a woman, which can make
      love blossom within us.

The door opened and M. Milial entered. He excused himself for being late.
      I excused myself for being ahead of time. Then I said: “Might I ask
      you who is this lady?”

The north wind was blowing a hurricane, driving through the sky big,
      black, heavy clouds from which the rain poured down on the earth with
      terrific violence.

A high sea was raging and dashing its huge, slow, foamy waves along the
      coast with the rumbling sound of thunder. The waves followed each other
      close, rolling in as high as mountains, scattering the foam as they broke.

The storm engulfed itself in the little valley of Yport, whistling and
      moaning, tearing the shingles from the roofs, smashing the shutters,
      knocking down the chimneys, rushing through the narrow streets in such
      gusts that one could walk only by holding on to the walls, and children
      would have been lifted up like leaves and carried over the houses into the
      fields.

The fishing smacks had been hauled high up on land, because at high tide
      the sea would sweep the beach. Several sailors, sheltered behind the
      curved bottoms of their boats, were watching this battle of the sky and
      the sea.

Then, one by one, they went away, for night was falling on the storm,
      wrapping in shadows the raging ocean and all the battling elements.

Just two men remained, their hands plunged deep into their pockets,
      bending their backs beneath the squall, their woolen caps pulled down over
      their ears; two big Normandy fishermen, bearded, their skin tanned through
      exposure, with the piercing black eyes of the sailor who looks over the
      horizon like a bird of prey.

The other hesitated a while, tempted on one hand by the game and the
      thought of brandy, knowing well that, if he went to Paumelle''s, he would
      return home drunk; held back, on the other hand, by the idea of his wife
      remaining alone in the house.

“Any one might think that you had made a bet to get me drunk every
      night. Say, what good is it doing you, since it''s always you that''s
      treating?”

Nevertheless he was smiling at the idea of all this brandy drunk at the
      expense of another. He was smiling the contented smirk of an avaricious
      Norman.

“Come on, Jeremie. This isn''t the kind of a night to go home without
      anything to warm you up. What are you afraid of? Isn''t your wife going to
      warm your bed for you?”

“The other night I couldn''t find the door—I had to be fished
      out of the ditch in front of the house!”

He was still laughing at this drunkard''s recollection, and he was
      unconsciously going toward Paumelle''s Cafe, where a light was shining in
      the window; he was going, pulled by Mathurin and pushed by the wind,
      unable to resist these combined forces.

The low room was full of sailors, smoke and noise. All these men, clad in
      woolens, their elbows on the tables, were shouting to make themselves
      heard. The more people came in, the more one had to shout in order to
      overcome the noise of voices and the rattling of dominoes on the marble
      tables.

Jeremie and Mathurin sat down in a corner and began a game, and the
      glasses were emptied in rapid succession into their thirsty throats.

Then they played more games and drank more glasses. Mathurin kept pouring
      and winking to the saloon keeper, a big, red-faced man, who chuckled as
      though at the thought of some fine joke; and Jeremie kept absorbing
      alcohol and wagging his head, giving vent to a roar of laughter and
      looking at his comrade with a stupid and contented expression.

All the customers were going away. Every time that one of them would open
      the door to leave a gust of wind would blow into the cafe, making the
      tobacco smoke swirl around, swinging the lamps at the end of their chains
      and making their flames flicker, and suddenly one could hear the deep
      booming of a breaking wave and the moaning of the wind.

Jeremie, his collar unbuttoned, was taking drunkard''s poses, one leg
      outstretched, one arm hanging down and in the other hand holding a domino.

And both of them looked toward Jeremie, who was triumphantly putting down
      the double six and announcing:

“Well, boys, I''m goin'' to bed. I will leave you the lamp and the
      bottle; there''s twenty cents'' worth in it. Lock the door when you go,
      Mathurin, and slip the key under the mat the way you did the other night.”

Paumelle shook hands with his two customers and slowly went up the wooden
      stairs. For several minutes his heavy step echoed through the little
      house. Then a loud creaking announced that he had got into bed.

The two men continued to play. From time to time a more violent gust of
      wind would shake the whole house, and the two drinkers would look up, as
      though some one were about to enter. Then Mathurin would take the bottle
      and fill Jeremie''s glass. But suddenly the clock over the bar struck
      twelve. Its hoarse clang sounded like the rattling of saucepans. Then
      Mathurin got up like a sailor whose watch is over.

The other man rose to his feet with difficulty, got his balance by leaning
      on the table, reached the door and opened it while his companion was
      putting out the light.

Jeremie took a few steps, staggered, stretched out his hands, met a wall
      which supported him and began to stumble along. From time to time a gust
      of wind would sweep through the street, pushing him forward, making him
      run for a few steps; then, when the wind would die down, he would stop
      short, having lost his impetus, and once more he would begin to stagger on
      his unsteady drunkard''s legs.

He went instinctively toward his home, just as birds go to their nests.
      Finally he recognized his door, and began to feel about for the keyhole
      and tried to put the key in it. Not finding the hole, he began to swear.
      Then he began to beat on the door with his fists, calling for his wife to
      come and help him:

As he leaned against the door for support, it gave way and opened, and
      Jeremie, losing his prop, fell inside, rolling on his face into the middle
      of his room, and he felt something heavy pass over him and escape in the
      night.

He was no longer moving, dazed by fright, bewildered, fearing the devil,
      ghosts, all the mysterious beings of darkness, and he waited a long time
      without daring to move. But when he found out that nothing else was
      moving, a little reason returned to him, the reason of a drunkard.

Then, suddenly, a suspicion crossed his darkened mind, an indistinct,
      vague suspicion. He was not moving; he was sitting there in the dark,
      trying to gather together his scattered wits, his mind stumbling over
      incomplete ideas, just as his feet stumbled along.

“I''m drunk, all right! I''m drunk! And he filled me up, the dog; he
      did it, to stop my goin'' home. I''m drunk!”

“He''s been keeping me at that loafer Paumelle''s place every night,
      so as to stop my going home. It''s some trick. Oh, you damned carrion!”

Slowly he got on his knees. A blind fury was gaining possession of him,
      mingling with the fumes of alcohol.

He was now standing, trembling with a wild fury, as though the alcohol had
      set his blood on fire. He took a step, knocked against a chair, seized it,
      went on, reached the bed, ran his hands over it and felt the warm body of
      his wife.

And, lifting the chair, which he was holding in his strong sailor''s grip,
      he swung it down before him with an exasperated fury. A cry burst from the
      bed, an agonizing, piercing cry. Then he began to thrash around like a
      thresher in a barn. And soon nothing more moved. The chair was broken to
      pieces, but he still held one leg and beat away with it, panting.

Then tired out, stupefied from his exertion, he stretched himself out on
      the ground and slept.

When day came a neighbor, seeing the door open, entered. He saw Jeremie
      snoring on the floor, amid the broken pieces of a chair, and on the bed a
      pulp of flesh and blood.

As we sat chatting after dinner, a party of men, the conversation turned
      on women, for lack of something else.

“Here''s a funny thing that happened to me on, that very subject.”
      And he told us the following story:

One evening last winter I suddenly felt overcome by that overpowering
      sense of misery and languor that takes possession of one from time to
      time. I was in my own apartment, all alone, and I was convinced that if I
      gave in to my feelings I should have a terrible attack of melancholia, one
      of those attacks that lead to suicide when they recur too often.

I put on my overcoat and went out without the slightest idea of what I was
      going to do. Having gone as far as the boulevards, I began to wander along
      by the almost empty cafes. It was raining, a fine rain that affects your
      mind as it does your clothing, not one of those good downpours which come
      down in torrents, driving breathless passers-by into doorways, but a rain
      without drops that deposits on your clothing an imperceptible spray and
      soon covers you with a sort of iced foam that chills you through.

What should I do? I walked in one direction and then came back, looking
      for some place where I could spend two hours, and discovering for the
      first time that there is no place of amusement in Paris in the evening. At
      last I decided to go to the Folies-Bergere, that entertaining resort for
      gay women.

There were very few people in the main hall. In the long horseshoe curve
      there were only a few ordinary looking people, whose plebeian origin was
      apparent in their manners, their clothes, the cut of their hair and beard,
      their hats, their complexion. It was rarely that one saw from time to time
      a man whom you suspected of having washed himself thoroughly, and his
      whole make-up seemed to match. As for the women, they were always the
      same, those frightful women you all know, ugly, tired looking, drooping,
      and walking along in their lackadaisical manner, with that air of foolish
      superciliousness which they assume, I do not know why.

I thought to myself that, in truth, not one of those languid creatures,
      greasy rather than fat, puffed out here and thin there, with the contour
      of a monk and the lower extremities of a bow-legged snipe, was worth the
      louis that they would get with great difficulty after asking five.

But all at once I saw a little creature whom I thought attractive, not in
      her first youth, but fresh, comical and tantalizing. I stopped her, and
      stupidly, without thinking, I made an appointment with her for that night.
      I did not want to go back to my own home alone, all alone; I preferred the
      company and the caresses of this hussy.

And I followed her. She lived in a great big house in the Rue des Martyrs.
      The gas was already extinguished on the stairway. I ascended the steps
      slowly, lighting a candle match every few seconds, stubbing my foot
      against the steps, stumbling and angry as I followed the rustle of the
      skirt ahead of me.

And she left me in the darkness. I heard her shutting two doors and then I
      thought I heard her talking. I was surprised and uneasy. The thought that
      she had a protector staggered me. But I have good fists and a solid back.
      “We shall see,” I said to myself.

I listened attentively with ear and mind. Some one was stirring about,
      walking quietly and very carefully. Then another door was opened and I
      thought I again heard some one talking, but in a very low tone.

She said “thou” in speaking to me, which was an indication of
      possession. I went in and after passing through a dining room in which it
      was very evident that no one ever ate, I entered a typical room of all
      these women, a furnished room with red curtains and a soiled eiderdown bed
      covering.

Five minutes later I longed to put on my things and get away. But this
      terrible languor that had overcome me at home took possession of me again,
      and deprived me of energy enough to move and I stayed in spite of the
      disgust that I felt for this association. The unusual attractiveness that
      I supposed I had discovered in this creature over there under the
      chandeliers of the theater had altogether vanished on closer acquaintance,
      and she was nothing more to me now than a common woman, like all the
      others, whose indifferent and complaisant kiss smacked of garlic.

But, suddenly, I heard something moving quite close to us. First there was
      a sigh, then a slight, but distinct, sound as if some one had turned round
      on a chair.

“Do not be uneasy, my dear boy, it is my neighbor. The partition is
      so thin that one can hear everything as if it were in the room. These are
      wretched rooms, just like pasteboard.”

I felt so lazy that I paid no further attention to it. We resumed our
      conversation. Driven by the stupid curiosity that prompts all men to
      question these creatures about their first experiences, to attempt to lift
      the veil of their first folly, as though to find in them a trace of
      pristine innocence, to love them, possibly, in a fleeting memory of their
      candor and modesty of former days, evoked by a word, I insistently asked
      her about her earlier lovers.

I knew she was telling me lies. What did it matter? Among all these lies I
      might, perhaps, discover something sincere and pathetic.

But I suddenly recalled the theory of a friend of mine, an observant and
      philosophical physician whom constant attendance in hospitals has brought
      into daily contact with girl-mothers and prostitutes, with all the shame
      and all the misery of women, of those poor women who have become the
      frightful prey of the wandering male with money in his pocket.

“A woman,” he said, “is always debauched by a man of her
      own class and position. I have volumes of statistics on that subject. We
      accuse the rich of plucking the flower of innocence among the girls of the
      people. This is not correct. The rich pay for what they want. They may
      gather some, but never for the first time.”

“I am a sorcerer, my dear girl, I am a clairvoyant. If you do not
      tell me the truth, I will go into a trance sleep and then I can find out.”

“There was a festival in the country. They had sent for a special
      chef, M. Alexandre. As soon as he came he did just as he pleased in the
      house. He bossed every one, even the proprietor and his wife, as if he had
      been a king. He was a big handsome man, who did not seem fitted to stand
      beside a kitchen range. He was always calling out, ''Come, some butter
      —some eggs—some Madeira!'' And it had to be brought to him at
      once in a hurry, or he would get cross and say things that would make us
      blush all over.

“When the day was over he would smoke a pipe outside the door. And
      as I was passing by him with a pile of plates he said to me, like that:
      ''Come, girlie, come down to the water with me and show me the country.'' I
      went with him like a fool, and we had hardly got down to the bank of the
      river when he took advantage of me so suddenly that I did not even know
      what he was doing. And then he went away on the nine o''clock train. I
      never saw him again.”

“All right, my girl, all right. You are all of you less stupid than
      one would imagine, all the same. And how old is he now, Florentin?”

But a loud noise just then coming from the room itself made me start up
      with a bound. It sounded like some one falling and picking themselves up
      again by feeling along the wall with their hands.

I had seized the candle and was looking about me, terrified and furious.
      She had risen also and was trying to hold me back to stop me, murmuring:

But I had discovered what direction the strange noise came from. I walked
      straight towards a door hidden at the head of the bed and I opened it
      abruptly and saw before me, trembling, his bright, terrified eyes opened
      wide at sight of me, a little pale, thin boy seated beside a large wicker
      chair off which he had fallen.

“It was not my fault, mamma, it was not my fault. I was asleep, and
      I fell off. Do not scold me, it was not my fault.”

“What do you want me to do? I do not earn enough to put him to
      school! I have to keep him with me, and I cannot afford to pay for another
      room, by heavens! He sleeps with me when I am alone. If any one comes for
      one hour or two he can stay in the wardrobe; he keeps quiet, he
      understands it. But when people stay all night, as you have done, it tires
      the poor child to sleep on a chair.

“It is not his fault. I should like to see you sleep all night on a
      chair—you would have something to say.”

The child was still crying. A poor delicate timid little fellow, a
      veritable child of the wardrobe, of the cold, dark closet, a child who
      from time to time was allowed to get a little warmth in the bed if it
      chanced to be unoccupied.

Spring is a season in which one ought, it seems to me, to drink and eat
      the landscape. It is the season of chills, just as autumn is the season of
      reflection. In spring the country rouses the physical senses, in autumn it
      enters into the soul.

I desired this year to breathe the odor of orange blossoms and I set out
      for the South of France just at the time that every one else was returning
      home. I visited Monaco, the shrine of pilgrims, rival of Mecca and
      Jerusalem, without leaving any gold in any one else''s pockets, and I
      climbed the high mountain beneath a covering of lemon, orange and olive
      branches.

Have you ever slept, my friend, in a grove of orange trees in flower? The
      air that one inhales with delight is a quintessence of perfumes. The
      strong yet sweet odor, delicious as some dainty, seems to blend with our
      being, to saturate us, to intoxicate us, to enervate us, to plunge us into
      a sleepy, dreamy torpor. As though it were an opium prepared by the hands
      of fairies and not by those of druggists.

This is a country of ravines. The surface of the mountains is cleft,
      hollowed out in all directions, and in these sinuous crevices grow
      veritable forests of lemon trees. Here and there where the steep gorge is
      interrupted by a sort of step, a kind of reservoir has been built which
      holds the water of the rain storms.

They are large holes with slippery walls with nothing for any one to grasp
      hold of should they fall in.

I was walking slowly in one of these ascending valleys or gorges, glancing
      through the foliage at the vivid-hued fruit that remained on the branches.
      The narrow gorge made the heavy odor of the flowers still more
      penetrating; the air seemed to be dense with it. A feeling of lassitude
      came over me and I looked for a place to sit down. A few drops of water
      glistened in the grass. I thought that there was a spring near by and I
      climbed a little further to look for it. But I only reached the edge of
      one of these large, deep reservoirs.

I sat down tailor fashion, with my legs crossed under me, and remained
      there in a reverie before this hole, which looked as if it were filled
      with ink, so black and stagnant was the liquid it contained. Down yonder,
      through the branches, I saw, like patches, bits of the Mediterranean
      gleaming so that they fairly dazzled my eyes. But my glance always
      returned to the immense somber well that appeared to be inhabited by no
      aquatic animals, so motionless was its surface. Suddenly a voice made me
      tremble. An old gentleman who was picking flowers—this country is
      the richest in Europe for herbalists—asked me:

“I beg your pardon. On seeing you sitting thus absorbed in front of
      this reservoir I thought you were recalling the frightful tragedy that
      occurred here.”

It is very dismal and very heart-rending, my dear friend, and very trivial
      at the same time. It is a simple news item. I do not know whether to
      attribute my emotion to the dramatic manner in which the story was told to
      me, to the setting of the mountains, to the contrast between the joy of
      the sunlight and the flowers and this black, murderous hole, but my heart
      was wrung, all my nerves unstrung by this tale which, perhaps, may not
      appear so terribly harrowing to you as you read it in your room without
      having the scene of the tragedy before your eyes.

It was one spring in recent years. Two little boys frequently came to play
      on the edge of this cistern while their tutor lay under a tree reading a
      book. One warm afternoon a piercing cry awoke the tutor who was dozing and
      the sound of splashing caused by something falling into the water made him
      jump to his feet abruptly. The younger of the children, eight years of
      age, was shouting, as he stood beside the reservoir, the surface of which
      was stirred and eddying at the spot where the older boy had fallen in as
      he ran along the stone coping.

Distracted, without waiting or stopping to think what was best to do, the
      tutor jumped into the black water and did not rise again, having struck
      his head at the bottom of the cistern.

At the same moment the young boy who had risen to the surface was waving
      his stretched-out arms toward his brother. The little fellow on land lay
      down full length, while the other tried to swim, to approach the wall, and
      presently the four little hands clasped each other, tightened in each
      other''s grasp, contracted as though they were fastened together. They both
      felt the intense joy of an escape from death, a shudder at the danger
      past.

The older boy tried to climb up to the edge, but could not manage it, as
      the wall was perpendicular, and his brother, who was too weak, was sliding
      slowly towards the hole.

The little fellow squeezed his brother''s hands with all his might and wept
      from nervousness as he repeated: “I cannot drag you out, I cannot
      drag you out.” And all at once he began to shout, “Help! Help!”
      But his light voice scarcely penetrated beyond the dome of foliage above
      their heads.

They remained thus a long time, hours and hours, facing each other, these
      two children, with one thought, one anguish of heart and the horrible
      dread that one of them, exhausted, might let go the hands of the other.
      And they kept on calling, but all in vain.

At length the older boy, who was shivering with cold, said to the little
      one: “I cannot hold out any longer. I am going to fall. Good-by,
      little brother.” And the other, gasping, replied: “Not yet,
      not yet, wait.”

Evening came on, the still evening with its stars mirrored in the water.
      The older lad, his endurance giving out, said: “Let go my hand, I am
      going to give you my watch.” He had received it as a present a few
      days before, and ever since it had been his chief amusement. He was able
      to get hold of it, and held it out to the little fellow who was sobbing
      and who laid it down on the grass beside him.

It was night now. The two unhappy beings, exhausted, had almost loosened
      their grasp. The elder, at last, feeling that he was lost, murmured once
      more: “Good-by, little brother, kiss mamma and papa.” And his
      numbed fingers relaxed their hold. He sank and did not rise again . . . .
      The little fellow, left alone, began to shout wildly: “Paul! Paul!”
      But the other did not come to the surface.

Then he darted across the mountain, falling among the stones, overcome by
      the most frightful anguish that can wring a child''s heart, and with a face
      like death reached the sitting-room, where his parents were waiting. He
      became bewildered again as he led them to the gloomy reservoir. He could
      not find his way. At last he reached the spot. “It is there; yes, it
      is there!”

But the cistern had to be emptied, and the proprietor would not permit it
      as he needed the water for his lemon trees.

You see, my dear friend, that this is a simple news item. But if you had
      seen the hole itself your heart would have been wrung, as mine was, at the
      thought of the agony of that child hanging to his brother''s hands, of the
      long suspense of those little chaps who were accustomed only to laugh and
      to play, and at the simple incident of the giving of the watch.

I said to myself: “May Fate preserve me from ever receiving a
      similar relic!” I know of nothing more terrible than such a
      recollection connected with a familiar object that one cannot dispose of.
      Only think of it; each time that he handles this sacred watch the survivor
      will picture once more the horrible scene; the pool, the wall, the still
      water, and the distracted face of his brother-alive, and yet as lost as
      though he were already dead. And all through his life, at any moment, the
      vision will be there, awakened the instant even the tip of his finger
      touches his watch pocket.

And I was sad until evening. I left the spot and kept on climbing, leaving
      the region of orange trees for the region of olive trees, and the region
      of olive trees for the region of pines; then I came to a valley of stones,
      and finally reached the ruins of an ancient castle, built, they say, in
      the tenth century by a Saracen chief, a good man, who was baptized a
      Christian through love for a young girl. Everywhere around me were
      mountains, and before me the sea, the sea with an almost imperceptible
      patch on it: Corsica, or, rather, the shadow of Corsica. But on the
      mountain summits, blood-red in the glow of the sunset, in the boundless
      sky and on the sea, in all this superb landscape that I had come here to
      admire I saw only two poor children, one lying prone on the edge of a hole
      filled with black water, the other submerged to his neck, their hands
      intertwined, weeping opposite each other, in despair. And it seemed as
      though I continually heard a weak, exhausted voice saying: “Good-by,
      little brother, I am going to give you my watch.”

This letter may seem rather melancholy, dear friend. I will try to be more
      cheerful some other day.

Last Monday an Indian prince died at Etretat, Bapu Sahib Khanderao Ghatay,
      a relation of His Highness, the Maharajah Gaikwar, prince of Baroda, in
      the province of Guzerat, Presidency of Bombay.

For about three weeks there had been seen walking in the streets about ten
      young East Indians, small, lithe, with dark skins, dressed all in gray and
      wearing on their heads caps such as English grooms wear. They were men of
      high rank who had come to Europe to study the military institutions of the
      principal Western nations. The little band consisted of three princes, a
      nobleman, an interpreter and three servants.

The head of the commission had just died, an old man of forty-two and
      father-in-law of Sampatro Kashivao Gaikwar, brother of His Highness, the
      Gaikwar of Baroda.

The other East Indians were called Ganpatrao Shravanrao Gaikwar, cousin of
      His Highness Khasherao Gadhav; Vasudev Madhav Samarth, interpreter and
      secretary; the slaves: Ramchandra Bajaji, Ganu bin Pukiram Kokate,
      Rhambhaji bin Fabji.

On leaving his native land the one who died recently was overcome with
      terrible grief, and feeling convinced that he would never return he wished
      to give up the journey, but he had to obey the wishes of his noble
      relative, the Prince of Baroda, and he set out.

They came to spend the latter part of the summer at Etretat, and people
      would go out of curiosity every morning to see them taking their bath at
      the Etablissment des Roches-Blanches.

Five or six days ago Bapu Sahib Khanderao Ghatay was taken with pains in
      his gums; then the inflammation spread to the throat and became
      ulceration. Gangrene set in and, on Monday, the doctors told his young
      friends that their relative was dying. The final struggle was already
      beginning, and the breath had almost left the unfortunate man''s body when
      his friends seized him, snatched him from his bed and laid him on the
      stone floor of the room, so that, stretched out on the earth, our mother,
      he should yield up his soul, according to the command of Brahma.

They then sent to ask the mayor, M. Boissaye, for a permit to burn the
      body that very day so as to fulfill the prescribed ceremonial of the
      Hindoo religion. The mayor hesitated, telegraphed to the prefecture to
      demand instructions, at the same time sending word that a failure to reply
      would be considered by him tantamount to a consent. As he had received no
      reply at 9 o''clock that evening, he decided, in view of the infectious
      character of the disease of which the East Indian had died, that the
      cremation of the body should take place that very night, beneath the
      cliff, on the beach, at ebb tide.

The mayor is being criticized now for this decision, though he acted as an
      intelligent, liberal and determined man, and was upheld and advised by the
      three physicians who had watched the case and reported the death.

They were dancing at the Casino that evening. It was an early autumn
      evening, rather chilly. A pretty strong wind was blowing from the ocean,
      although as yet there was no sea on, and swift, light, ragged clouds were
      driving across the sky. They came from the edge of the horizon, looking
      dark against the background of the sky, but as they approached the moon
      they grew whiter and passed hurriedly across her face, veiling it for a
      few seconds without completely hiding it.

The tall straight cliffs that inclose the rounded beach of Etretat and
      terminate in two celebrated arches, called “the Gates,” lay in
      shadow, and made two great black patches in the softly lighted landscape.

The Casino orchestra was playing waltzes, polkas and quadrilles. A rumor
      was presently circulated among the groups of dancers. It was said that an
      East Indian prince had just died at the Hotel des Bains and that the
      ministry had been approached for permission to burn the body. No one
      believed it, or at least no one supposed that such a thing could occur so
      foreign was the custom as yet to our customs, and as the night was far
      advanced every one went home.

At midnight, the lamplighter, running from street to street, extinguished,
      one after another, the yellow jets of flame that lighted up the sleeping
      houses, the mud and the puddles of water. We waited, watching for the hour
      when the little town should be quiet and deserted.

Ever since noon a carpenter had been cutting up wood and asking himself
      with amazement what was going to be done with all these planks sawn up
      into little bits, and why one should destroy so much good merchandise.
      This wood was piled up in a cart which went along through side streets as
      far as the beach, without arousing the suspicion of belated persons who
      might meet it. It went along on the shingle at the foot of the cliff, and
      having dumped its contents on the beach the three Indian servants began to
      build a funeral pile, a little longer than it was wide. They worked alone,
      for no profane hand must aid in this solemn duty.

It was one o''clock in the morning when the relations of the deceased were
      informed that they might accomplish their part of the work.

The door of the little house they occupied was open, and we perceived,
      lying on a stretcher in the small, dimly lighted vestibule the corpse
      covered with white silk. We could see him plainly as he lay stretched out
      on his back, his outline clearly defined beneath this white veil.

The East Indians, standing at his feet, remained motionless, while one of
      them performed the prescribed rites, murmuring unfamiliar words in a low,
      monotonous tone. He walked round and round the corpse; touching it
      occasionally, then, taking an urn suspended from three slender chains, he
      sprinkled it for some time with the sacred water of the Ganges, that East
      Indians must always carry with them wherever they go.

Then the stretcher was lifted by four of them who started off at a slow
      march. The moon had gone down, leaving the muddy, deserted streets in
      darkness, but the body on the stretcher appeared to be luminous, so
      dazzlingly white was the silk, and it was a weird sight to see, passing
      along through the night, the semi-luminous form of this corpse, borne by
      those men, the dusky skin of whose faces and hands could scarcely be
      distinguished from their clothing in the darkness.

Behind the corpse came three Indians, and then, a full head taller than
      themselves and wrapped in an ample traveling coat of a soft gray color,
      appeared the outline of an Englishman, a kind and superior man, a friend
      of theirs, who was their guide and counselor in their European travels.

Beneath the cold, misty sky of this little northern beach I felt as if I
      were taking part in a sort of symbolical drama. It seemed to me that they
      were carrying there, before me, the conquered genius of India, followed,
      as in a funeral procession, by the victorious genius of England robed in a
      gray ulster.

On the shingly beach the four bearers halted a few moments to take breath,
      and then proceeded on their way. They now walked quickly, bending beneath
      the weight of their burden. At length they reached the funeral pile. It
      was erected in an indentation, at the very foot of the cliff, which rose
      above it perpendicularly a hundred meters high, perfectly white but
      looking gray in the night.

The funeral pile was about three and a half feet high. The corpse was
      placed on it and then one of the Indians asked to have the pole star
      pointed out to him. This was done, and the dead Rajah was laid with his
      feet turned towards his native country. Then twelve bottles of kerosene
      were poured over him and he was covered completely with thin slabs of pine
      wood. For almost another hour the relations and servants kept piling up
      the funeral pyre which looked like one of those piles of wood that
      carpenters keep in their yards. Then on top of this was poured the
      contents of twenty bottles of oil, and on top of all they emptied a bag of
      fine shavings. A few steps further on, a flame was glimmering in a little
      bronze brazier, which had remained lighted since the arrival of the
      corpse.

The moment had arrived. The relations went to fetch the fire. As it was
      barely alight, some oil was poured on it, and suddenly a flame arose
      lighting up the great wall of rock from summit to base. An Indian who was
      leaning over the brazier rose upright, his two hands in the air, his
      elbows bent, and all at once we saw arising, all black on the immense
      white cliff, a colossal shadow, the shadow of Buddha in his hieratic
      posture. And the little pointed toque that the man wore on his head even
      looked like the head-dress of the god.

The effect was so striking and unexpected that I felt my heart beat as
      though some supernatural apparition had risen up before me.

That was just what it was—the ancient and sacred image, come from
      the heart of the East to the ends of Europe, and watching over its son
      whom they were going to cremate there.

It vanished. They brought fire. The shavings on top of the pyre were
      lighted and then the wood caught fire and a brilliant light illumined the
      cliff, the shingle and the foam of the waves as they broke on the beach.

It grew brighter from second to second, lighting up on the sea in the
      distance the dancing crest of the waves.

The breeze from the ocean blew in gusts, increasing the heat of the flame
      which flattened down, twisted, then shot up again, throwing out millions
      of sparks. They mounted with wild rapidity along the cliff and were lost
      in the sky, mingling with the stars, increasing their number. Some sea
      birds who had awakened uttered their plaintive cry, and, describing long
      curves, flew, with their white wings extended, through the gleam from the
      funeral pyre and then disappeared in the night.

Before long the pile of wood was nothing but a mass of flame, not red but
      yellow, a blinding yellow, a furnace lashed by the wind. And, suddenly,
      beneath a stronger gust, it tottered, partially crumbling as it leaned
      towards the sea, and the corpse came to view, full length, blackened on
      his couch of flame and burning with long blue flames:

The pile of wood having crumbled further on the right the corpse turned
      over as a man does in bed. They immediately covered him with fresh wood
      and the fire started up again more furiously than ever.

The East Indians, seated in a semi-circle on the shingle, looked out with
      sad, serious faces. And the rest of us, as it was very cold, had drawn
      nearer to the fire until the smoke and sparks came in our faces. There was
      no odor save that of burning pine and petroleum.

Hours passed; day began to break. Toward five o''clock in the morning
      nothing remained but a heap of ashes. The relations gathered them up, cast
      some of them to the winds, some in the sea, and kept some in a brass vase
      that they had brought from India. They then retired to their home to give
      utterance to lamentations.

These young princes and their servants, by the employment of the most
      inadequate appliances succeeded in carrying out the cremation of their
      relation in the most perfect manner, with singular skill and remarkable
      dignity. Everything was done according to ritual, according to the rigid
      ordinances of their religion. Their dead one rests in peace.

The following morning at daybreak there was an indescribable commotion in
      Etretat. Some insisted that they had burned a man alive, others that they
      were trying to hide a crime, some that the mayor would be put in jail,
      others that the Indian prince had succumbed to an attack of cholera.

The men were amazed, the women indignant. A crowd of people spent the day
      on the site of the funeral pile, looking for fragments of bone in the
      shingle that was still warm. They found enough bones to reconstruct ten
      skeletons, for the farmers on shore frequently throw their dead sheep into
      the sea. The finders carefully placed these various fragments in their
      pocketbooks. But not one of them possesses a true particle of the Indian
      prince.

That very night a deputy sent by the government came to hold an inquest.
      He, however, formed an estimate of this singular case like a man of
      intelligence and good sense. But what should he say in his report?

The East Indians declared that if they had been prevented in France from
      cremating their dead they would have taken him to a freer country where
      they could have carried out their customs.

Thus, I have seen a man cremated on a funeral pile, and it has given me a
      wish to disappear in the same manner.

In this way everything ends at once. Man expedites the slow work of
      nature, instead of delaying it by the hideous coffin in which one
      decomposes for months. The flesh is dead, the spirit has fled. Fire which
      purifies disperses in a few hours all that was a human being; it casts it
      to the winds, converting it into air and ashes, and not into ignominious
      corruption.

This is clean and hygienic. Putrefaction beneath the ground in a closed
      box where the body becomes like pap, a blackened, stinking pap, has about
      it something repugnant and disgusting. The sight of the coffin as it
      descends into this muddy hole wrings one''s heart with anguish. But the
      funeral pyre which flames up beneath the sky has about it something grand,
      beautiful and solemn.

I was very much interested at that time in a droll little woman. She was
      married, of course, as I have a horror of unmarried flirts. What enjoyment
      is there in making love to a woman who belongs to nobody and yet belongs
      to any one? And, besides, morality aside, I do not understand love as a
      trade. That disgusts me somewhat.

The especial attraction in a married woman to a bachelor is that she gives
      him a home, a sweet, pleasant home where every one takes care of you and
      spoils you, from the husband to the servants. One finds everything
      combined there, love, friendship, even fatherly interest, bed and board,
      all, in fact, that constitutes the happiness of life, with this
      incalculable advantage, that one can change one''s family from time to
      time, take up one''s abode in all kinds of society in turn: in summer, in
      the country with the workman who rents you a room in his house; in winter
      with the townsfolk, or even with the nobility, if one is ambitious.

I have another weakness; it is that I become attached to the husband as
      well as the wife. I acknowledge even that some husbands, ordinary or
      coarse as they may be, give me a feeling of disgust for their wives,
      however charming they may be. But when the husband is intellectual or
      charming I invariably become very much attached to him. I am careful if I
      quarrel with the wife not to quarrel with the husband. In this way I have
      made some of my best friends, and have also proved in many cases the
      incontestable superiority of the male over the female in the human
      species. The latter makes all sorts of trouble-scenes, reproaches, etc.;
      while the former, who has just as good a right to complain, treats you, on
      the contrary, as though you were the special Providence of his hearth.

Well, my friend was a quaint little woman, a brunette, fanciful,
      capricious, pious, superstitious, credulous as a monk, but charming. She
      had a way of kissing one that I never saw in any one else—but that
      was not the attraction—and such a soft skin! It gave me intense
      delight merely to hold her hands. And an eye—her glance was like a
      slow caress, delicious and unending. Sometimes I would lean my head on her
      knee and we would remain motionless, she leaning over me with that subtle,
      enigmatic, disturbing smile that women have, while my eyes would be raised
      to hers, drinking sweetly and deliciously into my heart, like a form of
      intoxication, the glance of her limpid blue eyes, limpid as though they
      were full of thoughts of love, and blue as though they were a heaven of
      delights.

Her husband, inspector of some large public works, was frequently away
      from home and left us our evenings free. Sometimes I spent them with her
      lounging on the divan with my forehead on one of her knees; while on the
      other lay an enormous black cat called “Misti,” whom she
      adored. Our fingers would meet on the cat''s back and would intertwine in
      her soft silky fur. I felt its warm body against my cheek, trembling with
      its eternal purring, and occasionally a paw would reach out and place on
      my mouth, or my eyelid, five unsheathed claws which would prick my
      eyelids, and then be immediately withdrawn.

Sometimes we would go out on what we called our escapades. They were very
      innocent, however. They consisted in taking supper at some inn in the
      suburbs, or else, after dining at her house or at mine, in making the
      round of the cheap cafes, like students out for a lark.

We would go into the common drinking places and take our seats at the end
      of the smoky den on two rickety chairs, at an old wooden table. A cloud of
      pungent smoke, with which blended an odor of fried fish from dinner,
      filled the room. Men in smocks were talking in loud tones as they drank
      their petits verres, and the astonished waiter placed before us two cherry
      brandies.

She, trembling, charmingly afraid, would raise her double black veil as
      far as her nose, and then take up her glass with the enjoyment that one
      feels at doing something delightfully naughty. Each cherry she swallowed
      made her feel as if she had done something wrong, each swallow of the
      burning liquor had on her the affect of a delicate and forbidden
      enjoyment.

Then she would say to me in a low tone: “Let us go.” And we
      would leave, she walking quickly with lowered head between the drinkers
      who watched her going by with a look of displeasure. And as soon as we got
      into the street she would give a great sigh of relief, as if we had
      escaped some terrible danger.

“Suppose they, should say something rude to me in those places, what
      would you do?” “Why, I would defend you, parbleu!” I
      would reply in a resolute manner. And she would squeeze my arm for
      happiness, perhaps with a vague wish that she might be insulted and
      protected, that she might see men fight on her account, even those men,
      with me!

One evening as we sat at a table in a tavern at Montmartre, we saw an old
      woman in tattered garments come in, holding in her hand a pack of dirty
      cards. Perceiving a lady, the old woman at once approached us and offered
      to tell my friend''s fortune. Emma, who in her heart believed in
      everything, was trembling with longing and anxiety, and she made a place
      beside her for the old woman.

The latter, old, wrinkled, her eyes with red inflamed rings round them,
      and her mouth without a single tooth in it, began to deal her dirty cards
      on the table. She dealt them in piles, then gathered them up, and then
      dealt them out again, murmuring indistinguishable words. Emma, turning
      pale, listened with bated breath, gasping with anxiety and curiosity.

The fortune-teller broke silence. She predicted vague happenings:
      happiness and children, a fair young man, a voyage, money, a lawsuit, a
      dark man, the return of some one, success, a death. The mention of this
      death attracted the younger woman''s attention. “Whose death? When?
      In what manner?”

The old woman replied: “Oh, as to that, these cards are not certain
      enough. You must come to my place to-morrow; I will tell you about it with
      coffee grounds which never make a mistake.”

“Say, let us go there to-morrow. Oh, please say yes. If not, you
      cannot imagine how worried I shall be.”

The old woman gave us her address. She lived on the sixth floor, in a
      wretched house behind the Buttes-Chaumont. We went there the following
      day.

Her room, an attic containing two chairs and a bed, was filled with
      strange objects, bunches of herbs hanging from nails, skins of animals,
      flasks and phials containing liquids of various colors. On the table a
      stuffed black cat looked out of eyes of glass. He seemed like the demon of
      this sinister dwelling.

My friend wanted to hear about it. She leaned against the old woman,
      questioned her, begged her to tell. At length the woman agreed to do so.

“I loved that cat,” she said, “as one would love a
      brother. I was young then and all alone, a seamstress. I had only him,
      Mouton. One of the tenants had given it to me. He was as intelligent as a
      child, and gentle as well, and he worshiped me, my dear lady, he worshiped
      me more than one does a fetish. All day long he would sit on my lap
      purring, and all night long on my pillow; I could feel his heart beating,
      in fact.

“Well, I happened to make an acquaintance, a fine young man who was
      working in a white-goods house. That went on for about three months on a
      footing of mere friendship. But you know one is liable to weaken, it may
      happen to any one, and, besides, I had really begun to love him. He was so
      nice, so nice, and so good. He wanted us to live together, for economy''s
      sake. I finally allowed him to come and see me one evening. I had not made
      up my mind to anything definite; oh, no! But I was pleased at the idea
      that we should spend an hour together.

“At first he behaved very well, said nice things to me that made my
      heart go pit-a-pat. And then he kissed me, madame, kissed me as one does
      when they love. I remained motionless, my eyes closed, in a paroxysm of
      happiness. But, suddenly, I felt him star' WHERE id = '6b5a5bab-cb6d-4c60-9071-cb95b01bf8ca';
