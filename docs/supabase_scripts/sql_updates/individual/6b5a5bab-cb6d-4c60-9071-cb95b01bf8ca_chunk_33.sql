      a scream that I shall never forget. I opened my eyes and saw that Mouton
      had sprung at his face and was tearing the skin with his claws as if it
      had been a linen rag. And the blood was streaming down like rain, madame.

“I tried to take the cat away, but he held on tight, scratching all
      the time; and he bit me, he was so crazy. I finally got him and threw him
      out of the window, which was open, for it was summer.

“When I began to bathe my poor friend''s face, I noticed that his
      eyes were destroyed, both his eyes!

“He had to go to the hospital. He died of grief at the end of a
      year. I wanted to keep him with me and provide for him, but he would not
      agree to it. One would have supposed that he hated me after the
      occurrence.

“As for Mouton, his back was broken by the fall, The janitor picked
      up his body. I had him stuffed, for in spite of all I was fond of him. If
      he acted as he did it was because he loved me, was it not?”

The old woman was silent and began to stroke the lifeless animal whose
      body trembled on its iron framework.

Emma, with sorrowful heart, had forgotten about the predicted death—or,
      at least, she did not allude to it again, and she left, giving the woman
      five francs.

As her husband was to return the following day, I did not go to the house
      for several days. When I did go I was surprised at not seeing Misti. I
      asked where he was.

Crazy people attract me. They live in a mysterious land of weird dreams,
      in that impenetrable cloud of dementia where all that they have witnessed
      in their previous life, all they have loved, is reproduced for them in an
      imaginary existence, outside of all laws that govern the things of this
      life and control human thought.

For them there is no such thing as the impossible, nothing is improbable;
      fairyland is a constant quantity and the supernatural quite familiar. The
      old rampart, logic; the old wall, reason; the old main stay of thought,
      good sense, break down, fall and crumble before their imagination, set
      free and escaped into the limitless realm of fancy, and advancing with
      fabulous bounds, and nothing can check it. For them everything happens,
      and anything may happen. They make no effort to conquer events, to
      overcome resistance, to overturn obstacles. By a sudden caprice of their
      flighty imagination they become princes, emperors, or gods, are possessed
      of all the wealth of the world, all the delightful things of life, enjoy
      all pleasures, are always strong, always beautiful, always young, always
      beloved! They, alone, can be happy in this world; for, as far as they are
      concerned, reality does not exist. I love to look into their wandering
      intelligence as one leans over an abyss at the bottom of which seethes a
      foaming torrent whose source and destination are both unknown.

But it is in vain that we lean over these abysses, for we shall never
      discover the source nor the destination of this water. After all, it is
      only water, just like what is flowing in the sunlight, and we shall learn
      nothing by looking at it.

It is likewise of no use to ponder over the intelligence of crazy people,
      for their most weird notions are, in fact, only ideas that are already
      known, which appear strange simply because they are no longer under the
      restraint of reason. Their whimsical source surprises us because we do not
      see it bubbling up. Doubtless the dropping of a little stone into the
      current was sufficient to cause these ebullitions. Nevertheless crazy
      people attract me and I always return to them, drawn in spite of myself by
      this trivial mystery of dementia.

And he opened the door of a cell where a woman of about forty, still
      handsome, was seated in a large armchair, looking persistently at her face
      in a little hand mirror.

As soon as she saw us she rose to her feet, ran to the other end of the
      room, picked up a veil that lay on a chair, wrapped it carefully round her
      face, then came back, nodding her head in reply to our greeting.

“No. I am certain of it. I counted ten pittings more this morning,
      three on the right cheek, four on the left cheek, and three on the
      forehead. It is frightful, frightful! I shall never dare to let any one
      see me, not even my son; no, not even him! I am lost, I am disfigured
      forever.”

“Come, let me see; I assure you it is nothing. With a slight
      cauterization I will make it all disappear.”

She shook her head in denial, without speaking. He tried to touch her
      veil, but she seized it with both hands so violently that her fingers went
      through it.

“Come, you know very well that I remove those horrid pits every time
      and that there is no trace of them after I have treated them. If you do
      not let me see them I cannot cure you.”

“I do not mind your seeing them,” she murmured, “but I
      do not know that gentleman who is with you.”

She then allowed her face to be uncovered, but her dread, her emotion, her
      shame at being seen brought a rosy flush to her face and her neck, down to
      the collar of her dress. She cast down her eyes, turned her face aside,
      first to the right; then to the left, to avoid our gaze and stammered out:

“Oh, it is torture to me to let myself be seen like this! It is
      horrible, is it not? Is it not horrible?”

I looked at her in much surprise, for there was nothing on her face, not a
      mark, not a spot, not a sign of one, nor a scar.

“It was while taking care of my son that I caught this fearful
      disease, monsieur. I saved him, but I am disfigured. I sacrificed my
      beauty to him, to my poor child. However, I did my duty, my conscience is
      at rest. If I suffer it is known only to God.”

She held out her right cheek, and he began by touching it lightly with the
      brush here and there, as though he were putting little points of paint on
      it. He did the same with the left cheek, then with the chin, and the
      forehead, and then exclaimed:

She took up the mirror, gazed at her reflection with profound, eager
      attention, with a strong mental effort to discover something, then she
      sighed:

The doctor had risen. He bowed to her, ushered me out and followed me,
      and, as soon as he had locked the door, said:

Her name is Mme. Hermet. She was once very beautiful, a great coquette,
      very much beloved and very much in-love with life.

She was one of those women who have nothing but their beauty and their
      love of admiration to sustain, guide or comfort them in this life. The
      constant anxiety to retain her freshness, the care of her complexion, of
      her hands, her teeth, of every portion of body that was visible, occupied
      all her time and all her attention.

She became a widow, with one son. The boy was brought up as are all
      children of society beauties. She was, however, very fond of him.

He grew up, and she grew older. Whether she saw the fatal crisis
      approaching, I cannot say. Did she, like so many others, gaze for hours
      and hours at her skin, once so fine, so transparent and free from blemish,
      now beginning to shrivel slightly, to be crossed with a thousand little
      lines, as yet imperceptible, that will grow deeper day by day, month by
      month? Did she also see slowly, but surely, increasing traces of those
      long wrinkles on the forehead, those slender serpents that nothing can
      check? Did she suffer the torture, the abominable torture of the mirror,
      the little mirror with the silver handle which one cannot make up one''s
      mind to lay down on the table, but then throws down in disgust only to
      take it up again in order to look more closely, and still more closely at
      the hateful and insidious approaches of old age? Did she shut herself up
      ten times, twenty times a day, leaving her friends chatting in the
      drawing-room, and go up to her room where, under the protection of bolts
      and bars, she would again contemplate the work of time on her ripe beauty,
      now beginning to wither, and recognize with despair the gradual progress
      of the process which no one else had as yet seemed to perceive, but of
      which she, herself, was well aware. She knows where to seek the most
      serious, the gravest traces of age. And the mirror, the little round
      hand-glass in its carved silver frame, tells her horrible things; for it
      speaks, it seems to laugh, it jeers and tells her all that is going to
      occur, all the physical discomforts and the atrocious mental anguish she
      will suffer until the day of her death, which will be the day of her
      deliverance.

Did she weep, distractedly, on her knees, her forehead to the ground, and
      pray, pray, pray to Him who thus slays his creatures and gives them youth
      only that he may render old age more unendurable, and lends them beauty
      only that he may withdraw it almost immediately? Did she pray to Him,
      imploring Him to do for her what He has never yet done for any one, to let
      her retain until her last day her charm, her freshness and her
      gracefulness? Then, finding that she was imploring in vain an inflexible
      Unknown who drives on the years, one after another, did she roll on the
      carpet in her room, knocking her head against the furniture and stifling
      in her throat shrieks of despair?

He took to his bed without any one being able to determine the cause or
      nature of his illness.

His tutor, a priest, watched beside him and hardly ever left him, while
      Mme. Hermet came morning and evening to inquire how he was.

She would come into the room in the morning in her night wrapper, smiling,
      all powdered and perfumed, and would ask as she entered the door:

She would stay in the room a few seconds, look at the bottles of medicine,
      and purse her lips as if she were saying “phew,” and then
      would suddenly exclaim: “Oh, I forgot something very important,”
      and would run out of the room leaving behind her a fragrance of choice
      toilet perfumes.

In the evening she would appear in a decollete dress, in a still greater
      hurry, for she was always late, and she had just time to inquire:

When her maid came to her room the following morning she noticed at once a
      strong odor of burnt sugar, and she found her mistress, with wide-open
      eyes, her face pale from lack of sleep, and shivering with terror in her
      bed.

She did not rise until noon, when she ate two eggs with a cup of tea, as
      if she herself had been ill, and then she went out to a druggist''s to
      inquire about prophylactic measures against the contagion of small-pox.

She did not come home until dinner time, laden with medicine bottles, and
      shut herself up at once in her room, where she saturated herself with
      disinfectants.

The priest was waiting for her in the dining-room. As soon as she saw him
      she exclaimed in a voice full of emotion:

The next day, as soon as it was light, she sent to inquire for her son,
      but there was no improvement and she spent the whole day in her room,
      where little braziers were giving out pungent odors. Her maid said also
      that you could hear her sighing all the evening.

She spent a whole week in this manner, only going out for an hour or two
      during the afternoon to breathe the air.

On the morning of the eleventh day the priest, having been announced,
      entered her room, his face grave and pale, and said, without taking the
      chair she offered him:

Two hours later as the young lad, feeling himself dying, again asked for
      his mother, the abbe went to her again and found her still on her knees,
      still weeping and repeating:

He tried to persuade her, to strengthen her, to lead her. He only
      succeeded in bringing on an attack of “nerves” that lasted
      some time and caused her to shriek.

The doctor when he came in the evening was told of this cowardice and
      declared that he would bring her in himself, of her own volition, or by
      force. But after trying all manner of argument and just as he seized her
      round the waist to carry her into her son''s room, she caught hold of the
      door and clung to it so firmly that they could not drag her away. Then
      when they let go of her she fell at the feet of the doctor, begging his
      forgiveness and acknowledging that she was a wretched creature. And then
      she exclaimed: “Oh, he is not going to die; tell me that he is not
      going to die, I beg of you; tell him that I love him, that I worship him.
      . .”

The young lad was dying. Feeling that he had only a few moments more to
      live, he entreated that his mother be persuaded to come and bid him a last
      farewell. With that sort of presentiment that the dying sometimes have, he
      had understood, had guessed all, and he said: “If she is afraid to
      come into the room, beg her just to come on the balcony as far as my
      window so that I may see her, at least, so that I may take a farewell look
      at her, as I cannot kiss her.”

The doctor and the abbe, once more, went together to this woman and
      assured her: “You will run no risk, for there will be a pane of
      glass between you and him.”

She consented, covered up her head, and took with her a bottle of smelling
      salts. She took three steps on the balcony; then, all at once, hiding her
      face in her hands, she moaned: “No . . . no . . . I would never dare
      to look at him . . . never. . . . I am too much ashamed . . . too much
      afraid . . . . No . . . I cannot.”

They endeavored to drag her along, but she held on with both hands to the
      railings and uttered such plaints that the passers-by in the street raised
      their heads. And the dying boy waited, his eyes turned towards that
      window, waited to die until he could see for the last time the sweet,
      beloved face, the worshiped face of his mother.

He waited long, and night came on. Then he turned over with his face to
      the wall and was silent.

The Seine flowed past my house, without a ripple on its surface, and
      gleaming in the bright morning sunlight. It was a beautiful, broad,
      indolent silver stream, with crimson lights here and there; and on the
      opposite side of the river were rows of tall trees that covered all the
      bank with an immense wall of verdure.

The sensation of life which is renewed each day, of fresh, happy, loving
      life trembled in the leaves, palpitated in the air, was mirrored in the
      water.

The postman had just brought my papers, which were handed to me, and I
      walked slowly to the river bank in order to read them.

In the first paper I opened I noticed this headline, “Statistics of
      Suicides,” and I read that more than 8,500 persons had killed
      themselves in that year.

In a moment I seemed to see them! I saw this voluntary and hideous
      massacre of the despairing who were weary of life. I saw men bleeding,
      their jaws fractured, their skulls cloven, their breasts pierced by a
      bullet, slowly dying, alone in a little room in a hotel, giving no thought
      to their wound, but thinking only of their misfortunes.

I saw others seated before a tumbler in which some matches were soaking,
      or before a little bottle with a red label.

They would look at it fixedly without moving; then they would drink and
      await the result; then a spasm would convulse their cheeks and draw their
      lips together; their eyes would grow wild with terror, for they did not
      know that the end would be preceded by so much suffering.

They rose to their feet, paused, fell over and with their hands pressed to
      their stomachs they felt their internal organs on fire, their entrails
      devoured by the fiery liquid, before their minds began to grow dim.

I saw others hanging from a nail in the wall, from the fastening of the
      window, from a hook in the ceiling, from a beam in the garret, from a
      branch of a tree amid the evening rain. And I surmised all that had
      happened before they hung there motionless, their tongues hanging out of
      their mouths. I imagined the anguish of their heart, their final
      hesitation, their attempts to fasten the rope, to determine that it was
      secure, then to pass the noose round their neck and to let themselves
      fall.

I saw others lying on wretched beds, mothers with their little children,
      old men dying of hunger, young girls dying for love, all rigid,
      suffocated, asphyxiated, while in the center of the room the brasier still
      gave forth the fumes of charcoal.

And I saw others walking at night along the deserted bridges. These were
      the most sinister. The water flowed under the arches with a low sound.
      They did not see it . . . they guessed at it from its cool breath! They
      longed for it and they feared it. They dared not do it! And yet, they
      must. A distant clock sounded the hour and, suddenly, in the vast silence
      of the night, there was heard the splash of a body falling into the river,
      a scream or two, the sound of hands beating the water, and all was still.
      Sometimes, even, there was only the sound of the falling body when they
      had tied their arms down or fastened a stone to their feet. Oh, the poor
      things, the poor things, the poor things, how I felt their anguish, how I
      died in their death! I went through all their wretchedness; I endured in
      one hour all their tortures. I knew all the sorrows that had led them to
      this, for I know the deceitful infamy of life, and no one has felt it more
      than I have.

How I understood them, these who weak, harassed by misfortune, having lost
      those they loved, awakened from the dream of a tardy compensation, from
      the illusion of another existence where God will finally be just, after
      having been ferocious, and their minds disabused of the mirages of
      happiness, have given up the fight and desire to put an end to this
      ceaseless tragedy, or this shameful comedy.

Suicide! Why, it is the strength of those whose strength is exhausted, the
      hope of those who no longer believe, the sublime courage of the conquered!
      Yes, there is at least one door to this life we can always open and pass
      through to the other side. Nature had an impulse of pity; she did not shut
      us up in prison. Mercy for the despairing!

As for those who are simply disillusioned, let them march ahead with free
      soul and quiet heart. They have nothing to fear since they may take their
      leave; for behind them there is always this door that the gods of our
      illusions cannot even lock.

I thought of this crowd of suicides: more than eight thousand five hundred
      in one year. And it seemed to me that they had combined to send to the
      world a prayer, to utter a cry of appeal, to demand something that should
      come into effect later when we understood things better. It seemed to me
      that all these victims, their throats cut, poisoned, hung, asphyxiated, or
      drowned, all came together, a frightful horde, like citizens to the polls,
      to say to society:

“Grant us, at least, a gentle death! Help us to die, you who will
      not help us to live! See, we are numerous, we have the right to speak in
      these days of freedom, of philosophic independence and of popular
      suffrage. Give to those who renounce life the charity of a death that will
      not be repugnant nor terrible.”

I began to dream, allowing my fancy to roam at will in weird and
      mysterious fashion on this subject.

I seemed to be all at once in a beautiful city. It was Paris; but at what
      period? I walked about the streets, looking at the houses, the theaters,
      the public buildings, and presently found myself in a square where I
      remarked a large building; very handsome, dainty and attractive. I was
      surprised on reading on the facade this inscription in letters of gold,
      “Suicide Bureau.”

Oh, the weirdness of waking dreams where the spirit soars into a world of
      unrealities and possibilities! Nothing astonishes one, nothing shocks one;
      and the unbridled fancy makes no distinction between the comic and the
      tragic.

I approached the building where footmen in knee-breeches were seated in
      the vestibule in front of a cloak-room as they do at the entrance of a
      club.

He took me through corridors where old gentlemen were chatting, and
      finally led me into a beautiful office, somewhat somber, furnished
      throughout in black wood. A stout young man with a corporation was writing
      a letter as he smoked a cigar, the fragrance of which gave evidence of its
      quality.

“Monsieur,” I replied, “pardon my curiosity. I had never
      seen this establishment. The few words inscribed on the facade filled me
      with astonishment, and I wanted to know what was going on here.”

“Mon Dieu, monsieur, we put to death in a cleanly and gentle—I
      do not venture to say agreeable manner those persons who desire to die.”

I did not feel very shocked, for it really seemed to me natural and right.
      What particularly surprised me was that on this planet, with its low,
      utilitarian, humanitarian ideals, selfish and coercive of all true
      freedom, any one should venture on a similar enterprise, worthy of an
      emancipated humanity.

“Monsieur,” he replied, “the number of suicides
      increased so enormously during the five years succeeding the world
      exposition of 1889 that some measures were urgently needed. People killed
      themselves in the streets, at fetes, in restaurants, at the theater, in
      railway carriages, at the receptions held by the President of the
      Republic, everywhere. It was not only a horrid sight for those who love
      life, as I do, but also a bad example for children. Hence it became
      necessary to centralize suicides.”

“I do not know. The fact is, I believe, the world is growing old.
      People begin to see things clearly and they are getting disgruntled. It is
      the same to-day with destiny as with the government, we have found out
      what it is; people find that they are swindled in every direction, and
      they just get out of it all. When one discovers that Providence lies,
      cheats, robs, deceives human beings just as a plain Deputy deceives his
      constituents, one gets angry, and as one cannot nominate a fresh
      Providence every three months as we do with our privileged
      representatives, one just gets out of the whole thing, which is decidedly
      bad.”

“Yes, monsieur, founded by the most eminent men in the country, by
      men of the highest intellect and brightest intelligence. And,” he
      added, laughing heartily, “I swear to you that every one gets a
      great deal of enjoyment out of it.”

“Mon Dieu, they enjoy themselves because they have not that fear of
      death which is the great killjoy in all our earthly pleasures.”

“I will explain. In view of the enormous increase in suicides, and
      of the hideous spectacle they presented, a purely benevolent society was
      formed for the protection of those in despair, which placed at their
      disposal the facilities for a peaceful, painless, if not unforeseen death.”

“General Boulanger during his brief tenure of power. He could never
      refuse anything. However, that was the only good thing he did. Hence, a
      society was formed of clear-sighted, disillusioned skeptics who desired to
      erect in the heart of Paris a kind of temple dedicated to the contempt for
      death. This place was formerly a dreaded spot that no one ventured to
      approach. Then its founders, who met together here, gave a grand inaugural
      entertainment with Mmes. Sarah Bernhardt, Judic, Theo, Granier, and twenty
      others, and Mme. de Reske, Coquelin, Mounet-Sully, Paulus, etc., present,
      followed by concerts, the comedies of Dumas, of Meilhac, Halevy and
      Sardon. We had only one thing to mar it, one drama by Becque which seemed
      sad, but which subsequently had a great success at the Comedie-Francaise.
      In fact all Paris came. The enterprise was launched.”

“Not at all. Death need not be sad, it should be a matter of
      indifference. We made death cheerful, crowned it with flowers, covered it
      with perfume, made it easy. One learns to aid others through example; one
      can see that it is nothing.”

“I can well understand that they should come to the entertainments;
      but did they come to . . . Death?”

“In crowds. We have had more than forty in a day. One finds hardly
      any more drowned bodies in the Seine.”

“I don''t think so. A man who was sick of everything, a ''down and
      out'' who had lost heavily at baccarat for three months.”

“The second was an Englishman, an eccentric. We then advertised in
      the papers, we gave an account of our methods, we invented some attractive
      instances. But the great impetus was given by poor people.”

He took his hat, opened the door, allowed me to precede him, and we
      entered a card room, where men sat playing as they, play in all gambling
      places. They were chatting cheerfully, eagerly. I have seldom seen such a
      jolly, lively, mirthful club.

“Oh, the establishment has an unheard of prestige. All the smart
      people all over the world belong to it so as to appear as though they held
      death in scorn. Then, once they get here, they feel obliged to be cheerful
      that they may not appear to be afraid. So they joke and laugh and talk
      flippantly, they are witty and they become so. At present it is certainly
      the most frequented and the most entertaining place in Paris. The women
      are even thinking of building an annex for themselves.”

“As I said, about forty or fifty a day. Society people are rare, but
      poor devils abound. The middle class has also a large contingent.

“A gas of our own invention. We have the patent. On the other side
      of the building are the public entrances—three little doors opening
      on small streets. When a man or a woman present themselves they are
      interrogated. Then they are offered assistance, aid, protection. If a
      client accepts, inquiries are made; and sometimes we have saved their
      lives.”

“We have a great deal. There are a large number of shareholders.
      Besides it is fashionable to contribute to the establishment. The names of
      the donors are published in Figaro. Then the suicide of every rich man
      costs a thousand francs. And they look as if they were lying in state. It
      costs the poor nothing.”

“Oh, oh, monsieur, we can guess! And, besides, they must bring a
      certificate of indigency from the commissary of police of their district.
      If you knew how distressing it is to see them come in! I visited their
      part of our building once only, and I will never go again. The place
      itself is almost as good as this part, almost as luxurious and
      comfortable; but they themselves . . . they themselves!!! If you could see
      them arriving, the old men in rags coming to die; persons who have been
      dying of misery for months, picking up their food at the edges of the
      curbstone like dogs in the street; women in rags, emaciated, sick,
      paralyzed, incapable of making a living, who say to us after they have
      told us their story: ''You see that things cannot go on like that, as I
      cannot work any longer or earn anything.'' I saw one woman of eighty-seven
      who had lost all her children and grandchildren, and who for the last six
      weeks had been sleeping out of doors. It made me ill to hear of it. Then
      we have so many different cases, without counting those who say nothing,
      but simply ask: ''Where is it?'' These are admitted at once and it is all
      over in a minute.”

“Go in; this is the part specially reserved for club members, and
      the one least used. We have so far had only eleven annihilations here.”

I hesitated. At length I went in. It was a wide corridor, a sort of
      greenhouse in which panes of glass of pale blue, tender pink and delicate
      green gave the poetic charm of landscapes to the inclosing walls. In this
      pretty salon there were divans, magnificent palms, flowers, especially
      roses of balmy fragrance, books on the tables, the Revue des Deuxmondes,
      cigars in government boxes, and, what surprised me, Vichy pastilles in a
      bonbonniere.

“Oh, they often come here to chat.” He continued: “The
      public corridors are similar, but more simply furnished.”

In reply to a question of mine, he pointed to a couch covered with creamy
      crepe de Chine with white embroidery, beneath a large shrub of unknown
      variety at the foot of which was a circular bed of mignonette.

“We change the flower and the perfume at will, for our gas, which is
      quite imperceptible, gives death the fragrance of the suicide''s favorite
      flower. It is volatilized with essences. Would you like to inhale it for a
      second?”

A little uneasy I seated myself on the low couch covered with crepe de
      Chine and stretched myself full length, and was at once bathed in a
      delicious odor of mignonette. I opened my mouth in order to breathe it in,
      for my mind had already become stupefied and forgetful of the past and was
      a prey, in the first stages of asphyxia, to the enchanting intoxication of
      a destroying and magic opium.

“Oh, oh, monsieur,” said the secretary, laughing, “it
      looks to me as if you were almost caught.”

But a voice, a real voice, and no longer a dream voice, greeted me with
      the peasant intonation:

My dream was over. I saw the Seine distinctly in the sunlight, and, coming
      along a path, the garde champetre of the district, who with his right hand
      touched his kepi braided in silver. I replied:

“I am going to look at a drowned man whom they fished up near the
      Morillons. Another who has thrown himself into the soup. He even took off
      his trousers in order to tie his legs together with them.”' WHERE id = '6b5a5bab-cb6d-4c60-9071-cb95b01bf8ca';
