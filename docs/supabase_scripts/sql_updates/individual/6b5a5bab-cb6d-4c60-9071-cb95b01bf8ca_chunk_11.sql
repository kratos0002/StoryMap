      ''should like——'' He said no more, and I could think of nothing
      to propose to him, and there was silence except for the noise of the
      plates and that vague sound of eating.

“Now, the abbe, who was listening behind the door, seeing our
      embarrassment, and thinking we had won the game, thought the time had come
      to interpose, and showed himself. My uncle was so stupefied at sight of
      him that at first he remained motionless; and then he opened his mouth as
      if he meant to swallow up the priest, and shouted to him in a strong,
      deep, furious voice: ''What are you doing here?''

“The abbe, who was used to difficult situations, came forward into
      the room, murmuring: ''I have come in your sister''s name, Monsieur le
      Marquis; she has sent me. She would be happy, monsieur—''

“But the marquis was not listening. Raising one hand, he pointed to
      the door with a proud, tragic gesture, and said angrily and breathing
      hard: ''Leave this room—go out—robber of souls. Go out from
      here, you violator of consciences. Go out from here, you pick-lock of
      dying men''s doors!''

“The abbe retreated, and I also went to the door, beating a retreat
      with the priest; the two young women, who had the best of it, got up,
      leaving their omelette only half eaten, and went and stood on either side
      of my uncle''s easy-chair, putting their hands on his arms to calm him, and
      to protect him against the criminal enterprises of the Family, and of
      Religion.

“The abbe and I rejoined my mother in the kitchen, and Melanie again
      offered us chairs. ''I knew quite well that this method would not work; we
      must try some other means, otherwise he will escape us.'' And they began
      deliberating afresh, my mother being of one opinion and the abbe of
      another, while I held a third.

“We had been discussing the matter in a low voice for half an hour,
      perhaps, when a great noise of furniture being moved and of cries uttered
      by my uncle, more vehement and terrible even than the former had been,
      made us all four jump up.

“Through the doors and walls we could hear him shouting: ''Go out—out
      —rascals—humbugs, get out, scoundrels—get out—get
      out!''

“Melanie rushed in, but came back immediately to call me to help
      her, and I hastened in. Opposite to my uncle, who was terribly excited by
      anger, almost standing up and vociferating, stood two men, one behind the
      other, who seemed to be waiting till he should be dead with rage.

“By his ridiculous long coat, his long English shoes, his manners of
      a tutor out of a position, his high collar, white necktie and straight
      hair, his humble face of a false priest of a bastard religion, I
      immediately recognized the first as a Protestant minister.

“The second was the porter of the house, who belonged to the
      reformed religion and had followed us, and having seen our defeat, had
      gone to fetch his own pastor, in hopes that he might meet a better
      reception. My uncle seemed mad with rage! If the sight of the Catholic
      priest, of the priest of his ancestors, had irritated the Marquis de
      Fumerol, who had become a freethinker, the sight of his porter''s minister
      made him altogether beside himself. I therefore took the two men by the
      arm and threw them out of the room so roughly that they bumped against
      each other twice, between the two doors which led to the staircase; and
      then I disappeared in my turn and returned to the kitchen, which was our
      headquarters in order to take counsel with my mother and the abbe.

“My mother rushed out. My uncle had fallen to the ground, and lay
      full length along the floor, without moving. I fancy he was already dead.
      My mother was superb at that moment! She went straight up to the two girls
      who were kneeling by the body and trying to raise it up, and pointing to
      the door with irresistible authority, dignity and majesty, she said: ''Now
      it is time for you to leave the room.''

“And they went out without a word of protest. I must add, that I was
      getting ready to turn them out as unceremoniously as I had done the parson
      and the porter.

“Then the Abbe Poivron administered the last sacraments to my uncle
      with all the customary prayers, and remitted all his sins, while my mother
      sobbed as she knelt near her brother. Suddenly, however, she exclaimed:
      ''He recognized me; he pressed my hand; I am sure he recognized me!!!—and
      that he thanked me! Oh, God, what happiness!''

“''Madame,'' Melanie said, ''we have no sheets to bury him in; all the
      linen belongs to these two young ladies,'' and when I looked at the
      omelette which they had not finished, I felt inclined to laugh and to cry
      at the same time. There are some humorous moments and some humorous
      situations in life, occasionally!

“We gave my uncle a magnificent funeral, with five speeches at the
      grave. Baron de Croiselles, the senator, showed in admirable terms that
      God always returns victorious into well-born souls which have temporarily
      been led into error. All the members of the Royalist and Catholic party
      followed the funeral procession with the enthusiasm of victors, as they
      spoke of that beautiful death after a somewhat troublous life.”

Viscount Roger ceased speaking; his audience was laughing. Then somebody
      said: “Bah! That is the story of all conversions in extremis.”

On the morning of July 8th I received the following telegram: “Fine
      day. Always my predictions. Belgian frontier. Baggage and servants left at
      noon at the social session. Beginning of manoeuvres at three. So I will
      wait for you at the works from five o''clock on. Jovis.”

At five o''clock sharp I entered the gas works of La Villette. It might
      have been mistaken for the colossal ruins of an old town inhabited by
      Cyclops. There were immense dark avenues separating heavy gasometers
      standing one behind another, like monstrous columns, unequally high and,
      undoubtedly, in the past the supports of some tremendous, some fearful
      iron edifice.

The balloon was lying in the courtyard and had the appearance of a cake
      made of yellow cloth, flattened on the ground under a rope. That is called
      placing a balloon in a sweep-net, and, in fact, it appeared like an
      enormous fish.

Two or three hundred people were looking at it, sitting or standing, and
      some were examining the basket, a nice little square basket for a human
      cargo, bearing on its side in gold letters on a mahogany plate the words:
      Le Horla.

Suddenly the people began to stand back, for the gas was beginning to
      enter into the balloon through a long tube of yellow cloth, which lay on
      the soil, swelling and undulating like an enormous worm. But another
      thought, another picture occurs to every mind. It is thus that nature
      itself nourishes beings until their birth. The creature that will rise
      soon begins to move, and the attendants of Captain Jovis, as Le Horla grew
      larger, spread and put in place the net which covers it, so that the
      pressure will be regular and equally distributed at every point.

The operation is very delicate and very important, for the resistance of
      the cotton cloth of which the balloon is made is figured not in proportion
      to the contact surface of this cloth with the net, but in proportion to
      the links of the basket.

Le Horla, moreover, has been designed by M. Mallet, constructed under his
      own eyes and made by himself. Everything had been made in the shops of M.
      Jovis by his own working staff and nothing was made outside.

We must add that everything was new in this balloon, from the varnish to
      the valve, those two essential parts of a balloon. Both must render the
      cloth gas-proof, as the sides of a ship are waterproof. The old varnishes,
      made with a base of linseed oil, sometimes fermented and thus burned the
      cloth, which in a short time would tear like a piece of paper.

The valves were apt to close imperfectly after being opened and when the
      covering called “cataplasme” was injured. The fall of M.
      L''Hoste in the open sea during the night proved the imperfection of the
      old system.

The two discoveries of Captain Jovis, the varnish principally, are of
      inestimable value in the art of ballooning.

The crowd has begun to talk, and some men, who appear to be specialists,
      affirm with authority that we shall come down before reaching the
      fortifications. Several other things have been criticized in this novel
      type of balloon with which we are about to experiment with so much
      pleasure and success.

It is growing slowly but surely. Some small holes and scratches made in
      transit have been discovered, and we cover them and plug them with a
      little piece of paper applied on the cloth while wet. This method of
      repairing alarms and mystifies the public.

While Captain Jovis and his assistants are busy with the last details, the
      travellers go to dine in the canteen of the gas-works, according to the
      established custom.

When we come out again the balloon is swaying, enormous and transparent, a
      prodigious golden fruit, a fantastic pear which is still ripening, covered
      by the last rays of the setting sun. Now the basket is attached, the
      barometers are brought, the siren, which we will blow to our hearts''
      content, is also brought, also the two trumpets, the eatables, the
      overcoats and raincoats, all the small articles that can go with the men
      in that flying basket.

As the wind pushes the balloon against the gasometers, it is necessary to
      steady it now and then, to avoid an accident at the start.

Lieutenant Mallet jumps aboard, climbing first on the aerial net between
      the basket and the balloon, from which he will watch during the night the
      movements of Le Horla across the skies, as the officer on watch, standing
      on starboard, watches the course of a ship.

M. Etierine Beer gets in after him, then comes M. Paul Bessand, then M.
      Patrice Eyries and I get in last.

But the basket is too heavy for the balloon, considering the long trip to
      be taken, and M. Eyries has to get out, not without great regret.

M. Joliet, standing erect on the edge of the basket, begs the ladies, in
      very gallant terms, to stand aside a little, for he is afraid he might
      throw sand on their hats in rising. Then he commands:

“Let it loose,” and, cutting with one stroke of his knife the
      ropes that hold the balloon to the ground, he gives Le Horla its liberty.

In one second we fly skyward. Nothing can be heard; we float, we rise, we
      fly, we glide. Our friends shout with glee and applaud, but we hardly hear
      them, we hardly see them. We are already so far, so high! What? Are we
      really leaving these people down there? Is it possible? Paris spreads out
      beneath us, a dark bluish patch, cut by its streets, from which rise, here
      and there, domes, towers, steeples, then around it the plain, the country,
      traversed by long roads, thin and white, amidst green fields of a tender
      or dark green, and woods almost black.

The Seine appears like a coiled snake, asleep, of which we see neither
      head nor tail; it crosses Paris, and the entire field resembles an immense
      basin of prairies and forests dotted here and there by mountains, hardly
      visible in the horizon.

The sun, which we could no longer see down below, now reappears as though
      it were about to rise again, and our balloon seems to be lighted; it must
      appear like a star to the people who are looking up. M. Mallet every few
      seconds throws a cigarette paper intospace and says quietly: “We
      are rising, always rising,” while Captain Jovis, radiant with joy,
      rubs his hands together and repeats: “Eh? this varnish? Isn''t it
      good?”

In fact, we can see whether we are rising or sinking only by throwing a
      cigarette paper out of the basket now and then. If this paper appears to
      fall down like a stone, it means that the balloon is rising; if it appears
      to shoot skyward the balloon is descending.

The two barometers mark about five hundred meters, and we gaze with
      enthusiastic admiration at the earth we are leaving and to which we are
      not attached in any way; it looks like a colored map, an immense plan of
      the country. All its noises, however, rise to our ears very distinctly,
      easily recognizable. We hear the sound of the wheels rolling in the
      streets, the snap of a whip, the cries of drivers, the rolling and
      whistling of trains and the laughter of small boys running after one
      another. Every time we pass over a village the noise of children''s voices
      is heard above the rest and with the greatest distinctness. Some men are
      calling us; the locomotives whistle; we answer with the siren, which emits
      plaintive, fearfully shrill wails like the voice of a weird being
      wandering through the world.

We perceive lights here and there, some isolated fire in the farms, and
      lines of gas in the towns. We are going toward the northwest, after
      roaming for some time over the little lake of Enghien. Now we see a river;
      it is the Oise, and we begin to argue about the exact spot we are passing.
      Is that town Creil or Pontoise—the one with so many lights? But if
      we were over Pontoise we could see the junction of the Seine and the Oise;
      and that enormous fire to the left, isn''t it the blast furnaces of
      Montataire? So then we are above Creil. The view is superb; it is dark on
      the earth, but we are still in the light, and it is now past ten o''clock.
      Now we begin to hear slight country noises, the double cry of the quail in
      particular, then the mewing of cats and the barking of dogs. Surely the
      dogs have scented the balloon; they have seen it and have given the alarm.
      We can hear them barking all over the plain and making the identical noise
      they make when baying at the moon. The cows also seem to wake up in the
      barns, for we can hear them lowing; all the beasts are scared and moved
      before the aerial monster that is passing.

The delicious odors of the soil rise toward us, the smell of hay, of
      flowers, of the moist, verdant earth, perfuming the air-a light air, in
      fact, so light, so sweet, so delightful that I realize I never was so
      fortunate as to breathe before. A profound sense of well-being, unknown to
      me heretofore, pervades me, a well-being of body and spirit, composed of
      supineness, of infinite rest, of forgetfulness, of indifference to
      everything and of this novel sensation of traversing space without any of
      the sensations that make motion unbearable, without noise, without shocks
      and without fear.

At times we rise and then descend. Every few minutes Lieutenant Mallet,
      suspended in his cobweb of netting, says to Captain Jovis: “We are
      descending; throw down half a handful.” And the captain, who is
      talking and laughing with us, with a bag of ballast between his legs,
      takes a handful of sand out of the bag and throws it overboard.

Nothing is more amusing, more delicate, more interesting than the
      manoeuvring of a balloon. It is an enormous toy, free and docile, which
      obeys with surprising sensitiveness, but it is also, and before all, the
      slave of the wind, which we cannot control. A pinch of sand, half a sheet
      of paper, one or two drops of water, the bones of a chicken which we had
      just eaten, thrown overboard, makes it go up quickly.

A breath of cool, damp air rising from the river or the wood we are
      traversing makes the balloon descend two hundred metres. It does not vary
      when passing over fields of ripe grain, and it rises when it passes over
      towns.

The earth sleeps now, or, rather, men sleep on the earth, for the beasts
      awakened by the sight of our balloon announce our approach everywhere. Now
      and then the rolling of a train or the whistling of a locomotive is
      plainly distinguishable. We sound our siren as we pass over inhabited
      places; and the peasants, terrified in their beds, must surely tremble and
      ask themselves if the Angel Gabriel is not passing by.

A strong and continuous odor of gas can be plainly observed. We must have
      encountered a current of warm air, and the balloon expands, losing its
      invisible blood by the escape-valve, which is called the appendix, and
      which closes of itself as soon as the expansion ceases.

We are rising. The earth no longer gives back the echo of our trumpets; we
      have risen almost two thousand feet. It is not light enough for us to
      consult the instruments; we only know that the rice paper falls from us
      like dead butterflies, that we are rising, always rising. We can no longer
      see the earth; a light mist separates us from it; and above our head
      twinkles a world of stars.

A silvery light appears before us and makes the sky turn pale, and
      suddenly, as if it were rising from unknown depths behind the horizon
      below us rises the moon on the edge of a cloud. It seems to be coming from
      below, while we are looking down upon it from a great height, leaning on
      the edge of our basket like an audience on a balcony. Clear and round, it
      emerges from the clouds and slowly rises in the sky.

The earth no longer seems to exist, it is buried in milky vapors that
      resemble a sea. We are now alone in space with the moon, which looks like
      another balloon travelling opposite us; and our balloon, which shines in
      the air, appears like another, larger moon, a world wandering in the sky
      amid the stars, through infinity. We no longer speak, think nor live; we
      float along through space in delicious inertia. The air which is bearing
      us up has made of us all beings which resemble itself, silent, joyous,
      irresponsible beings, intoxicated by this stupendous flight, peculiarly
      alert, although motionless. One is no longer conscious of one''s flesh or
      one''s bones; one''s heart seems to have ceased beating; we have become
      something indescribable, birds who do not even have to flap their wings.

All memory has disappeared from our minds, all trouble from our thoughts;
      we have no more regrets, plans nor hopes. We look, we feel, we wildly
      enjoy this fantastic journey; nothing in the sky but the moon and
      ourselves! We are a wandering, travelling world, like our sisters, the
      planets; and this little world carries five men who have left the earth
      and who have almost forgotten it. We can now see as plainly as in
      daylight; we look at each other, surprised at this brightness, for we have
      nothing to look at but ourselves and a few silvery clouds floating below
      us. The barometers mark twelve hundred metres, then thirteen, fourteen,
      fifteen hundred; and the little rice papers still fall about us.

Captain Jovis claims that the moon has often made balloons act thus, and
      that the upward journey will continue.

We are now at two thousand metres; we go up to two thousand three hundred
      and fifty; then the balloon stops: We blow the siren and are surprised
      that no one answers us from the stars.

We are now going down rapidly. M. Mallet keeps crying: “Throw out
      more ballast! throw out more ballast!” And the sand and stones that
      we throw over come back into our faces, as if they were going up, thrown
      from below toward the stars, so rapid is our descent.

Here is the earth! Where are we? It is now past midnight, and we are
      crossing a broad, dry, well-cultivated country, with many roads and well
      populated.

To the right is a large city and farther away to the left is another. But
      suddenly from the earth appears a bright fairy light; it disappears,
      reappears and once more disappears. Jovis, intoxicated by space, exclaims:
      “Look, look at this phenomenon of the moon in the water. One can see
      nothing more beautiful at night!”

Nothing indeed can give one an idea of the wonderful brightness of these
      spots of light which are not fire, which do not look like reflections,
      which appear quickly here or there and immediately go out again. These
      shining lights appear on the winding rivers at every turn, but one hardly
      has time to see them as the balloon passes as quickly as the wind.

We are now quite near the earth, and Beer exclaims:—“Look at
      that! What is that running over there in the fields? Isn''t it a dog?”
      Indeed, something is running along the ground with great speed, and this
      something seems to jump over ditches, roads, trees with such ease that we
      could not understand what it might be. The captain laughed: “It is
      the shadow of our balloon. It will grow as we descend.”

I distinctly hear a great noise of foundries in the distance. And,
      according to the polar star, which we have been observing all night, ''and
      which I have so often watched and consulted from the bridge of my little
      yacht on the Mediterranean, we are heading straight for Belgium.

Our siren and our two horns are continually calling. A few cries from some
      truck driver or belated reveler answer us. We bellow: “Where are we?”
      But the balloon is going so rapidly that the bewildered man has not even
      time to answer us. The growing shadow of Le Horla, as large as a child''s
      ball, is fleeing before us over the fields, roads and woods. It goes along
      steadily, preceding us by about a quarter of a mile; and now I am leaning
      out of the basket, listening to the roaring of the wind in the trees and
      across the harvest fields. I say to Captain Jovis: “How the wind
      blows!”

He answers: “No, those are probably waterfalls.” I insist,
      sure of my ear that knows the sound of the wind, from hearing it so often
      whistle through the rigging. Then Jovis nudges me; he fears to frighten
      his happy, quiet passengers, for he knows full well that a storm is
      pursuing us.

At last a man manages to understand us; he answers: “Nord!” We
      get the same reply from another.

Suddenly the lights of a town, which seems to be of considerable size,
      appear before us. Perhaps it is Lille. As we approach it, such a wonderful
      flow of fire appears below us that I think myself transported into some
      fairyland where precious stones are manufactured for giants.

It seems that it is a brick factory. Here are others, two, three. The
      fusing material bubbles, sparkles, throws out blue, red, yellow, green
      sparks, reflections from giant diamonds, rubies, emeralds, turquoises,
      sapphires, topazes. And near by are great foundries roaring like
      apocalyptic lions; high chimneys belch forth their clouds of smoke and
      flame, and we can hear the noise of metal striking against metal.

We were not mistaken. We are already out of sight of the town, and we see
      Roubaix to the right, then some well-cultivated, rectangular fields, of
      different colors according to the crops, some yellow, some gray or brown.
      But the clouds are gathering behind us, hiding the moon, whereas toward
      the east the sky is growing lighter, becoming a clear blue tinged with
      red. It is dawn. It grows rapidly, now showing us all the little details
      of the earth, the trains, the brooks, the cows, the goats. And all this
      passes beneath us with surprising speed. One hardly has time to notice
      that other fields, other meadows, other houses have already disappeared.
      Cocks are crowing, but the voice of ducks drowns everything. One might
      think the world to be peopled, covered with them, they make so much noise.

The early rising peasants are waving their arms and crying to us: “Let
      yourselves drop!” But we go along steadily, neither rising nor
      falling, leaning over the edge of the basket and watching the world
      fleeing under our feet.

Jovis sights another city far off in the distance. It approaches;
      everywhere are old church spires. They are delightful, seen thus from
      above. Where are we? Is this Courtrai? Is it Ghent?

We are already very near it, and we see that it is surrounded by water and
      crossed in every direction by canals. One might think it a Venice of the
      north. Just as we are passing so near to a church tower that our long
      guy-rope almost touches it, the chimes begin to ring three o''clock. The
      sweet, clear sounds rise to us from this frail roof which we have almost
      touched in our wandering course. It is a charming greeting, a friendly
      welcome from Holland. We answer with our siren, whose raucous voice echoes
      throughout the streets.

It was Bruges. But we have hardly lost sight of it when my neighbor, Paul
      Bessand, asks me: “Don''t you see something over there, to the right,
      in front of us? It looks like a river.”

And, indeed, far ahead of us stretches a bright highway, in the light of
      the dawning day. Yes, it looks like a river, an immense river full of
      islands.

“Get ready for the descent,” cried the captain. He makes M.
      Mallet leave his net and return to the basket; then we pack the barometers
      and everything that could be injured by possible shocks. M. Bessand
      exclaims: “Look at the masts over there to the left! We are at the
      sea!”

Fogs had hidden it from us until then. The sea was everywhere, to the left
      and opposite us, while to our right the Scheldt, which had joined the
      Moselle, extended as far as the sea, its mouths vaster than a lake.

It was necessary to descend within a minute or two. The rope to the
      escape-valve, which had been religiously enclosed in a little white bag
      and placed in sight of all so that no one would touch it, is unrolled, and
      M. Mallet holds it in his hand while Captain Jovis looks for a favorable
      landing.

We were passing over a canal. The basket trembled and tipped over
      slightly. The guy-rope touched the tall trees on both banks. But our speed
      is so great that the long rope now trailing does not seem to slow down,
      and we pass with frightful rapidity over a large farm, from which the
      bewildered chickens, pigeons and ducks fly away, while the cows, cats and
      dogs run, terrified, toward the house.

Just one-half bag of ballast is left. Jovis throws it overboard, and Le
      Horla flies lightly across the roof.

M. Mallet reaches for the rope and hangs to it, and we drop like an arrow.
      With a slash of a knife the cord which retains the anchor is cut, and we
      drag this grapple behind us, through a field of beets. Here are the trees.

The basket does indeed strike the earth. Then it flies up again. Once more
      it falls and bounds upward again, and at last it settles on the ground,
      while the balloon struggles madly, like a wounded beast.

Peasants run toward us, but they do not dare approach. They were a long
      time before they decided to come and deliver us, for one cannot set foot
      on the ground until the bag is almost completely deflated.

Then, almost at the same time as the bewildered men, some of whom showed
      their astonishment by jumping, with the wild gestures of savages, all the
      cows that were grazing along the coast came toward us, surrounding our
      balloon with a strange and comical circle of horns, big eyes and blowing
      nostrils.

With the help of the accommodating and hospitable Belgian peasants, we
      were able in a short time to pack up all our material and carry it to the
      station at Heyst, where at twenty minutes past eight we took the train for
      Paris.

The descent occurred at three-fifteen in the morning, preceding by only a
      few seconds the torrent of rain and the blinding lightning of the storm
      which had been chasing us before it.

Thanks to Captain Jovis, of whom I had heard much from my colleague, Paul
      Ginisty—for both of them had fallen together and voluntarily into
      the sea opposite Mentone—thanks to this brave man, we were able to
      see, in a single night, from far up in the sky, the setting of the sun,
      the rising of the moon and the dawn of day and to go from Paris to the
      mouth of the Scheldt through the skies.

The two friends were getting near the end of their dinner. Through the
      cafe windows they could see the Boulevard, crowded with people. They could
      feel the gentle breezes which are wafted over Paris on warm summer
      evenings and make you feel like going out somewhere, you care not where,
      under the trees, and make you dream of moonlit rivers, of fireflies and of
      larks.

“Ah! I am growing old. It''s sad. Formerly, on evenings like this, I
      felt full of life. Now, I only feel regrets. Life is short!”

“Well, my boy, I have grown old without noticing it in the least. I
      have always been merry, healthy, vigorous and all the rest. As one sees
      oneself in the mirror every day, one does not realize the work of age, for
      it is slow, regular, and it modifies the countenance so gently that the
      changes are unnoticeable. It is for this reason alone that we do not die
      of sorrow after two or three years of excitement. For we cannot understand
      the alterations which time produces. In order to appreciate them one would
      have to remain six months without seeing one''s own face —then, oh,
      what a shock!

“And the women, my friend, how I pity the poor beings! All their
      joy, all their power, all their life, lies in their beauty, which lasts
      ten years.

“As I said, I aged without noticing it; I thought myself practically
      a youth, when I was almost fifty years old. Not feeling the slightest
      infirmity, I went about, happy and peaceful.

“The revelation of my decline came to me in a simple and terrible
      manner, which overwhelmed me for almost six months—then I became
      resigned.

“I met her at the seashore, at Etretat, about twelve years ago,
      shortly after the war. There is nothing prettier than this beach during
      the morning bathing hour. It is small, shaped like a horseshoe, framed by
      high white cliffs, which are pierced by strange holes called the ''Portes,''
      one stretching out into the ocean like the leg of a giant, the other short
      and dumpy. The women gather on the narrow strip of sand in this frame of
      high rocks, which they make into a gorgeous garden of beautiful gowns. The
      sun beats down on the shores, on the multicolored parasols, on the
      blue-green sea; and all is gay, delightful, smiling. You sit down at the
      edge of the water and you watch the bathers. The women come down, wrapped
      in long bath robes, which they throw off daintily when they reach the
      foamy edge of the rippling waves; and they run into the water with a rapid
      little step, stopping from time to time for a delightful little thrill
      from the cold water, a short gasp.

“Very few stand the test of the bath. It is there that they can be
      judged, from the ankle to the throat. Especially on leaving the water are
      the defects revealed, although water is a powerful aid to flabby skin.

“The first time that I saw this young woman in the water, I was
      delighted, entranced. She stood the test well. There are faces whose
      charms appeal to you at first glance and delight you instantly. You seem
      to have found the woman whom you were born to love. I had that feeling and
      that shock.

“I was introduced, and was soon smitten worse than I had ever been
      before. My heart longed for her. It is a terrible yet delightful thing
      thus to be dominated by a young woman. It is almost torture, and yet
      infinite delight. Her look, her smile, her hair fluttering in the wind,
      the little lines of her face, the slightest movement of her features,
      delighted me, upset me, entranced me. She had captured me, body and soul,
      by her gestures, her manners, even by her clothes, which seemed to take on
      a peculiar charm as soon as she wore them. I grew tender at the sight of
      her veil on some piece of furniture, her gloves thrown on a chair. Her
      gowns seemed to me inimitable. Nobody had hats like hers.

“She was married, but her husband came only on Saturday, and left on
      Monday. I didn''t cencern myself about him, anyhow. I wasn''t jealous of
      him, I don''t know why; never did a creature seem to me to be of less
      importance in life, to attract my attention less than this man.

“But she! how I loved her! How beautiful, graceful and young she
      was! She was youth, elegance, freshness itself! Never before had I felt so
      strongly what a pretty, distinguished, delicate, charming, graceful being
      woman is. Never before had I appreciated the seductive beauty to be found
      in the curve of a cheek, the movement of a lip, the pinkness of an ear,
      the shape of that foolish organ called the nose.

“This lasted three months; then I left for America, overwhelmed with
      sadness. But her memory remained in me, persistent, triumphant. From far
      away I was as much hers as I had been when she was near me. Years passed
      by, and I did not forget her. The charming image of her person was ever
      before my eyes and in my heart. And my love remained true to her, a quiet
      tenderness now, something like the beloved memory of the most beautiful
      and the most enchanting thing I had ever met in my life.

“Twelve years are not much in a lifetime! One does not feel them
      slip by. The years follow each other gently and quickly, slowly yet
      rapidly, each one is long and yet so soon over! They add up so rapidly,
      they leave so few traces behind them, they disappear so completely, that,
      when one turns round to look back over bygone years, one sees nothing and
      yet one does not understand how one happens to be so old. It seemed to me,
      really, that hardly a few months separated me from that charming season on
      the sands of Etretat.

“Just as the train was leaving, a big, fat lady, escorted by four
      little girls, got into my car. I hardly looked at this mother hen, very
      big, very round, with a face as full as the moon framed in an enormous,
      beribboned hat.

“She was puffing, out of breath from having been forced to walk
      quickly. The children began to chatter. I unfolded my paper and began to
      read.

“I hesitated. It seemed to me that I had seen that face somewhere;
      but where? when? I answered:

“Never had I received such a shock. In a second it seemed to me as
      though it were all over with me! I felt that a veil had been torn from my
      eyes and that I was going to make a horrible and heartrending discovery.

“So that was she! That big, fat, common woman, she! She had become
      the mother of these four girls since I had last her. And these little
      beings surprised me as much as their mother. They were part of her; they
      were big girls, and already had a place in life. Whereas she no longer
      counted, she, that marvel of dainty and charming gracefulness. It seemed
      to me that I had seen her but yesterday, and this is how I found her
      again! Was it possible? A poignant grief seized my heart; and also a
      revolt against nature herself, an unreasoning indignation against this
      brutal, infarious act of destruction.

“I looked at her, bewildered. Then I took her hand in mine, and
      tears came to my eyes. I wept for her lost youth. For I did not know this
      fat lady.

“''I am greatly changed, am I not? What can you expect—everything
      has its time! You see, I have become a mother, nothing but a good mother.
      Farewell to the rest, that is over. Oh! I never expected you to recognize
      me if we met. You, too, have changed. It took me quite a while to be sure
      that I was not mistaken. Your hair is all white. Just think! Twelve years
      ago! Twelve years! My oldest girl is already ten.''

“I looked at the child. And I recognized in her something of her
      mother''s old charm, but something as yet unformed, something which
      promised for the future. And life seemed to me as swift as a passing
      train.

“We had reached. Maisons-Laffitte. I kissed my old friend''s hand. I
      had found nothing but the most commonplace remarks. I was too much upset
      to talk.

“At night, alone, at home, I stood in front of the mirror for a long
      time, a very long time. And I finally remembered what I had been, finally
      saw in my mind''s eye my brown mustache, my black hair and the youthful
      expression of my face. Now I was old. Farewell!”

This is what the old Marquis d''Arville told us after St. Hubert''s dinner
      at the house of the Baron des Ravels.

We had killed a stag that day. The marquis was the only one of the guests
      who had not taken part in this chase. He never hunted.

During that long repast we had talked about hardly anything but the
      slaughter of animals. The ladies themselves were interested in bloody and
      exaggerated tales, and the orators imitated the attacks and the combats of
      men against beasts, raised their arms, romanced in a thundering voice.

M. d Arville talked well, in a certain flowery, high-sounding, but
      effective style. He must have told this story frequently, for he told it
      fluently, never hesitating for words, choosing them with skill to make his
      description vivid.

Gentlemen, I have never hunted, neither did my father, nor my grandfather,
      nor my great-grandfather. This last was the son of a man who hunted more
      than all of you put together. He died in 1764. I will tell you the story
      of his death.

His name was Jean. He was married, father of that child who became my
      great-grandfather, and he lived with his younger brother, Francois
      d''Arville, in our castle in Lorraine, in the midst of the forest.

They both hunted from one end of the year to the other, without stopping
      and seemingly without fatigue. They loved only hunting, understood nothing
      else, talked only of that, lived only for that.

They had at heart that one passion, which was terrible and inexorable. It
      consumed them, had completely absorbed them, leaving room for no other
      thought.

They had given orders that they should not be interrupted in the chase for
      any reason whatever. My great-grandfather was born while his father was
      following a fox, and Jean d''Arville did not stop the chase, but exclaimed:
      “The deuce! The rascal might have waited till after the view —halloo!”

His brother Francois was still more infatuated. On rising he went to see
      the dogs, then the horses, then he shot little birds about the castle
      until the time came to hunt some large game.

In the countryside they were called M. le Marquis and M. le Cadet, the
      nobles then not being at all like the chance nobility of our time, which
      wishes to establish an hereditary hierarchy in titles; for the son of a
      marquis is no more a count, nor the son of a viscount a baron, than a son
      of a general is a colonel by birth. But the contemptible vanity of today
      finds profit in that arrangement.

My ancestors were unusually tall, bony, hairy, violent and vigorous. The
      younger, still taller than the older, had a voice so strong that,
      according to a legend of which he was proud, all the leaves of the forest
      shook when he shouted.

When they were both mounted to set out hunting, it must have been a superb
      sight to see those two giants straddling their huge horses.

Now, toward the midwinter of that year, 1764, the frosts were excessive,
      and the wolves became ferocious.

They even attacked belated peasants, roamed at night outside the houses,
      howled from sunset to sunrise, and robbed the stables.

And soon a rumor began to circulate. People talked of a colossal wolf with
      gray fur, almost white, who had eaten two children, gnawed off a woman''s
      arm, strangled all the watch dogs in the district, and even come without
      fear into the farmyards. The people in the houses affirmed that they had
      felt his breath, and that it made the flame of the lights flicker. And
      soon a panic ran through all the province. No one dared go out any more
      after nightfall. The darkness seemed haunted by the image of the beast.

The brothers d''Arville determined to find and kill him, and several times
      they brought together all the gentlemen of the country to a great hunt.

They beat the forests and searched the coverts in vain; they never met
      him. They killed wolves, but not that one. And every night after a battue
      the beast, as if to avenge himself, attacked some traveller or killed some
      one''s cattle, always far from the place where they had looked for him.

Finally, one night he stole into the pigpen of the Chateau d''Arville and
      ate the two fattest pigs.

The brothers were roused to anger, considering this attack as a direct
      insult and a defiance. They took their strong bloodhounds, used to pursue
      dangerous animals, and they set off to hunt, their hearts filled with
      rage.

From dawn until the hour when the empurpled sun descended behind the great
      naked trees, they beat the woods without finding anything.

At last, furious and disgusted, both were returning, walking their horses
      along a lane bordered with hedges, and they marvelled that their skill as
      huntsmen should be baffled by this wolf, and they were suddenly seized
      with a mysterious fear.

“Perhaps we should have a bullet blessed by our cousin, the bishop,
      or pray some priest to pronounce the words which are needed.”

He had hardly finished speaking when his horse reared; that of Franqois
      began to kick. A large thicket covered with dead leaves opened before
      them, and a mammoth beast, entirely gray, jumped up and ran off through
      the wood.

Both uttered a kind of grunt of joy, and bending over the necks of their
      heavy horses, they threw them forward with an impulse from all their body,
      hurling them on at such a pace, urging them, hurrying them away, exciting
      them so with voice and with gesture and with spur that the experienced
      riders seemed to be carrying the heavy beasts between their thighs and
      to bear them off as if they were flying.

Thus they went, plunging through the thickets, dashing across the beds of
      streams, climbing the hillsides, descending the gorges, and blowing the
      horn as loud as they could to attract their people and the dogs.

And now, suddenly, in that mad race, my ancestor struck his forehead
      against an enormous branch which split his skull; and he fell dead on the
      ground, while his frightened horse took himself off, disappearing in the
      gloom which enveloped the woods.

The younger d''Arville stopped quick, leaped to the earth, seized his
      brother in his arms, and saw that the brains were escaping from the wound
      with the blood.

Then he sat down beside the body, rested the head, disfigured and red, on
      his knees, and waited, regarding the immobile face of his elder brother.
      Little by little a fear possessed him, a strange fear which he had never
      felt before, the fear of the dark, the fear of loneliness, the fear of the
      deserted wood, and the fear also of the weird wolf who had just killed his
      brother to avenge himself upon them both.

The gloom thickened; the acute cold made the trees crack. Francois got up,
      shivering, unable to remain there longer, feeling himself growing faint.
      Nothing was to be heard, neither the voice of the dogs nor the sound of
      the horns-all was silent along the invisible horizon; and this mournful
      silence of the frozen night had something about it terrific and strange.

He seized in his immense hands the great body of Jean, straightened it,
      and laid it across the saddle to carry it back to the chateau; then he
      went on his way softly, his mind troubled as if he were in a stupor,
      pursued by horrible and fear-giving images.

And all at once, in the growing darkness a great shape crossed his path.
      It was the beast. A shock of terror shook the hunter; something cold, like
      a drop of water, seemed to glide down his back, and, like a monk haunted
      of the devil, he made a great sign of the cross, dismayed at this abrupt
      return of the horrible prowler. But his eyes fell again on the inert body
      before him, and passing abruptly from fear to anger, he shook with an
      indescribable rage.

He followed it through the copses, the ravines, and the tall trees,
      traversing woods which he no longer recognized, his eyes fixed on the
      white speck which fled before him through the night.

His horse also seemed animated by a force and strength hitherto unknown.
      It galloped straight ahead with outstretched neck, striking against trees,
      and rocks, the head and the feet of the dead man thrown across the saddle.
      The limbs tore out his hair; the brow, beating the huge trunks, spattered
      them with blood; the spurs tore their ragged coats of bark. Suddenly the
      beast and the horseman issued from the forest and rushed into a valley,
      just as the moon appeared above the mountains. The valley here was stony,
      inclosed by enormous rocks.

Francois then uttered a yell of joy which the echoes repeated like a peal
      of thunder, and he leaped from his horse, his cutlass in his hand.

The beast, with bristling hair, the back arched, awaited him, its eyes
      gleaming like two stars. But, before beginning battle, the strong hunter,
      seizing his brother, seated him on a rock, and, placing stones under his
      head, which was no more than a mass of blood, he shouted in the ears as if
      he was talking to a deaf man: “Look, Jean; look at this!”

Then he attacked the monster. He felt himself strong enough to overturn a
      mountain, to bruise stones in his hands. The beast tried to bite him,
      aiming for his stomach; but he had seized the fierce animal by the neck,
      without even using his weapon, and he strangled it gently, listening to
      the cessation of breathing in its throat and the beatings of its heart. He
      laughed, wild with joy, pressing closer and closer his formidable embrace,
      crying in a delirium of joy, “Look, Jean, look!” All
      resistance ceased; the body of the wolf became limp. He was dead.

Francois took him up in his arms and carried him to the feet of the elder
      brother, where he laid him, repeating, in a tender voice: “There,
      there, there, my little Jean, see him!”

He returned to the chateau, laughing and crying, like Gargantua at the
      birth of Pantagruel, uttering shouts of triumph, and boisterous with joy
      as he related the death of the beast, and grieving and tearing his beard
      in telling of that of his brother.

And often, later, when he talked again of that day, he would say, with
      tears in his eyes: “If only poor Jean could have seen me strangle
      the beast, he would have died content, that I am sure!”

The widow of my ancestor inspired her orphan son with that horror of the
      chase which has transmitted itself from father to son as far down as
      myself.

Resembling in appearance all the wooden hostelries of the High Alps
      situated at the foot of glaciers in the barren rocky gorges that intersect
      the summits of the mountains, the Inn of Schwarenbach serves as a resting
      place for travellers crossing the Gemini Pass.

It remains open for six months in the year and is inhabited by the family
      of Jean Hauser; then, as soon as the snow begins to fall and to fill the
      valley so as to make the road down to Loeche impassable, the father and
      his three sons go away and leave the house in charge of the old guide,
      Gaspard Hari, with the young guide, Ulrich Kunsi, and Sam, the great
      mountain dog.

The two men and the dog remain till the spring in their snowy prison, with
      nothing before their eyes except the immense white slopes of the Balmhorn,
      surrounded by light, glistening summits, and are shut in, blocked up and
      buried by the snow which rises around them and which envelops, binds and
      crushes the little house, which lies piled on the roof, covering the
      windows and blocking up the door.

It was the day on which the Hauser family were going to return to Loeche,
      as winter was approaching, and the descent was becoming dangerous. Three
      mules started first, laden with baggage and led by the three sons. Then
      the mother, Jeanne Hauser, and her daughter Louise mounted a fourth mule
      and set off in their turn and the father followed them, accompanied by the
      two men in charge, who were to escort the family as far as the brow of the
      descent. First of all they passed round the small lake, which was now
      frozen over, at the bottom of the mass of rocks which stretched in front
      of the inn, and then they followed the valley, which was dominated on all
      sides by the snow-covered summits.

A ray of sunlight fell into that little white, glistening, frozen desert
      and illuminated it with a cold and dazzling flame. No living thing
      appeared among this ocean of mountains. There was no motion in this
      immeasurable solitude and no noise disturbed the profound silence.

By degrees the young guide, Ulrich Kunsi, a tall, long-legged Swiss, left
      old man Hauser and old Gaspard behind, in order to catch up the mule which
      bore the two women. The younger one looked at him as he approached and
      appeared to be calling him with her sad eyes. She was a young, fairhaired
      little peasant girl, whose milk-white cheeks and pale hair looked as if
      they had lost their color by their long abode amid the ice. When he had
      got up to the animal she was riding he put his hand on the crupper and
      relaxed his speed. Mother Hauser began to talk to him, enumerating with
      the minutest details all that he would have to attend to during the
      winter. It was the first time that he was going to stay up there, while
      old Hari had already spent fourteen winters amid the snow, at the inn of
      Schwarenbach.

Ulrich Kunsi listened, without appearing to understand and looked
      incessantly at the girl. From time to time he replied: “Yes, Madame
      Hauser,” but his thoughts seemed far away and his calm features
      remained unmoved.

They reached Lake Daube, whose broad, frozen surface extended to the end
      of the valley. On the right one saw the black, pointed, rocky summits of
      the Daubenhorn beside the enormous moraines of the Lommern glacier, above
      which rose the Wildstrubel. As they approached the Gemmi pass, where the
      descent of Loeche begins, they suddenly beheld the immense horizon of the
      Alps of the Valais, from which the broad, deep valley of the Rhone
      separated them.

In the distance there was a group of white, unequal, flat, or pointed
      mountain summits, which glistened in the sun; the Mischabel with its two
      peaks, the huge group of the Weisshorn, the heavy Brunegghorn, the lofty
      and formidable pyramid of Mount Cervin, that slayer of men, and the
      Dent-Blanche, that monstrous coquette.

Then beneath them, in a tremendous hole, at the bottom of a terrific
      abyss, they perceived Loeche, where houses looked as grains of sand which
      had been thrown into that enormous crevice that is ended and closed by the
      Gemmi and which opens, down below, on the Rhone.

The mule stopped at the edge of the path, which winds and turns
      continually, doubling backward, then, fantastically and strangely, along
      the side of the mountain as far as the almost invisible little village at
      its feet. The women jumped into the snow and the two old men joined them.
      “Well,” father Hauser said, “good-by, and keep up your
      spirits till next year, my friends,” and old Hari replied: “Till
      next year.”

They embraced each other and then Madame Hauser in her turn offered her
      cheek, and the girl did the same.

When Ulrich Kunsi''s turn came, he whispered in Louise''s ear, “Do not
      forget those up yonder,” and she replied, “No,” in such
      a low voice that he guessed what she had said without hearing it. “Well,
      adieu,” Jean Hauser repeated, “and don''t fall ill.” And
      going before the two women, he commenced the descent, and soon all three
      disappeared at the first turn in the road, while the two men returned to
      the inn at Schwarenbach.

They walked slowly, side by side, without speaking. It was over, and they
      would be alone together for four or five months. Then Gaspard Hari began
      to relate his life last winter. He had remained with Michael Canol, who
      was too old now to stand it, for an accident might happen during that long
      solitude. They had not been dull, however; the only thing was to make up
      one''s mind to it from the first, and in the end one would find plenty of
      distraction, games and other means of whiling away the time.

Ulrich Kunsi listened to him with his eyes on the ground, for in his
      thoughts he was following those who were descending to the village. They
      soon came in sight of the inn, which was, however, scarcely visible, so
      small did it look, a black speck at the foot of that enormous billow of
      snow, and when they opened the door Sam, the great curly dog, began to
      romp round them.

“Come, my boy,” old Gaspard said, “we have no women now,
      so we must get our own dinner ready. Go and peel the potatoes.” And
      they both sat down on wooden stools and began to prepare the soup.

The next morning seemed very long to Kunsi. Old Hari smoked and spat on
      the hearth, while the young man looked out of the window at the
      snow-covered mountain opposite the house.

In the afternoon he went out, and going over yesterday''s ground again, he
      looked for the traces of the mule that had carried the two women. Then
      when he had reached the Gemmi Pass, he laid himself down on his stomach
      and looked at Loeche.

The village, in its rocky pit, was not yet buried under the snow, from
      which it was sheltered by the pine woods which protected it on all sides.
      Its low houses looked like paving stones in a large meadow from above.
      Hauser''s little daughter was there now in one of those gray-colored
      houses. In which? Ulrich Kunsi was too far away to be able to make them
      out separately. How he would have liked to go down while he was yet able!

But the sun had disappeared behind the lofty crest of the Wildstrubel and
      the young man returned to the chalet. Daddy Hari was smoking, and when he
      saw his mate come in he proposed a game of cards to him, and they sat down
      opposite each other, on either side of the table. They played for a long
      time a simple game called brisque and then they had supper and went to
      bed.

The following days were like the first, bright and cold, without any fresh
      snow. Old Gaspard spent his afternoons in watching the eagles and other
      rare birds which ventured on those frozen heights, while Ulrich returned
      regularly to the Gemmi Pass to look at the village. Then they played
      cards, dice or dominoes and lost and won a trifle, just to create an
      interest in the game.

One morning Hari, who was up first, called his companion. A moving, deep
      and light cloud of white spray was falling on them noiselessly and was by
      degrees burying them under a thick, heavy coverlet of foam. That lasted
      four days and four nights. It was necessary to free the door and the
      windows, to dig out a passage and to cut steps to get over this frozen
      powder, which a twelve hours'' frost had made as hard as the granite of the
      moraines.

They lived like prisoners and did not venture outside their abode. They
      had divided their duties, which they performed regularly. Ulrich Kunsi
      undertook the scouring, washing and everything that belonged to
      cleanliness. He also chopped up the wood while Gaspard Hari did the
      cooking and attended to the fire. Their regular and monotonous work was
      interrupted by long games at cards or dice, and they never quarrelled, but
      were always calm and placid. They were never seen impatient or
      ill-humored, nor did they ever use hard words, for they had laid in a
      stock of patience for their wintering on the top of the mountain.

Sometimes old Gaspard took his rifle and went after chamois, and
      occasionally he killed one. Then there was a feast in the inn at
      Schwarenbach and they revelled in fresh meat. One morning he went out as
      usual. The thermometer outside marked eighteen degrees of frost, and as
      the sun had not yet risen, the hunter hoped to surprise the animals at the
      approaches to the Wildstrubel, and Ulrich, being alone, remained in bed
      until ten o''clock. He was of a sleepy nature, but he would not have dared
      to give way like that to his inclination in the presence of the old guide,
      who was ever an early riser. He breakfasted leisurely with Sam, who also
      spent his days and nights in sleeping in front of the fire; then he felt
      low-spirited and even frightened at the solitude, and was seized by a
      longing for his daily game of cards, as one is by the craving of a
      confirmed habit, and so he went out to meet his companion, who was to
      return at four o''clock.

The snow had levelled the whole deep valley, filled up the crevasses,
      obliterated all signs of the two lakes and covered the rocks, so that
      between the high summits there was nothing but an immense, white, regular,
      dazzling and frozen surface. For three weeks Ulrich had not been to the
      edge of the precipice from which he had looked down on the village, and he
      wanted to go there before climbing the slopes which led to Wildstrubel.
      Loeche was now also covered by the snow and the houses could scarcely be
      distinguished, covered as they were by that white cloak.

Then, turning to the right, he reached the Loemmern glacier. He went along
      with a mountaineer''s long strides, striking the snow, which was as hard as
      a rock, with his iron-pointed stick, and with his piercing eyes he looked
      for the little black, moving speck in the distance, on that enormous,
      white expanse.

When he reached the end of the glacier he stopped and asked himself
      whether the old man had taken that road, and then he began to walk along
      the moraines with rapid and uneasy steps. The day was declining, the snow
      was assuming a rosy tint, and a dry, frozen wind blew in rough gusts over
      its crystal surface. Ulrich uttered a long, shrill, vibrating call. His
      voice sped through the deathlike silence in which the mountains were
      sleeping; it reached the distance, across profound and motionless waves of
      glacial foam, like the cry of a bird across the waves of the sea. Then it
      died away and nothing answered him.

He began to walk again. The sun had sunk yonder behind the mountain tops,
      which were still purple with the reflection from the sky, but the depths
      of the valley were becoming gray, and suddenly the young man felt
      frightened. It seemed to him as if the silence, the cold, the solitude,
      the winter death of these mountains were taking possession of him, were
      going to stop and to freeze his blood, to make his limbs grow stiff and to
      turn him into a motionless and frozen object, and he set off running,
      fleeing toward his dwelling. The old man, he thought, would have returned
      during his absence. He had taken another road; he would, no doubt, be
      sitting before the fire, with a dead chamois at his feet. He soon came in
      sight of the inn, but no smoke rose from it. Ulrich walked faster and
      opened the door. Sam ran up to him to greet him, but Gaspard Hari had not
      returned. Kunsi, in his alarm, turned round suddenly, as if he had
      expected to find his comrade hidden in a corner. Then he relighted the
      fire and made the soup, hoping every moment to see the old man come in.
      From time to time he went out to see if he were not coming. It was quite
      night now, that wan, livid night of the mountains, lighted by a thin,
      yellow crescent moon, just disappearing behind the mountain tops.

Then the young man went in and sat down to warm his hands and feet, while
      he pictured to himself every possible accident. Gaspard might have broken
      a leg, have fallen into a crevasse, taken a false step and dislocated his
      ankle. And, perhaps, he was lying on the snow, overcome and stiff with the
      cold, in agony of mind, lost and, perhaps, shouting for help, calling with
      all his might in the silence of the night.. But where? The mountain was so
      vast, so rugged, so dangerous in places, especially at that time of the
      year, that it would have required ten or twenty guides to walk for a week
      in all directions to find a man in that immense space. Ulrich Kunsi,
      however, made up his mind to set out with Sam if Gaspard did not return by
      one in the morning, and he made his preparations.

He put provisions for two days into a bag, took his steel climbing iron,
      tied a long, thin, strong rope round his waist, and looked to see that his
      iron-shod stick and his axe, which served to cut steps in the ice, were in
      order. Then he waited. The fire was burning on the hearth, the great dog
      was snoring in front of it, and the clock was ticking, as regularly as a
      heart beating, in its resounding wooden case. He waited, with his ears on
      the alert for distant sounds, and he shivered when the wind blew against
      the roof and the walls. It struck twelve and he trembled: Then, frightened
      and shivering, he put some water on the fire, so that he might have some
      hot coffee before starting, and when the clock struck one he got up, woke
      Sam, opened the door and went off in the direction of the Wildstrubel. For
      five hours he mounted, scaling the rocks by means of his climbing irons,
      cutting into the ice, advancing continually, and occasionally hauling up
      the dog, who remained below at the foot of some slope that was too steep
      for him, by means of the rope. It was about six o''clock when he reached
      one of the summits to which old Gaspard often came after chamois, and he
      waited till it should be daylight.

The sky was growing pale overhead, and a strange light, springing nobody
      could tell whence, suddenly illuminated the immense ocean of pale mountain
      summits, which extended for a hundred leagues around him. One might have
      said that this vague brightness arose from the snow itself and spread
      abroad in space. By degrees the highest distant summits assumed a
      delicate, pink flesh color, and the red sun appeared behind the ponderous
      giants of the Bernese Alps.

Ulrich Kunsi set off again, walking like a hunter, bent over, looking for
      tracks, and saying to his dog: “Seek, old fellow, seek!”

He was descending the mountain now, scanning the depths closely, and from
      time to time shouting, uttering aloud, prolonged cry, which soon died away
      in that silent vastness. Then he put his ear to the ground to listen. He
      thought he could distinguish a voice, and he began to run and shouted
      again, but he heard nothing more and sat down, exhausted and in despair.
      Toward midday he breakfasted and gave Sam, who was as tired as himself,
      something to eat also, and then he recommenced his search.

When evening came he was still walking, and he had walked more than thirty
      miles over the mountains. As he was too far away to return home and too
      tired to drag himself along any further, he dug a hole in the snow and
      crouched in it with his dog under a blanket which he had brought with him.
      And the man and the dog lay side by side, trying to keep warm, but frozen
      to the marrow nevertheless. Ulrich scarcely slept, his mind haunted by
      visions and his limbs shaking with cold.

Day was breaking when he got up. His legs were as stiff as iron bars and
      his spirits so low that he was ready to cry with anguish, while his heart
      was beating so that he almost fell over with agitation, when he thought he
      heard a noise.

Suddenly he imagined that he also was going to die of cold in the midst of
      this vast solitude, and the terror of such a death roused his energies and
      gave him renewed vigor. He was descending toward the inn, falling down and
      getting up again, and followed at a distance by Sam, who was limping on
      three legs, and they did not reach Schwarenbach until four o''clock in the
      afternoon. The house was empty and the young man made a fire, had
      something to eat and went to sleep, so worn out that he did not think of
      anything more.

He slept for a long time, for a very long time, an irresistible sleep. But
      suddenly a voice, a cry, a name, “Ulrich!” aroused him from
      his profound torpor and made him sit up in bed. Had he been dreaming? Was
      it one of those strange appeals which cross the dreams of disquieted
      minds? No, he heard it still, that reverberating cry-which had entered his
      ears and remained in his flesh-to the tips of his sinewy fingers.
      Certainly somebody had cried out and called “Ulrich!” There
      was somebody there near the house, there could be no doubt of that, and he
      opened the door and shouted, “Is it you, Gaspard?” with all
      the strength of his lungs. But there was no reply, no murmur, no groan,
      nothing. It was quite dark and the snow looked wan.

The wind had risen, that icy wind that cracks the rocks and leaves nothing
      alive on those deserted heights, and it came in sudden gusts, which were
      more parching and more deadly than the burning wind of the desert, and
      again Ulrich shouted: “Gaspard! Gaspard! Gaspard.” And then he
      waited again. Everything was silent on the mountain.

Then he shook with terror and with a bound he was inside the inn, when he
      shut and bolted the door, and then he fell into a chair trembling all
      over, for he felt certain that his comrade had called him at the moment he
      was expiring.

He was sure of that, as sure as one is of being alive or of eating a piece
      of bread. Old Gaspard Hari had been dying for two days and three nights
      somewhere, in some hole, in one of those deep, untrodden ravines whose
      whiteness is more sinister than subterranean darkness. He had been dying
      for two days and three nights and he had just then died, thinking of his
      comrade. His soul, almost before it was released, had taken its flight to
      the inn where Ulrich was sleeping, and it had called him by that terrible
      and mysterious power which the spirits of the dead have to haunt the
      living. That voiceless soul had cried to the worn-out soul of the sleeper;
      it had uttered its last farewell, or its reproach, or its curse on the man
      who had not searched carefully enough.

And Ulrich felt that it was there, quite close to him, behind the wall,
      behind the door which he had just fastened. It was wandering about, like a
      night bird which lightly touches a lighted window with his wings, and the
      terrified young man was ready to scream with horror. He wanted to run
      away, but did not dare to go out; he did not dare, and he should never
      dare to do it in the future, for that phantom would remain there day and
      night, round the inn, as long as the old man''s body was not recovered and
      had not been deposited in the consecrated earth of a churchyard.

When it was daylight Kunsi recovered some of his courage at the return of
      the bright sun. He prepared his meal, gave his dog some food and then
      remained motionless on a chair, tortured at heart as he thought of the old
      man lying on the snow, and then, as soon as night once more covered the
      mountains, new terrors assailed him. He now walked up and down the dark
      kitchen, which was scarcely lighted by the flame of one candle, and he
      walked from one end of it to the other with great strides, listening,
      listening whether the terrible cry of the other night would again break
      the dreary silence outside. He felt himself alone, unhappy man, as no man
      had ever been alone before! He was alone in this immense desert of Snow,
      alone five thousand feet above the inhabited earth, above human
      habitation, above that stirring, noisy, palpitating life, alone under an
      icy sky! A mad longing impelled him to run away, no matter where, to get
      down to Loeche by flinging himself over the precipice; but he did not even
      dare to open the door, as he felt sure that the other, the dead man, would
      bar his road, so that he might not be obliged to remain up there alone:

Toward midnight, tired with walking, worn out by grief and fear, he at
      last fell into a doze in his chair, for he was afraid of his bed as one is
      of a haunted spot. But suddenly the strident cry of the other evening
      pierced his ears, and it was so shrill that Ulrich stretched out his arms
      to repulse the ghost, and he fell backward with his chair.

Sam, who was awakened by the noise, began to howl as frightened dogs do
      howl, and he walked all about the house trying to find out where the
      danger came from. When he got to the door, he sniffed beneath it, smelling
      vigorously, with his coat bristling and his tail stiff, while he growled
      angrily. Kunsi, who was terrified, jumped up, and, holding his chair by
      one leg, he cried: “Don''t come in, don''t come in, or I shall kill
      you.” And the dog, excited by this threat, barked angrily at that
      invisible enemy who defied his master''s voice. By degrees, however, he
      quieted down and came back and stretched himself in front of the fire, but
      he was uneasy and kept his head up and growled between his teeth.

Ulrich, in turn, recovered his senses, but as he felt faint with terror,
      he went and got a bottle of brandy out of the sideboard, and he drank off
      several glasses, one after anther, at a gulp. His ideas became vague, his
      courage revived and a feverish glow ran through his veins.

He ate scarcely anything the next day and limited himself to alcohol, and
      so he lived for several days, like a drunken brute. As soon as he thought
      of Gaspard Hari, he began to drink again, and went on drinking until he
      fell to the ground, overcome by intoxication. And there he remained lying
      on his face, dead drunk, his limbs benumbed, and snoring loudly. But
      scarcely had he digested the maddening and burning liquor than the same
      cry, “Ulrich!” woke him like a bullet piercing his brain, and
      he got up, still staggering, stretching out his hands to save himself from
      falling, and calling to Sam to help him. And the dog, who appeared to be
      going mad like his master, rushed to the door, scratched it with his claws
      and gnawed it with his long white teeth, while the young man, with his
      head thrown back drank the brandy in draughts, as if it had been cold
      water, so that it might by and by send his thoughts, his frantic terror,
      and his memory to sleep again.

In three weeks he had consumed all his stock of ardent spirits. But his
      continual drunkenness only lulled his terror, which awoke more furiously
      than ever as soon as it was impossible for him to calm it. His fixed idea
      then, which had been intensified by a month of drunkenness, and which was
      continually increasing in his absolute solitude, penetrated him like a
      gimlet. He now walked about the house like a wild beast in its cage,
      putting his ear to the door to listen if the other were there and defying
      him through the wall. Then, as soon as he dozed, overcome by fatigue, he
      heard the voice which made him leap to his feet.

At last one night, as cowards do when driven to extremities, he sprang to
      the door and opened it, to see who was calling him and to force him to
      keep quiet, but such a gust of cold wind blew into his face that it
      chilled him to the bone, and he closed and bolted the door again
      immediately, without noticing that Sam had rushed out. Then, as he was
      shivering with cold, he threw some wood on the fire and sat down in front
      of it to warm himself, but suddenly he started, for somebody was
      scratching at the wall and crying. In desperation he called out: “Go
      away!” but was answered by another long, sorrowful wail.

Then all his remaining senses forsook him from sheer fright. He repeated:
      “Go away!” and turned round to try to find some corner in
      which to hide, while the other person went round the house still crying
      and rubbing against the wall. Ulrich went to the oak sideboard, which was
      full of plates and dishes and of provisions, and lifting it up with
      superhuman strength, he dragged it to the door, so as to form a barricade.
      Then piling up all the rest of the furniture, the mattresses, palliasses
      and chairs, he stopped up the windows as one does when assailed by an
      enemy.

But the person outside now uttered long, plaintive, mournful groans, to
      which the young man replied by similar groans, and thus days and nights
      passed without their ceasing to howl at each other. The one was
      continually walking round the house and scraped the walls with his nails
      so vigorously that it seemed as if he wished to destroy them, while the
      other, inside, followed all his movements, stooping down and holding his
      ear to the walls and replying to all his appeals with terrible cries. One
      evening, however, Ulrich heard nothing more, and he sat down, so overcome
      by fatigue, that he went to sleep immediately and awoke in the morning
      without a thought, without any recollection of what had happened, just as
      if his head had been emptied during his heavy sleep, but he felt hungry,
      and he ate.

The winter was over and the Gemmi Pass was practicable again, so the
      Hauser family started off to return to their inn. As soon as they had
      reached the top of the ascent the women mounted their mule and spoke about
      the two men whom they would meet again shortly. They were, indeed, rather
      surprised that neither of them had come down a few days before, as soon as
      the road was open, in order to tell them all about their long winter
      sojourn. At last, however, they saw the inn, still covered with snow, like
      a quilt. The door and the window were closed, but a little smoke was
      coming out of the chimney, which reassured old Hauser. On going up to the
      door, however, he saw the skeleton of an animal which had been torn to
      pieces by the eagles, a large skeleton lying on its side.

“That must be Sam,” and then she shouted: “Hi, Gaspard!”
      A cry from the interior of the house answered her and a sharp cry that one
      might have thought some animal had uttered it. Old Hauser repeated,
      “Hi, Gaspard!” and they heard another cry similar to the
      first.

Then the three men, the father and the two sons, tried to open the door,
      but it resisted their efforts. From the empty cow-stall they took a beam
      to serve as a battering-ram and hurled it against the door with all their
      might. The wood gave way and the boards flew into splinters. Then the
      house was shaken by a loud voice, and inside, behind the side board which
      was overturned, they saw a man standing upright, with his hair falling on
      his shoulders and a beard descending to his breast, with shining eyes, and
      nothing but rags to cover him. They did not recognize him, but Louise
      Hauser exclaimed:

“It is Ulrich, mother.” And her mother declared that it was
      Ulrich, although his hair was white.

He allowed them to go up to him and to touch him, but he did not reply to
      any of their questions, and they were obliged to take him to Loeche, where
      the doctors found that he was mad, and nobody ever found out what had
      become of his companion.

Little Louise Hauser nearly died that summer of decline, which the
      physicians attributed to the cold air of the mountains.

George''s father was sitting in an iron chair, watching his little son with
      concentrated affection and attention, as little George piled up the sand
      into heaps during one of their walks. He would take up the sand with both
      hands, make a mound of it, and put a chestnut leaf on top. His father saw
      no one but him in that public park full of people.

The sun was just disappearing behind the roofs of the Rue Saint-Lazare,
      but still shed its rays obliquely on that little, overdressed crowd. The
      chestnut trees were lighted up by its yellow rays, and the three fountains
      before the lofty porch of the church had the appearance of liquid silver.

Monsieur Parent, accidentally looking up at the church clock, saw that he
      was five minutes late. He got up, took the child by the arm, shook his
      dress, which was covered with sand, wiped his hands, and led him in the
      direction of the Rue Blanche. He walked quickly, so as not to get in after
      his wife, and the child could not keep up with him. He took him up and
      carried him, though it made him pant when he had to walk up the steep
      street. He was a man of forty, already turning gray, and rather stout. At
      last he reached his house. An old servant who had brought him up, one of
      those trusted servants who are the tyrants of families, opened the door to
      him.

The servant looked at him with angry and contemptuous pity. “Oh, I
      can see that well enough,” she grumbled. “You are covered with
      perspiration, monsieur. I suppose you walked quickly and carried the
      child, and only to have to wait until half-past seven, perhaps, for
      madame. I have made up my mind not to have dinner ready on time. I shall
      get it for eight o''clock, and if, you have to wait, I ca' WHERE id = '6b5a5bab-cb6d-4c60-9071-cb95b01bf8ca';
