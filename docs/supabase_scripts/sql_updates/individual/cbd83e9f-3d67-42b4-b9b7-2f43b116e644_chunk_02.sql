UPDATE stories SET original_text = original_text || 'nd whispered to Ekaterina
Ivanovna in great agitation:

She shrugged her shoulders, as though perplexed and not knowing what he
wanted of her, but she got up and went.

"You play the piano for three or four hours," he said, following her;
"then you sit with your mother, and there is no possibility of speaking
to you. Give me a quarter of an hour at least, I beseech you."

Autumn was approaching, and it was quiet and melancholy in the old
garden; the dark leaves lay thick in the walks. It was already beginning
to get dark early.

"I haven''t seen you for a whole week," Startsev went on, "and if you
only knew what suffering it is! Let us sit down. Listen to me."

They had a favourite place in the garden; a seat under an old spreading
maple. And now they sat down on this seat.

"I have not seen you for a whole week; I have not heard you for so long.
I long passionately, I thirst for your voice. Speak."

She fascinated him by her freshness, the naÃ¯ve expression of her eyes
and cheeks. Even in the way her dress hung on her, he saw something
extraordinarily charming, touching in its simplicity and naÃ¯ve grace;
and at the same time, in spite of this naÃ¯vetÃ©, she seemed to him
intelligent and developed beyond her years. He could talk with her about
literature, about art, about anything he liked; could complain to her of
life, of people, though it sometimes happened in the middle of serious
conversation she would laugh inappropriately or run away into the house.
Like almost all girls of her neighbourhood, she had read a great deal
(as a rule, people read very little in S——, and at the lending library
they said if it were not for the girls and the young Jews, they might as
well shut up the library). This afforded Startsev infinite delight; he
used to ask her eagerly every time what she had been reading the last
few days, and listened enthralled while she told him.

"Where are you going?" cried Startsev in horror, as she suddenly got up
and walked towards the house. "I must talk to you; I want to explain
myself.... Stay with me just five minutes, I supplicate you!"

She stopped as though she wanted to say something, then awkwardly thrust
a note into his hand, ran home and sat down to the piano again.

It was clear: Kitten was playing a prank. Who would seriously dream of
making an appointment at night in the cemetery far out of the town, when
it might have been arranged in the street or in the town gardens? And
was it in keeping with him—a district doctor, an intelligent, staid
man—to be sighing, receiving notes, to hang about cemeteries, to do
silly things that even schoolboys think ridiculous nowadays? What would
this romance lead to? What would his colleagues say when they heard of
it? Such were Startsev''s reflections as he wandered round the tables at
the club, and at half-past ten he suddenly set off for the cemetery.

By now he had his own pair of horses, and a coachman called Panteleimon,
in a velvet waistcoat. The moon was shining. It was still warm, warm as
it is in autumn. Dogs were howling in the suburb near the
slaughter-house. Startsev left his horses in one of the side-streets at
the end of the town, and walked on foot to the cemetery.

"We all have our oddities," he thought. "Kitten is odd, too; and—who
knows?—perhaps she is not joking, perhaps she will come"; and he
abandoned himself to this faint, vain hope, and it intoxicated him.

He walked for half a mile through the fields; the cemetery showed as a
dark streak in the distance, like a forest or a big garden. The wall of
white stone came into sight, the gate.... In the moonlight he could read
on the gate: "The hour cometh." Startsev went in at the little gate, and
before anything else he saw the white crosses and monuments on both
sides of the broad avenue, and the black shadows of them and the
poplars; and for a long way round it was all white and black, and the
slumbering trees bowed their branches over the white stones. It seemed
as though it were lighter here than in the fields; the maple-leaves
stood out sharply like paws on the yellow sand of the avenue and on the
stones, and the inscriptions on the tombs could be clearly read. For the
first moments Startsev was struck now by what he saw for the first time
in his life, and what he would probably never see again; a world not
like anything else, a world in which the moonlight was as soft and
beautiful, as though slumbering here in its cradle, where there was no
life, none whatever; but in every dark poplar, in every tomb, there was
felt the presence of a mystery that promised a life peaceful, beautiful,
eternal. The stones and faded flowers, together with the autumn scent of
the leaves, all told of forgiveness, melancholy, and peace.

All was silence around; the stars looked down from the sky in the
profound stillness, and Startsev''s footsteps sounded loud and out of
place, and only when the church clock began striking and he imagined
himself dead, buried there for ever, he felt as though some one were
looking at him, and for a moment he thought that it was not peace and
tranquillity, but stifled despair, the dumb dreariness of
non-existence....

Demetti''s tomb was in the form of a shrine with an angel at the top. The
Italian opera had once visited S—— and one of the singers had died;
she had been buried here, and this monument put up to her. No one in the
town remembered her, but the lamp at the entrance reflected the
moonlight, and looked as though it were burning.

There was no one, and, indeed, who would come here at midnight? But
Startsev waited, and as though the moonlight warmed his passion, he
waited passionately, and, in imagination, pictured kisses and embraces.
He sat near the monument for half an hour, then paced up and down the
side avenues, with his hat in his hand, waiting and thinking of the many
women and girls buried in these tombs who had been beautiful and
fascinating, who had loved, at night burned with passion, yielding
themselves to caresses. How wickedly Mother Nature jested at man''s
expense, after all! How humiliating it was to recognise it!

Startsev thought this, and at the same time he wanted to cry out that he
wanted love, that he was eager for it at all costs. To his eyes they
were not slabs of marble, but fair white bodies in the moonlight; he saw
shapes hiding bashfully in the shadows of the trees, felt their warmth,
and the languor was oppressive....

And as though a curtain were lowered, the moon went behind a cloud, and
suddenly all was darkness. Startsev could scarcely find the gate—by now
it was as dark as it is on an autumn night. Then he wandered about for
an hour and a half, looking for the side-street in which he had left his
horses.

The following evening he went to the Turkins'' to make an offer. But it
turned out to be an inconvenient moment, as Ekaterina Ivanovna was in
her own room having her hair done by a hair-dresser. She was getting
ready to go to a dance at the club.

He had to sit a long time again in the dining-room drinking tea. Ivan
Petrovitch, seeing that his visitor was bored and preoccupied, drew some
notes out of his waistcoat pocket, read a funny letter from a German
steward, saying that all the ironmongery was ruined and the plasticity
was peeling off the walls.

After a sleepless night, he found himself in a state of stupefaction, as
though he had been given something sweet and soporific to drink; there
was fog in his soul, but joy and warmth, and at the same time a sort of
cold, heavy fragment of his brain was reflecting:

"Stop before it is too late! Is she the match for you? She is spoilt,
whimsical, sleeps till two o''clock in the afternoon, while you are a
deacon''s son, a district doctor...."

"Besides, if you marry her," the fragment went on, "then her relations
will make you give up the district work and live in the town."

"After all," he thought, "if it must be the town, the town it must be.
They will give a dowry; we can establish ourselves suitably."

At last Ekaterina Ivanovna came in, dressed for the ball, with a low
neck, looking fresh and pretty; and Startsev admired her so much, and
went into such ecstasies, that he could say nothing, but simply stared
at her and laughed.

She began saying good-bye, and he—he had no reason for staying now—got
up, saying that it was time for him to go home; his patients were
waiting for him.

"Well, there''s no help for that," said Ivan Petrovitch. "Go, and you
might take Kitten to the club on the way."

It was spotting with rain; it was very dark, and they could only tell
where the horses were by Panteleimon''s husky cough. The hood of the
carriage was put up.

"I stand upright; you lie down right; he lies all right," said Ivan
Petrovitch as he put his daughter into the carriage.

"I was at the cemetery yesterday," Startsev began. "How ungenerous and
merciless it was on your part!..."

Ekaterina Ivanovna, pleased at having so cleverly taken in a man who was
in love with her, and at being the object of such intense love, burst
out laughing and suddenly uttered a shriek of terror, for, at that very
minute, the horses turned sharply in at the gate of the club, and the
carriage almost tilted over. Startsev put his arm round Ekaterina
Ivanovna''s waist; in her fright she nestled up to him, and he could not
restrain himself, and passionately kissed her on the lips and on the
chin, and hugged her more tightly.

And a minute later she was not in the carriage, and a policeman near the
lighted entrance of the club shouted in a detestable voice to
Panteleimon:

Startsev drove home, but soon afterwards returned. Attired in another
man''s dress suit and a stiff white tie which kept sawing at his neck and
trying to slip away from the collar, he was sitting at midnight in the
club drawing-room, and was saying with enthusiasm to Ekaterina Ivanovna.

"Ah, how little people know who have never loved! It seems to me that no
one has ever yet written of love truly, and I doubt whether this tender,
joyful, agonising feeling can be described, and any one who has once
experienced it would not attempt to put it into words. What is the use
of preliminaries and introductions? What is the use of unnecessary fine
words? My love is immeasurable. I beg, I beseech you," Startsev brought
out at last, "be my wife!"

"Dmitri Ionitch," said Ekaterina Ivanovna, with a very grave face, after
a moment''s thought—"Dmitri Ionitch, I am very grateful to you for the
honour. I respect you, but ..." she got up and continued standing, "but,
forgive me, I cannot be your wife. Let us talk seriously. Dmitri
Ionitch, you know I love art beyond everything in life. I adore music; I
love it frantically; I have dedicated my whole life to it. I want to be
an artist; I want fame, success, freedom, and you want me to go on
living in this town, to go on living this empty, useless life, which has
become insufferable to me. To become a wife—oh, no, forgive me! One
must strive towards a lofty, glorious goal, and married life would put
me in bondage for ever. Dmitri Ionitch" (she faintly smiled as she
pronounced his name; she thought of "Alexey Feofilaktitch")—"Dmitri
Ionitch, you are a good, clever, honourable man; you are better than any
one...." Tears came into her eyes. "I feel for you with my whole heart,
but ... but you will understand...."

Startsev''s heart left off throbbing uneasily. Going out of the club into
the street, he first of all tore off the stiff tie and drew a deep
breath. He was a little ashamed and his vanity was wounded—he had not
expected a refusal—and could not believe that all his dreams, his hopes
and yearnings, had led him up to such a stupid end, just as in some
little play at an amateur performance, and he was sorry for his feeling,
for that love of his, so sorry that he felt as though he could have
burst into sobs or have violently belaboured Panteleimon''s broad back
with his umbrella.

For three days he could not get on with anything, he could not eat nor
sleep; but when the news reached him that Ekaterina Ivanovna had gone
away to Moscow to enter the Conservatoire, he grew calmer and lived as
before.

Afterwards, remembering sometimes how he had wandered about the cemetery
or how he had driven all over the town to get a dress suit, he stretched
lazily and said:

Four years had passed. Startsev already had a large practice in the
town. Every morning he hurriedly saw his patients at Dyalizh, then he
drove in to see his town patients. By now he drove, not with a pair, but
with a team of three with bells on them, and he returned home late at
night. He had grown broader and stouter, and was not very fond of
walking, as he was somewhat asthmatic. And Panteleimon had grown stout,
too, and the broader he grew, the more mournfully he sighed and
complained of his hard luck: he was sick of driving! Startsev used to
visit various households and met many people, but did not become
intimate with any one. The inhabitants irritated him by their
conversation, their views of life, and even their appearance. Experience
taught him by degrees that while he played cards or lunched with one of
these people, the man was a peaceable, friendly, and even intelligent
human being; that as soon as one talked of anything not eatable, for
instance, of politics or science, he would be completely at a loss, or
would expound a philosophy so stupid and ill-natured that there was
nothing else to do but wave one''s hand in despair and go away. Even when
Startsev tried to talk to liberal citizens, saying, for instance, that
humanity, thank God, was progressing, and that one day it would be
possible to dispense with passports and capital punishment, the liberal
citizen would look at him askance and ask him mistrustfully: "Then any
one could murder any one he chose in the open street?" And when, at tea
or supper, Startsev observed in company that one should work, and that
one ought not to live without working, every one took this as a
reproach, and began to get angry and argue aggressively. With all that,
the inhabitants did nothing, absolutely nothing, and took no interest in
anything, and it was quite impossible to think of anything to say. And
Startsev avoided conversation, and confined himself to eating and
playing vint; and when there was a family festivity in some household
and he was invited to a meal, then he sat and ate in silence, looking at
his plate.

And everything that was said at the time was uninteresting, unjust, and
stupid; he felt irritated and disturbed, but held his tongue, and,
because he sat glumly silent and looked at his plate, he was nicknamed
in the town "the haughty Pole," though he never had been a Pole.

All such entertainments as theatres and concerts he declined, but he
played vint every evening for three hours with enjoyment. He had
another diversion to which he took imperceptibly, little by little: in
the evening he would take out of his pockets the notes he had gained by
his practice, and sometimes there were stuffed in his pockets
notes—yellow and green, and smelling of scent and vinegar and incense
and fish oil—up to the value of seventy roubles; and when they amounted
to some hundreds he took them to the Mutual Credit Bank and deposited
the money there to his account.

He was only twice at the Turkins'' in the course of the four years after
Ekaterina Ivanovna had gone away, on each occasion at the invitation of
Vera Iosifovna, who was still undergoing treatment for migraine. Every
summer Ekaterina Ivanovna came to stay with her parents, but he did not
once see her; it somehow never happened.

But now four years had passed. One still, warm morning a letter was
brought to the hospital. Vera Iosifovna wrote to Dmitri Ionitch that she
was missing him very much, and begged him to come and see them, and to
relieve her sufferings; and, by the way, it was her birthday. Below was
a postscript: "I join in mother''s request.—K."

Vera Iosifovna, white-haired and looking much older, shook Startsev''s
hand, sighed affectedly, and said:

"You don''t care to pay attentions to me, doctor. You never come and see
us; I am too old for you. But now some one young has come; perhaps she
will be more fortunate."

And Kitten? She had grown thinner, paler, had grown handsomer and more
graceful; but now she was Ekaterina Ivanovna, not Kitten; she had lost
the freshness and look of childish naÃ¯vetÃ©. And in her expression and
manners there was something new—guilty and diffident, as though she did
not feel herself at home here in the Turkins'' house.

"How many summers, how many winters!" she said, giving Startsev her
hand, and he could see that her heart was beating with excitement; and
looking at him intently and curiously, she went on: "How much stouter
you are! You look sunburnt and more manly, but on the whole you have
changed very little."

Now, too, he thought her attractive, very attractive, but there was
something lacking in her, or else something superfluous—he could not
himself have said exactly what it was, but something prevented him from
feeling as before. He did not like her pallor, her new expression, her
faint smile, her voice, and soon afterwards he disliked her clothes,
too, the low chair in which she was sitting; he disliked something in
the past when he had almost married her. He thought of his love, of the
dreams and the hopes which had troubled him four years before—and he
felt awkward.

They had tea with cakes. Then Vera Iosifovna read aloud a novel; she
read of things that never happen in real life, and Startsev listened,
looked at her handsome grey head, and waited for her to finish.

"People are not stupid because they can''t write novels, but because they
can''t conceal it when they do," he thought.

Then Ekaterina Ivanovna played long and noisily on the piano, and when
she finished she was profusely thanked and warmly praised.

She looked at him, and evidently expected him to ask her to go into the
garden, but he remained silent.

"Let us have a talk," she said, going up to him. "How are you getting
on? What are you doing? How are things? I have been thinking about you
all these days," she went on nervously. "I wanted to write to you,
wanted to come myself to see you at Dyalizh. I quite made up my mind to
go, but afterwards I thought better of it. God knows what your attitude
is towards me now; I have been looking forward to seeing you to-day with
such emotion. For goodness'' sake let us go into the garden."

They went into the garden and sat down on the seat under the old maple,
just as they had done four years before. It was dark.

"I feel so excited!" said Ekaterina Ivanovna, and she hid her face in
her hands. "But don''t pay attention to it. I am so happy to be at home;
I am so glad to see every one. I can''t get used to it. So many memories!
I thought we should talk without stopping till morning."

Now he saw her face near, her shining eyes, and in the darkness she
looked younger than in the room, and even her old childish expression
seemed to have come back to her. And indeed she was looking at him with
naÃ¯ve curiosity, as though she wanted to get a closer view and
understanding of the man who had loved her so ardently, with such
tenderness, and so unsuccessfully; her eyes thanked him for that love.
And he remembered all that had been, every minute detail; how he had
wandered about the cemetery, how he had returned home in the morning
exhausted, and he suddenly felt sad and regretted the past. A warmth
began glowing in his heart.

"Do you remember how I took you to the dance at the club?" he asked. "It
was dark and rainy then ..."

"Ech!" he said with a sigh. "You ask how I am living. How do we live
here? Why, not at all. We grow old, we grow stout, we grow slack. Day
after day passes; life slips by without colour, without expressions,
without thoughts.... In the daytime working for gain, and in the evening
the club, the company of card-players, alcoholic, raucous-voiced
gentlemen whom I can''t endure. What is there nice in it?"

"Well, you have work—a noble object in life. You used to be so fond of
talking of your hospital. I was such a queer girl then; I imagined
myself such a great pianist. Nowadays all young ladies play the piano,
and I played, too, like everybody else, and there was nothing special
about me. I am just such a pianist as my mother is an authoress. And of
course I didn''t understand you then, but afterwards in Moscow I often
thought of you. I thought of no one but you. What happiness to be a
district doctor; to help the suffering; to be serving the people! What
happiness!" Ekaterina Ivanovna repeated with enthusiasm. "When I thought
of you in Moscow, you seemed to me so ideal, so lofty...."

Startsev thought of the notes he used to take out of his pockets in the
evening with such pleasure, and the glow in his heart was quenched.

"You are the best man I''ve known in my life," she went on. "We will see
each other and talk, won''t we? Promise me. I am not a pianist; I am not
in error about myself now, and I will not play before you or talk of
music."

When they had gone into the house, and when Startsev saw in the
lamplight her face, and her sad, grateful, searching eyes fixed upon
him, he felt uneasy and thought again:

"You have no human right to go before supper," said Ivan Petrovitch as
he saw him off. "It''s extremely perpendicular on your part. Well, now,
perform!" he added, addressing Pava in the hall.

Pava, no longer a boy, but a young man with moustaches, threw himself
into an attitude, flung up his arm, and said in a tragic voice:

All this irritated Startsev. Getting into his carriage, and looking at
the dark house and garden which had once been so precious and so dear,
he thought of everything at once—Vera Iosifovna''s novels and Kitten''s
noisy playing, and Ivan Petrovitch''s jokes and Pava''s tragic posturing,
and thought if the most talented people in the town were so futile, what
must the town be?

"You don''t come and see us—why?" she wrote to him. "I am afraid that
you have changed towards us. I am afraid, and I am terrified at the very
thought of it. Reassure me; come and tell me that everything is well.

"Tell them, my good fellow, that I can''t come to-day; I am very busy.
Say I will come in three days or so."

But three days passed, a week passed; he still did not go. Happening
once to drive past the Turkins'' house, he thought he must go in, if only
for a moment, but on second thoughts ... did not go in.

Several more years have passed. Startsev has grown stouter still, has
grown corpulent, breathes heavily, and already walks with his head
thrown back. When stout and red in the face, he drives with his bells
and his team of three horses, and Panteleimon, also stout and red in the
face with his thick beefy neck, sits on the box, holding his arms
stiffly out before him as though they were made of wood, and shouts to
those he meets: "Keep to the ri-i-ight!" it is an impressive picture;
one might think it was not a mortal, but some heathen deity in his
chariot. He has an immense practice in the town, no time to breathe, and
already has an estate and two houses in the town, and he is looking out
for a third more profitable; and when at the Mutual Credit Bank he is
told of a house that is for sale, he goes to the house without ceremony,
and, marching through all the rooms, regardless of half-dressed women
and children who gaze at him in amazement and alarm, he prods at the
doors with his stick, and says:

He has a great deal to do, but still he does not give up his work as
district doctor; he is greedy for gain, and he tries to be in all places
at once. At Dyalizh and in the town he is called simply "Ionitch":
"Where is Ionitch off to?" or "Should not we call in Ionitch to a
consultation?"

Probably because his throat is covered with rolls of fat, his voice has
changed; it has become thin and sharp. His temper has changed, too: he
has grown ill-humoured and irritable. When he sees his patients he is
usually out of temper; he impatiently taps the floor with his stick, and
shouts in his disagreeable voice:

During all the years he had lived at Dyalizh his love for Kitten had
been his one joy, and probably his last. In the evenings he plays vint
at the club, and then sits alone at a big table and has supper. Ivan,
the oldest and most respectable of the waiters, serves him, hands him
Lafitte No. 17, and every one at the club—the members of the committee,
the cook and waiters—know what he likes and what he doesn''t like and do
their very utmost to satisfy him, or else he is sure to fly into a rage
and bang on the floor with his stick.

And the Turkins? Ivan Petrovitch has grown no older; he is not changed
in the least, and still makes jokes and tells anecdotes as of old. Vera
Iosifovna still reads her novels aloud to her visitors with eagerness
and touching simplicity. And Kitten plays the piano for four hours every
day. She has grown visibly older, is constantly ailing, and every autumn
goes to the Crimea with her mother. When Ivan Petrovitch sees them off
at the station, he wipes his tears as the train starts, and shouts:

IT is, as a rule, after losing heavily at cards or after a drinking-bout
when an attack of dyspepsia is setting in that Stepan Stepanitch Zhilin
wakes up in an exceptionally gloomy frame of mind. He looks sour,
rumpled, and dishevelled; there is an expression of displeasure on his
grey face, as though he were offended or disgusted by something. He
dresses slowly, sips his Vichy water deliberately, and begins walking
about the rooms.

"I should like to know what b-b-beast comes in here and does not shut
the door!" he grumbles angrily, wrapping his dressing-gown about him and
spitting loudly. "Take away that paper! Why is it lying about here? We
keep twenty servants, and the place is more untidy than a pot-house. Who
was that ringing? Who the devil is that?"

"I am not scolding; I am speaking. You might find something to do, my
dear, instead of sitting with your hands in your lap trying to pick a
quarrel. Upon my word, women are beyond my comprehension! Beyond my
comprehension! How can they waste whole days doing nothing? A man works
like an ox, like a b-beast, while his wife, the partner of his life,
sits like a pretty doll, sits and does nothing but watch for an
opportunity to quarrel with her husband by way of diversion. It''s time
to drop these schoolgirlish ways, my dear. You are not a schoolgirl, not
a young lady; you are a wife and mother! You turn away? Aha! It''s not
agreeable to listen to the bitter truth!"

"What if I have? Is that anybody''s business? Am I obliged to give an
account of my doings to any one? It''s my own money I lose, I suppose?
What I spend as well as what is spent in this house belongs to me—me.
Do you hear? To me!"

And so on, all in the same style. But at no other time is Stepan
Stepanitch so reasonable, virtuous, stern or just as at dinner, when all
his household are sitting about him. It usually begins with the soup.
After swallowing the first spoonful Zhilin suddenly frowns and puts down
his spoon.

"One must have the taste of a pig to eat hogwash like that! There''s too
much salt in it; it smells of dirty rags ... more like bugs than
onions.... It''s simply revolting, Anfissa Ivanovna," he says, addressing
the midwife. "Every day I give no end of money for housekeeping.... I
deny myself everything, and this is what they provide for my dinner! I
suppose they want me to give up the office and go into the kitchen to do
the cooking myself."

"Oh, you think so?" says Zhilin, looking at her angrily from under his
eyelids. "Every one to his taste, of course. It must be confessed our
tastes are very different, Varvara Vassilyevna. You, for instance, are
satisfied with the behaviour of this boy" (Zhilin with a tragic gesture
points to his son Fedya); "you are delighted with him, while I ... I am
disgusted. Yes!"

Fedya, a boy of seven with a pale, sickly face, leaves off eating and
drops his eyes. His face grows paler still.

"Yes, you are delighted, and I am disgusted. Which of us is right, I
cannot say, but I venture to think as his father, I know my own son
better than you do. Look how he is sitting! Is that the way decently
brought up children sit? Sit properly."

Fedya tilts his chin up, cranes his neck, and fancies that he is holding
himself better. Tears come into his eyes.

"Eat your dinner! Hold your spoon properly! You wait. I''ll show you, you
horrid boy! Don''t dare to whimper! Look straight at me!"

"You won''t get off with that!" his parent persists. "If nobody else
cares to look after your bringing up, so be it; I must begin.... I won''t
let you be naughty and cry at dinner, my lad! Idiot! You must do your
duty! Do you understand? Do your duty! Your father works and you must
work, too! No one must eat the bread of idleness! You must be a man! A
m-man!"

"For God''s sake, leave off," says his wife in French. "Don''t nag at us
before outsiders, at least.... The old woman is all ears; and now,
thanks to her, all the town will hear of it."

"I am not afraid of outsiders," answers Zhilin in Russian. "Anfissa
Ivanovna sees that I am speaking the truth. Why, do you think I ought to
be pleased with the boy? Do you know what he costs me? Do you know, you
nasty boy, what you cost me? Or do you imagine that I coin money, that I
get it for nothing? Don''t howl! Hold your tongue! Do you hear what I
say? Do you want me to whip you, you young ruffian?"

"This is insufferable," says his mother, getting up from the table and
flinging down her dinner-napkin. "You never let us have dinner in peace!
Your bread sticks in my throat."

"Now she is offended," grumbles Zhilin, with a forced smile. "She''s been
spoilt.... That''s how it is, Anfissa Ivanovna; no one likes to hear the
truth nowadays.... It''s all my fault, it seems."

Several minutes of silence follow. Zhilin looks round at the plates, and
noticing that no one has yet touched their soup, heaves a deep sigh, and
stares at the flushed and uneasy face of the governess.

"Why don''t you eat, Varvara Vassilyevna?" he asks. "Offended, I suppose?
I see.... You don''t like to be told the truth. You must forgive me, it''s
my nature; I can''t be a hypocrite.... I always blurt out the plain
truth" (a sigh). "But I notice that my presence is unwelcome. No one can
eat or talk while I am here.... Well, you should have told me, and I
would have gone away.... I will go."

"After all that has passed here, you are free," he says to Fedya,
throwing back his head with dignity. "I won''t meddle in your bringing up
again. I wash my hands of it! I humbly apologise that as a father, from
a sincere desire for your welfare, I have disturbed you and your
mentors. At the same time, once for all I disclaim all responsibility
for your future...."

Fedya wails and sobs more loudly than ever. Zhilin turns with dignity to
the door and departs to his bedroom.

When he wakes from his after-dinner nap he begins to feel the stings of
conscience. He is ashamed to face his wife, his son, Anfissa Ivanovna,
and even feels very wretched when he recalls the scene at dinner, but
his amour-propre is too much for him; he has not the manliness to be
frank, and he goes on sulking and grumbling.

Waking up next morning, he feels in excellent spirits, and whistles
gaily as he washes. Going into the dining-room to breakfast, he finds
there Fedya, who, at the sight of his father, gets up and looks at him
helplessly.

"Well, young man?" Zhilin greets him good-humouredly, sitting down to
the table. "What have you got to tell me, young man? Are you all right?
Well, come, chubby; give your father a kiss."

With a pale, grave face Fedya goes up to his father and touches his
cheek with his quivering lips, then walks away and sits down in his
place without a word.

ANDREY VASSILITCH KOVRIN, who held a master''s degree at the University,
had exhausted himself, and had upset his nerves. He did not send for a
doctor, but casually, over a bottle of wine, he spoke to a friend who
was a doctor, and the latter advised him to spend the spring and summer
in the country. Very opportunely a long letter came from Tanya Pesotsky,
who asked him to come and stay with them at Borissovka. And he made up
his mind that he really must go.

To begin with—that was in April—he went to his own home, Kovrinka, and
there spent three weeks in solitude; then, as soon as the roads were in
good condition, he set off, driving in a carriage, to visit Pesotsky,
his former guardian, who had brought him up, and was a horticulturist
well known all over Russia. The distance from Kovrinka to Borissovka was
reckoned only a little over fifty miles. To drive along a soft road in
May in a comfortable carriage with springs was a real pleasure.

Pesotsky had an immense house with columns and lions, off which the
stucco was peeling, and with a footman in swallow-tails at the entrance.
The old park, laid out in the English style, gloomy and severe,
stretched for almost three-quarters of a mile to the river, and there
ended in a steep, precipitous clay bank, where pines grew with bare
roots that looked like shaggy paws; the water shone below with an
unfriendly gleam, and the peewits flew up with a plaintive cry, and
there one always felt that one must sit down and write a ballad. But
near the house itself, in the courtyard and orchard, which together with
the nurseries covered ninety acres, it was all life and gaiety even in
bad weather. Such marvellous roses, lilies, camellias; such tulips of
all possible shades, from glistening white to sooty black—such a wealth
of flowers, in fact, Kovrin had never seen anywhere as at Pesotsky''s. It
was only the beginning of spring, and the real glory of the flower-beds
was still hidden away in the hot-houses. But even the flowers along the
avenues, and here and there in the flower-beds, were enough to make one
feel, as one walked about the garden, as though one were in a realm of
tender colours, especially in the early morning when the dew was
glistening on every petal.

What was the decorative part of the garden, and what Pesotsky
contemptuously spoke of as rubbish, had at one time in his childhood
given Kovrin an impression of fairyland.

Every sort of caprice, of elaborate monstrosity and mockery at Nature
was here. There were espaliers of fruit-trees, a pear-tree in the shape
of a pyramidal poplar, spherical oaks and lime-trees, an apple-tree in
the shape of an umbrella, plum-trees trained into arches, crests,
candelabra, and even into the number 1862—the year when Pesotsky first
took up horticulture. One came across, too, lovely, graceful trees with
strong, straight stems like palms, and it was only by looking intently
that one could recognise these trees as gooseberries or currants. But
what made the garden most cheerful and gave it a lively air, was the
continual coming and going in it, from early morning till evening;
people with wheelbarrows, shovels, and watering-cans swarmed round the
trees and bushes, in the avenues and the flower-beds, like ants....

Kovrin arrived at Pesotsky''s at ten o''clock in the evening. He found
Tanya and her father, Yegor Semyonitch, in great anxiety. The clear
starlight sky and the thermometer foretold a frost towards morning, and
meanwhile Ivan Karlovitch, the gardener, had gone to the town, and they
had no one to rely upon. At supper they talked of nothing but the
morning frost, and it was settled that Tanya should not go to bed, and
between twelve and one should walk through the garden, and see that
everything was done properly, and Yegor Semyonitch should get up at
three o''clock or even earlier.

Kovrin sat with Tanya all the evening, and after midnight went out with
her into the garden. It was cold. There was a strong smell of burning
already in the garden. In the big orchard, which was called the
commercial garden, and which brought Yegor Semyonitch several thousand
clear profit, a thick, black, acrid smoke was creeping over the ground
and, curling around the trees, was saving those thousands from the
frost. Here the trees were arranged as on a chessboard, in straight and
regular rows like ranks of soldiers, and this severe pedantic
regularity, and the fact that all the trees were of the same size, and
had tops and trunks all exactly alike, made them look monotonous and
even dreary. Kovrin and Tanya walked along the rows where fires of dung,
straw, and all sorts of refuse were smouldering, and from time to time
they were met by labourers who wandered in the smoke like shadows. The
only trees in flower were the cherries, plums, and certain sorts of
apples, but the whole garden was plunged in smoke, and it was only near
the nurseries that Kovrin could breathe freely.

"Even as a child I used to sneeze from the smoke here," he said,
shrugging his shoulders, "but to this day I don''t understand how smoke
can keep off frost."

He laughed and took her arm. Her broad, very earnest face, chilled with
the frost, with her delicate black eyebrows, the turned-up collar of her
coat, which prevented her moving her head freely, and the whole of her
thin, graceful figure, with her skirts tucked up on account of the dew,
touched him.

"Good heavens! she is grown up," he said. "When I went away from here
last, five years ago, you were still a child. You were such a thin,
longlegged creature, with your hair hanging on your shoulders; you used
to wear short frocks, and I used to tease you, calling you a heron....
What time does!"

"Yes, five years!" sighed Tanya. "Much water has flowed since then. Tell
me, Andryusha, honestly," she began eagerly, looking him in the face:
"do you feel strange with us now? But why do I ask you? You are a man,
you live your own interesting life, you are somebody.... To grow apart
is so natural! But however that may be, Andryusha, I want you to think
of us as your people. We have a right to that."

"You were surprised this evening that we have so many of your
photographs. You know my father adores you. Sometimes it seems to me
that he loves you more than he does me. He is proud of you. You are a
clever, extraordinary man, you have made a brilliant career for
yourself, and he is persuaded that you have turned out like this because
he brought you up. I don''t try to prevent him from thinking so. Let
him."

Dawn was already beginning, and that was especially perceptible from the
distinctness with which the coils of smoke and the tops of the trees
began to stand out in the air.

"It''s time we were asleep, though," said Tanya, "and it''s cold, too."
She took his arm. "Thank you for coming, Andryusha. We have only
uninteresting acquaintances, and not many of them. We have only the
garden, the garden, the garden, and nothing else. Standards,
half-standards," she laughed. "Aports, Reinettes, Borovinkas, budded
stocks, grafted stocks.... All, all our life has gone into the garden. I
never even dream of anything but apples and pears. Of course, it is very
nice and useful, but sometimes one longs for something else for variety.
I remember that when you used to come to us for the summer holidays, or
simply a visit, it always seemed to be fresher and brighter in the
house, as though the covers had been taken off the lustres and the
furniture. I was only a little girl then, but yet I understood it."

She talked a long while and with great feeling. For some reason the idea
came into his head that in the course of the summer he might grow fond
of this little, weak, talkative creature, might be carried away and fall
in love; in their position it was so possible and natural! This thought
touched and amused him; he bent down to her sweet, preoccupied face and
hummed softly:

By the time they reached the house, Yegor Semyonitch had got up. Kovrin
did not feel sleepy; he talked to the old man and went to the garden
with him. Yegor Semyonitch was a tall, broad-shouldered, corpulent man,
and he suffered from asthma, yet he walked so fast that it was hard work
to hurry after him. He had an extremely preoccupied air; he was always
hurrying somewhere, with an expression that suggested that if he were
one minute late all would be ruined!

"Here is a business, brother ..." he began, standing still to take
breath. "On the surface of the ground, as you see, is frost; but if you
raise the thermometer on a stick fourteen feet above the ground, there
it is warm.... Why is that?"

"H''m!... One can''t know everything, of course.... However large the
intellect may be, you can''t find room for everything in it. I suppose
you still go in chiefly for philosophy?"

"Well, God bless you!..." said Yegor Semyonitch, meditatively stroking
his grey whiskers. "God bless you!... I am delighted about you ...
delighted, my boy...."

But suddenly he listened, and, with a terrible face, ran off and quickly
disappeared behind the trees in a cloud of smoke.

"Who tied this horse to an apple-tree?" Kovrin heard his despairing,
heart-rending cry. "Who is the low scoundrel who has dared to tie this
horse to an apple-tree? My God, my God! They have ruined everything;
they have spoilt everything; they have done everything filthy, horrible,
and abominable. The orchard''s done for, the orchard''s ruined. My God!"

"What is one to do with these accursed people?" he said in a tearful
voice, flinging up his hands. "Styopka was carting dung at night, and
tied the horse to an apple-tree! He twisted the reins round it, the
rascal, as tightly as he could, so that the bark is rubbed off in three
places. What do you think of that! I spoke to him and he stands like a
post and only blinks his eyes. Hanging is too good for him."

"Well, God bless you!... God bless you!..." he muttered. "I am very glad
you have come. Unutterably glad.... Thank you."

Then, with the same rapid step and preoccupied face, he made the round
of the whole garden, and showed his former ward all his greenhouses and
hot-houses, his covered-in garden, and two apiaries which he called the
marvel of our century.

While they were walking the sun rose, flooding the garden with brilliant
light. It grew warm. Foreseeing a long, bright, cheerful day, Kovrin
recollected that it was only the beginning of May, and that he had
before him a whole summer as bright, cheerful, and long; and suddenly
there stirred in his bosom a joyous, youthful feeling, such as he used
to experience in his childhood, running about in that garden. And he
hugged the old man and kissed him affectionately. Both of them, feeling
touched, went indoors and drank tea out of old-fashioned china cups,
with cream and satisfying krendels made with milk and eggs; and these
trifles reminded Kovrin again of his childhood and boyhood. The
delightful present was blended with the impressions of the past that
stirred within him; there was a tightness at his heart; yet he was
happy.

He waited till Tanya was awake and had coffee with her, went for a walk,
then went to his room and sat down to work. He read attentively, making
notes, and from time to time raised his eyes to look out at the open
windows or at the fresh, still dewy flowers in the vases on the table;
and again he dropped his eyes to his book, and it seemed to him as
though every vein in his body was quivering and fluttering with
pleasure.

In the country he led just as nervous and restless a life as in town. He
read and wrote a great deal, he studied Italian, and when he was out for
a walk, thought with pleasure that he would soon sit down to work again.
He slept so little that every one wondered at him; if he accidentally
dozed for half an hour in the daytime, he would lie awake all night,
and, after a sleepless night, would feel cheerful and vigorous as though
nothing had happened.

He talked a great deal, drank wine, and smoked expensive cigars. Very
often, almost every day, young ladies of neighbouring families would
come to the Pesotskys'', and would sing and play the piano with Tanya;
sometimes a young neighbour who was a good violinist would come, too.
Kovrin listened with eagerness to the music and singing, and was
exhausted by it, and this showed itself by his eyes closing and his head
falling to one side.

One day he was sitting on the balcony after evening tea, reading. At the
same time, in the drawing-room, Tanya taking soprano, one of the young
ladies a contralto, and the young man with his violin, were practising a
well-known serenade of Braga''s. Kovrin listened to the words—they were
Russian—and could not understand their meaning. At last, leaving his
book and listening attentively, he understood: a maiden, full of sick
fancies, heard one night in her garden mysterious sounds, so strange and
lovely that she was obliged to recognise them as a holy harmony which is
unintelligible to us mortals, and so flies back to heaven. Kovrin''s eyes
began to close. He got up, and in exhaustion walked up and down the
drawing-room, and then the dining-room. When the singing was over he
took Tanya''s arm, and with her went out on the balcony.

"I have been all day thinking of a legend," he said. "I don''t remember
whether I have read it somewhere or heard it, but it is a strange and
almost grotesque legend. To begin with, it is somewhat obscure. A
thousand years ago a monk, dressed in black, wandered about the desert,
somewhere in Syria or Arabia.... Some miles from where he was, some
fisherman saw another black monk, who was moving slowly over the surface
of a lake. This second monk was a mirage. Now forget all the laws of
optics, which the legend does not recognise, and listen to the rest.
From that mirage there was cast another mirage, then from that other a
third, so that the image of the black monk began to be repeated
endlessly from one layer of the atmosphere to another. So that he was
seen at one time in Africa, at another in Spain, then in Italy, then in
the Far North.... Then he passed out of the atmosphere of the earth, and
now he is wandering all over the universe, still never coming into
conditions in which he might disappear. Possibly he may be seen now in
Mars or in some star of the Southern Cross. But, my dear, the real point
on which the whole legend hangs lies in the fact that, exactly a
thousand years from the day when the monk walked in the desert, the
mirage will return to the atmosphere of the earth again and will appear
to men. And it seems that the thousand years is almost up.... According
to the legend, we may look out for the black monk to-day or to-morrow."

"But the most wonderful part of it all," laughed Kovrin, "is that I
simply cannot recall where I got this legend from. Have I read it
somewhere? Have I heard it? Or perhaps I dreamed of the black monk. I
swear I don''t remember. But the legend interests me. I have been
thinking about it all day."

Letting Tanya go back to her visitors, he went out of the house, and,
lost in meditation, walked by the flower-beds. The sun was already
setting. The flowers, having just been watered, gave forth a damp,
irritating fragrance. Indoors they began singing again, and in the
distance the violin had the effect of a human voice. Kovrin, racking his
brains to remember where he had read or heard the legend, turned slowly
towards the park, and unconsciously went as far as the river. By a
little path that ran along the steep bank, between the bare roots, he
went down to the water, disturbed the peewits there and frightened two
ducks. The last rays of the setting sun still threw light here and there
on the gloomy pines, but it was quite dark on the surface of the river.
Kovrin crossed to the other side by the narrow bridge. Before him lay a
wide field covered with young rye not yet in blossom. There was no
living habitation, no living soul in the distance, and it seemed as
though the little path, if one went along it, would take one to the
unknown, mysterious place where the sun had just gone down, and where
the evening glow was flaming in immensity and splendour.

"How open, how free, how still it is here!" thought Kovrin, walking
along the path. "And it feels as though all the world were watching me,
hiding and waiting for me to understand it...."

But then waves began running across the rye, and a light evening breeze
softly touched his uncovered head. A minute later there was another gust
of wind, but stronger—the rye began rustling, and he heard behind him
the hollow murmur of the pines. Kovrin stood still in amazement. From
the horizon there rose up to the sky, like a whirlwind or a waterspout,
a tall black column. Its outline was indistinct, but from the first
instant it could be seen that it was not standing still, but moving with
fearful rapidity, moving straight towards Kovrin, and the nearer it came
the smaller and the more distinct it was. Kovrin moved aside into the
rye to make way for it, and only just had time to do so.

A monk, dressed in black, with a grey head and black eyebrows, his arms
crossed over his breast, floated by him.... His bare feet did not touch
the earth. After he had floated twenty feet beyond him, he looked round
at Kovrin, and nodded to him with a friendly but sly smile. But what a
pale, fearfully pale, thin face! Beginning to grow larger again, he flew
across the river, collided noiselessly with the clay bank and pines, and
passing through them, vanished like smoke.

Without trying to explain to himself the strange apparition, glad that
he had succeeded in seeing so near and so distinctly, not only the
monk''s black garments, but even his face and eyes, agreeably excited, he
went back to the house.

In the park and in the garden people were moving about quietly, in the
house they were playing—so he alone had seen the monk. He had an
intense desire to tell Tanya and Yegor Semyonitch, but he reflected that
they would certainly think his words the ravings of delirium, and that
would frighten them; he had better say nothing.

He laughed aloud, sang, and danced the mazurka; he was in high spirits,
and all of them, the visitors and Tanya, thought he had a peculiar look,
radiant and inspired, and that he was very interesting.

After supper, when the visitors had gone, he went to his room and lay
down on the sofa: he wanted to think about the monk. But a minute later
Tanya came in.

"Here, Andryusha; read father''s articles," she said, giving him a bundle
of pamphlets and proofs. "They are splendid articles. He writes
capitally."

"Capitally, indeed!" said Yegor Semyonitch, following her and smiling
constrainedly; he was ashamed. "Don''t listen to her, please; don''t read
them! Though, if you want to go to sleep, read them by all means; they
are a fine soporific."

"I think they are splendid articles," said Tanya, with deep conviction.
"You read them, Andryusha, and persuade father to write oftener. He
could write a complete manual of horticulture."

Yegor Semyonitch gave a forced laugh, blushed, and began uttering the
phrases usually made use of by an embarrassed author. At last he began
to give way.

"In that case, begin with Gaucher''s article and these Russian articles,"
he muttered, turning over the pamphlets with a trembling hand, "or else
you won''t understand. Before you read my objections, you must know what
I am objecting to. But it''s all nonsense ... tiresome stuff. Besides, I
believe it''s bedtime."

"Yes, my boy ..." he began after a pause. "That''s how it is, my dear
lecturer. Here I write articles, and take part in exhibitions, and
receive medals.... Pesotsky, they say, has apples the size of a head,
and Pesotsky, they say, has made his fortune with his garden. In short,
''Kotcheby is rich and glorious.'' But one asks oneself: what is it all
for? The garden is certainly fine, a model. It''s not really a garden,
but a regular institution, which is of the greatest public importance
because it marks, so to say, a new era in Russian agriculture and
Russian industry. But, what''s it for? What''s the object of it?"

"I do not mean in that sense. I meant to ask: what will happen to the
garden when I die? In the condition in which you see it now, it would
not be maintained for one month without me. The whole secret of success
lies not in its being a big garden or a great number of labourers being
employed in it, but in the fact that I love the work. Do you understand?
I love it perhaps more than myself. Look at me; I do everything myself.
I work from morning to night: I do all the grafting myself, the pruning
myself, the planting myself. I do it all myself: when any one helps me I
am jealous and irritable till I am rude. The whole secret lies in loving
it—that is, in the sharp eye of the master; yes, and in the master''s
hands, and in the feeling that makes one, when one goes anywhere for an
hour''s visit, sit, ill at ease, with one''s heart far away, afraid that
something may have happened in the garden. But when I die, who will look
after it? Who will work? The gardener? The labourers? Yes? But I will
tell you, my dear fellow, the worst enemy in the garden is not a hare,
not a cockchafer, and not the frost, but any outside person."

"And Tanya?" asked Kovrin, laughing. "She can''t be more harmful than a
hare? She loves the work and understands it."

"Yes, she loves it and understands it. If after my death the garden goes
to her and she is the mistress, of course nothing better could be
wished. But if, which God forbid, she should marry," Yegor Semyonitch
whispered, and looked with a frightened look at Kovrin, "that''s just it.
If she marries and children come, she will have no time to think about
the garden. What I fear most is: she will marry some fine gentleman, and
he will be greedy, and he will let the garden to people who will run it
for profit, and everything will go to the devil the very first year! In
our work females are the scourge of God!"

"Perhaps it is egoism, but I tell you frankly: I don''t want Tanya to get
married. I am afraid of it! There is one young dandy comes to see us,
bringing his violin and scraping on it; I know Tanya will not marry him,
I know it quite well; but I can''t bear to see him! Altogether, my boy, I
am very queer. I know that."

Yegor Semyonitch got up and walked about the room in excitement, and it
was evident that he wanted to say something very important, but could
not bring himself to it.

"I am very fond of you, and so I am going to speak to you openly," he
decided at last, thrusting his hands into his pockets. "I deal plainly
with certain delicate questions, and say exactly what I think, and I
cannot endure so-called hidden thoughts. I will speak plainly: you are
the only man to whom I should not be afraid to marry my daughter. You
are a clever man with a good heart, and would not let my beloved work go
to ruin; and the chief reason is that I love you as a son, and I am
proud of you. If Tanya and you could get up a romance somehow,
then—well! I should be very glad and even happy. I tell you this
plainly, without mincing matters, like an honest man."

"If Tanya and you had a son, I would make a horticulturist of him," he
said, after a moment''s thought. "However, this is idle dreaming.
Goodnight."

Left alone, Kovrin settled himself more comfortably on the sofa and took
up the articles. The title of one was "On Intercropping"; of another, "A
few Words on the Remarks of Monsieur Z. concerning the Trenching of the
Soil for a New Garden"; a third, "Additional Matter concerning Grafting
with a Dormant Bud"; and they were all of the same sort. But what a
restless, jerky tone! What nervous, almost hysterical passion! Here was
an article, one would have thought, with most peaceable and impersonal
contents: the subject of it was the Russian Antonovsky Apple. But Yegor
Semyonitch began it with "Audiatur altera pars," and finished it with
"Sapienti sat"; and between these two quotations a perfect torrent of
venomous phrases directed "at the learned ignorance of our recognised
horticultural authorities, who observe Nature from the height of their
university chairs," or at Monsieur Gaucher, "whose success has been the
work of the vulgar and the dilettanti." And then followed an
inappropriate, affected, and insincere regret that peasants who stole
fruit and broke the branches could not nowadays be flogged.

"It is beautiful, charming, healthy work, but even in this there is
strife and passion," thought Kovrin, "I suppose that everywhere and in
all careers men of ideas are nervous, and marked by exaggerated
sensitiveness. Most likely it must be so."

He thought of Tanya, who was so pleased with Yegor Semyonitch''s
articles. Small, pale, and so thin that her shoulder-blades stuck out,
her eyes, wide and open, dark and intelligent, had an intent gaze, as
though looking for something. She walked like her father with a little
hurried step. She talked a great deal and was fond of arguing,
accompanying every phrase, however insignificant, with expressive
mimicry and gesticulation. No doubt she was nervous in the extreme.

Kovrin went on reading the articles, but he understood nothing of them,
and flung them aside. The same pleasant excitement with which he had
earlier in the evening danced the mazurka and listened to the music was
now mastering him again and rousing a multitude of thoughts. He got up
and began walking about the room, thinking about the black monk. It
occurred to him that if this strange, supernatural monk had appeared to
him only, that meant that he was ill and had reached the point of having
hallucinations. This reflection frightened him, but not for long.

"But I am all right, and I am doing no harm to any one; so there is no
harm in my hallucinations," he thought; and he felt happy again.

He sat down on the sofa and clasped his hands round his head.
Restraining the unaccountable joy which filled his whole being, he then
paced up and down again, and sat down to his work. But the thought that
he read in the book did not satisfy him. He wanted something gigantic,
unfathomable, stupendous. Towards morning he undressed and reluctantly
went to bed: he ought to sleep.

When he heard the footsteps of Yegor Semyonitch going out into the
garden, Kovrin rang the bell and asked the footman to bring him some
wine. He drank several glasses of Lafitte, then wrapped himself up, head
and all; his consciousness grew clouded and he fell asleep.

They quarrelled about something that morning. Tanya burst out crying and
went to her room. She would not come down to dinner nor to tea. At first
Yegor Semyonitch went about looking sulky and dignified, as though to
give every one to understand that for him the claims of justice and good
order were more important than anything else in the world; but he could
not keep it up for long, and soon sank into depression. He walked about
the park dejectedly, continually sighing: "Oh, my God! My God!" and at
dinner did not eat a morsel. At last, guilty and conscience-stricken, he
knocked at the locked door and called timidly:

The depression of the master and mistress was reflected in the whole
household, even in the labourers working in the garden. Kovrin was
absorbed in his interesting work, but at last he, too, felt dreary and
uncomfortable. To dissipate the general ill-humour in some way, he made
up his mind to intervene, and towards evening he knocked at Tanya''s
door. He was admitted.

"Fie, fie, for shame!" he began playfully, looking with surprise at
Tanya''s tear-stained, woebegone face, flushed in patches with crying.
"Is it really so serious? Fie, fie!"

"But if you knew how he tortures me!" she said, and floods of scalding
tears streamed from her big eyes. "He torments me to death," she went
on, wringing her hands. "I said nothing to him ... nothing ... I only
said that there was no need to keep ... too many labourers ... if we
could hire them by the day when we wanted them. You know ... you know
the labourers have been doing nothing for a whole week.... I ... I ...
only said that, and he shouted and ... said ... a lot of horrible
insulting things to me. What for?"

"There, there," said Kovrin, smoothing her hair. "You''ve quarrelled with
each other, you''ve cried, and that''s enough. You must not be angry for
long—that''s wrong ... all the more as he loves you beyond everything."

"He has ... has spoiled my whole life," Tanya went on, sobbing. "I hear
nothing but abuse and ... insults. He thinks I am of no use in the
house. Well! He is right. I shall go away to-morrow; I shall become a
telegraph clerk.... I don''t care...."

"Come, come, come.... You mustn''t cry, Tanya. You mustn''t, dear.... You
are both hot-tempered and irritable, and you are both to blame. Come
along; I will reconcile you."

Kovrin talked affectionately and persuasively, while she went on crying,
twitching her shoulders and wringing her hands, as though some terrible
misfortune had really befallen her. He felt all the sorrier for her
because her grief was not a serious one, yet she suffered extremely.
What trivialities were enough to make this little creature miserable for
a whole day, perhaps for her whole life! Comforting Tanya, Kovrin
thought that, apart from this girl and her father, he might hunt the
world over and would not find people who would love him as one of
themselves, as one of their kindred. If it had not been for those two he
might very likely, having lost his father and mother in early childhood,
never to the day of his death have known what was meant by genuine
affection and that naÃ¯ve, uncritical love which is only lavished on very
close blood relations; and he felt that the nerves of this weeping,
shaking girl responded to his half-sick, overstrained nerves like iron
to a magnet. He never could have loved a healthy, strong, rosy-cheeked
woman, but pale, weak, unhappy Tanya attracted him.

And he liked stroking her hair and her shoulders, pressing her hand and
wiping away her tears.... At last she left off crying. She went on for a
long time complaining of her father and her hard, insufferable life in
that house, entreating Kovrin to put himself in her place; then she
began, little by little, smiling, and sighing that God had given her
such a bad temper. At last, laughing aloud, she called herself a fool,
and ran out of the room.

When a little later Kovrin went into the garden, Yegor Semyonitch and
Tanya were walking side by side along an avenue as though nothing had
happened, and both were eating rye bread with salt on it, as both were
hungry.

Glad that he had been so successful in the part of peacemaker, Kovrin
went into the park. Sitting on a garden seat, thinking, he heard the
rattle of a carriage and a feminine laugh—visitors were arriving. When
the shades of evening began falling on the garden, the sounds of the
violin and singing voices reached him indistinctly, and that reminded
him of the black monk. Where, in what land or in what planet, was that
optical absurdity moving now?

Hardly had he recalled the legend and pictured in his imagination the
dark apparition he had seen in the rye-field, when, from behind a
pine-tree exactly opposite, there came out noiselessly, without the
slightest rustle, a man of medium height with uncovered grey head, all
in black, and barefooted like a beggar, and his black eyebrows stood out
conspicuously on his pale, death-like face. Nodding his head graciously,
this beggar or pilgrim came noiselessly to the seat and sat down, and
Kovrin recognised him as the black monk.

For a minute they looked at one another, Kovrin with amazement, and the
monk with friendliness, and, just as before, a little slyness, as though
he were thinking something to himself.

"But you are a mirage," said Kovrin. "Why are you here and sitting
still? That does not fit in with the legend."

"That does not matter," the monk answered in a low voice, not
immediately turning his face towards him. "The legend, the mirage, and I
are all the products of your excited imagination. I am a phantom."

"You can think as you like," said the monk, with a faint smile. "I exist
in your imagination, and your imagination is part of nature, so I exist
in nature."

"You have a very old, wise, and extremely expressive face, as though you
really had lived more than a thousand years," said Kovrin. "I did not
know that my imagination was capable of creating such phenomena. But why
do you look at me with such enthusiasm? Do you like me?"

"Yes, you are one of those few who are justly called the chosen of God.
You do the service of eternal truth. Your thoughts, your designs, the
marvellous studies you are engaged in, and all your life, bear the
Divine, the heavenly stamp, seeing that they are consecrated to the
rational and the beautiful—that is, to what is eternal."

"You said ''eternal truth.'' ... But is eternal truth of use to man and
within his reach, if there is no eternal life?"

"Yes, of course. A grand, brilliant future is in store for you men. And
the more there are like you on earth, the sooner will this future be
realised. Without you who serve the higher principle and live in full
understanding and freedom, mankind would be of little account;
developing in a natural way, it would have to wait a long time for the
end of its earthly history. You will lead it some thousands of years
earlier into the kingdom of eternal truth—and therein lies your supreme
service. You are the incarnation of the blessing of God, which rests
upon men."

"As of all life—enjoyment. True enjoyment lies in knowledge, and
eternal life provides innumerable and inexhaustible sources of
knowledge, and in that sense it has been said: ''In My Father''s house
there are many mansions.''"

"If only you knew how pleasant it is to hear you!" said Kovrin, rubbing
his hands with satisfaction.

"But I know that when you go away I shall be worried by the question of
your reality. You are a phantom, an hallucination. So I am mentally
deranged, not normal?"

"What if you are? Why trouble yourself? You are ill because you have
overworked and exhausted yourself, and that means that you have
sacrificed your health to the idea, and the time is near at hand when
you will give up life itself to it. What could be better? That is the
goal towards which all divinely endowed, noble natures strive."

"And are you sure that the men of genius, whom all men trust, did not
see phantoms, too? The learned say now that genius is allied to madness.
My friend, healthy and normal people are only the common herd.
Reflections upon the neurasthenia of the age, nervous exhaustion and
degeneracy, et cetera, can only seriously agitate those who place the
object of life in the present—that is, the common herd."

"Not everything the Greeks and the Romans said is true. Exaltation,
enthusiasm, ecstasy—all that distinguishes prophets, poets, martyrs for
the idea, from the common folk—is repellent to the animal side of
man—that is, his physical health. I repeat, if you want to be healthy
and normal, go to the common herd."

"Strange that you repeat what often comes into my mind," said Kovrin.
"It is as though you had seen and overheard my secret thoughts. But
don''t let us talk about me. What do you mean by ''eternal truth''?"

The monk did not answer. Kovrin looked at him and could not distinguish
his face. His features grew blurred and misty. Then the monk''s head and
arms disappeared; his body seemed merged into the seat and the evening
twilight, and he vanished altogether.

He went back to the house, light-hearted and happy. The little the monk
had said to him had flattered, not his vanity, but his whole soul, his
whole being. To be one of the chosen, to serve eternal truth, to stand
in the ranks of those who could make mankind worthy of the kingdom of
God some thousands of years sooner—that is, to free men from some
thousands of years of unnecessary struggle, sin, and suffering; to
sacrifice to the idea everything—youth, strength, health; to be ready
to die for the common weal—what an exalted, what a happy lot! He
recalled his past—pure, chaste, laborious; he remembered what he had
learned himself and what he had taught to others, and decided that there
was no exaggeration in the monk''s words.

"Are you here?" she said. "And we have been looking and looking for
you.... But what is the matter with you?" she asked in wonder, glancing
at his radiant, ecstatic face and eyes full of tears. "How strange you
are, Andryusha!"

"I am pleased, Tanya," said Kovrin, laying his hand on her shoulders. "I
am more than pleased: I am happy. Tanya, darling Tanya, you are an
extraordinary, nice creature. Dear Tanya, I am so glad, I am so glad!"

"I have just passed through an exalted, wonderful, unearthly moment. But
I can''t tell you all about it or you would call me mad and not believe
me. Let us talk of you. Dear, delightful Tanya! I love you, and am used
to loving you. To have you near me, to meet you a dozen times a day, has
become a necessity of my existence; I don''t know how I shall get on
without you when I go back home."

"Oh," laughed Tanya, "you will forget about us in two days. We are
humble people and you are a great man."

"No; let us talk in earnest!" he said. "I shall take you with me, Tanya.
Yes? Will you come with me? Will you be mine?"

"Come," said Tanya, and tried to laugh again, but the laugh would not
come, and patches of colour came into her face.

She began breathing quickly and walked very quickly, but not to the
house, but further into the park.

"I want a love that will dominate me altogether; and that love only you,
Tanya, can give me. I am happy! I am happy!"

She was overwhelmed, and huddling and shrinking together, seemed ten
years older all at once, while he thought her beautiful and expressed
his rapture aloud:

Learning from Kovrin that not only a romance had been got up, but that
there would even be a wedding, Yegor Semyonitch spent a long time in
pacing from one corner of the room to the other, trying to conceal his
agitation. His hands began trembling, his neck swelled and turned
purple, he ordered his racing droshky and drove off somewhere. Tanya,
seeing how he lashed the horse, and seeing how he pulled his cap over
his ears, understood what he was feeling, shut herself up in her room,
and cried the whole day.

In the hot-houses the peaches and plums were already ripe; the packing
and sending off of these tender and fragile goods to Moscow took a great
deal of care, work, and trouble. Owing to the fact that the summer was
very hot and dry, it was necessary to water every tree, and a great deal
of time and labour was spent on doing it. Numbers of caterpillars made
their appearance, which, to Kovrin''s disgust, the labourers and even
Yegor Semyonitch and Tanya squashed with their fingers. In spite of all
that, they had already to book autumn orders for fruit and trees, and to
carry on a great deal of correspondence. And at the very busiest time,
when no one seemed to have a free moment, the work of the fields carried
off more than half their labourers from the garden. Yegor Semyonitch,
sunburnt, exhausted, ill-humoured, galloped from the fields to the
garden and back again; cried that he was being torn to pieces, and that
he should put a bullet through his brains.

Then came the fuss and worry of the trousseau, to which the Pesotskys
attached a good deal of importance. Every one''s head was in a whirl from
the snipping of the scissors, the rattle of the sewing-machine, the
smell of hot irons, and the caprices of the dressmaker, a huffy and
nervous lady. And, as ill-luck would have it, visitors came every day,
who had to be entertained, fed, and even put up for the night. But all
this hard labour passed unnoticed as though in a fog. Tanya felt that
love and happiness had taken her unawares, though she had, since she was
fourteen, for some reason been convinced that Kovrin would marry her and
no one else. She was bewildered, could not grasp it, could not believe
herself.... At one minute such joy would swoop down upon her that she
longed to fly away to the clouds and there pray to God, at another
moment she would remember that in August she would have to part from her
home and leave her father; or, goodness knows why, the idea would occur
to her that she was worthless—insignificant and unworthy of a great man
like Kovrin—and she would go to her room, lock herself in, and cry
bitterly for several hours. When there were visitors, she would suddenly
fancy that Kovrin looked extraordinarily handsome, and that all the
women were in love with him and envying her, and her soul was filled
with pride and rapture, as though she had vanquished the whole world;
but he had only to smile politely at any young lady for her to be
trembling with jealousy, to retreat to her room—and tears again. These
new sensations mastered her completely; she helped her father
mechanically, without noticing peaches, caterpillars or labourers, or
how rapidly the time was passing.

It was almost the same with Yegor Semyonitch. He worked from morning
till night, was always in a hurry, was irritable, and flew into rages,
but all of this was in a sort of spellbound dream. It seemed as though
there were two men in him: one was the real Yegor Semyonitch, who was
moved to indignation, and clutched his head in despair when he heard of
some irregularity from Ivan Karlovitch the gardener; and another—not
the real one—who seemed as though he were half drunk, would interrupt a
business conversation at half a word, touch the gardener on the
shoulder, and begin muttering:

"Say what you like, there is a great deal in blood. His mother was a
wonderful woman, most high-minded and intelligent. It was a pleasure to
look at her good, candid, pure face; it was like the face of an angel.
She drew splendidly, wrote verses, spoke five foreign languages,
sang.... Poor thing! she died of consumption. The Kingdom of Heaven be
hers."

"When he was a boy and growing up in my house, he had the same angelic
face, good and candid. The way he looks and talks and moves is as soft
and elegant as his mother''s. And his intellect! We were always struck
with his intelligence. To be sure, it''s not for nothing he''s a Master of
Arts! It''s not for nothing! And wait a bit, Ivan Karlovitch, what will
he be in ten years'' time? He will be far above us!"

But at this point the real Yegor Semyonitch, suddenly coming to himself,
would make a terrible face, would clutch his head and cry:

"The devils! They have spoilt everything! They have ruined everything!
They have spoilt everything! The garden''s done for, the garden''s
ruined!"

Kovrin, meanwhile, worked with the same ardour as before, and did not
notice the general commotion. Love only added fuel to the flames. After
every talk with Tanya he went to his room, happy and triumphant, took up
his book or his manuscript with the same passion with which he had just
kissed Tanya and told her of his love. What the black monk had told him
of the chosen of God, of eternal truth, of the brilliant future of
mankind and so on, gave peculiar and extraordinary significance to his
work, and filled his soul with pride and the consciousness of his own
exalted consequence. Once or twice a week, in the park or in the house,
he met the black monk and had long conversations with him, but this did
not alarm him, but, on the contrary, delighted him, as he was now firmly
persuaded that such apparitions only visited the elect few who rise up
above their fellows and devote themselves to the service of the idea.

One day the monk appeared at dinner-time and sat in the dining-room
window. Kovrin was delighted, and very adroitly began a conversation
with Yegor Semyonitch and Tanya of what might be of interest to the
monk; the black-robed visitor listened and nodded his head graciously,
and Yegor Semyonitch and Tanya listened, too, and smiled gaily without
suspecting that Kovrin was not talking to them but to his hallucination.

Imperceptibly the fast of the Assumption was approaching, and soon after
came the wedding, which, at Yegor Semyonitch''s urgent desire, was
celebrated with "a flourish"—that is, with senseless festivities that
lasted for two whole days and nights. Three thousand roubles'' worth of
food and drink was consumed, but the music of the wretched hired band,
the noisy toasts, the scurrying to and fro of the footmen, the uproar
and crowding, prevented them from appreciating the taste of the
expensive wines and wonderful delicacies ordered from Moscow.

One long winter night Kovrin was lying in bed, reading a French novel.
Poor Tanya, who had headaches in the evenings from living in town, to
which she was not accustomed, had been asleep a long while, and, from
time to time, articulated some incoherent phrase in her restless dreams.

It struck three o''clock. Kovrin put out the light and lay down to sleep,
lay for a long time with his eyes closed, but could not get to sleep
because, as he fancied, the room was very hot and Tanya talked in her
sleep. At half-past four he lighted the candle again, and this time he
saw the black monk sitting in an arm-chair near the bed.

"Of fame," answered Kovrin. "In the French novel I have just been
reading, there is a description of a young savant, who does silly
things and pines away through worrying about fame. I can''t understand
such anxiety."

"Because you are wise. Your attitude towards fame is one of
indifference, as towards a toy which no longer interests you."

"Renown does not allure you now. What is there flattering, amusing, or
edifying in their carving your name on a tombstone, then time rubbing
off the inscription together with the gilding? Moreover, happily there
are too many of you for the weak memory of mankind to be able to retain
your names."

"Of course," assented Kovrin. "Besides, why should they be remembered?
But let us talk of something else. Of happiness, for instance. What is
happiness?"

When the clock struck five, he was sitting on the bed, dangling his feet
to the carpet, talking to the monk:

"In ancient times a happy man grew at last frightened of his happiness
—it was so great!—and to propitiate the gods he brought as a sacrifice
his favourite ring. Do you know, I, too, like Polykrates, begin to be
uneasy of my happiness. It seems strange to me that from morning to
night I feel nothing but joy; it fills my whole being and smothers all
other feelings. I don''t know what sadness, grief, or boredom is. Here I
am not asleep; I suffer from sleeplessness, but I am not dull. I say it
in earnest; I begin to feel perplexed."

"But why?" the monk asked in wonder. "Is joy a supernatural feeling?
Ought it not to be the normal state of man? The more highly a man is
developed on the intellectual and moral side, the more independent he
is, the more pleasure life gives him. Socrates, Diogenes, and Marcus
Aurelius, were joyful, not sorrowful. And the Apostle tells us: ''Rejoice
continually''; ''Rejoice and be glad.''"

"But will the gods be suddenly wrathful?" Kovrin jested; and he laughed.
"If they take from me comfort and make me go cold and hungry, it won''t
be very much to my taste."

Meanwhile Tanya woke up and looked with amazement and horror at her
husband. He was talking, addressing the arm-chair, laughing and
gesticulating; his eyes were gleaming, and there was something strange
in his laugh.

"Andryusha, whom are you talking to?" she asked, clutching the hand he
stretched out to the monk. "Andryusha! Whom?"

"Oh! Whom?" said Kovrin in confusion. "Why, to him.... He is sitting
here," he said, pointing to the black monk.

Tanya put her arm round her husband and held him tight, as though
protecting him from the apparition, and put her hand over his eyes.

"You are ill!" she sobbed, trembling all over. "Forgive me, my precious,
my dear one, but I have noticed for a long time that your mind is
clouded in some way.... You are mentally ill, Andryusha...."

Her trembling infected him, too. He glanced once more at the arm-chair,
which was now empty, felt a sudden weakness in his arms and legs, was
frightened, and began dressing.

"It''s nothing, Tanya; it''s nothing," he muttered, shivering. "I really
