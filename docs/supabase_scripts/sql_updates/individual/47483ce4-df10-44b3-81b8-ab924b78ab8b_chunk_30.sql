      eye to the keyhole. He was writing, and seemed very calm.

Then she returned to the kitchen and sat down, ready for any emergency.
      She slept on a chair and awoke at daylight.

She did the rooms as she had been accustomed to every morning; she swept
      and dusted, and, towards eight o''clock, prepared M. Lemonnier''s breakfast.

But she did not dare bring it to her master, knowing too well how she
      would be received; she waited for him to ring. But he did not ring. Nine
      o''clock, then ten o''clock went by.

Celeste, not knowing what to think, prepared her tray and started up with
      it, her heart beating fast.

She stopped before the door and listened. Everything was still. She
      knocked; no answer. Then, gathering up all her courage, she opened the
      door and entered. With a wild shriek, she dropped the breakfast tray which
      she had been holding in her hand.

In the middle of the room, M. Lemonnier was hanging by a rope from a ring
      in the ceiling. His tongue was sticking out horribly. His right slipper
      was lying on the ground, his left one still on his foot. An upturned chair
      had rolled over to the bed.

Celeste, dazed, ran away shrieking. All the neighbors crowded together.
      The physician declared that he had died at about midnight.

A letter addressed to M. Duretdur was found on the table of the suicide.
      It contained these words:

For five months they had been talking of going to take luncheon in one of
      the country suburbs of Paris on Madame Dufour''s birthday, and as they were
      looking forward very impatiently to the outing, they rose very early that
      morning. Monsieur Dufour had borrowed the milkman''s wagon and drove
      himself. It was a very tidy, two-wheeled conveyance, with a cover
      supported by four iron rods, with curtains that had been drawn up, except
      the one at the back, which floated out like a sail. Madame Dufour,
      resplendent in a wonderful, cherry colored silk dress, sat by the side of
      her husband.

The old grandmother and a girl sat behind them on two chairs, and a boy
      with yellow hair was lying at the bottom of the wagon, with nothing to be
      seen of him except his head.

When they reached the bridge of Neuilly, Monsieur Dufour said: “Here
      we are in the country at last!” and at that signal his wife grew
      sentimental about the beauties of nature. When they got to the crossroads
      at Courbevoie they were seized with admiration for the distant landscape.
      On the right was Argenteuil with its bell tower, and above it rose the
      hills of Sannois and the mill of Orgemont, while on the left the aqueduct
      of Marly stood out against the clear morning sky, and in the distance they
      could see the terrace of Saint-Germain; and opposite them, at the end of a
      low chain of hills, the new fort of Cormeilles. Quite in the distance; a
      very long way off, beyond the plains and village, one could see the sombre
      green of the forests.

The sun was beginning to burn their faces, the dust got into their eyes,
      and on either side of the road there stretched an interminable tract of
      bare, ugly country with an unpleasant odor. One might have thought that it
      had been ravaged by a pestilence, which had even attacked the buildings,
      for skeletons of dilapidated and deserted houses, or small cottages, which
      were left in an unfinished state, because the contractors had not been
      paid, reared their four roofless walls on each side.

Here and there tall factory chimneys rose up from the barren soil. The
      only vegetation on that putrid land, where the spring breezes wafted an
      odor of petroleum and slate, blended with another odor that was even less
      agreeable. At last, however, they crossed the Seine a second time, and the
      bridge was a delight. The river sparkled in the sun, and they had a
      feeling of quiet enjoyment, felt refreshed as they drank in the purer air
      that was not impregnated by the black smoke of factories nor by the miasma
      from the deposits of night soil. A man whom they met told them that the
      name of the place was Bezons. Monsieur Dufour pulled up and read the
      attractive announcement outside an eating house: Restaurant Poulin,
      matelottes and fried fish, private rooms, arbors, and swings.

It was a white country inn, built by the roadside, and through the open
      door she could see the bright zinc of the counter, at which sat two
      workmen in their Sunday clothes. At last she made up her mind and said:

They drove into a large field behind the inn, separated from the river by
      the towing path, and dismounted. The husband sprang out first and then
      held out his arms for his wife, and as the step was very high Madame
      Dufour, in order to reach him, had to show the lower part of her limbs,
      whose former slenderness had disappeared in fat, and Monsieur Dufour, who
      was already getting excited by the country air, pinched her calf, and
      then, taking her in his arms, he set her on the ground, as if she had been
      some enormous bundle. She shook the dust out of the silk dress and then
      looked round to see in what sort of a place she was.

She was a stout woman, of about thirty-six, full-blown, and delightful to
      look at. She could hardly breathe, as her corsets were laced too tightly,
      and their pressure forced her superabundant bosom up to her double chin.
      Next the girl placed her hand on her father''s shoulder and jumped down
      lightly. The boy with the yellow hair had got down by stepping on the
      wheel, and he helped Monsieur Dufour to lift his grandmother out. Then
      they unharnessed the horse, which they had tied to a tree, and the
      carriage fell back, with both shafts in the air. The men took off their
      coats and washed their hands in a pail of water and then went and joined
      the ladies, who had already taken possession of the swings.

Mademoiselle Dufour was trying to swing herself standing up, but she could
      not succeed in getting a start. She was a pretty girl of about eighteen,
      one of those women who suddenly excite your desire when you meet them in
      the street and who leave you with a vague feeling of uneasiness and of
      excited senses. She was tall, had a small waist and large hips, with a
      dark skin, very large eyes and very black hair. Her dress clearly marked
      the outlines of her firm, full figure, which was accentuated by the motion
      of her hips as she tried to swing herself higher. Her arms were stretched
      upward to hold the rope, so that her bosom rose at every movement she
      made. Her hat, which a gust of wind had blown off, was hanging behind her,
      and as the swing gradually rose higher and higher, she showed her delicate
      limbs up to the knees each time, and the breeze from her flying skirts,
      which was more heady than the fumes of wine, blew into the faces of the
      two men, who were looking at her and smiling.

At last he went, and turning up his shirt sleeves, as if undertaking a
      hard piece of work, with much difficulty he set his wife in motion. She
      clutched the two ropes and held her legs out straight, so as not to touch
      the ground. She enjoyed feeling dizzy at the motion of the swing, and her
      whole figure shook like a jelly on a dish, but as she went higher and
      higher; she became too giddy and was frightened. Each time the swing came
      down she uttered a piercing scream, which made all the little urchins in
      the neighborhood come round, and down below, beneath the garden hedge, she
      vaguely saw a row of mischievous heads making various grimaces as they
      laughed.

“Some fried fish, a rabbit saute, salad and dessert,” Madame
      Dufour said, with an important air.

The grandmother, who had an affection for cats, had been running after one
      that belonged to the house, trying to coax it to come to her for the last
      ten minutes. The animal, who was no doubt secretly flattered by her
      attentions, kept close to the good woman, but just out of reach of her
      hand, and quietly walked round the trees, against which she rubbed
      herself, with her tail up, purring with pleasure.

“Hello!” suddenly exclaimed the young man with the yellow
      hair, who was wandering about. “Here are two swell boats!”
      They all went to look at them and saw two beautiful canoes in a wooden
      shed; they were as beautifully finished as if they had been ornamental
      furniture. They hung side by side, like two tall, slender girls, in their
      narrow shining length, and made one wish to float in them on warm summer
      mornings and evenings along the flower-covered banks of the river, where
      the trees dip their branches into the water, where the rushes are
      continually rustling in the breeze and where the swift kingfishers dart
      about like flashes of blue lightning.

“Oh, they are indeed swell boats!” Monsieur Dufour repeated
      gravely, as he examined them like a connoiseur. He had been in the habit
      of rowing in his younger days, he said, and when he had spat in his hands—and
      he went through the action of pulling the oars—he did not care a fig
      for anybody. He had beaten more than one Englishman formerly at the
      Joinville regattas. He grew quite excited at last and offered to make a
      bet that in a boat like that he could row six leagues an hour without
      exerting himself.

“Luncheon is ready,” the waitress said, appearing at the
      entrance to the boathouse, and they all hurried off. But two young men had
      taken the very seats that Madame Dufour had selected and were eating their
      luncheon. No doubt they were the owners of the sculls, for they were in
      boating costume. They were stretched out, almost lying on the chairs; they
      were sun-browned and their thin cotton jerseys, with short sleeves, showed
      their bare arms, which were as strong as a blacksmith''s. They were two
      strong, athletic fellows, who showed in all their movements that
      elasticity and grace of limb which can only be acquired by exercise and
      which is so different to the deformity with which monotonous heavy work
      stamps the mechanic.

They exchanged a rapid smile when they saw the mother and then a glance on
      seeing the daughter.

The other got up immediately, and holding his black and red boating cap in
      his hand, he politely offered the ladies the only shady place in the
      garden. With many excuses they accepted, and that it might be more rural,
      they sat on the grass, without either tables or chairs.

The two young men took their plates, knives, forks, etc., to a table a
      little way off and began to eat again, and their bare arms, which they
      showed continually, rather embarrassed the girl. She even pretended to
      turn her head aside and not to see them, while Madame Dufour, who was
      rather bolder, tempted by feminine curiosity, looked at them every moment,
      and, no doubt, compared them with the secret unsightliness of her husband.
      She had squatted herself on ground, with her legs tucked under her, after
      the manner of tailors, and she kept moving about restlessly, saying that
      ants were crawling about her somewhere. Monsieur Dufour, annoyed at the
      presence of the polite strangers, was trying to find a comfortable
      position which he did not, however, succeed in doing, and the young man
      with the yellow hair was eating as silently as an ogre.

“It is lovely weather, monsieur,” the stout lady said to one
      of the boating men. She wished to be friendly because they had given up
      their place.

“Certainly it is, madame.” And he gave them such a practical
      account of his daily life that it awakened afresh in the hearts of these
      shopkeepers who were deprived of the meadows and who longed for country
      walks, to that foolish love of nature which they all feel so strongly the
      whole year round behind the counter in their shop.

The girl raised her eyes and looked at the oarsman with emotion and
      Monsieur Dufour spoke for the first time.

“No, thank you,” she replied, and turning to the young men
      again, and pointing to their arms, asked: “Do you never feel cold
      like that?”

They both began to laugh, and they astonished the family with an account
      of the enormous fatigue they could endure, of their bathing while in a
      state of tremendous perspiration, of their rowing in the fog at night; and
      they struck their chests violently to show how hollow they sounded.

“Ah! You look very strong,” said the husband, who did not talk
      any more of the time when he used to beat the English. The girl was
      looking at them sideways now, and the young fellow with the yellow hair,
      who had swallowed some wine the wrong way, was coughing violently and
      bespattering Madame Dufour''s cherry-colored silk dress. She got angry and
      sent for some water to wash the spots.

Meanwhile it had grown unbearably hot, the sparkling river looked like a
      blaze of fire and the fumes of the wine were getting into their heads.
      Monsieur Dufour, who had a violent hiccough, had unbuttoned his waistcoat
      and the top button of his trousers, while his wife, who felt choking, was
      gradually unfastening her dress. The apprentice was shaking his yellow wig
      in a happy frame of mind, and kept helping himself to wine, and the old
      grandmother, feeling the effects of the wine, was very stiff and
      dignified. As for the girl, one noticed only a peculiar brightness in her
      eyes, while the brown cheeks became more rosy.

The coffee finished, they suggested singing, and each of them sang or
      repeated a couplet, which the others applauded frantically. Then they got
      up with some difficulty, and while the two women, who were rather dizzy,
      were trying to get a breath of air, the two men, who were altogether
      drunk, were attempting gymnastics. Heavy, limp and with scarlet faces they
      hung or, awkwardly to the iron rings, without being able to raise
      themselves.

Meanwhile the two boating men had got their boats into the water, and they
      came back and politely asked the ladies whether they would like a row.

He merely gave her a drunken nod, without understanding what she said.
      Then one of the rowers came up with two fishing rods in his hands, and the
      hope of catching a gudgeon, that great vision of the Parisian shopkeeper,
      made Dufour''s dull eyes gleam, and he politely allowed them to do whatever
      they liked, while he sat in the shade under the bridge, with his feet
      dangling over the river, by the side of the young man with the yellow
      hair, who was sleeping soundly.

“Let us go to the little wood on the Ile aux Anglais!” he
      called out as he rowed off. The other boat went more slowly, for the rower
      was looking at his companion so intently that he thought of nothing else,
      and his emotion seemed to paralyze his strength, while the girl, who was
      sitting in the bow, gave herself up to the enjoyment of being on the
      water. She felt a disinclination to think, a lassitude in her limbs and a
      total enervation, as if she were intoxicated, and her face was flushed and
      her breathing quickened. The effects of the wine, which were increased by
      the extreme heat, made all the trees on the bank seem to bow as she
      passed. A vague wish for enjoyment and a fermentation of her blood seemed
      to pervade her whole body, which was excited by the heat of the day, and
      she was also disturbed at this tete-a-tete on the water, in a place which
      seemed depopulated by the heat, with this young man who thought her
      pretty, whose ardent looks seemed to caress her skin and were as
      penetrating and pervading as the sun''s rays.

Their inability to speak increased their emotion, and they looked about
      them. At last, however, he made an effort and asked her name.

“Why, my name is Henri,” he replied. The sound of their voices
      had calmed them, and they looked at the banks. The other boat had passed
      them and seemed to be waiting for them, and the rower called out:

“We will meet you in the wood; we are going as far as Robinson''s,
      because Madame Dufour is thirsty.” Then he bent over his oars again
      and rowed off so quickly that he was soon out of sight.

Meanwhile a continual roar, which they had heard for some time, came
      nearer, and the river itself seemed to shiver, as if the dull noise were
      rising from its depths.

“What is that noise?” she asked. It was the noise of the weir
      which cut the river in two at the island, and he was explaining it to her,
      when, above the noise of the waterfall, they heard the song of a bird,
      which seemed a long way off.

“Listen!” he said; “the nightingales are singing during
      the day, so the female birds must be sitting.”

A nightingale! She had never heard one before, and the idea of listening
      to one roused visions of poetic tenderness in her heart. A nightingale!
      That is to say, the invisible witness of her love trysts which Juliet
      invoked on her balcony; that celestial music which it attuned to human
      kisses, that eternal inspirer of all those languorous romances which open
      an ideal sky to all the poor little tender hearts of sensitive girls!

“We must not make a noise,” her companion said, “and
      then we can go into the wood, and sit down close beside it.”

The boat seemed to glide. They saw the trees on the island, the banks of
      which were so low that they could look into the depths of the thickets.
      They stopped, he made the boat fast, Henriette took hold of Henri''s arm,
      and they went beneath the trees.

“Stoop,” he said, so she stooped down, and they went into an
      inextricable thicket of creepers, leaves and reed grass, which formed an
      undiscoverable retreat, and which the young man laughingly called “his
      private room.”

Just above their heads, perched in one of the trees which hid them, the
      bird was still singing. He uttered trills and roulades, and then loud,
      vibrating notes that filled the air and seemed to lose themselves on the
      horizon, across the level country, through that burning silence which
      weighed upon the whole landscape. They did not speak for fear of
      frightening it away. They were sitting close together, and, slowly,
      Henri''s arm stole round the girl''s waist and squeezed it gently. She took
      that daring hand without any anger, and kept removing it whenever he put
      it round her; without, however, feeling at all embarrassed by this caress,
      just as if it had been something quite natural, which she was resisting
      just as naturally.

She was listening to the bird in ecstasy. She felt an infinite longing for
      happiness, for some sudden demonstration of tenderness, for the revelation
      of superhuman poetry, and she felt such a softening at her heart, and
      relaxation of her nerves, that she began to cry, without knowing why. The
      young man was now straining her close to him, yet she did not remove his
      arm; she did not think of it. Suddenly the nightingale stopped, and a
      voice called out in the distance:

But she had no idea of doing so, and they remained in the same position
      for some time. Madame Dufour had sat down somewhere or other, for from
      time to time they heard the stout lady break out into little bursts of
      laughter.

The girl was still crying; she was filled with strange sensations. Henri''s
      head was on her shoulder, and suddenly he kissed her on the lips. She was
      surprised and angry, and, to avoid him, she stood up.

They were both very pale when they left their grassy retreat. The blue sky
      appeared to them clouded and the ardent sun darkened; and they felt the
      solitude and the silence. They walked rapidly, side by side, without
      speaking or touching each other, for they seemed to have become
      irreconcilable enemies, as if disgust and hatred had arisen between them,
      and from time to time Henriette called out: “Mamma!”

By and by they heard a noise behind a bush, and the stout lady appeared,
      looking rather confused, and her companion''s face was wrinkled with smiles
      which he could not check.

Madame Dufour took his arm, and they returned to the boats, and Henri, who
      was ahead, walked in silence beside the young girl. At last they got back
      to Bezons. Monsieur Dufour, who was now sober, was waiting for them very
      impatiently, while the young man with the yellow hair was having a
      mouthful of something to eat before leaving the inn. The carriage was
      waiting in the yard, and the grandmother, who had already got in, was very
      frightened at the thought of being overtaken by night before they reached
      Paris, as the outskirts were not safe.

“Good-by, until we meet again!” the oarsmen cried, and the
      answer they got was a sigh and a tear.

Two months later, as Henri was going along the Rue des Martyrs, he saw
      Dufour, Ironmonger, over a door, and so he went in, and saw the stout lady
      sitting at the counter. They recognized each other immediately, and after
      an interchange of polite greetings, he asked after them all.

He was going out, feeling very unhappy, though scarcely knowing why, when
      madame called him back.

“Please give him our compliments, and beg him to come and call, when
      he is in the neighborhood.”

The next year, one very hot Sunday, all the details of that adventure,
      which Henri had never forgotten, suddenly came back to him so clearly that
      he returned alone to their room in the wood, and was overwhelmed with
      astonishment when he went in. She was sitting on the grass, looking very
      sad, while by her side, still in his shirt sleeves, the young man with the
      yellow hair was sleeping soundly, like some animal.

She grew so pale when she saw Henri that at first he thought she was going
      to faint; then, however, they began to talk quite naturally. But when he
      told her that he was very fond of that spot, and went there frequently on
      Sundays to indulge in memories, she looked into his eyes for a long time.

The two young women appear to be buried under a blanket of flowers. They
      are alone in the immense landau, which is filled with flowers like a giant
      basket. On the front seat are two small hampers of white satin filled with
      violets, and on the bearskin by which their knees are covered there is a
      mass of roses, mimosas, pinks, daisies, tuberoses and orange blossoms,
      interwoven with silk ribbons; the two frail bodies seem buried under this
      beautiful perfumed bed, which hides everything but the shoulders and arms
      and a little of the dainty waists.

The coachman''s whip is wound with a garland of anemones, the horses''
      traces are dotted with carnations, the spokes of the wheels are clothed in
      mignonette, and where the lanterns ought to be are two enormous round
      bouquets which look as though they were the eyes of this strange, rolling,
      flower-bedecked creature.

The landau drives rapidly along the road, through the Rue d''Antibes,
      preceded, followed, accompanied, by a crowd of other carriages covered
      with flowers, full of women almost hidden by a sea of violets. It is the
      flower carnival at Cannes.

The carriage reaches the Boulevard de la Fonciere, where the battle is
      waged. All along the immense avenue a double row of flower-bedecked
      vehicles are going and coming like an endless ribbon. Flowers are thrown
      from one to the other. They pass through the air like balls, striking
      fresh faces, bouncing and falling into the dust, where an army of
      youngsters pick them up.

A thick crowd is standing on the sidewalks looking on and held in check by
      the mounted police, who pass brutally along pushing back the curious
      pedestrians as though to prevent the common people from mingling with the
      rich.

In the carriages, people call to each other, recognize each other and
      bombard each other with roses. A chariot full of pretty women, dressed in
      red, like devils, attracts the eyes of all. A gentleman, who looks like
      the portraits of Henry IV., is throwing an immense bouquet which is held
      back by an elastic. Fearing the shock, the women hide their eyes and the
      men lower their heads, but the graceful, rapid and obedient missile
      describes a curve and returns to its master, who immediately throws it at
      some new face.

The two young women begin to throw their stock of flowers by handfuls, and
      receive a perfect hail of bouquets; then, after an hour of warfare, a
      little tired, they tell the coachman to drive along the road which follows
      the seashore.

The sun disappears behind Esterel, outlining the dark, rugged mountain
      against the sunset sky. The clear blue sea, as calm as a mill-pond,
      stretches out as far as the horizon, where it blends with the sky; and the
      fleet, anchored in the middle of the bay, looks like a herd of enormous
      beasts, motionless on the water, apocalyptic animals, armored and
      hump-backed, their frail masts looking like feathers, and with eyes which
      light up when evening approaches.

The two young women, leaning back under the heavy robes, look out lazily
      over the blue expanse of water. At last one of them says:

“Yes, you do. You are not thinking of it. No matter how contented we
      may be, physically, we always long for something more—for the heart.”

They stopped talking, their eyes fastened on the distant horizon, then the
      one called Marguerite murmured: “Life without that seems to me
      unbearable. I need to be loved, if only by a dog. But we are all alike, no
      matter what you may say, Simone.”

“Not at all, my dear. I had rather not be loved at all than to be
      loved by the first comer. Do you think, for instance, that it would be
      pleasant to be loved by—by—”

She was thinking by whom she might possibly be loved, glancing across the
      wide landscape. Her eyes, after traveling around the horizon, fell on the
      two bright buttons which were shining on the back of the coachman''s
      livery, and she continued, laughing: “by my coachman?”

“I assure you that it is very amusing to be loved by a servant. It
      has happened to me two or three times. They roll their eyes in such a
      funny manner—it''s enough to make you die laughing! Naturally, the
      more in love they are, the more severe one must be with them, and then,
      some day, for some reason, you dismiss them, because, if anyone should
      notice it, you would appear so ridiculous.”

“No, I''m afraid that my footman''s heart would not satisfy me. Tell
      me how you noticed that they loved you.”

“Moved? no, flattered—yes a little. One is always flattered to
      be loved by a man, no matter who he may be.”

“Yes, indeed, my dear! For instance, I will tell you of a peculiar
      incident which happened to me. You will see how curious and complex our
      emotions are, in such cases.

“About four years ago I happened to be without a maid. I had tried
      five or six, one right after the other, and I was about ready to give up
      in despair, when I saw an advertisement in a newspaper of a young girl
      knowing how to cook, embroider, dress hair, who was looking for a position
      and who could furnish the best of references. Besides all these
      accomplishments, she could speak English.

“I wrote to the given address, and the next day the person in
      question presented herself. She was tall, slender, pale, shy-looking. She
      had beautiful black eyes and a charming complexion; she pleased me
      immediately. I asked for her certificates; she gave me one in English, for
      she came, as she said, from Lady Rymwell''s, where she had been for ten
      years.

“The certificate showed that the young girl had left of her own free
      will, in order to return to France, and the only thing which they had had
      to find fault in her during her long period of service was a little French
      coquettishness.

“At the end of a month I would have been helpless without her. She
      was a treasure, a pearl, a phenomenon.

“She could dress my hair with infinite taste; she could trim a hat
      better than most milliners, and she could even make my dresses.

“She dressed me rapidly and with a surprisingly light touch. I never
      felt her fingers on my skin, and nothing is so disagreeable to me as
      contact with a servant''s hand. I soon became excessively lazy; it was so
      pleasant to be dressed from head to foot, and from lingerie to gloves, by
      this tall, timid girl, always blushing a little, and never saying a word.
      After my bath she would rub and massage me while I dozed a little on my
      couch; I almost considered her more of a friend than a servant.

“One morning the janitor asked, mysteriously, to speak to me. I was
      surprised, and told him to come in. He was a good, faithful man, an old
      soldier, one of my husband''s former orderlies.

“Of course the police are useful, but I hate them. I do not think
      that it is a noble profession. I answered, angered and hurt:

“This time I was frightened and I told him to bring the inspector to
      me, so that I might get some explanation. He was a man with good manners
      and decorated with the Legion of Honor. He begged my pardon for disturbing
      me, and then informed me that I had, among my domestics, a convict.

“I was shocked; and I answered that I could guarantee every servant
      in the house, and I began to enumerate them.

“As the conviction of a notable criminal is at stake, would you be
      so kind as to send for all your servants?”

“''Excuse me, monsieur, there is no one left but my maid, a young
      girl whom you could not possibly mistake for a convict.''

“I rang for Rose, who immediately appeared. She had hardly entered
      the room, when the inspector made a motion, and two men whom I had not
      seen, hidden behind the door, sprang forward, seized her and tied her
      hands behind her back.

“''This girl, madame, is a man whose name is Jean Nicolas Lecapet,
      condemned to death in 1879 for assaulting a woman and injuring her so that
      death resulted. His sentence was commuted to imprisonment for life. He
      escaped four months ago. We have been looking for him ever since.''

“Well, would you believe me, the thing that moved me most was not
      anger at having thus been played upon, deceived and made ridiculous, it
      was not the shame of having thus been dressed and undressed, handled and
      touched by this man—but a deep humiliation—a woman''s
      humiliation. Do you understand?”

“Just think—this man had been condemned for—for
      assaulting a woman. Well! I thought of the one whom he had assaulted—and—and
      I felt humiliated—There! Do you understand now?”

Madame Margot did not answer. She was looking straight ahead, her eyes
      fastened on the two shining buttons of the livery, with that sphinx-like
      smile which women sometimes have.

There was a real mystery in this affair which neither the jury, nor the
      president, nor the public prosecutor himself could understand.

The girl Prudent (Rosalie), servant at the Varambots'', of Nantes, having
      become enceinte without the knowledge of her masters, had, during the
      night, killed and buried her child in the garden.

It was the usual story of the infanticides committed by servant girls. But
      there was one inexplicable circumstance about this one. When the police
      searched the girl Prudent''s room they discovered a complete infant''s
      outfit, made by Rosalie herself, who had spent her nights for the last
      three months in cutting and sewing it. The grocer from whom she had bought
      her candles, out of her own wages, for this long piece of work had come to
      testify. It came out, moreover, that the sage-femme of the district,
      informed by Rosalie of her condition, had given her all necessary
      instructions and counsel in case the event should happen at a time when it
      might not be possible to get help. She had also procured a place at Poissy
      for the girl Prudent, who foresaw that her present employers would
      discharge her, for the Varambot couple did not trifle with morality.

There were present at the trial both the man and the woman, a middle-class
      pair from the provinces, living on their income. They were so exasperated
      against this girl, who had sullied their house, that they would have liked
      to see her guillotined on the spot without a trial. The spiteful
      depositions they made against her became accusations in their mouths.

The defendant, a large, handsome girl of Lower Normandy, well educated for
      her station in life, wept continuously and would not answer to anything.

The court and the spectators were forced to the opinion that she had
      committed this barbarous act in a moment of despair and madness, since
      there was every indication that she had expected to keep and bring up her
      child.

The president tried for the last time to make her speak, to get some
      confession, and, having urged her with much gentleness, he finally made
      her understand that all these men gathered here to pass judgment upon her
      were not anxious for her death and might even have pity on her.

The couple started in their seats and cried with one voice—“That''s
      not true! She lies! This is infamous!”

The president had them silenced and continued, “Go on, please, and
      tell us how it all happened.”

Then she suddenly began to talk freely, relieving her pent-up heart, that
      poor, solitary, crushed heart—laying bare her sorrow, her whole
      sorrow, before those severe men whom she had until now taken for enemies
      and inflexible judges.

“He is a non-commissioned officer in the artillery, monsieur. Well,
      he stayed two months at the house, two months of the summer. I thought
      nothing about it when he began to look at me, and then flatter me, and
      make love to me all day long. And I let myself be taken in, monsieur. He
      kept saying to me that I was a handsome girl, that I was good company,
      that I just suited him—and I, I liked him well enough. What could I
      do? One listens to these things when one is alone—all alone—as
      I was. I am alone in the world, monsieur. I have no one to talk to—no
      one to tell my troubles to. I have no father, no mother, no brother, no
      sister, nobody. And when he began to talk to me it was as if I had a
      brother who had come back. And then he asked me to go with him to the
      river one evening, so that we might talk without disturbing any one. I
      went—I don''t know—I don''t know how it happened. He had his arm
      around me. Really I didn''t want to—no—no—I could not—I
      felt like crying, the air was so soft —the moon was shining. No, I
      swear to you—I could not—he did what he wanted. That went on
      three weeks, as long as he stayed. I could have followed him to the ends
      of the world. He went away. I did not know that I was enceinte. I did not
      know it until the month after—”

She began to talk again: “When I realized my condition I went to see
      Madame Boudin, who is there to tell you, and I asked her how it would be,
      in case it should come if she were not there. Then I made the outfit,
      sewing night after night, every evening until one o''clock in the morning;
      and then I looked for another place, for I knew very well that I should be
      sent away, but I wanted to stay in the house until the very last, so as to
      save my pennies, for I have not got very much and I should need my money
      for the little one.”

“It happened this way. It came sooner than I expected. It came upon
      me in the kitchen, while I was doing the dishes. Monsieur and Madame
      Varambot were already asleep, so I went up, not without difficulty,
      dragging myself up by the banister, and I lay down on the bare floor. It
      lasted perhaps one hour, or two, or three; I don''t know, I had such pain;
      and then I pushed him out with all my strength. I felt that he came out
      and I picked him up.

“Ah! but I was glad, I assure you! I did all that Madame Boudin told
      me to do. And then I laid him on my bed. And then such a pain griped me
      again that I thought I should die. If you knew what it meant, you there,
      you would not do so much of this. I fell on my knees, and then toppled
      over backward on the floor; and it griped me again, perhaps one hour,
      perhaps two. I lay there all alone—and then another one comes—another
      little one—two, yes, two, like this. I took him up as I did the
      first one, and then I put him on the bed, the two side by side. Is it
      possible, tell me, two children, and I who get only twenty francs a month?
      Say, is it possible? One, yes, that can be managed by going without
      things, but not two. That turned my head. What do I know about it? Had I
      any choice, tell me?

“What could I do? I felt as if my last hour had come. I put the
      pillow over them, without knowing why. I could not keep them both; and
      then I threw myself down, and I lay there, rolling over and over and
      crying until I saw the daylight come into the window. Both of them were
      quite dead under the pillow. Then I took them under my arms and went down
      the stairs out in the vegetable garden. I took the gardener''s spade and I
      buried them under the earth, digging as deep a hole as I could, one here
      and the other one there, not together, so that they might not talk of
      their mother if these little dead bodies can talk. What do I know about
      it?

“And then, back in my bed, I felt so sick that I could not get up.
      They sent for the doctor and he understood it all. I''m telling you the
      truth, Your Honor. Do what you like with me; I''m ready.”

Half of the jury were blowing their noses violently to keep from crying.
      The women in the courtroom were sobbing.

Monsieur Saval, who was called in Mantes “Father Saval,” had
      just risen from bed. He was weeping. It was a dull autumn day; the leaves
      were falling. They fell slowly in the rain, like a heavier and slower
      rain. M. Saval was not in good spirits. He walked from the fireplace to
      the window, and from the window to the fireplace. Life has its sombre
      days. It would no longer have any but sombre days for him, for he had
      reached the age of sixty-two. He is alone, an old bachelor, with nobody
      about him. How sad it is to die alone, all alone, without any one who is
      devoted to you!

He pondered over his life, so barren, so empty. He recalled former days,
      the days of his childhood, the home, the house of his parents; his college
      days, his follies; the time he studied law in Paris, his father''s illness,
      his death. He then returned to live with his mother. They lived together
      very quietly, and desired nothing more. At last the mother died. How sad
      life is! He lived alone since then, and now, in his turn, he, too, will
      soon be dead. He will disappear, and that will be the end. There will be
      no more of Paul Saval upon the earth. What a frightful thing! Other people
      will love, will laugh. Yes, people will go on amusing themselves, and he
      will no longer exist! Is it not strange that people can laugh, amuse
      themselves, be joyful under that eternal certainty of death? If this death
      were only probable, one could then have hope; but no, it is inevitable, as
      inevitable as that night follows the day.

If, however, his life had been full! If he had done something; if he had
      had adventures, great pleasures, success, satisfaction of some kind or
      another. But no, nothing. He had done nothing, nothing but rise from bed,
      eat, at the same hours, and go to bed again. And he had gone on like that
      to the age of sixty-two years. He had not even taken unto himself a wife,
      as other men do. Why? Yes, why was it that he had not married? He might
      have done so, for he possessed considerable means. Had he lacked an
      opportunity? Perhaps! But one can create opportunities. He was
      indifferent; that was all. Indifference had been his greatest drawback,
      his defect, his vice. How many men wreck their lives through indifference!
      It is so difficult for some natures to get out of bed, to move about, to
      take long walks, to speak, to study any question.

He had not even been loved. No woman had reposed on his bosom, in a
      complete abandon of love. He knew nothing of the delicious anguish of
      expectation, the divine vibration of a hand in yours, of the ecstasy of
      triumphant passion.

What superhuman happiness must overflow your heart, when lips encounter
      lips for the first time, when the grasp of four arms makes one being of
      you, a being unutterably happy, two beings infatuated with one another.

M. Saval was sitting before the fire, his feet on the fender, in his
      dressing gown. Assuredly his life had been spoiled, completely spoiled. He
      had, however, loved. He had loved secretly, sadly, and indifferently, in a
      manner characteristic of him in everything. Yes, he had loved his old
      friend, Madame Sandres, the wife of his old companion, Sandres. Ah! if he
      had known her as a young girl! But he had met her too late; she was
      already married. Unquestionably, he would have asked her hand! How he had
      loved her, nevertheless, without respite, since the first day he set eyes
      on her!

He recalled his emotion every time he saw her, his grief on leaving her,
      the many nights that he could not sleep, because he was thinking of her.

How pretty she was formerly, so dainty, with fair curly hair, and always
      laughing. Sandres was not the man she should have chosen. She was now
      fifty-two years of age. She seemed happy. Ah! if she had only loved him in
      days gone by; yes, if she had only loved him! And why should she not have
      loved him, he, Saval, seeing that he loved her so much, yes, she, Madame
      Sandres!

If only she could have guessed. Had she not guessed anything, seen
      anything, comprehended anything? What would she have thought? If he had
      spoken, what would she have answered?

And Saval asked himself a thousand other things. He reviewed his whole
      life, seeking to recall a multitude of details.

He recalled all the long evenings spent at the house of Sandres, when the
      latter''s wife was young, and so charming.

He recalled many things that she had said to him, the intonations of her
      voice, the little significant smiles that meant so much.

He recalled their walks, the three of them together, along the banks of
      the Seine, their luncheon on the grass on Sundays, for Sandres was
      employed at the sub-prefecture. And all at once the distinct recollection
      came to him of an afternoon spent with her in a little wood on the banks
      of the river.

They had set out in the morning, carrying their provisions in baskets. It
      was a bright spring morning, one of those days which intoxicate one.
      Everything smells fresh, everything seems happy. The voices of the birds
      sound more joyous, and they fly more swiftly. They had luncheon on the
      grass, under the willow trees, quite close to the water, which glittered
      in the sun''s rays. The air was balmy, charged with the odors of fresh
      vegetation; they drank it in with delight. How pleasant everything was on
      that day!

After lunch, Sandres went to sleep on the broad of his back. “The
      best nap he had in his life,” said he, when he woke up.

She leaned tenderly on his arm. She laughed and said to him: “I am
      intoxicated, my friend, I am quite intoxicated.” He looked at her,
      his heart going pit-a-pat. He felt himself grow pale, fearful that he
      might have looked too boldly at her, and that the trembling of his hand
      had revealed his passion.

She had made a wreath of wild flowers and water-lilies, and she asked him:
      “Do I look pretty like that?”

As he did not answer—for he could find nothing to say, he would have
      liked to go down on his knees—she burst out laughing, a sort of
      annoyed, displeased laugh, as she said: “Great goose, what ails you?
      You might at least say something.”

All these things came back to him now, as vividly as on the day when they
      took place. Why had she said this to him, “Great goose, what ails
      you? You might at least say something!”

And he recalled how tenderly she had leaned on his arm. And in passing
      under a shady tree he had felt her ear brushing his cheek, and he had
      moved his head abruptly, lest she should suppose he was too familiar.

When he had said to her: “Is it not time to return?” she
      darted a singular look at him. “Certainly,” she said, “certainly,”
      regarding him at the same time in a curious manner. He had not thought of
      it at the time, but now the whole thing appeared to him quite plain.

And she had said: “If you are afraid of my husband''s being awake,
      that is another thing. Let us return.”

At that time it had never occurred to him, to ask himself “why.”
      Now he seemed to apprehend something that he had not then understood.

M. Saval felt himself blush, and he got up at a bound, as if he were
      thirty years younger and had heard Madame Sandres say, “I love you.”

Was it possible? That idea which had just entered his mind tortured him.
      Was it possible that he had not seen, had not guessed?

Oh! if that were true, if he had let this opportunity of happiness pass
      without taking advantage of it!

He said to himself: “I must know. I cannot remain in this state of
      doubt. I must know!” He thought: “I am sixty-two years of age,
      she is fifty-eight; I may ask her that now without giving offense.”

The Sandres'' house was situated on the other side of the street, almost
      directly opposite his own. He went across and knocked at the door, and a
      little servant opened it.

“No, my girl,” he replied; “but go and tell your
      mistress that I want to speak to her at once.”

“The fact is madame is preserving pears for the winter, and she is
      in the preserving room. She is not dressed, you understand.”

The little servant went away, and Saval began to walk, with long, nervous
      strides, up and down the drawing-room. He did not feel in the least
      embarrassed, however. Oh! he was merely going to ask her something, as he
      would have asked her about some cooking recipe. He was sixty-two years of
      age!

The door opened and madame appeared. She was now a large woman, fat and
      round, with full cheeks and a sonorous laugh. She walked with her arms
      away from her sides and her sleeves tucked up, her bare arms all covered
      with fruit juice. She asked anxiously:

“No, my dear friend; but I wish to ask you one thing, which to me is
      of the first importance, something which is torturing my heart, and I want
      you to promise that you will answer me frankly.”

“Well, then. I have loved you from the first day I ever saw you. Can
      you have any doubt of this?”

She broke into a peal of laughter. Some of the juice ran off the tips of
      her fingers on to the carpet.

“Tell me—tell me . . . . You remember the day when Sandres
      went to sleep on the grass after lunch . . . when we had walked together
      as far as the bend of the river, below . . .”

She began to laugh as only a happy woman can laugh, who has nothing to
      regret, and responded frankly, in a clear voice tinged with irony:

Saval rushed into the street, cast down, as though he had met with some
      disaster. He walked with giant strides through the rain, straight on,
      until he reached the river bank, without thinking where he was going. He
      then turned to the right and followed the river. He walked a long time, as
      if urged on by some instinct. His clothes were running with water, his hat
      was out of shape, as soft as a rag, and dripping like a roof. He walked
      on, straight in front of him. At last, he came to the place where they had
      lunched on that day so long ago, the recollection of which tortured his
      heart. He sat down under the leafless trees, and wept.

Marguerite de Therelles was dying. Although she was only fifty-six years
      old she looked at least seventy-five. She gasped for breath, her face
      whiter than the sheets, and had spasms of violent shivering, with her face
      convulsed and her eyes haggard as though she saw a frightful vision.

Her elder sister, Suzanne, six years older than herself, was sobbing on
      her knees beside the bed. A small table close to the dying woman''s couch
      bore, on a white cloth, two lighted candles, for the priest was expected
      at any moment to administer extreme unction and the last communion.

The apartment wore that melancholy aspect common to death chambers; a look
      of despairing farewell. Medicine bottles littered the furniture; linen lay
      in the corners into which it had been kicked or swept. The very chairs
      looked, in their disarray, as if they were terrified and had run in all
      directions. Death—terrible Death—was in the room, hidden,
      awaiting his prey.

This history of the two sisters was an affecting one. It was spoken of far
      and wide; it had drawn tears from many eyes.

Suzanne, the elder, had once been passionately loved by a young man, whose
      affection she returned. They were engaged to be married, and the wedding
      day was at hand, when Henry de Sampierre suddenly died.

The young girl''s despair was terrible, and she took an oath never to
      marry. She faithfully kept her vow and adopted widow''s weeds for the
      remainder of her life.

But one morning her sister, her little sister Marguerite, then only twelve
      years old, threw herself into Suzanne''s arms, sobbing: “Sister, I
      don''t want you to be unhappy. I don''t want you to mourn all your life.
      I''ll never leave you—never, never, never! I shall never marry,
      either. I''ll stay with you always—always!”

Suzanne kissed her, touched by the child''s devotion, though not putting
      any faith in her promise.

But the little one kept her word, and, despite her parents'' remonstrances,
      despite her elder sister''s prayers, never married. She was remarkably
      pretty and refused many offers. She never left her sister.

They spent their whole life together, without a single day''s separation.
      They went everywhere together and were inseparable. But Marguerite was
      pensive, melancholy, sadder than her sister, as if her sublime sacrifice
      had undermined her spirits. She grew older more quickly; her hair was
      white at thirty; and she was often ill, apparently stricken with some
      unknown, wasting malady.

And she had since remained lying on her back, convulsed with agony, her
      lips moving as if unable to utter the dreadful words that rose in her
      heart, her face expressive of a terror distressing to witness.

Suzanne, distracted with grief, her brow pressed against the bed, wept
      bitterly, repeating over and over again the words:

She had always called her “my little one,” while Marguerite''s
      name for the elder was invariably “sister.”

A footstep sounded on the stairs. The door opened. An acolyte appeared,
      followed by the aged priest in his surplice. As soon as she saw him the
      dying woman sat up suddenly in bed, opened her lips, stammered a few words
      and began to scratch the bed-clothes, as if she would have made hole in
      them.

Father Simon approached, took her hand, kissed her on the forehead and
      said in a gentle voice:

“May God pardon your sins, my daughter. Be of good courage. Now is
      the moment to confess them—speak!”

Then Marguerite, shuddering from head to foot, so that the very bed shook
      with her nervous movements, gasped:

The priest stooped toward the prostrate Suzanne, raised her to her feet,
      placed her in a chair, and, taking a hand of each of the sisters,
      pronounced:

And Marguerite began to speak. The words issued from her lips one by one—hoarse,
      jerky, tremulous.

“Pardon, pardon, sister! pardon me! Oh, if only you knew how I have
      dreaded this moment all my life!”

“But what have I to pardon, little one? You have given me
      everything, sacrificed all to me. You are an angel.”

“Be silent, be silent! Let me speak! Don''t stop me! It is terrible.
      Let me tell all, to the very end, without interruption. Listen. You
      remember—you remember—Henry—”

“In order to understand you must hear everything. I was twelve years
      old—only twelve—you remember, don''t you? And I was spoilt; I
      did just as I pleased. You remember how everybody spoilt me? Listen. The
      first time he came he had on his riding boots; he dismounted, saying that
      he had a message for father. You remember, don''t you? Don''t speak. Listen.
      When I saw him I was struck with admiration. I thought him so handsome,
      and I stayed in a corner of the drawing-room all the time he was talking.
      Children are strange—and terrible. Yes, indeed, I dreamt of him.

“He came again—many times. I looked at him with all my eyes,
      all my heart. I was large for my age and much more precocious than—any
      one suspected. He came often. I thought only of him. I often whispered to
      myself:

“Then I was told that he was going to marry you. That was a blow!
      Oh, sister, a terrible blow—terrible! I wept all through three
      sleepless nights.

“He came every afternoon after lunch. You remember, don''t you? Don''t
      answer. Listen. You used to make cakes that he was very fond of—with
      flour, butter and milk. Oh, I know how to make them. I could make them
      still, if necessary. He would swallow them at one mouthful and wash them
      down with a glass of wine, saying: ''Delicious!'' Do you remember the way he
      said it?

“I was jealous—jealous! Your wedding day was drawing near. It
      was only a fortnight distant. I was distracted. I said to myself: ''He
      shall not marry Suzanne—no, he shall not! He shall marry me when I
      am old enough! I shall never love any one half so much.'' But one evening,
      ten days before the wedding, you went for a stroll with him in the
      moonlight before the house—and yonder—under the pine tree, the
      big pine tree—he kissed you—kissed you—and held you in
      his arms so long—so long! You remember, don''t you? It was probably
      the first time. You were so pale when you came back to the drawing-room!

“I saw you. I was there in the shrubbery. I was mad with rage! I
      would have killed you both if I could!

“I said to myself: ''He shall never marry Suzanne—never! He
      shall marry no one! I could not bear it.'' And all at once I began to hate
      him intensely.

“Then do you know what I did? Listen. I had seen the gardener
      prepare pellets for killing stray dogs. He would crush a bottle into small
      pieces with a stone and put the ground glass into a ball of meat.

“I stole a small medicine bottle from mother''s room. I ground it
      fine with a hammer and hid the glass in my pocket. It was a glistening
      powder. The next day, when you had made your little cakes; I opened them
      with a knife and inserted the glass. He ate three. I ate one myself. I
      threw the six others into the pond. The two swans died three days later.
      You remember? Oh, don''t speak! Listen, listen. I, I alone did not die. But
      I have always been ill. Listen—he died—you know—listen—that
      was not the worst. It was afterward, later—always—the most
      terrible—listen.

“My life, all my life—such torture! I said to myself: ''I will
      never leave my sister. And on my deathbed I will tell her all.'' And now I
      have told. And I have always thought of this moment—the moment when
      all would be told. Now it has come. It is terrible—oh!—sister—

“I have always thought, morning and evening, day and night: ''I shall
      have to tell her some day!'' I waited. The horror of it! It is done. Say
      nothing. Now I am afraid—I am afraid! Oh! Supposing I should see him
      again, by and by, when I am dead! See him again! Only to think of it! I
      dare not—yet I must. I am going to die. I want you to forgive me. I
      insist on it. I cannot meet him without your forgiveness. Oh, tell her to
      forgive me, Father! Tell her. I implore you! I cannot die without it.”

She was silent and lay back, gasping for breath, still plucking at the
      sheets with her fingers.

Suzanne had hidden her face in her hands and did not move. She was
      thinking of him whom she had loved so long. What a life of happiness they
      might have had together! She saw him again in the dim and distant
      past-that past forever lost. Beloved dead! how the thought of them rends
      the heart! Oh! that kiss, his only kiss! She had retained the memory of it
      in her soul. And, after that, nothing, nothing more throughout her whole
      existence!

Then Suzanne, raising her tear-stained face, put her arms round her
      sister, and kissing her fervently, exclaimed:

Throughout the whole countryside the Lucas farn, was known as “the
      Manor.” No one knew why. The peasants doubtless attached to this
      word, “Manor,” a meaning of wealth and of splendor, for this
      farm was undoubtedly the largest, richest and the best managed in the
      whole neighborhood.

The immense court, surrounded by five rows of magnificent trees, which
      sheltered the delicate apple trees from the harsh wind of the plain,
      inclosed in its confines long brick buildings used for storing fodder and
      grain, beautiful stables built of hard stone and made to accommodate
      thirty horses, and a red brick residence which looked like a little
      chateau.

Thanks for the good care taken, the manure heaps were as little offensive
      as such things can be; the watch-dogs lived in kennels, and countless
      poultry paraded through the tall grass.

Every day, at noon, fifteen persons, masters, farmhands and the women
      folks, seated themselves around the long kitchen table where the soup was
      brought in steaming in a large, blue-flowered bowl.

The beasts-horses, cows, pigs and sheep-were fat, well fed and clean.
      Maitre Lucas, a tall man who was getting stout, would go round three times
      a day, overseeing everything and thinking of everything.

A very old white horse, which the mistress wished to keep until its
      natural death, because she had brought it up and had always used it, and
      also because it recalled many happy memories, was housed, through sheer
      kindness of heart, at the end of the stable.

A young scamp about fifteen years old, Isidore Duval by name, and called,
      for convenience, Zidore, took care of this pensioner, gave him his measure
      of oats and fodder in winter, and in summer was supposed to change his
      pasturing place four times a day, so that he might have plenty of fresh
      grass.

The animal, almost crippled, lifted with difficulty his legs, large at the
      knees and swollen above the hoofs. His coat, which was no longer curried,
      looked like white hair, and his long eyelashes gave to his eyes a sad
      expression.

When Zidore took the animal to pasture, he had to pull on the rope with
      all his might, because it walked so slowly; and the youth, bent over and
      out of breath, would swear at it, exasperated at having to care for this
      old nag.

The farmhands, noticing the young rascal''s anger against Coco, were amused
      and would continually talk of the horse to Zidore, in order to exasperate
      him. His comrades would make sport with him. In the village he was called
      Coco-Zidore.

The boy would fume, feeling an unholy desire to revenge himself on the
      horse. He was a thin, long-legged, dirty child, with thick, coarse,
      bristly red hair. He seemed only half-witted, and stuttered as though
      ideas were unable to form in his thick, brute-like mind.

For a long time he had been unable to understand why Coco should be kept,
      indignant at seeing things wasted on this useless beast. Since the horse
      could no longer work, it seemed to him unjust that he should be fed; he
      revolted at the idea of wasting oats, oats which were so expensive, on
      this paralyzed old plug. And often, in spite of the orders of Maitre
      Lucas, he would economize on the nag''s food, only giving him half measure.
      Hatred grew in his confused, childlike mind, the hatred of a stingy, mean,
      fierce, brutal and cowardly peasant.

When summer came he had to move the animal about in the pasture. It was
      some distance away. The rascal, angrier every morning, would start, with
      his dragging step, across the wheat fields. The men working in the fields
      would shout to him, jokingly:

He would not answer; but on the way he would break off a switch, and, as
      soon as he had moved the old horse, he would let it begin grazing; then,
      treacherously sneaking up behind it, he would slash its legs. The animal
      would try to escape, to kick, to get away from the blows, and run around
      in a circle about its rope, as though it had been inclosed in a circus
      ring. And the boy would slash away furiously, running along behind, his
      teeth clenched in anger.

Then he would go away slowly, without turning round, while the horse
      watched him disappear, his ribs sticking out, panting as a result of his
      unusual exertions. Not until the blue blouse of the young peasant was out
      of sight would he lower his thin white head to the grass.

As the nights were now warm, Coco was allowed to sleep out of doors, in
      the field behind the little wood. Zidore alone went to see him. The boy
      threw stones at him to amuse himself. He would sit down on an embankment
      about ten feet away and would stay there about half an hour, from time to
      time throwing a sharp stone at the old horse, which remained standing tied
      before his enemy, watching him continually and not daring to eat before he
      was gone.

This one thought persisted in the mind of the young scamp: “Why feed
      this horse, which is no longer good for anything?” It seemed to him
      that this old nag was stealing the food of the others, the goods of man
      and God, that he was even robbing him, Zidore, who was working.

Then, little by little, each day, the boy began to shorten the length of
      rope which allowed the horse to graze.

The hungry animal was growing thinner, and starving. Too feeble to break
      his bonds, he would stretch his head out toward the tall, green, tempting
      grass, so near that he could smell, and yet so far that he could not touch
      it.

But one morning Zidore had an idea: it was, not to move Coco any more. He
      was tired of walking so far for that old skeleton. He came, however, in
      order to enjoy his vengeance. The beast watched him anxiously. He did not
      beat him that day. He walked around him with his hands in his pockets. He
      even pretended to change his place, but he sank the stake in exactly the
      same hole, and went away overjoyed with his invention.

The horse, seeing him leave, neighed to call him back; but the rascal
      began to run, leaving him alone, entirely alone in his field, well tied
      down and without a blade of grass within reach.

Starving, he tried to reach the grass which he could touch with the end of
      his nose. He got on his knees, stretching out his neck and his long,
      drooling lips. All in vain. The old animal spent the whole day in useless,
      terrible efforts. The sight of all that green food, which stretched out on
      all sides of him, served to increase the gnawing pangs of hunger.

The next day he appeared upon the scene again. Coco, exhausted, had lain
      down. When he saw the boy, he got up, expecting at last to have his place
      changed.

But the little peasant did not even touch the mallet, which was lying on
      the ground. He came nearer, looked at the animal, threw at his head a
      clump of earth which flattened out against the white hair, and he started
      off again, whistling.

The horse remained standing as long as he could see him; then, knowing
      that his attempts to reach the near-by grass would be hopeless, he once
      more lay down on his side and closed his eyes.

Then he remained standing, looking at him, pleased with what he had done,
      surprised that it should already be all over. He touched him with his
      foot, lifted one of his legs and then let it drop, sat on him and remained
      there, his eyes fixed on the grass, thinking of nothing. He returned to
      the farm, but did not mention the accident, because he wished to wander
      about at the hours when he used to change the horse''s pasture. He went to
      see him the next day. At his approach some crows flew away. Countless
      flies were walking over the body and were buzzing around it. When he
      returned home, he announced the event. The animal was so old that nobody
      was surprised. The master said to two of the men:

The men buried the horse at the place where he had died of hunger. And the
      grass grew thick, green and vigorous, fed by the poor body.

The woman had died without pain, quietly, as a woman should whose life had
      been blameless. Now she was resting in her bed, lying on her back, her
      eyes closed, her features calm, her long white hair carefully arranged as
      though she had done it up ten minutes before dying. The whole pale
      countenance of the dead woman was so collected, so calm, so resigned that
      one could feel what a sweet soul had lived in that body, what a quiet
      existence this old soul had led, how easy and pure the death of this
      parent had been.

Kneeling beside the bed, her son, a magistrate with inflexible principles,
      and her daughter, Marguerite, known as Sister Eulalie, were weeping as
      though their hearts would break. She had, from childhood up, armed them
      with a strict moral code, teaching them religion, without weakness, and
      duty, without compromise. He, the man, had become a judge and handled the
      law as a weapon with which he smote the weak ones without pity. She, the
      girl, influenced by the virtue which had bathed her in this austere
      family, had become the bride of the Church through her loathing for man.

They had hardly known their father, knowing only that he had made their
      mother most unhappy, without being told any other details.

The nun was wildly-kissing the dead woman''s hand, an ivory hand as white
      as the large crucifix lying across the bed. On the other side of the long
      body the other hand seemed still to be holding the sheet in the death
      grasp; and the sheet had preserved the little creases as a memory of those
      last movements which precede eternal immobility.

A few light taps on the door caused the two sobbing heads to look up, and
      the priest, who had just come from dinner, returned. He was red and out of
      breath from his interrupted digestion, for he had made himself a strong
      mixture of coffee and brandy in order to combat the fatigue of the last
      few nights and of the wake which was beginning.

He looked sad, with that assumed sadness of the priest for whom death is a
      bread winner. He crossed himself and approaching with his professional
      gesture: “Well, my poor children! I have come to help you pass these
      last sad hours.” But Sister Eulalie suddenly arose. “Thank
      you, father, but my brother and I prefer to remain alone with her. This is
      our last chance to see her, and we wish to be together, all three of us,
      as we—we—used to be when we were small and our poor mo—mother——”

Once more serene, the priest bowed, thinking of his bed. “As you
      wish, my children.” He kneeled, crossed himself, prayed, arose and
      went out quietly, murmuring: “She was a saint!”

They remained alone, the dead woman and her children. The ticking of the
      clock, hidden in the shadow, could be heard distinctly, and through the
      open window drifted in the sweet smell of hay and of woods, together with
      the soft moonlight. No other noise could be heard over the land except the
      occasional croaking of the frog or the chirping of some belated insect. An
      infinite peace, a divine melancholy, a silent serenity surrounded this
      dead woman, seemed to be breathed out from her and to appease nature
      itself.

Then the judge, still kneeling, his head buried in the bed clothes, cried
      in a voice altered by grief and deadened by the sheets and blankets:
      “Mamma, mamma, mamma!” And his sister, frantically striking
      her forehead against the woodwork, convulsed, twitching and trembling as
      in an epileptic fit, moaned: “Jesus, Jesus, mamma, Jesus!” And
      both of them, shaken by a storm of grief, gasped and choked.

The crisis slowly calmed down and they began to weep quietly, just as on
      the sea when a calm follows a squall.

A rather long time passed and they arose and looked at their dead. And the
      memories, those distant memories, yesterday so dear, to-day so torturing,
      came to their minds with all the little forgotten details, those little
      intimate familiar details which bring back to life the one who has left.
      They recalled to each other circumstances, words, smiles, intonations of
      the mother who was no longer to speak to them. They saw her again happy
      and calm. They remembered things which she had said, and a little motion
      of the hand, like beating time, which she often used when emphasizing
      something important.

And they loved her as they never had loved her before. They measured the
      depth of their grief, and thus they discovered how lonely they would find
      themselves.

It was their prop, their guide, their whole youth, all the best part of
      their lives which was disappearing. It was their bond with life, their
      mother, their mamma, the connecting link with their forefathers which they
      would thenceforth miss. They now became solitary, lonely beings; they
      could no longer look back.

The nun said to her brother: “You remember how mamma used always to
      read her old letters; they are all there in that drawer. Let us, in turn,
      read them; let us live her whole life through tonight beside her! It would
      be like a road to the cross, like making the acquaintance of her mother,
      of our grandparents, whom we never knew, but whose letters are there and
      of whom she so often spoke, do you remember?”

Out of the drawer they took about ten little packages of yellow paper,
      tied with care and arranged one beside the other. They threw these relics
      on the bed and chose one of them on which the word “Father”
      was written. They opened and read it.

It was one of those old-fashioned letters which one finds in old family
      desk drawers, those epistles which smell of another century. The first one
      started: “My dear,” another one: “My beautiful little
      girl,” others: “My dear child,” or: “My dear
      (laughter).” And suddenly the nun began to read aloud, to read over
      to the dead woman her whole history, all her tender memories. The judge,
      resting his elbow on the bed, was listening with his eyes fastened on his
      mother. The motionless body seemed happy.

“These ought to be put in the grave with her; they ought to be used
      as a shroud and she ought to be buried in it.” She took another
      package, on which no name was written. She began to read in a firm voice:
      “My adored one, I love you wildly. Since yesterday I have been
      suffering the tortures of the damned, haunted by our memory. I feel your
      lips against mine, your eyes in mine, your breast against mine. I love
      you, I love you! You have driven me mad. My arms open, I gasp, moved by a
      wild desire to hold you again. My whole soul and body cries out for you,
      wants you. I have kept in my mouth the taste of your kisses—”

The judge had straightened himself up. The nun stopped reading. He
      snatched the letter from her and looked for the signature. There was none,
      but only under the words, “The man who adores you,” the name
      “Henry.” Their father''s name was Rene. Therefore this was not
      from him. The son then quickly rummaged through the package of letters,
      took one out and read: “I can no longer live without your caresses.”
      Standing erect, severe as when sitting on the bench, he looked unmoved at
      the dead woman. The nun, straight as a statue, tears trembling in the
      corners of her eyes, was watching her brother, waiting. Then he crossed
      the room slowly, went to the window and stood there, gazing out into the
      dark night.

When he turned around again Sister Eulalie, her eyes dry now, was still
      standing near the bed, her head bent down.

He stepped forward, quickly picked up the letters and threw them pell-mell
      back into the drawer. Then he closed the curtains of the bed.

When daylight made the candles on the table turn pale the son slowly left
      his armchair, and without looking again at the mother upon whom he had
      passed sentence, severing the tie that united her to son and daughter, he
      said slowly: “Let us now retire, sister.”

Meetings that are unexpected constitute the charm of traveling. Who has
      not experienced the joy of suddenly coming across a Parisian, a college
      friend, or a neighbor, five hundred miles from home? Who has not passed a
      night awake in one of those small, rattling country stage-coaches, in
      regions where steam is still a thing unknown, beside a strange young
      woman, of whom one has caught only a glimpse in the dim light of the
      lantern, as she entered the carriage in front of a white house in some
      small country town?

And the next morning, when one''s head and ears feel numb with the
      continuous tinkling of the bells and the loud rattling of the windows,
      what a charming sensation it is to see your pretty neighbor open her eyes,
      startled, glance around her, arrange her rebellious hair with her slender
      fingers, adjust her hat, feel with sure hand whether her corset is still
      in place, her waist straight, and her skirt not too wrinkled.

She glances at you coldly and curiously. Then she leans back and no longer
      seems interested in anything but the country.

In spite of yourself, you watch her; and in spite of yourself you keep on
      thinking of her. Who is she? Whence does she come? Where is she going? In
      spite of yourself you spin a little romance around her. She is pretty; she
      seems charming! Happy he who . . . Life might be delightful with her. Who
      knows? She is perhaps the woman of our dreams, the one suited to our
      disposition, the one for whom our heart calls.

And how delicious even the disappointment at seeing her get out at the
      gate of a country house! A man stands there, who is awaiting her, with two
      children and two maids. He takes her in his arms and kisses as he lifts
      her out. Then she stoops over the little ones, who hold up their hands to
      her; she kisses them tenderly; and then they all go away together, down a
      path, while the maids catch the packages which the driver throws down to
      them from the coach.

Adieu! It is all over. You never will see her again! Adieu to the young
      woman who has passed the night by your side. You know her no more, you
      have not spoken to her; all the same, you feel a little sad to see her go.
      Adieu!

Once I was in Auvergne, tramping through those delightful French
      mountains, that are not too high, not too steep, but friendly and
      familiar. I had climbed the Sancy, and entered a little inn, near a
      pilgrim''s chapel called Notre-Dame de Vassiviere, when I saw a queer,
      ridiculous-looking old woman breakfasting alone at the end table.

She was at least seventy years old, tall, skinny, and angular, and her
      white hair was puffed around her temples in the old-fashioned style. She
      was dressed like a traveling Englishwoman, in awkward, queer clothing,
      like a person who is indifferent to dress. She was eating an omelet and
      drinking water.

Her face was peculiar, with restless eyes and the expression of one with
      whom fate has dealt unkindly. I watched her, in spite of myself, thinking:
      “Who is she? What is the life of this woman? Why is she wandering
      alone through these mountains?”

She paid and rose to leave, drawing up over her shoulders an astonishing
      little shawl, the two ends of which hung over her arms. From a corner of
      the room she took an alpenstock, which was covered with names traced with
      a hot iron; then she went out, straight, erect, with the long steps of a
      letter-carrier who is setting out on his route.

A guide was waiting for her at the door, and both went away. I watched
      them go down the valley, along the road marked by a line of high wooden
      crosses. She was taller than her companion, and seemed to walk faster than
      he.

Two hours later I was climbing the edge of the deep funnel that incloses
      Lake Pavin in a marvelous and enormous basin of verdure, full of trees,
      bushes, rocks, and flowers. This lake is so round that it seems as if the
      outline had been drawn with a pair of compasses, so clear and blue that
      one might deem it a flood of azure come down from the sky, so charming
      that one would like to live in a hut on the wooded slope which dominates
      this crater, where the cold, still water is sleeping. The Englishwoman was
      standing there like a statue, gazing upon the transparent sheet down in
      the dead volcano. She was straining her eyes to penetrate below the
      surface down to the unknown depths, where monstrous trout which have
      devoured all the other fish are said to live. As I was passing close by
      her, it seemed to me that two big tears were brimming her eyes. But she
