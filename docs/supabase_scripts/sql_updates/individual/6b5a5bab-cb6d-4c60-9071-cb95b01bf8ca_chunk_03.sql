      dear and so distant, would little by little gain possession of their
      minds, sending them back through space, to the well-known forms and
      noises, to the familiar scenery, with the fragrance of its green fields
      and sea air. They no longer noticed the smells of the city. And in their
      dreams they saw their friends leaving, perhaps forever, for the dangerous
      fishing grounds.

They were walking slowly, Luc Le Ganidec and Jean Kerderen, contented and
      sad, haunted by a sweet sorrow, the slow and penetrating sorrow of a
      captive animal which remembers the days of its freedom.

And when Luc had finished whittling his stick, they came to a little nook,
      where every Sunday they took their meal. They found the two bricks, which
      they had hidden in a hedge, and they made a little fire of dry branches
      and roasted their sausages on the ends of their knives.

When their last crumb of bread had been eaten and the last drop of wine
      had been drunk, they stretched themselves out on the grass side by side,
      without speaking, their half-closed eyes looking away in the distance,
      their hands clasped as in prayer, their red-trousered legs mingling with
      the bright colors of the wild flowers.

Towards noon they glanced, from time to time, towards the village of
      Bezons, for the dairy maid would soon be coming. Every Sunday she would
      pass in front of them on the way to milk her cow, the only cow in the
      neighborhood which was sent out to pasture.

Soon they would see the girl, coming through the fields, and it pleased
      them to watch the sparkling sunbeams reflected from her shining pail. They
      never spoke of her. They were just glad to see her, without understanding
      why.

She was a tall, strapping girl, freckled and tanned by the open air—a
      girl typical of the Parisian suburbs.

That was all. But the following Sunday, on seeing them, she smiled with
      the kindly smile of a woman who understood their shyness, and she asked:

She went on. But when she came back with her pail full of milk, she
      stopped before them and said:

Both were moved. Then not without difficulty, she poured some milk into
      the bottle in which they had brought their wine. Luc started to drink,
      carefully watching lest he should take more than his share. Then he passed
      the bottle to Jean. She stood before them, her hands on her hips, her pail
      at her feet, enjoying the pleasure that she was giving them. Then she went
      on, saying: “Well, bye-bye until next Sunday!”

For a long time they watched her tall form as it receded in the distance,
      blending with the background, and finally disappeared.

They were sorely perplexed by the problem of choosing something to bring
      to the dairy maid. Luc was in favor of bringing her some chitterlings; but
      Jean, who had a sweet tooth, thought that candy would be the best thing.
      He won, and so they went to a grocery to buy two sous'' worth, of red and
      white candies.

Jean was the first one to notice her. “There she is,” he said;
      and Luc answered: “Yes, there she is.”

Then she started to talk of simple things which might interest them; of
      the weather, of the crops, of her masters.

They didn''t dare to offer their candies, which were slowly melting in
      Jean''s pocket. Finally Luc, growing bolder, murmured:

Then Jean, blushing to the tips of his ears, reached in his pocket, and
      drawing out the little paper bag, handed it to her.

She began to eat the little sweet dainties. The two soldiers sat in front
      of her, moved and delighted.

They thought of her all through the week and often spoke of her: The
      following Sunday she sat beside them for a longer time.

The three of them sat there, side by side, their eyes looking far away in
      the distance, their hands clasped over their knees, and they told each
      other little incidents and little details of the villages where they were
      born, while the cow, waiting to be milked, stretched her heavy head toward
      the girl and mooed.

Soon the girl consented to eat with them and to take a sip of wine. Often
      she brought them plums pocket for plums were now ripe. Her presence
      enlivened the little Breton soldiers, who chattered away like two birds.

One Tuesday something unusual happened to Luc Le Ganidec; he asked for
      leave and did not return until ten o''clock at night.

The following Friday, Luc borrowed ten sons from one of his friends, and
      once more asked and obtained leave for several hours.

When he started out with Jean on Sunday he seemed queer, disturbed,
      changed. Kerderen did not understand; he vaguely suspected something, but
      he could not guess what it might be.

Soon the girl appeared. They watched her approach as they always did. When
      she was near, Luc arose and went towards her. She placed her pail on the
      ground and kissed him. She kissed him passionately, throwing her arms
      around his neck, without paying attention to Jean, without even noticing
      that he was there.

Poor Jean was dazed, so dazed that he could not understand. His mind was
      upset and his heart broken, without his even realizing why.

Jean was not looking at them. He understood now why his friend had gone
      out twice during the week. He felt the pain and the sting which treachery
      and deceit leave in their wake.

Jean followed them with his eyes. He saw them disappear side by side, the
      red trousers of his friend making a scarlet spot against the white road.
      It was Luc who sank the stake to which the cow was tethered. The girl
      stooped down to milk the cow, while he absent-mindedly stroked the
      animal''s glossy neck. Then they left the pail in the grass and disappeared
      in the woods.

Jean could no longer see anything but the wall of leaves through which
      they had passed. He was unmanned so that he did not have strength to
      stand. He stayed there, motionless, bewildered and grieving-simple,
      passionate grief. He wanted to weep, to run away, to hide somewhere, never
      to see anyone again.

Then he saw them coming back again. They were walking slowly, hand in
      hand, as village lovers do. Luc was carrying the pail.

After kissing him again, the girl went on, nodding carelessly to Jean. She
      did not offer him any milk that day.

The two little soldiers sat side by side, motionless as always, silent and
      quiet, their calm faces in no way betraying the trouble in their hearts.
      The sun shone down on them. From time to time they could hear the
      plaintive lowing of the cow. At the usual time they arose to return.

Luc was whittling a stick. Jean carried the empty bottle. He left it at
      the wine merchant''s in Bezons. Then they stopped on the bridge, as they
      did every Sunday, and watched the water flowing by.

Jean leaned over the railing, farther and farther, as though he had seen
      something in the stream which hypnotized him. Luc said to him:

He had hardly said the last word when Jean''s head carried away the rest of
      his body, and the little blue and red soldier fell like a shot and
      disappeared in the water.

Luc, paralyzed with horror, tried vainly to shout for help. In the
      distance he saw something move; then his friend''s head bobbed up out of
      the water only to disappear again.

Farther down he again noticed a hand, just one hand, which appeared and
      again went out of sight. That was all.

Luc ran back to the barracks, crazed, and with eyes and voice full of
      tears, he related the accident: “He leaned—he—he was
      leaning —so far over—that his head carried him away—and—he—fell
      —he fell——”

For a month the hot sun has been parching the fields. Nature is expanding
      beneath its rays; the fields are green as far as the eye can see. The big
      azure dome of the sky is unclouded. The farms of Normandy, scattered over
      the plains and surrounded by a belt of tall beeches, look, from a
      distance, like little woods. On closer view, after lowering the worm-eaten
      wooden bars, you imagine yourself in an immense garden, for all the
      ancient apple-trees, as gnarled as the peasants themselves, are in bloom.
      The sweet scent of their blossoms mingles with the heavy smell of the
      earth and the penetrating odor of the stables. It is noon. The family is
      eating under the shade of a pear tree planted in front of the door;
      father, mother, the four children, and the help—two women and three
      men are all there. All are silent. The soup is eaten and then a dish of
      potatoes fried with bacon is brought on.

From time to time one of the women gets up and takes a pitcher down to the
      cellar to fetch more cider.

The man, a big fellow about forty years old, is watching a grape vine,
      still bare, which is winding and twisting like a snake along the side of
      the house.

At last he says: “Father''s vine is budding early this year. Perhaps
      we may get something from it.”

It was during the war of 1870. The Prussians were occupying the whole
      country. General Faidherbe, with the Northern Division of the army, was
      opposing them.

The Prussians had established their headquarters at this farm. The old
      farmer to whom it belonged, Father Pierre Milon, had received and
      quartered them to the best of his ability.

For a month the German vanguard had been in this village. The French
      remained motionless, ten leagues away; and yet, every night, some of the
      Uhlans disappeared.

Of all the isolated scouts, of all those who were sent to the outposts, in
      groups of not more than three, not one ever returned.

They were picked up the next morning in a field or in a ditch. Even their
      horses were found along the roads with their throats cut.

The country was terrorized. Farmers were shot on suspicion, women were
      imprisoned; children were frightened in order to try and obtain
      information. Nothing could be ascertained.

But, one morning, Father Milon was found stretched out in the barn, with a
      sword gash across his face.

Two Uhlans were found dead about a mile and a half from the farm. One of
      them was still holding his bloody sword in his hand. He had fought, tried
      to defend himself. A court-martial was immediately held in the open air,
      in front of the farm. The old man was brought before it.

He was sixty-eight years old, small, thin, bent, with two big hands
      resembling the claws of a crab. His colorless hair was sparse and thin,
      like the down of a young duck, allowing patches of his scalp to be seen.
      The brown and wrinkled skin of his neck showed big veins which disappeared
      behind his jaws and came out again at the temples. He had the reputation
      of being miserly and hard to deal with.

They stood him up between four soldiers, in front of the kitchen table,
      which had been dragged outside. Five officers and the colonel seated
      themselves opposite him.

“Father Milon, since we have been here we have only had praise for
      you. You have always been obliging and even attentive to us. But to-day a
      terrible accusation is hanging over you, and you must clear the matter up.
      How did you receive that wound on your face?”

“Your silence accuses you, Father Milon. But I want you to answer
      me! Do you understand? Do you know who killed the two Uhlans who were
      found this morning near Calvaire?”

The colonel, surprised, was silent for a minute, looking straight at the
      prisoner. Father Milon stood impassive, with the stupid look of the
      peasant, his eyes lowered as though he were talking to the priest. Just
      one thing betrayed an uneasy mind; he was continually swallowing his
      saliva, with a visible effort, as though his throat were terribly
      contracted.

The man''s family, his son Jean, his daughter-in-law and his two
      grandchildren were standing a few feet behind him, bewildered and
      affrighted.

“Do you also know who killed all the scouts who have been found
      dead, for a month, throughout the country, every morning?”

This time the man seemed moved; the necessity for talking any length of
      time annoyed him visibly. He stammered:

“I warn you that you will have to tell me everything. You might as
      well make up your mind right away. How did you begin?”

The man cast a troubled look toward his family, standing close behind him.
      He hesitated a minute longer, and then suddenly made up his mind to obey
      the order.

“I was coming home one night at about ten o''clock, the night after
      you got here. You and your soldiers had taken more than fifty ecus worth
      of forage from me, as well as a cow and two sheep. I said to myself: ''As
      much as they take from you; just so much will you make them pay back.'' And
      then I had other things on my mind which I will tell you. Just then I
      noticed one of your soldiers who was smoking his pipe by the ditch behind
      the barn. I went and got my scythe and crept up slowly behind him, so that
      he couldn''t hear me. And I cut his head off with one single blow, just as
      I would a blade of grass, before he could say ''Booh!'' If you should look
      at the bottom of the pond, you will find him tied up in a potato-sack,
      with a stone fastened to it.

“I got an idea. I took all his clothes, from his boots to his cap,
      and hid them away in the little wood behind the yard.”

The old man stopped. The officers remained speechless, looking at each
      other. The questioning began again, and this is what they learned.

Once this murder committed, the man had lived with this one thought:
      “Kill the Prussians!” He hated them with the blind, fierce
      hate of the greedy yet patriotic peasant. He had his idea, as he said. He
      waited several days.

He was allowed to go and come as he pleased, because he had shown himself
      so humble, submissive and obliging to the invaders. Each night he saw the
      outposts leave. One night he followed them, having heard the name of the
      village to which the men were going, and having learned the few words of
      German which he needed for his plan through associating with the soldiers.

He left through the back yard, slipped into the woods, found the dead
      man''s clothes and put them on. Then he began to crawl through the fields,
      following along the hedges in order to keep out of sight, listening to the
      slightest noises, as wary as a poacher.

As soon as he thought the time ripe, he approached the road and hid behind
      a bush. He waited for a while. Finally, toward midnight, he heard the
      sound of a galloping horse. The man put his ear to the ground in order to
      make sure that only one horseman was approaching, then he got ready.

An Uhlan came galloping along, carrying dispatches. As he went, he was
      all eyes and ears. When he was only a few feet away, Father Milon dragged
      himself across the road, moaning: “Hilfe! Hilfe!” ( Help!
      Help!) The horseman stopped, and recognizing a German, he thought he was
      wounded and dismounted, coming nearer without any suspicion, and just as
      he was leaning over the unknown man, he received, in the pit of his
      stomach, a heavy thrust from the long curved blade of the sabre. He
      dropped without suffering pain, quivering only in the final throes. Then
      the farmer, radiant with the silent joy of an old peasant, got up again,
      and, for his own pleasure, cut the dead man''s throat. He then dragged the
      body to the ditch and threw it in.

The horse quietly awaited its master. Father Milon mounted him and started
      galloping across the plains.

About an hour later he noticed two more Uhlans who were returning home,
      side by side. He rode straight for them, once more crying “Hilfe!
      Hilfe!”

The Prussians, recognizing the uniform, let him approach without distrust.
      The old man passed between them like a cannon-ball, felling them both, one
      with his sabre and the other with a revolver.

Then he killed the horses, German horses! After that he quickly returned
      to the woods and hid one of the horses. He left his uniform there and
      again put on his old clothes; then going back into bed, he slept until
      morning.

For four days he did not go out, waiting for the inquest to be terminated;
      but on the fifth day he went out again and killed two more soldiers by the
      same stratagem. From that time on he did not stop. Each night he wandered
      about in search of adventure, killing Prussians, sometimes here and
      sometimes there, galloping through deserted fields, in the moonlight, a
      lost Uhlan, a hunter of men. Then, his task accomplished, leaving behind
      him the bodies lying along the roads, the old farmer would return and hide
      his horse and uniform.

He went, toward noon, to carry oats and water quietly to his mount, and he
      fed it well as he required from it a great amount of work.

But one of those whom he had attacked the night before, in defending
      himself slashed the old peasant across the face with his sabre.

However, he had killed them both. He had come back and hidden the horse
      and put on his ordinary clothes again; but as he reached home he began to
      feel faint, and had dragged himself as far as the stable, being unable to
      reach the house.

When he had finished his tale, he suddenly lifted up his head and looked
      proudly at the Prussian officers.

“Yes, I served my time. And then, you had killed my father, who was
      a soldier of the first Emperor. And last month you killed my youngest son,
      Francois, near Evreux. I owed you one for that; I paid. We are quits.”

“Eight for my father, eight for the boy—we are quits. I did
      not seek any quarrel with you. I don''t know you. I don''t even know where
      you come from. And here you are, ordering me about in my home as though it
      were your own. I took my revenge upon the others. I''m not sorry.”

And, straightening up his bent back, the old man folded his arms in the
      attitude of a modest hero.

The Prussians talked in a low tone for a long time. One of them, a
      captain, who had also lost his son the previous month, was defending the
      poor wretch. Then the colonel arose and, approaching Father Milon, said in
      a low voice:

But the man was not listening, and, his eyes fixed on the hated officer,
      while the wind played with the downy hair on his head, he distorted his
      slashed face, giving it a truly terrible expression, and, swelling out his
      chest, he spat, as hard as he could, right in the Prussian''s face.

In less than a minute the old man, still impassive, was pushed up against
      the wall and shot, looking smilingly the while toward Jean, his eldest
      son, his daughter-in-law and his two grandchildren, who witnessed this
      scene in dumb terror.

Paris had just heard of the disaster at Sedan. A republic had been
      declared. All France was wavering on the brink of this madness which
      lasted until after the Commune. From one end of the country to the other
      everybody was playing soldier.

Cap-makers became colonels, fulfilling the duties of generals; revolvers
      and swords were displayed around big, peaceful stomachs wrapped in flaming
      red belts; little tradesmen became warriors commanding battalions of
      brawling volunteers, and swearing like pirates in order to give themselves
      some prestige.

The sole fact of handling firearms crazed these people, who up to that
      time had only handled scales, and made them, without any reason, dangerous
      to all. Innocent people were shot to prove that they knew how to kill; in
      forests which had never seen a Prussian, stray dogs, grazing cows and
      browsing horses were killed.

Each one thought himself called upon to play a great part in military
      affairs. The cafes of the smallest villages, full of uniformed tradesmen,
      looked like barracks or hospitals.

The town of Canneville was still in ignorance of the maddening news from
      the army and the capital; nevertheless, great excitement had prevailed for
      the last month, the opposing parties finding themselves face to face.

The mayor, Viscount de Varnetot, a thin, little old man, a conservative,
      who had recently, from ambition, gone over to the Empire, had seen a
      determined opponent arise in Dr. Massarel, a big, full-blooded man, leader
      of the Republican party of the neighborhood, a high official in the local
      masonic lodge, president of the Agricultural Society and of the firemen''s
      banquet and the organizer of the rural militia which was to save the
      country.

In two weeks, he had managed to gather together sixty-three volunteers,
      fathers of families, prudent farmers and town merchants, and every morning
      he would drill them in the square in front of the town-hall.

When, perchance, the mayor would come to the municipal building, Commander
      Massarel, girt with pistols, would pass proudly in front of his troop, his
      sword in his hand, and make all of them cry: “Long live the
      Fatherland!” And it had been noticed that this cry excited the
      little viscount, who probably saw in it a menace, a threat, as well as the
      odious memory of the great Revolution.

On the morning of the fifth of September, the doctor, in full uniform, his
      revolver on the table, was giving a consultation to an old couple, a
      farmer who had been suffering from varicose veins for the last seven years
      and had waited until his wife had them also, before he would consult the
      doctor, when the postman brought in the paper.

M. Massarel opened it, grew pale, suddenly rose, and lifting his hands to
      heaven in a gesture of exaltation, began to shout at the top of his voice
      before the two frightened country folks:

And as the peasant resumed: “It started with the ants, which began
      to run up and down my legs—-” Dr. Massarel exclaimed:

“Shut up! I haven''t got time to bother with your nonsense. The
      Republic has been proclaimed, the emperor has been taken prisoner, France
      is saved! Long live the Republic!”

The servant, affrighted, hastened in; he was trying to talk so rapidly,
      that he could only stammer:

“My boots, my sword, my cartridge-box and the Spanish dagger which
      is on my night-table! Hasten!”

As the persistent peasant, taking advantage of a moment''s silence,
      continued, “I seemed to get big lumps which hurt me when I walk,”
      the physician, exasperated, roared:

As he equipped himself from head to foot, he gave a series of important
      orders to his servant:

“Run over to Lieutenant Picart and to Second Lieutenant Pommel, and
      tell them that I am expecting them here immediately. Also send me
      Torchebeuf with his drum. Quick! quick!”

When Celeste had gone out, he sat down and thought over the situation and
      the difficulties which he would have to surmount.

The three men arrived together in their working clothes. The commandant,
      who expected to see them in uniform, felt a little shocked.

“Don''t you people know anything? The emperor has been taken
      prisoner, the Republic has been proclaimed. We must act. My position is
      delicate, I might even say dangerous.”

“We must act and not hesitate; minutes count as hours in times like
      these. All depends on the promptness of our decision. You, Picart, go to
      the cure and order him to ring the alarm-bell, in order to get together
      the people, to whom I am going to announce the news. You, Torchebeuf beat
      the tattoo throughout the whole neighborhood as far as the hamlets of
      Gerisaie and Salmare, in order to assemble the militia in the public
      square. You, Pommel, get your uniform on quickly, just the coat and cap.
      We are going to the town-hall to demand Monsieur de Varnetot to surrender
      his powers to me. Do you understand?”

“Now carry out those orders quickly. I will go over to your house
      with you, Pommel, since we shall act together.”

Five minutes later, the commandant and his subordinates, armed to the
      teeth, appeared on the square, just as the little Viscount de Varnetot,
      his legs encased in gaiters as for a hunting party, his gun on his
      shoulder, was coming down the other street at double-quick time, followed
      by his three green-coated guards, their swords at their sides and their
      guns swung over their shoulders.

While the doctor stopped, bewildered, the four men entered the town-hall
      and closed the door behind them.

“They have outstripped us,” muttered the physician, “we
      must now wait for reenforcements. There is nothing to do for the present.”

“The priest refuses to obey,” he said. “He has even
      locked himself in the church with the sexton and beadle.”

On the other side of the square, opposite the white, tightly closed
      town-hall, stood the church, silent and dark, with its massive oak door
      studded with iron.

But just as the perplexed inhabitants were sticking their heads out of the
      windows or coming out on their doorsteps, the drum suddenly began to be
      heard, and Torchebeuf appeared, furiously beating the tattoo. He crossed
      the square running, and disappeared along the road leading to the fields.

The commandant drew his sword, and advanced alone to half way between the
      two buildings behind which the enemy had intrenched itself, and, waving
      his sword over his head, he roared with all his might:

The butcher, the baker and the druggist, much disturbed, were anxiously
      pulling down their shades and closing their shops. The grocer alone kept
      open.

However, the militia were arriving by degrees, each man in a different
      uniform, but all wearing a black cap with gold braid, the cap being the
      principal part of the outfit. They were armed with old rusty guns, the old
      guns which had hung for thirty years on the kitchen wall; and they looked
      a good deal like an army of tramps.

When he had about thirty men about him, the commandant, in a few words,
      outlined the situation to them. Then, turning to his staff: “Let us
      act,” he said.

“Lieutenant Picart, you will advance under the windows of this
      town-hall and summon Monsieur de Varnetot, in the name of the Republic, to
      hand the keys over to me.”

“You''re smart, you are. I don''t care to get killed, thank you. Those
      people in there shoot straight, don''t you forget it. Do your errands
      yourself.”

And, leaving his sword and his revolver in the hands of a soldier, he
      advanced slowly, his eye fastened on the windows, expecting any minute to
      see a gun trained on him.

When he was within a few feet of the building, the doors at both ends,
      leading into the two schools, opened and a flood of children ran out, boys
      from one side, girls from the ether, and began to play around the doctor,
      in the big empty square, screeching and screaming, and making so much
      noise that he could not make himself heard.

“Monsieur, you know that great events have just taken place which
      have changed the entire aspect of the government. The one which you
      represented no longer exists. The one which I represent is taking control.
      Under these painful, but decisive circumstances, I come, in the name of
      the new Republic, to ask you to turn over to me the office which you held
      under the former government.”

“Doctor, I am the mayor of Canneville, duly appointed, and I shall
      remain mayor of Canneville until I have been dismissed by a decree from my
      superiors. As mayor, I am in my place in the townhall, and here I stay.
      Anyhow, just try to get me out.”

The commandant returned to his troop. But before giving any information,
      eyeing Lieutenant Picart from head to foot, he exclaimed:

“You''re a great one, you are! You''re a fine specimen of manhood!
      You''re a disgrace to the army! I degrade you.”

Then the doctor hesitated. What could he do? Attack? But would his men
      obey orders? And then, did he have the right to do so?

An idea struck him. He ran to the telegraph office, opposite the
      town-hall, and sent off three telegrams:

He explained the situation, pointed out the danger which the town would
      run if it should remain in the hands of the royalist mayor; offered his
      faithful services, asked for orders and signed, putting all his titles
      after his name.

Then he returned to his battalion, and, drawing ten francs from his
      pocket, he cried: “Here, my friends, go eat and drink; only leave me
      a detachment of ten men to guard against anybody''s leaving the town-hall.”

But ex-Lieutenant Picart, who had been talking with the watchmaker, heard
      him; he began to laugh, and exclaimed: “By Jove, if they come out,
      it''ll give you a chance to get in. Otherwise I can see you standing out
      there for the rest of your life!”

In the afternoon, he disposed his men about the town as though they were
      in immediate danger of an ambush.

Several times he passed in front of the town-hall and of the church
      without noticing anything suspicious; the two buildings looked as though
      empty.

Everybody was talking about the affair. If the emperor were a prisoner,
      there must have been some kind of treason. They did not know exactly which
      of the republics had returned to power.

Toward nine o''clock, the doctor, alone, noiselessly approached the
      entrance of the public building, persuaded that the enemy must have gone
      to bed; and, as he was preparing to batter down the door with a pick-axe,
      the deep voice of a sentry suddenly called:

Armed militia occupied the square. All the citizens had gathered around
      this troop awaiting developments. Even neighboring villagers had come to
      look on.

Then the doctor, seeing that his reputation was at stake, resolved to put
      an end to the matter in one way or another; and he was about to take some
      measures, undoubtedly energetic ones, when the door of the telegraph
      station opened and the little servant of the postmistress appeared,
      holding in her hands two papers.

First she went to the commandant and gave him one of the despatches; then
      she crossed the empty square, confused at seeing the eyes of everyone on
      her, and lowering her head and running along with little quick steps, she
      went and knocked softly at the door of the barricaded house, as though
      ignorant of the fact that those behind it were armed.

The door opened wide enough to let a man''s hand reach out and receive the
      message; and the young girl returned blushing, ready to cry at being thus
      stared at by the whole countryside.

He was-triumphant; his heart was throbbing with joy and his hands were
      trembling; but Picart, his former subordinate, cried to him from a
      neighboring group:

“That''s all right; but supposing the others don''t come out, what
      good is the telegram going to do you?”

M. Massarel grew pale. He had not thought of that; if the others did not
      come out, he would now have to take some decisive step. It was not only
      his right, but his duty.

The door remained closed. What could he do? The crowd was growing and
      closing around the militia. They were laughing.

One thought especially tortured the doctor. If he attacked, he would have
      to march at the head of his men; and as, with him dead, all strife would
      cease, it was at him and him only that M. de Varnetot and his three guards
      would aim. And they were good shots, very good shots, as Picart had just
      said. But an idea struck him and, turning to Pommel, he ordered:

He would make a flag of truce, a white flag, at the sight of which the
      royalist heart of the mayor would perhaps rejoice.

Pommel returned with the cloth and a broom-stick. With some twine they
      completed the flag, and M. Massarel, grasping it in both hands and holding
      it in front of him, again advanced in the direction of the town-hall. When
      he was opposite the door, he once more called: “Monsieur de
      Varnetot!” The door suddenly opened and M. de Varnetot and his three
      guards appeared on the threshold.

Instinctively the doctor stepped back; then he bowed courteously to his
      enemy, and, choking with emotion, he announced: “I have come,
      monsieur, to make you acquainted with the orders which I have received.”

The nobleman, without returning the bow, answered: “I resign,
      monsieur, but understand that it is neither through fear of, nor obedience
      to, the odious government which has usurped the power.” And,
      emphasizing every word, he declared: “I do not wish to appear, for a
      single day, to serve the Republic. That''s all.”

Massarel, stunned, answered nothing; and M. de Varnetot, walking quickly,
      disappeared around the corner of the square, still followed by his escort.

The doctor, puffed up with pride, returned to the crowd. As soon as he was
      near enough to make himself heard, he cried: “Hurrah! hurrah!
      Victory crowns the Republic everywhere.”

The motionless villagers were looking at him without any signs of triumph
      shining in their eyes.

He looked at them, indignant at their indifference, thinking of what he
      could say or do in order to make an impression to electrify this calm
      peasantry, to fulfill his mission as a leader.

He had an inspiration and, turning to Pommel, he ordered: “Lieutenant,
      go get me the bust of the ex-emperor which is in the meeting room of the
      municipal council, and bring it here with a chair.”

The man presently reappeared, carrying on his right shoulder the plaster
      Bonaparte, and holding in his left hand a cane-seated chair.

M. Massarel went towards him, took the chair, placed the white bust on it,
      then stepping back a few steps, he addressed it in a loud voice:

“Tyrant, tyrant, you have fallen down in the mud. The dying
      fatherland was in its death throes under your oppression. Vengeful Destiny
      has struck you. Defeat and shame have pursued you; you fall conquered, a
      prisoner of the Prussians; and from the ruins of your crumbling empire,
      the young and glorious Republic arises, lifting from the ground your
      broken sword——”

He waited for applause. Not a sound greeted his listening ear. The
      peasants, nonplussed, kept silent; and the white, placid, well-groomed
      statue seemed to look at M. Massarel with its plaster smile, ineffaceable
      and sarcastic.

Thus they stood, face to face, Napoleon on his chair, the physician
      standing three feet away. Anger seized the commandant. What could he do to
      move this crowd and definitely to win over public opinion?

He happened to carry his hand to his stomach, and he felt, under his red
      belt, the butt of his revolver.

Not another inspiration, not another word cane to his mind. Then, he drew
      his weapon, stepped back a few steps and shot the former monarch.

The bullet made a little black hole: like a spot, in his forehead. No
      sensation was created. M. Massarel shot a second time and made a second
      hole, then a third time, then, without stopping, he shot off the three
      remaining shots. Napoleon''s forehead was blown away in a white powder, but
      his eyes, nose and pointed mustache remained intact.

Then in exasperation, the doctor kicked the chair over, and placing one
      foot on what remained of the bust in the position of a conqueror, he
      turned to the amazed public and yelled: “Thus may all traitors die!”

As no enthusiasm was, as yet, visible, the spectators appearing to be dumb
      with astonishment, the commandant cried to the militia: “You may go
      home now.” And he himself walked rapidly, almost ran, towards his
      house.

As soon as he appeared, the servant told him that some patients had been
      waiting in his office for over three hours. He hastened in. They were the
      same two peasants as a few days before, who had returned at daybreak,
      obstinate and patient.

Since the beginning of the campaign Lieutenant Lare had taken two cannon
      from the Prussians. His general had said: “Thank you, lieutenant,”
      and had given him the cross of honor.

As he was as cautious as he was brave, wary, inventive, wily and
      resourceful, he was entrusted with a hundred soldiers and he organized a
      company of scouts who saved the army on several occasions during a
      retreat.

But the invading army entered by every frontier like a surging sea. Great
      waves of men arrived one after the other, scattering all around them a
      scum of freebooters. General Carrel''s brigade, separated from its
      division, retreated continually, fighting each day, but remaining almost
      intact, thanks to the vigilance and agility of Lieutenant Lare, who seemed
      to be everywhere at the same moment, baffling all the enemy''s cunning,
      frustrating their plans, misleading their Uhlans and killing their
      vanguards.

“Lieutenant,” said he, “here is a dispatch from General
      de Lacere, who will be destroyed if we do not go to his aid by sunrise
      to-morrow. He is at Blainville, eight leagues from here. You will start at
      nightfall with three hundred men, whom you will echelon along the road. I
      will follow you two hours later. Study the road carefully; I fear we may
      meet a division of the enemy.”

It had been freezing hard for a week. At two o''clock it began to snow, and
      by night the ground was covered and heavy white swirls concealed objects
      hard by.

Two men walked alone as scouts about three yards ahead. Then came a
      platoon of ten men commanded by the lieutenant himself. The rest followed
      them in two long columns. To the right and left of the little band, at a
      distance of about three hundred feet on either side, some soldiers marched
      in pairs.

The snow, which was still falling, covered them with a white powder in the
      darkness, and as it did not melt on their uniforms, they were hardly
      distinguishable in the night amid the dead whiteness of the landscape.

From time to time they halted. One heard nothing but that indescribable,
      nameless flutter of falling snow—a sensation rather than a sound, a
      vague, ominous murmur. A command was given in a low tone and when the
      troop resumed its march it left in its wake a sort of white phantom
      standing in the snow. It gradually grew fainter and finally disappeared.
      It was the echelons who were to lead the army.

“Turn to the right,” said the lieutenant; “it is the
      Ronfi wood; the chateau is more to the left.”

Presently the command “Halt” was passed along. The detachment
      stopped and waited for the lieutenant, who, accompanied by only ten men,
      had undertaken a reconnoitering expedition to the chateau.

They advanced, creeping under the trees. Suddenly they all remained
      motionless. Around them was a dead silence. Then, quite near them, a
      little clear, musical young voice was heard amid the stillness of the
      wood.

All at once a woman''s shrill cry was heard through the darkness. Two
      prisoners were brought back, an old man and a young girl. The lieutenant
      questioned them, still in a low tone:

“Twelve Uhlans passed by this evening. They shot three keepers and
      hanged the gardener. I was alarmed on account of the little one.”

They rejoined the column and resumed their march across country. The old
      man walked in silence beside the lieutenant, his daughter walking at his
      side. All at once she stopped.

And she sat down. She was shaking with cold and seemed about to lose
      consciousness. Her father wanted to carry her, but he was too old and too
      weak.

“Lieutenant,” said he, sobbing, “we shall only impede
      your march. France before all. Leave us here.”

The officer had given a command. Some men had started off. They came back
      with branches they had cut, and in a minute a litter was ready. The whole
      detachment had joined them by this time.

Two hundred capes were taken off. The young girl was wrapped up in these
      warm soldiers'' capes, gently laid in the litter, and then four'' hardy
      shoulders lifted her up, and like an Eastern queen borne by her slaves she
      was placed in the center of the detachment of soldiers, who resumed their
      march with more energy, more courage, more cheerfulness, animated by the
      presence of a woman, that sovereign inspiration that has stirred the old
      French blood to so many deeds of valor.

At the end of an hour they halted again and every one lay down in the
      snow. Over yonder on the level country a big, dark shadow was moving. It
      looked like some weird monster stretching itself out like a serpent, then
      suddenly coiling itself into a mass, darting forth again, then back, and
      then forward again without ceasing. Some whispered orders were passed
      around among the soldiers, and an occasional little, dry, metallic click
      was heard. The moving object suddenly came nearer, and twelve Uhlans were
      seen approaching at a gallop, one behind the other, having lost their way
      in the darkness. A brilliant flash suddenly revealed to them two hundred
      men lying on the ground before them. A rapid fire was heard, which died
      away in the snowy silence, and all the twelve fell to the ground, their
      horses with them.

They made another halt; some conferences took place. It had stopped
      snowing. A cold wind was driving the clouds, and innumerable stars were
      sparkling in the sky behind them, gradually paling in the rosy light of
      dawn.

A staff officer came forward to receive the detachment. But when he asked
      who was being carried in the litter, the form stirred; two little hands
      moved aside the big blue army capes and, rosy as the dawn, with two eyes
      that were brighter than the stars that had just faded from sight, and a
      smile as radiant as the morn, a dainty face appeared.

The soldiers, wild with delight, clapped their hands and bore the young
      girl in triumph into the midst of the camp, that was just getting to arms.
      Presently General Carrel arrived on the scene. At nine o''clock the
      Prussians made an attack. They beat a retreat at noon.

That evening, as Lieutenant Lare, overcome by fatigue, was sleeping on a
      bundle of straw, he was sent for by the general. He found the commanding
      officer in his tent, chatting with the old man whom they had come across
      during the night. As soon as he entered the tent the general took his
      hand, and addressing the stranger, said:

“My dear comte, this is the young man of whom you were telling me
      just now; he is one of my best officers.”

“My dear lieutenant, you have saved my daughter''s life. I have only
      one way of thanking you. You may come in a few months to tell me—if
      you like her.”

One year later, on the very same day, Captain Lare and Miss
      Louise-Hortense-Genevieve de Ronfi-Quedissac were married in the church of
      St. Thomas Aquinas.

She brought a dowry of six thousand francs, and was said to be the
      prettiest bride that had been seen that year.

The shadows of a balmy night were slowly falling. The women remained in
      the drawing-room of the villa. The men, seated, or astride of garden
      chairs, were smoking outside the door of the house, around a table laden
      with cups and liqueur glasses.

Their lighted cigars shone like eyes in the darkness, which was gradually
      becoming more dense. They had been talking about a frightful accident
      which had occurred the night before—two men and three women drowned
      in the river before the eyes of the guests.

“Horrible, that well-known word, means much more than terrible. A
      frightful accident like this affects, upsets, terrifies; it does not
      horrify. In order that we should experience horror, something more is
      needed than emotion, something more than the spectacle of a dreadful
      death; there must be a shuddering sense of mystery, or a sensation of
      abnormal terror, more than natural. A man who dies, even under the most
      tragic circumstances, does not excite horror; a field of battle is not
      horrible; blood is not horrible; the vilest crimes are rarely horrible.

“It was during the war of 1870. We were retreating toward
      Pont-Audemer, after having passed through Rouen. The army, consisting of
      about twenty thousand men, twenty thousand routed men, disbanded,
      demoralized, exhausted, were going to disband at Havre.

“The earth was covered with snow. The night was falling. They had
      not eaten anything since the day before. They were fleeing rapidly, the
      Prussians not being far off.

“All the Norman country, sombre, dotted with the shadows of the
      trees surrounding the farms, stretched out beneath a black, heavy,
      threatening sky.

“Nothing else could be heard in the wan twilight but the confused
      sound, undefined though rapid, of a marching throng, an endless tramping,
      mingled with the vague clink of tin bowls or swords. The men, bent,
      round-shouldered, dirty, in many cases even in rags, dragged themselves
      along, hurried through the snow, with a long, broken-backed stride.

“The skin of their hands froze to the butt ends of their muskets,
      for it was freezing hard that night. I frequently saw a little soldier
      take off his shoes in order to walk barefoot, as his shoes hurt his weary
      feet; and at every step he left a track of blood. Then, after some time,
      he would sit down in a field for a few minutes'' rest, and he never got up
      again. Every man who sat down was a dead man.

“Should we have left behind us those poor, exhausted soldiers, who
      fondly counted on being able to start afresh as soon as they had somewhat
      refreshed their stiffened legs? But scarcely had they ceased to move, and
      to make their almost frozen blood circulate in their veins, than an
      unconquerable torpor congealed them, nailed them to the ground, closed
      their eyes, and paralyzed in one second this overworked human mechanism.
      And they gradually sank down, their foreheads on their knees, without,
      however, falling over, for their loins and their limbs became as hard and
      immovable as wood, impossible to bend or to stand upright.

“And the rest of us, more robust, kept straggling on, chilled to the
      marrow, advancing by a kind of inertia through the night, through the
      snow, through that cold and deadly country, crushed by pain, by defeat, by
      despair, above all overcome by the abominable sensation of abandonment, of
      the end, of death, of nothingness.

“I saw two gendarmes holding by the arm a curious-looking little
      man, old, beardless, of truly surprising aspect.

“They were looking for an officer, believing that they had caught a
      spy. The word ''spy'' at once spread through the midst of the stragglers,
      and they gathered in a group round the prisoner. A voice exclaimed: ''He
      must be shot!'' And all these soldiers who were falling from utter
      prostration, only holding themselves on their feet by leaning on their
      guns, felt all of a sudden that thrill of furious and bestial anger which
      urges on a mob to massacre.

“I wanted to speak. I was at that time in command of a battalion;
      but they no longer recognized the authority of their commanding officers;
      they would even have shot me.

“One of the gendarmes said: ''He has been following us for the three
      last days. He has been asking information from every one about the
      artillery.''”

“He stammered out some words in some unintelligible dialect. He was,
      indeed, a strange being, with narrow shoulders, a sly look, and such an
      agitated air in my presence that I really no longer doubted that he was a
      spy. He seemed very aged and feeble. He kept looking at me from under his
      eyes with a humble, stupid, crafty air.

“I had not ceased speaking when a terrible shove threw me on my
      back, and in a second I saw the man seized by the furious soldiers, thrown
      down, struck, dragged along the side of the road, and flung against a
      tree. He fell in the snow, nearly dead already.

“And immediately they shot him. The soldiers fired at him, reloaded
      their guns, fired again with the desperate energy of brutes. They fought
      with each other to have a shot at him, filed off in front of the corpse,
      and kept on firing at him, as people at a funeral keep sprinkling holy
      water in front of a coffin.

“And all along the horizon I heard the great noise of this
      panic-stricken army in full flight.

“A panic, the result of these shots fired at this vagabond, had
      filled his very executioners with terror; and, without realizing that they
      were themselves the originators of the scare, they fled and disappeared in
      the darkness.

“I remained alone with the corpse, except for the two gendarmes
      whose duty compelled them to stay with me.

“''He must be searched,'' I said. And I handed them a box of taper
      matches which I had in my pocket. One of the soldiers had another box. I
      was standing between the two.

“The first match went out; we lighted a second. The man continued,
      as he turned out his pockets:

“''A horn-handled pocketknife, check handkerchief, a snuffbox, a bit
      of pack thread, a piece of bread.''

“The second match went out; we lighted a third. The gendarme, after
      having felt the corpse for a long time, said:

“And in order that the two soldiers might help each other in this
      task, I stood between them to hold the lighted match. By the rapid and
      speedily extinguished flame of the match, I saw them take off the garments
      one by one, and expose to view that bleeding bundle of flesh, still warm,
      though lifeless.

“I cannot describe to you the strange and poignant sensation of pain
      that moved my heart. I could not believe it, and I knelt down in the snow
      before this shapeless pulp of flesh to see for myself: it was a woman.

“The two gendarmes, speechless and stunned, waited for me to give my
      opinion on the matter. But I did not know what to think, what theory to
      adopt.

“And I, who had seen some very terrible things in my time, began to
      cry. And I felt, in the presence of this corpse, on that icy cold night,
      in the midst of that gloomy plain; at the sight of this mystery, at the
      sight of this murdered stranger, the meaning of that word ''horror.''

“I had the same sensation last year, while interrogating one of the
      survivors of the Flatters Mission, an Algerian sharpshooter.

“You know the details of that atrocious drama. It is possible,
      however, that you are unacquainted with one of them.

“The colonel travelled through the desert into the Soudan, and
      passed through the immense territory of the Touaregs, who, in that great
      ocean of sand which stretches from the Atlantic to Egypt and from the
      Soudan to Algeria, are a kind of pirates, resembling those who ravaged the
      seas in former days.

“Now, one day we encamped in the middle of the desert, and the Arabs
      declared that, as the spring was still some distance away, they would go
      with all their camels to look for water.

“One man alone warned the colonel that he had been betrayed.
      Flatters did not believe this, and accompanied the convoy with the
      engineers, the doctors, and nearly all his officers.

“The captain of the Arab Intelligence Department at Ouargla, who had
      remained in the camp, took command of the survivors, spahis and
      sharpshooters, and they began to retreat, leaving behind them the baggage
      and provisions, for want of camels to carry them.

“Then they started on their journey through this solitude without
      shade and boundless, beneath the devouring sun, which burned them from
      morning till night.

“One tribe came to tender its submission and brought dates as a
      tribute. The dates were poisoned. Nearly all the Frenchmen died, and,
      among them, the last officer.

“There now only remained a few spahis with their quartermaster,
      Pobeguin, and some native sharpshooters of the Chambaa tribe. They had
      still two camels left. They disappeared one night, along with two, Arabs.

“Then the survivors understood that they would be obliged to eat
      each other, and as soon as they discovered the flight of the two men with
      the two camels, those who remained separated, and proceeded to march, one
      by one, through the soft sand, under the glare of a scorching sun, at a
      distance of more than a gunshot from each other.

“So they went on all day, and when they reached a spring each of
      them came to drink at it in turn, as soon as each solitary marcher had
      moved forward the number of yards arranged upon. And thus they continued
      marching the whole day, raising everywhere they passed, in that level,
      burnt up expanse, those little columns of dust which, from a distance,
      indicate those who are trudging through the desert.

“But one morning one of the travellers suddenly turned round and
      approached the man behind him. And they all stopped to look.

“The man toward whom the famished soldier drew near did not flee,
      but lay flat on the ground, and took aim at the one who was coming toward
      him. When he believed he was within gunshot, he fired. The other was not
      hit, and he continued then to advance, and levelling his gun, in turn, he
      killed his comrade.

“Then from all directions the others rushed to seek their share. And
      he who had killed the fallen man, cutting the corpse into pieces,
      distributed it.

“And they once more placed themselves at fixed distances, these
      irreconcilable allies, preparing for the next murder which would bring
      them together.

“For two days they lived on this human flesh which they divided
      between them. Then, becoming famished again, he who had killed the first
      man began killing afresh. And again, like a butcher, he cut up the corpse
      and offered it to his comrades, keeping only his own portion of it.

“The last Frenchman, Pobeguin, was massacred at the side of a well,
      the very night before the supplies arrived.

I was sitting on the pier of the small port of Obernon, near the village
      of Salis, looking at Antibes, bathed in the setting sun. I had never
      before seen anything so wonderful and so beautiful.

The small town, enclosed by its massive ramparts, built by Monsieur de
      Vauban, extended into the open sea, in the middle of the immense Gulf of
      Nice. The great waves, coming in from the ocean, broke at its feet,
      surrounding it with a wreath of foam; and beyond the ramparts the houses
      climbed up the hill, one after the other, as far as the two towers, which
      rose up into the sky, like the peaks of an ancient helmet. And these two
      towers were outlined against the milky whiteness of the Alps, that
      enormous distant wall of snow which enclosed the entire horizon.

Between the white foam at the foot of the walls and the white snow on the
      sky-line the little city, dazzling against the bluish background of the
      nearest mountain ranges, presented to the rays of the setting sun a
      pyramid of red-roofed houses, whose facades were also white, but so
      different one from another that they seemed to be of all tints.

And the sky above the Alps was itself of a blue that was almost white, as
      if the snow had tinted it; some silvery clouds were floating just over the
      pale summits, and on the other side of the gulf Nice, lying close to the
      water, stretched like a white thread between the sea and the mountain. Two
      great sails, driven by a strong breeze, seemed to skim over the waves. I
      looked upon all this, astounded.

This view was one of those sweet, rare, delightful things that seem to
      permeate you and are unforgettable, like the memory of a great happiness.
      One sees, thinks, suffers, is moved and loves with the eyes. He who can
      feel with the eye experiences the same keen, exquisite and deep pleasure
      in looking at men and things as the man with the delicate and sensitive
      ear, whose soul music overwhelms.

“I have seen Mont Saint-Michel, that monstrous granite jewel, rise
      out of the sand at sunrise.

“I have seen, in the Sahara, Lake Raianechergui, fifty kilometers
      long, shining under a moon as brilliant as our sun and breathing up toward
      it a white cloud, like a mist of milk.

“I have seen, in the Lipari Islands, the weird sulphur crater of the
      Volcanello, a giant flower which smokes and burns, an enormous yellow
      flower, opening out in the midst of the sea, whose stem is a volcano.

“But I have seen nothing more wonderful than Antibes, standing
      against the Alps in the setting sun.

“And I know not how it is that memories of antiquity haunt me;
      verses of Homer come into my mind; this is a city of the ancient East, a
      city of the odyssey; this is Troy, although Troy was very far from the
      sea.”

M. Martini drew the Sarty guide-book out of his pocket and read: “This
      city was originally a colony founded by the Phocians of Marseilles, about
      340 B.C. They gave it the Greek name of Antipolis, meaning counter-city,
      city opposite another, because it is in fact opposite to Nice, another
      colony from Marseilles.

“After the Gauls were conquered, the Romans turned Antibes into a
      municipal city, its inhabitants receiving the rights of Roman citizenship.

“I don''t care what she was. I tell you that I see down there a city
      of the Odyssey. The coast of Asia and the coast of Europe resemble each
      other in their shores, and there is no city on the other coast of the
      Mediterranean which awakens in me the memories of the heroic age as this
      one does.”

A footstep caused me to turn my head; a woman, a large, dark woman, was
      walking along the road which skirts the sea in going to the cape.

“That is Madame Parisse, you know,” muttered Monsieur Martini,
      dwelling on the final syllable.

No, I did not know, but that name, mentioned carelessly, that name of the
      Trojan shepherd, confirmed me in my dream.

I assured him that I did not know it, and I looked after the woman, who
      passed by without seeing us, dreaming, walking with steady and slow step,
      as doubtless the ladies of old walked.

Mademoiselle Combelombe was married, one year before the war of 1870, to
      Monsieur Parisse, a government official. She was then a handsome young
      girl, as slender and lively as she has now become stout and sad.

Unwillingly she had accepted Monsieur Parisse, one of those little fat men
      with short legs, who trip along, with trousers that are always too large.

After the war Antibes was garrisoned by a single battalion commanded by
      Monsieur Jean de Carmelin, a young officer decorated during the war, and
      who had just received his four stripes.

As he found life exceedingly tedious in this fortress this stuffy
      mole-hole enclosed by its enormous double walls, he often strolled out to
      the cape, a kind of park or pine wood shaken by all the winds from the
      sea.

There he met Madame Parisse, who also came out in the summer evenings to
      get the fresh air under the trees. How did they come to love each other?
      Who knows? They met, they looked at each other, and when out of sight they
      doubtless thought of each other. The image of the young woman with the
      brown eyes, the black hair, the pale skin, this fresh, handsome
      Southerner, who displayed her teeth in smiling, floated before the eyes of
      the officer as he continued his promenade, chewing his cigar instead of
      smoking it; and the image of the commanding officer, in his close-fitting
      coat, covered with gold lace, and his red trousers, and a little blond
      mustache, would pass before the eyes of Madame Parisse, when her husband,
      half shaven and ill-clad, short-legged and big-bellied, came home to
      supper in the evening.

As they met so often, they perhaps smiled at the next meeting; then,
      seeing each other again and again, they felt as if they knew each other.
      He certainly bowed to her. And she, surprised, bowed in return, but very,
      very slightly, just enough not to appear impolite. But after two weeks she
      returned his salutation from a distance, even before they were side by
      side.

He spoke to her. Of what? Doubtless of the setting sun. They admired it
      together, looking for it in each other''s eyes more often than on the
      horizon. And every evening for two weeks this was the commonplace and
      persistent pretext for a few minutes'' chat.

Then they ventured to take a few steps together, talking of anything that
      came into their minds, but their eyes were already saying to each other a
      thousand more intimate things, those secret, charming things that are
      reflected in the gentle emotion of the glance, and that cause the heart to
      beat, for they are a better revelation of the soul than the spoken ward.

And then he would take her hand, murmuring those words which the woman
      divines, without seeming to hear them.

And it was agreed between them that they would love each other without
      evidencing it by anything sensual or brutal.

She would have remained indefinitely at this stage of intimacy, but he
      wanted more. And every day he urged her more hotly to give in to his
      ardent desire.

But one evening she said to him casually: “My husband has just gone
      to Marseilles. He will be away four days.”

Jean de Carmelin threw himself at her feet, imploring her to open her door
      to him that very night at eleven o''clock. But she would not listen to him,
      and went home, appearing to be annoyed.

The commandant was in a bad humor all the evening, and the next morning at
      dawn he went out on the ramparts in a rage, going from one exercise field
      to the other, dealing out punishment to the officers and men as one might
      fling stones into a crowd,

On going in to breakfast he found an envelope under his napkin with these
      four words: “To-night at ten.” And he gave one hundred sous
      without any reason to the waiter.

The day seemed endless to him. He passed part of it in curling his hair
      and perfuming himself.

As he was sitting down to the dinner-table another envelope was handed to
      him, and in it he found the following telegram:

The commandant let loose such a vehement oath that the waiter dropped the
      soup-tureen on the floor.

What should he do? He certainly wanted her, that very, evening at whatever
      cost; and he would have her. He would resort to any means, even to
      arresting and imprisoning the husband. Then a mad thought struck him.
      Calling for paper, he wrote the following note:

Toward eight o''clock he sent for Captain Gribois, the second in command,
      and said, rolling between his fingers the crumpled telegram of Monsieur
      Parisse:

“Captain, I have just received a telegram of a very singular nature,
      which it is impossible for me to communicate to you. You will immediately
      have all the gates of the city closed and guarded, so that no one, mind
      me, no one, will either enter or leave before six in the morning. You will
      also have men patrol the streets, who will compel the inhabitants to
      retire to their houses at nine o''clock. Any one found outside beyond that
      time will be conducted to his home ''manu militari''. If your men meet me
      this night they will at once go out of my way, appearing not to know me.
      You understand me?”

The train from Marseilles arrived at the station at nine o''clock sharp,
      left two passengers on the platform and went on toward Nice.

One of them, tall and thin, was Monsieur Saribe, the oil merchant, and the
      other, short and fat, was Monsieur Parisse.

But on arriving at the gate of the port the guards crossed their bayonets,
      commanding them to retire.

Frightened, surprised, cowed with astonishment, they retired to
      deliberate; then, after having taken counsel one with the other, they came
      back cautiously to parley, giving their names.

But the soldiers evidently had strict orders, for they threatened to
      shoot; and the two scared travellers ran off, throwing away their valises,
      which impeded their flight.

Making the tour of the ramparts, they presented themselves at the gate on
      the route to Cannes. This likewise was closed and guarded by a menacing
      sentinel. Messrs. Saribe and Parisse, like the prudent men they were,
      desisted from their efforts and went back to the station for shelter,
      since it was not safe to be near the fortifications after sundown.

The station agent, surprised and sleepy, permitted them to stay till
      morning in the waiting-room.

And they sat there side by side, in the dark, on the green velvet sofa,
      too scared to think of sleeping.

At half-past six in the morning they were informed that the gates were
      open and that people could now enter Antibes.

When they passed through the gates of the city, still somewhat anxious,
      the Commandant de Carmelin, with sly glance and mustache curled up, came
      himself to look at them and question them.

Then he bowed to them politely, excusing himself for having caused them a
      bad night. But he had to carry out orders.

The people of Antibes were scared to death. Some spoke of a surprise
      planned by the Italians, others of the landing of the prince imperial and
      others again believed that there was an Orleanist conspiracy. The truth
      was suspected only later, when it became known that the battalion of the
      commandant had been sent away, to a distance and that Monsieur de Carmelin
      had been severely punished.

Monsieur Martini had finished his story. Madame Parisse returned, her
      promenade being ended. She passed gravely near me, with her eyes fixed on
      the Alps, whose summits now gleamed rosy in the last rays of the setting
      sun.

I longed to speak to her, this poor, sad woman, who would ever be thinking
      of that night of love, now long past, and of the bold man who for the sake
      of a kiss from her had dared to put a city into a state of siege and to
      compromise his whole future.

And to-day he had probably forgotten her, if he did not relate this
      audacious, comical and tender farce to his comrades over their cups.

Had she seen him again? Did she still love him? And I thought: Here is an
      instance of modern love, grotesque and yet heroic. The Homer who should
      sing of this new Helen and the adventure of her Menelaus must be gifted
      with the soul of a Paul de Kock. And yet the hero of this deserted woman
      was brave, daring, handsome, strong as Achilles and more cunning than
      Ulysses.

Major Graf Von Farlsberg, the Prussian commandant, was reading his
      newspaper as he lay back in a great easy-chair, with his booted feet on
      the beautiful marble mantelpiece where his spurs had made two holes, which
      had grown deeper every day during the three months that he had been in the
      chateau of Uville.

A cup of coffee was smoking on a small inlaid table, which was stained
      with liqueur, burned by cigars, notched by the penknife of the victorious
      officer, who occasionally would stop while sharpening a pencil, to jot
      down figures, or to make a drawing on it, just as it took his fancy.

When he had read his letters and the German newspapers, which his orderly
      had brought him, he got up, and after throwing three or four enormous
      pieces of green wood on the fire, for these gentlemen were gradually
      cutting down the park in order to keep themselves warm, he went to the
      window. The rain was descending in torrents, a regular Normandy rain,
      which looked as if it were being poured out by some furious person, a
      slanting rain, opaque as a curtain, which formed a kind of wall with
      diagonal stripes, and which deluged everything, a rain such as one
      frequently experiences in the neighborhood of Rouen, which is the
      watering-pot of France.

For a long time the officer looked at the sodden turf and at the swollen
      Andelle beyond it, which was overflowing its banks; he was drumming a
      waltz with his fingers on the window-panes, when a noise made him turn
      round. It was his second in command, Captain Baron van Kelweinstein.

The major was a giant, with broad shoulders and a long, fan-like beard,
      which hung down like a curtain to his chest. His whole solemn person
      suggested the idea of a military peacock, a peacock who was carrying his
      tail spread out on his breast. He had cold, gentle blue eyes, and a scar
      from a swordcut, which he had received in the war with Austria; he was
      said to be an honorable man, as well as a brave officer.

The captain, a short, red-faced man, was tightly belted in at the waist,
      his red hair was cropped quite close to his head, and in certain lights he
      almost looked as if he had been rubbed over with phosphorus. He had lost
      two front teeth one night, though he could not quite remember how, and
      this sometimes made him speak unintelligibly, and he had a bald patch on
      top of his head surrounded by a fringe of curly, bright golden hair, which
      made him look like a monk.

The commandant shook hands with him and drank his cup of coffee (the sixth
      that morning), while he listened to his subordinate''s report of what had
      occurred; and then they both went to the window and declared that it was a
      very unpleasant outlook. The major, who was a quiet man, with a wife at
      home, could accommodate himself to everything; but the captain, who led a
      fast life, who was in the habit of frequenting low resorts, and enjoying
      women''s society, was angry at having to be shut up for three months in
      that wretched hole.

There was a knock at the door, and when the commandant said, “Come
      in,” one of the orderlies appeared, and by his mere presence
      announced that breakfast was ready. In the dining-room they met three
      other officers of lower rank—a lieutenant, Otto von Grossling, and
      two sub-lieutenants, Fritz Scheuneberg and Baron von Eyrick, a very short,
      fair-haired man, who was proud and brutal toward men, harsh toward
      prisoners and as explosive as gunpowder.

Since he had been in France his comrades had called him nothing but
      Mademoiselle Fifi. They had given him that nickname on account of his
      dandified style and small waist, which looked as if he wore corsets; of
      his pale face, on which his budding mustache scarcely showed, and on
      account of the habit he had acquired of employing the French expression,
      ''Fi, fi donc'', which he pronounced with a slight whistle when he wished to
      express his sovereign contempt for persons or things.

The dining-room of the chateau was a magnificent long room, whose fine old
      mirrors, that were cracked by pistol bullets, and whose Flemish tapestry,
      which was cut to ribbons, and hanging in rags in places from sword-cuts,
      told too well what Mademoiselle Fifi''s occupation was during his spare
      time.

There were three family portraits on the walls a steel-clad knight, a
      cardinal and a judge, who were all smoking long porcelain pipes, which had
      been inserted into holes in the canvas, while a lady in a long, pointed
      waist proudly exhibited a pair of enormous mustaches, drawn with charcoal.
      The officers ate their breakfast almost in silence in that mutilated room,
      which looked dull in the rain and melancholy in its dilapidated condition,
      although its old oak floor had become as solid as the stone floor of an
      inn.

When they had finished eating and were smoking and drinking, they began,
      as usual, to berate the dull life they were leading. The bottles of brandy
      and of liqueur passed from hand to hand, and all sat back in their chairs
      and took repeated sips from their glasses, scarcely removing from their
      mouths the long, curved stems, which terminated in china bowls, painted in
      a manner to delight a Hottentot.

As soon as their glasses were empty they filled them again, with a gesture
      of resigned weariness, but Mademoiselle Fifi emptied his every minute, and
      a soldier immediately gave him another. They were enveloped in a cloud of
      strong tobacco smoke, and seemed to be sunk in a state of drowsy, stupid
      intoxication, that condition of stupid intoxication of men who have
      nothing to do, when suddenly the baron sat up and said: “Heavens!
      This cannot go on; we must think of something to do.” And on hearing
      this, Lieutenant Otto and Sub-lieutenant Fritz, who preeminently possessed
      the serious, heavy German countenance, said: “What, captain?”

He thought for a few moments and then replied: “What? Why, we must
      get up some entertainment, if the commandant will allow us.” “What
      sort of an entertainment, captain?” the major asked, taking his pipe
      out of his mouth. “I will arrange all that, commandant,” the
      baron said. “I will send Le Devoir to Rouen, and he will bring back
      some ladies. I know where they can be found, We will have supper here, as
      all the materials are at hand and; at least, we shall have a jolly
      evening.”

But all the other officers had risen and surrounded their chief, saying:
      “Let the captain have his way, commandant; it is terribly dull here.”
      And the major ended by yielding. “Very well,” he replied, and
      the baron immediately sent for Le Devoir. He was an old non-commissioned
      officer, who had never been seen to smile, but who carried out all the
      orders of his superiors to the letter, no matter what they might be. He
      stood there, with an impassive face, while he received the baron''s
      instructions, and then went out, and five minutes later a large military
      wagon, covered with tarpaulin, galloped off as fast as four horses could
      draw it in the pouring rain. The officers all seemed to awaken from their
      lethargy, their looks brightened, and they began to talk.

Although it was raining as hard as ever, the major declared that it was
      not so dark, and Lieutenant von Grossling said with conviction that the
      sky was clearing up, while Mademoiselle Fifi did not seem to be able to
      keep still. He got up and sat down again, and his bright eyes seemed to be
      looking for something to destroy. Suddenly, looking at the lady with the
      mustaches, the young fellow pulled out his revolver and said: “You
      shall not see it.” And without leaving his seat he aimed, and with
      two successive bullets cut out both the eyes of the portrait.

“Let us make a mine!” he then exclaimed, and the conversation
      was suddenly interrupted, as if they had found some fresh and powerful
      subject of interest. The mine was his invention, his method of
      destruction, and his favorite amusement.

When he left the chateau, the lawful owner, Comte Fernand d''Amoys
      d''Uville, had not had time to carry away or to hide anything except the
      plate, which had been stowed away in a hole made in one of the walls. As
      he was very rich and had good taste, the large drawing-room, which opened
      into the dining-room, looked like a gallery in a museum, before his
      precipitate flight.

Expensive oil paintings, water colors and drawings hung against the walls,
      while on the tables, on the hanging shelves and in elegant glass cupboards
      there were a thousand ornaments: small vases, statuettes, groups of
      Dresden china and grotesque Chinese figures, old ivory and Venetian glass,
      which filled the large room with their costly and fantastic array.

Scarcely anything was left now; not that the things had been stolen, for
      the major would not have allowed that, but Mademoiselle Fifi would every
      now and then have a mine, and on those occasions all the officers
      thoroughly enjoyed themselves for five minutes. The little marquis went
      into the drawing-room to get what he wanted, and he brought back a small,
      delicate china teapot, which he filled with gunpowder, and carefully
      introduced a piece of punk through the spout. This he lighted and took his
      infernal machine into the next room, but he came back immediately and shut
      the door. The Germans all stood expectant, their faces full of childish,
      smiling curiosity, and as soon as the explosion had shaken the chateau,
      they all rushed in at once.

Mademoiselle Fifi, who got in first, clapped his hands in delight at the
      sight of a terra-cotta Venus, whose head had been blown off, and each
      picked up pieces of porcelain and wondered at the strange shape of the
      fragments, while the major was looking with a paternal eye at the large
      drawing-room, which had been wrecked after the fashion of a Nero, and was
      strewn with the fragments of works of art. He went out first and said with
      a smile: “That was a great success this time.”

But there was such a cloud of smoke in the dining-room, mingled with the
      tobacco smoke, that they could not breathe, so the commandant opened the
      window, and all the officers, who had returned for a last glass of cognac,
      went up to it.

The moist air blew into the room, bringing with it a sort of powdery
      spray, which sprinkled their beards. They looked at the tall trees which
      were dripping with rain, at the broad valley which was covered with mist,
      and at the church spire in the distance, which rose up like a gray point
      in the beating rain.

The bells had not rung since their arrival. That was the only resistance
      which the invaders had met with in the neighborhood. The parish priest had
      not refused to take in and to feed the Prussian soldiers; he had several
      times even drunk a bottle of beer or claret with the hostile commandant,
      who often employed him as a benevolent intermediary; but it was no use to
      ask him for a single stroke of the bells; he would sooner have allowed
      himself to be s' WHERE id = '6b5a5bab-cb6d-4c60-9071-cb95b01bf8ca';
