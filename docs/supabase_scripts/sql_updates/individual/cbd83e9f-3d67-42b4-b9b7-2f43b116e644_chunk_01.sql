UPDATE stories SET original_text = 'IT was said that a new person had appeared on the sea-front: a lady with
a little dog. Dmitri Dmitritch Gurov, who had by then been a fortnight
at Yalta, and so was fairly at home there, had begun to take an interest
in new arrivals. Sitting in Verney''s pavilion, he saw, walking on the
sea-front, a fair-haired young lady of medium height, wearing a bÃ©ret;
a white Pomeranian dog was running behind her.

And afterwards he met her in the public gardens and in the square
several times a day. She was walking alone, always wearing the same
bÃ©ret, and always with the same white dog; no one knew who she was,
and every one called her simply "the lady with the dog."

"If she is here alone without a husband or friends, it wouldn''t be amiss
to make her acquaintance," Gurov reflected.

He was under forty, but he had a daughter already twelve years old, and
two sons at school. He had been married young, when he was a student in
his second year, and by now his wife seemed half as old again as he. She
was a tall, erect woman with dark eyebrows, staid and dignified, and, as
she said of herself, intellectual. She read a great deal, used phonetic
spelling, called her husband, not Dmitri, but Dimitri, and he secretly
considered her unintelligent, narrow, inelegant, was afraid of her, and
did not like to be at home. He had begun being unfaithful to her long
ago—had been unfaithful to her often, and, probably on that account,
almost always spoke ill of women, and when they were talked about in his
presence, used to call them "the lower race."

It seemed to him that he had been so schooled by bitter experience that
he might call them what he liked, and yet he could not get on for two
days together without "the lower race." In the society of men he was
bored and not himself, with them he was cold and uncommunicative; but
when he was in the company of women he felt free, and knew what to say
to them and how to behave; and he was at ease with them even when he was
silent. In his appearance, in his character, in his whole nature, there
was something attractive and elusive which allured women and disposed
them in his favour; he knew that, and some force seemed to draw him,
too, to them.

Experience often repeated, truly bitter experience, had taught him long
ago that with decent people, especially Moscow people—always slow to
move and irresolute—every intimacy, which at first so agreeably
diversifies life and appears a light and charming adventure, inevitably
grows into a regular problem of extreme intricacy, and in the long run
the situation becomes unbearable. But at every fresh meeting with an
interesting woman this experience seemed to slip out of his memory, and
he was eager for life, and everything seemed simple and amusing.

One evening he was dining in the gardens, and the lady in the bÃ©ret
came up slowly to take the next table. Her expression, her gait, her
dress, and the way she did her hair told him that she was a lady, that
she was married, that she was in Yalta for the first time and alone, and
that she was dull there.... The stories told of the immorality in such
places as Yalta are to a great extent untrue; he despised them, and knew
that such stories were for the most part made up by persons who would
themselves have been glad to sin if they had been able; but when the
lady sat down at the next table three paces from him, he remembered
these tales of easy conquests, of trips to the mountains, and the
tempting thought of a swift, fleeting love affair, a romance with an
unknown woman, whose name he did not know, suddenly took possession of
him.

He beckoned coaxingly to the Pomeranian, and when the dog came up to him
he shook his finger at it. The Pomeranian growled: Gurov shook his
finger at it again.

"May I give him a bone?" he asked; and when she nodded he asked
courteously, "Have you been long in Yalta?"

"That''s only the fashion to say it is dull here. A provincial will live
in Belyov or Zhidra and not be dull, and when he comes here it''s ''Oh,
the dulness! Oh, the dust!'' One would think he came from Grenada."

She laughed. Then both continued eating in silence, like strangers, but
after dinner they walked side by side; and there sprang up between them
the light jesting conversation of people who are free and satisfied, to
whom it does not matter where they go or what they talk about. They
walked and talked of the strange light on the sea: the water was of a
soft warm lilac hue, and there was a golden streak from the moon upon
it. They talked of how sultry it was after a hot day. Gurov told her
that he came from Moscow, that he had taken his degree in Arts, but had
a post in a bank; that he had trained as an opera-singer, but had given
it up, that he owned two houses in Moscow.... And from her he learnt
that she had grown up in Petersburg, but had lived in S—— since her
marriage two years before, that she was staying another month in Yalta,
and that her husband, who needed a holiday too, might perhaps come and
fetch her. She was not sure whether her husband had a post in a Crown
Department or under the Provincial Council—and was amused by her own
ignorance. And Gurov learnt, too, that she was called Anna Sergeyevna.

Afterwards he thought about her in his room at the hotel—thought she
would certainly meet him next day; it would be sure to happen. As he got
into bed he thought how lately she had been a girl at school, doing
lessons like his own daughter; he recalled the diffidence, the
angularity, that was still manifest in her laugh and her manner of
talking with a stranger. This must have been the first time in her life
she had been alone in surroundings in which she was followed, looked at,
and spoken to merely from a secret motive which she could hardly fail to
guess. He recalled her slender, delicate neck, her lovely grey eyes.

A week had passed since they had made acquaintance. It was a holiday. It
was sultry indoors, while in the street the wind whirled the dust round
and round, and blew people''s hats off. It was a thirsty day, and Gurov
often went into the pavilion, and pressed Anna Sergeyevna to have syrup
and water or an ice. One did not know what to do with oneself.

In the evening when the wind had dropped a little, they went out on the
groyne to see the steamer come in. There were a great many people
walking about the harbour; they had gathered to welcome some one,
bringing bouquets. And two peculiarities of a well-dressed Yalta crowd
were very conspicuous: the elderly ladies were dressed like young ones,
and there were great numbers of generals.

Owing to the roughness of the sea, the steamer arrived late, after the
sun had set, and it was a long time turning about before it reached the
groyne. Anna Sergeyevna looked through her lorgnette at the steamer and
the passengers as though looking for acquaintances, and when she turned
to Gurov her eyes were shining. She talked a great deal and asked
disconnected questions, forgetting next moment what she had asked; then
she dropped her lorgnette in the crush.

The festive crowd began to disperse; it was too dark to see people''s
faces. The wind had completely dropped, but Gurov and Anna Sergeyevna
still stood as though waiting to see some one else come from the
steamer. Anna Sergeyevna was silent now, and sniffed the flowers without
looking at Gurov.

Then he looked at her intently, and all at once put his arm round her
and kissed her on the lips, and breathed in the moisture and the
fragrance of the flowers; and he immediately looked round him, anxiously
wondering whether any one had seen them.

The room was close and smelt of the scent she had bought at the Japanese
shop. Gurov looked at her and thought: "What different people one meets
in the world!" From the past he preserved memories of careless,
good-natured women, who loved cheerfully and were grateful to him for
the happiness he gave them, however brief it might be; and of women like
his wife who loved without any genuine feeling, with superfluous
phrases, affectedly, hysterically, with an expression that suggested
that it was not love nor passion, but something more significant; and of
two or three others, very beautiful, cold women, on whose faces he had
caught a glimpse of a rapacious expression—an obstinate desire to
snatch from life more than it could give, and these were capricious,
unreflecting, domineering, unintelligent women not in their first youth,
and when Gurov grew cold to them their beauty excited his hatred, and
the lace on their linen seemed to him like scales.

But in this case there was still the diffidence, the angularity of
inexperienced youth, an awkward feeling; and there was a sense of
consternation as though some one had suddenly knocked at the door. The
attitude of Anna Sergeyevna—"the lady with the dog"—to what had
happened was somehow peculiar, very grave, as though it were her
fall—so it seemed, and it was strange and inappropriate. Her face
dropped and faded, and on both sides of it her long hair hung down
mournfully; she mused in a dejected attitude like "the woman who was a
sinner" in an old-fashioned picture.

There was a water-melon on the table. Gurov cut himself a slice and
began eating it without haste. There followed at least half an hour of
silence.

Anna Sergeyevna was touching; there was about her the purity of a good,
simple woman who had seen little of life. The solitary candle burning on
the table threw a faint light on her face, yet it was clear that she was
very unhappy.

"Forgiven? No. I am a bad, low woman; I despise myself and don''t attempt
to justify myself. It''s not my husband but myself I have deceived. And
not only just now; I have been deceiving myself for a long time. My
husband may be a good, honest man, but he is a flunkey! I don''t know
what he does there, what his work is, but I know he is a flunkey! I was
twenty when I was married to him. I have been tormented by curiosity; I
wanted something better. ''There must be a different sort of life,'' I
said to myself. I wanted to live! To live, to live!... I was fired by
curiosity ... you don''t understand it, but, I swear to God, I could not
control myself; something happened to me: I could not be restrained. I
told my husband I was ill, and came here.... And here I have been
walking about as though I were dazed, like a mad creature; ... and now I
have become a vulgar, contemptible woman whom any one may despise."

Gurov felt bored already, listening to her. He was irritated by the
naÃ¯ve tone, by this remorse, so unexpected and inopportune; but for the
tears in her eyes, he might have thought she was jesting or playing a
part.

"Believe me, believe me, I beseech you ..." she said. "I love a pure,
honest life, and sin is loathsome to me. I don''t know what I am doing.
Simple people say: ''The Evil One has beguiled me.'' And I may say of
myself now that the Evil One has beguiled me."

He looked at her fixed, scared eyes, kissed her, talked softly and
affectionately, and by degrees she was comforted, and her gaiety
returned; they both began laughing.

Afterwards when they went out there was not a soul on the sea-front. The
town with its cypresses had quite a deathlike air, but the sea still
broke noisily on the shore; a single barge was rocking on the waves, and
a lantern was blinking sleepily on it.

"I found out your surname in the hall just now: it was written on the
board—Von Diderits," said Gurov. "Is your husband a German?"

At Oreanda they sat on a seat not far from the church, looked down at
the sea, and were silent. Yalta was hardly visible through the morning
mist; white clouds stood motionless on the mountain-tops. The leaves did
not stir on the trees, grasshoppers chirruped, and the monotonous hollow
sound of the sea rising up from below, spoke of the peace, of the
eternal sleep awaiting us. So it must have sounded when there was no
Yalta, no Oreanda here; so it sounds now, and it will sound as
indifferently and monotonously when we are all no more. And in this
constancy, in this complete indifference to the life and death of each
of us, there lies hid, perhaps, a pledge of our eternal salvation, of
the unceasing movement of life upon earth, of unceasing progress towards
perfection. Sitting beside a young woman who in the dawn seemed so
lovely, soothed and spellbound in these magical surroundings—the sea,
mountains, clouds, the open sky—Gurov thought how in reality everything
is beautiful in this world when one reflects: everything except what we
think or do ourselves when we forget our human dignity and the higher
aims of our existence.

A man walked up to them—probably a keeper—looked at them and walked
away. And this detail seemed mysterious and beautiful, too. They saw a
steamer come from Theodosia, with its lights out in the glow of dawn.

Then they met every day at twelve o''clock on the sea-front, lunched and
dined together, went for walks, admired the sea. She complained that she
slept badly, that her heart throbbed violently; asked the same
questions, troubled now by jealousy and now by the fear that he did not
respect her sufficiently. And often in the square or gardens, when there
was no one near them, he suddenly drew her to him and kissed her
passionately. Complete idleness, these kisses in broad daylight while he
looked round in dread of some one''s seeing them, the heat, the smell of
the sea, and the continual passing to and fro before him of idle,
well-dressed, well-fed people, made a new man of him; he told Anna
Sergeyevna how beautiful she was, how fascinating. He was impatiently
passionate, he would not move a step away from her, while she was often
pensive and continually urged him to confess that he did not respect
her, did not love her in the least, and thought of her as nothing but a
common woman. Rather late almost every evening they drove somewhere out
of town, to Oreanda or to the waterfall; and the expedition was always a
success, the scenery invariably impressed them as grand and beautiful.

They were expecting her husband to come, but a letter came from him,
saying that there was something wrong with his eyes, and he entreated
his wife to come home as quickly as possible. Anna Sergeyevna made haste
to go.

She went by coach and he went with her. They were driving the whole day.
When she had got into a compartment of the express, and when the second
bell had rung, she said:

"I shall remember you ... think of you," she said. "God be with you; be
happy. Don''t remember evil against me. We are parting forever—it must
be so, for we ought never to have met. Well, God be with you."

The train moved off rapidly, its lights soon vanished from sight, and a
minute later there was no sound of it, as though everything had
conspired together to end as quickly as possible that sweet delirium,
that madness. Left alone on the platform, and gazing into the dark
distance, Gurov listened to the chirrup of the grasshoppers and the hum
of the telegraph wires, feeling as though he had only just waked up. And
he thought, musing, that there had been another episode or adventure in
his life, and it, too, was at an end, and nothing was left of it but a
memory.... He was moved, sad, and conscious of a slight remorse. This
young woman whom he would never meet again had not been happy with him;
he was genuinely warm and affectionate with her, but yet in his manner,
his tone, and his caresses there had been a shade of light irony, the
coarse condescension of a happy man who was, besides, almost twice her
age. All the time she had called him kind, exceptional, lofty; obviously
he had seemed to her different from what he really was, so he had
unintentionally deceived her....

At home in Moscow everything was in its winter routine; the stoves were
heated, and in the morning it was still dark when the children were
having breakfast and getting ready for school, and the nurse would light
the lamp for a short time. The frosts had begun already. When the first
snow has fallen, on the first day of sledge-driving it is pleasant to
see the white earth, the white roofs, to draw soft, delicious breath,
and the season brings back the days of one''s youth. The old limes and
birches, white with hoar-frost, have a good-natured expression; they are
nearer to one''s heart than cypresses and palms, and near them one
doesn''t want to be thinking of the sea and the mountains.

Gurov was Moscow born; he arrived in Moscow on a fine frosty day, and
when he put on his fur coat and warm gloves, and walked along Petrovka,
and when on Saturday evening he heard the ringing of the bells, his
recent trip and the places he had seen lost all charm for him. Little by
little he became absorbed in Moscow life, greedily read three newspapers
a day, and declared he did not read the Moscow papers on principle! He
already felt a longing to go to restaurants, clubs, dinner-parties,
anniversary celebrations, and he felt flattered at entertaining
distinguished lawyers and artists, and at playing cards with a professor
at the doctors'' club. He could already eat a whole plateful of salt fish
and cabbage.

In another month, he fancied, the image of Anna Sergeyevna would be
shrouded in a mist in his memory, and only from time to time would visit
him in his dreams with a touching smile as others did. But more than a
month passed, real winter had come, and everything was still clear in
his memory as though he had parted with Anna Sergeyevna only the day
before. And his memories glowed more and more vividly. When in the
evening stillness he heard from his study the voices of his children,
preparing their lessons, or when he listened to a song or the organ at
the restaurant, or the storm howled in the chimney, suddenly everything
would rise up in his memory: what had happened on the groyne, and the
early morning with the mist on the mountains, and the steamer coming
from Theodosia, and the kisses. He would pace a long time about his
room, remembering it all and smiling; then his memories passed into
dreams, and in his fancy the past was mingled with what was to come.
Anna Sergeyevna did not visit him in dreams, but followed him about
everywhere like a shadow and haunted him. When he shut his eyes he saw
her as though she were living before him, and she seemed to him
lovelier, younger, tenderer than she was; and he imagined himself finer
than he had been in Yalta. In the evenings she peeped out at him from
the bookcase, from the fireplace, from the corner—he heard her
breathing, the caressing rustle of her dress. In the street he watched
the women, looking for some one like her.

He was tormented by an intense desire to confide his memories to some
one. But in his home it was impossible to talk of his love, and he had
no one outside; he could not talk to his tenants nor to any one at the
bank. And what had he to talk of? Had he been in love, then? Had there
been anything beautiful, poetical, or edifying or simply interesting in
his relations with Anna Sergeyevna? And there was nothing for him but to
talk vaguely of love, of woman, and no one guessed what it meant; only
his wife twitched her black eyebrows, and said:

One evening, coming out of the doctors'' club with an official with whom
he had been playing cards, he could not resist saying:

These words, so ordinary, for some reason moved Gurov to indignation,
and struck him as degrading and unclean. What savage manners, what
people! What senseless nights, what uninteresting, uneventful days! The
rage for card-playing, the gluttony, the drunkenness, the continual talk
always about the same thing. Useless pursuits and conversations always
about the same things absorb the better part of one''s time, the better
part of one''s strength, and in the end there is left a life grovelling
and curtailed, worthless and trivial, and there is no escaping or
getting away from it—just as though one were in a madhouse or a prison.

Gurov did not sleep all night, and was filled with indignation. And he
had a headache all next day. And the next night he slept badly; he sat
up in bed, thinking, or paced up and down his room. He was sick of his
children, sick of the bank; he had no desire to go anywhere or to talk
of anything.

In the holidays in December he prepared for a journey, and told his wife
he was going to Petersburg to do something in the interests of a young
friend—and he set off for S——. What for? He did not very well know
himself. He wanted to see Anna Sergeyevna and to talk with her—to
arrange a meeting, if possible.

He reached S—— in the morning, and took the best room at the hotel, in
which the floor was covered with grey army cloth, and on the table was
an inkstand, grey with dust and adorned with a figure on horseback, with
its hat in its hand and its head broken off. The hotel porter gave him
the necessary information; Von Diderits lived in a house of his own in
Old Gontcharny Street—it was not far from the hotel: he was rich and
lived in good style, and had his own horses; every one in the town knew
him. The porter pronounced the name "Dridirits."

Gurov went without haste to Old Gontcharny Street and found the house.
Just opposite the house stretched a long grey fence adorned with nails.

"One would run away from a fence like that," thought Gurov, looking from
the fence to the windows of the house and back again.

He considered: to-day was a holiday, and the husband would probably be
at home. And in any case it would be tactless to go into the house and
upset her. If he were to send her a note it might fall into her
husband''s hands, and then it might ruin everything. The best thing was
to trust to chance. And he kept walking up and down the street by the
fence, waiting for the chance. He saw a beggar go in at the gate and
dogs fly at him; then an hour later he heard a piano, and the sounds
were faint and indistinct. Probably it was Anna Sergeyevna playing. The
front door suddenly opened, and an old woman came out, followed by the
familiar white Pomeranian. Gurov was on the point of calling to the dog,
but his heart began beating violently, and in his excitement he could
not remember the dog''s name.

He walked up and down, and loathed the grey fence more and more, and by
now he thought irritably that Anna Sergeyevna had forgotten him, and was
perhaps already amusing herself with some one else, and that that was
very natural in a young woman who had nothing to look at from morning
till night but that confounded fence. He went back to his hotel room and
sat for a long while on the sofa, not knowing what to do, then he had
dinner and a long nap.

"How stupid and worrying it is!" he thought when he woke and looked at
the dark windows: it was already evening. "Here I''ve had a good sleep
for some reason. What shall I do in the night?"

He sat on the bed, which was covered by a cheap grey blanket, such as
one sees in hospitals, and he taunted himself in his vexation:

That morning at the station a poster in large letters had caught his
eye. "The Geisha" was to be performed for the first time. He thought of
this and went to the theatre.

The theatre was full. As in all provincial theatres, there was a fog
above the chandelier, the gallery was noisy and restless; in the front
row the local dandies were standing up before the beginning of the
performance, with their hands behind them; in the Governor''s box the
Governor''s daughter, wearing a boa, was sitting in the front seat, while
the Governor himself lurked modestly behind the curtain with only his
hands visible; the orchestra was a long time tuning up; the stage
curtain swayed. All the time the audience were coming in and taking
their seats Gurov looked at them eagerly.

Anna Sergeyevna, too, came in. She sat down in the third row, and when
Gurov looked at her his heart contracted, and he understood clearly that
for him there was in the whole world no creature so near, so precious,
and so important to him; she, this little woman, in no way remarkable,
lost in a provincial crowd, with a vulgar lorgnette in her hand, filled
his whole life now, was his sorrow and his joy, the one happiness that
he now desired for himself, and to the sounds of the inferior orchestra,
of the wretched provincial violins, he thought how lovely she was. He
thought and dreamed.

A young man with small side-whiskers, tall and stooping, came in with
Anna Sergeyevna and sat down beside her; he bent his head at every step
and seemed to be continually bowing. Most likely this was the husband
whom at Yalta, in a rush of bitter feeling, she had called a flunkey.
And there really was in his long figure, his side-whiskers, and the
small bald patch on his head, something of the flunkey''s obsequiousness;
his smile was sugary, and in his buttonhole there was some badge of
distinction like the number on a waiter.

During the first interval the husband went away to smoke; she remained
alone in her stall. Gurov, who was sitting in the stalls, too, went up
to her and said in a trembling voice, with a forced smile:

She glanced at him and turned pale, then glanced again with horror,
unable to believe her eyes, and tightly gripped the fan and the
lorgnette in her hands, evidently struggling with herself not to faint.
Both were silent. She was sitting, he was standing, frightened by her
confusion and not venturing to sit down beside her. The violins and the
flute began tuning up. He felt suddenly frightened; it seemed as though
all the people in the boxes were looking at them. She got up and went
quickly to the door; he followed her, and both walked senselessly along
passages, and up and down stairs, and figures in legal, scholastic, and
civil service uniforms, all wearing badges, flitted before their eyes.
They caught glimpses of ladies, of fur coats hanging on pegs; the
draughts blew on them, bringing a smell of stale tobacco. And Gurov,
whose heart was beating violently, thought:

And at that instant he recalled how when he had seen Anna Sergeyevna off
at the station he had thought that everything was over and they would
never meet again. But how far they were still from the end!

"How you have frightened me!" she said, breathing hard, still pale and
overwhelmed. "Oh, how you have frightened me! I am half dead. Why have
you come? Why?"

"But do understand, Anna, do understand ..." he said hastily in a low
voice. "I entreat you to understand...."

She looked at him with dread, with entreaty, with love; she looked at
him intently, to keep his features more distinctly in her memory.

"I am so unhappy," she went on, not heeding him. "I have thought of
nothing but you all the time; I live only in the thought of you. And I
wanted to forget, to forget you; but why, oh, why, have you come?"

On the landing above them two schoolboys were smoking and looking down,
but that was nothing to Gurov; he drew Anna Sergeyevna to him, and began
kissing her face, her cheeks, and her hands.

"What are you doing, what are you doing!" she cried in horror, pushing
him away. "We are mad. Go away to-day; go away at once.... I beseech you
by all that is sacred, I implore you.... There are people coming this
way!"

"You must go away," Anna Sergeyevna went on in a whisper. "Do you hear,
Dmitri Dmitritch? I will come and see you in Moscow. I have never been
happy; I am miserable now, and I never, never shall be happy, never!
Don''t make me suffer still more! I swear I''ll come to Moscow. But now
let us part. My precious, good, dear one, we must part!"

She pressed his hand and began rapidly going downstairs, looking round
at him, and from her eyes he could see that she really was unhappy.
Gurov stood for a little while, listened, then, when all sound had died
away, he found his coat and left the theatre.

And Anna Sergeyevna began coming to see him in Moscow. Once in two or
three months she left S——, telling her husband that she was going to
consult a doctor about an internal complaint—and her husband believed
her, and did not believe her. In Moscow she stayed at the Slaviansky
Bazaar hotel, and at once sent a man in a red cap to Gurov. Gurov went
to see her, and no one in Moscow knew of it.

Once he was going to see her in this way on a winter morning (the
messenger had come the evening before when he was out). With him walked
his daughter, whom he wanted to take to school: it was on the way. Snow
was falling in big wet flakes.

"It''s three degrees above freezing-point, and yet it is snowing," said
Gurov to his daughter. "The thaw is only on the surface of the earth;
there is quite a different temperature at a greater height in the
atmosphere."

He explained that, too. He talked, thinking all the while that he was
going to see her, and no living soul knew of it, and probably never
would know. He had two lives: one, open, seen and known by all who cared
to know, full of relative truth and of relative falsehood, exactly like
the lives of his friends and acquaintances; and another life running its
course in secret. And through some strange, perhaps accidental,
conjunction of circumstances, everything that was essential, of interest
and of value to him, everything in which he was sincere and did not
deceive himself, everything that made the kernel of his life, was hidden
from other people; and all that was false in him, the sheath in which he
hid himself to conceal the truth—such, for instance, as his work in the
bank, his discussions at the club, his "lower race," his presence with
his wife at anniversary festivities—all that was open. And he judged of
others by himself, not believing in what he saw, and always believing
that every man had his real, most interesting life under the cover of
secrecy and under the cover of night. All personal life rested on
secrecy, and possibly it was partly on that account that civilised man
was so nervously anxious that personal privacy should be respected.

After leaving his daughter at school, Gurov went on to the Slaviansky
Bazaar. He took off his fur coat below, went upstairs, and softly
knocked at the door. Anna Sergeyevna, wearing his favourite grey dress,
exhausted by the journey and the suspense, had been expecting him since
the evening before. She was pale; she looked at him, and did not smile,
and he had hardly come in when she fell on his breast. Their kiss was
slow and prolonged, as though they had not met for two years.

She could not speak; she was crying. She turned away from him, and
pressed her handkerchief to her eyes.

Then he rang and asked for tea to be brought him, and while he drank his
tea she remained standing at the window with her back to him. She was
crying from emotion, from the miserable consciousness that their life
was so hard for them; they could only meet in secret, hiding themselves
from people, like thieves! Was not their life shattered?

It was evident to him that this love of theirs would not soon be over,
that he could not see the end of it. Anna Sergeyevna grew more and more
attached to him. She adored him, and it was unthinkable to say to her
that it was bound to have an end some day; besides, she would not have
believed it!

He went up to her and took her by the shoulders to say something
affectionate and cheering, and at that moment he saw himself in the
looking-glass.

His hair was already beginning to turn grey. And it seemed strange to
him that he had grown so much older, so much plainer during the last few
years. The shoulders on which his hands rested were warm and quivering.
He felt compassion for this life, still so warm and lovely, but probably
already not far from beginning to fade and wither like his own. Why did
she love him so much? He always seemed to women different from what he
was, and they loved in him not himself, but the man created by their
imagination, whom they had been eagerly seeking all their lives; and
afterwards, when they noticed their mistake, they loved him all the
same. And not one of them had been happy with him. Time passed, he had
made their acquaintance, got on with them, parted, but he had never once
loved; it was anything you like, but not love.

And only now when his head was grey he had fallen properly, really in
love—for the first time in his life.

Anna Sergeyevna and he loved each other like people very close and akin,
like husband and wife, like tender friends; it seemed to them that fate
itself had meant them for one another, and they could not understand why
he had a wife and she a husband; and it was as though they were a pair
of birds of passage, caught and forced to live in different cages. They
forgave each other for what they were ashamed of in their past, they
forgave everything in the present, and felt that this love of theirs had
changed them both.

In moments of depression in the past he had comforted himself with any
arguments that came into his mind, but now he no longer cared for
arguments; he felt profound compassion, he wanted to be sincere and
tender....

"Don''t cry, my darling," he said. "You''ve had your cry; that''s
enough.... Let us talk now, let us think of some plan."

Then they spent a long while taking counsel together, talked of how to
avoid the necessity for secrecy, for deception, for living in different
towns and not seeing each other for long at a time. How could they be
free from this intolerable bondage?

And it seemed as though in a little while the solution would be found,
and then a new and splendid life would begin; and it was clear to both
of them that they had still a long, long road before them, and that the
most complicated and difficult part of it was only just beginning.

THE Professor received a telegram from the Lyalikovs'' factory; he was
asked to come as quickly as possible. The daughter of some Madame
Lyalikov, apparently the owner of the factory, was ill, and that was all
that one could make out of the long, incoherent telegram. And the
Professor did not go himself, but sent instead his assistant, Korolyov.

It was two stations from Moscow, and there was a drive of three miles
from the station. A carriage with three horses had been sent to the
station to meet Korolyov; the coachman wore a hat with a peacock''s
feather on it, and answered every question in a loud voice like a
soldier: "No, sir!" "Certainly, sir!"

It was Saturday evening; the sun was setting, the workpeople were coming
in crowds from the factory to the station, and they bowed to the
carriage in which Korolyov was driving. And he was charmed with the
evening, the farmhouses and villas on the road, and the birch-trees, and
the quiet atmosphere all around, when the fields and woods and the sun
seemed preparing, like the workpeople now on the eve of the holiday, to
rest, and perhaps to pray....

He was born and had grown up in Moscow; he did not know the country, and
he had never taken any interest in factories, or been inside one, but he
had happened to read about factories, and had been in the houses of
manufacturers and had talked to them; and whenever he saw a factory far
or near, he always thought how quiet and peaceable it was outside, but
within there was always sure to be impenetrable ignorance and dull
egoism on the side of the owners, wearisome, unhealthy toil on the side
of the workpeople, squabbling, vermin, vodka. And now when the
workpeople timidly and respectfully made way for the carriage, in their
faces, their caps, their walk, he read physical impurity, drunkenness,
nervous exhaustion, bewilderment.

They drove in at the factory gates. On each side he caught glimpses of
the little houses of workpeople, of the faces of women, of quilts and
linen on the railings. "Look out!" shouted the coachman, not pulling up
the horses. It was a wide courtyard without grass, with five immense
blocks of buildings with tall chimneys a little distance one from
another, warehouses and barracks, and over everything a sort of grey
powder as though from dust. Here and there, like oases in the desert,
there were pitiful gardens, and the green and red roofs of the houses in
which the managers and clerks lived. The coachman suddenly pulled up the
horses, and the carriage stopped at the house, which had been newly
painted grey; here was a flower garden, with a lilac bush covered with
dust, and on the yellow steps at the front door there was a strong smell
of paint.

"Please come in, doctor," said women''s voices in the passage and the
entry, and at the same time he heard sighs and whisperings. "Pray walk
in.... We''ve been expecting you so long ... we''re in real trouble. Here,
this way."

Madame Lyalikov—a stout elderly lady wearing a black silk dress with
fashionable sleeves, but, judging from her face, a simple uneducated
woman—looked at the doctor in a flutter, and could not bring herself to
hold out her hand to him; she did not dare. Beside her stood a personage
with short hair and a pince-nez; she was wearing a blouse of many
colours, and was very thin and no longer young. The servants called her
Christina Dmitryevna, and Korolyov guessed that this was the governess.
Probably, as the person of most education in the house, she had been
charged to meet and receive the doctor, for she began immediately, in
great haste, stating the causes of the illness, giving trivial and
tiresome details, but without saying who was ill or what was the matter.

The doctor and the governess were sitting talking while the lady of the
house stood motionless at the door, waiting. From the conversation
Korolyov learned that the patient was Madame Lyalikov''s only daughter
and heiress, a girl of twenty, called Liza; she had been ill for a long
time, and had consulted various doctors, and the previous night she had
suffered till morning from such violent palpitations of the heart, that
no one in the house had slept, and they had been afraid she might die.

"She has been, one may say, ailing from a child," said Christina
Dmitryevna in a sing-song voice, continually wiping her lips with her
hand. "The doctors say it is nerves; when she was a little girl she was
scrofulous, and the doctors drove it inwards, so I think it may be due
to that."

They went to see the invalid. Fully grown up, big and tall, but ugly
like her mother, with the same little eyes and disproportionate breadth
of the lower part of the face, lying with her hair in disorder, muffled
up to the chin, she made upon Korolyov at the first minute the
impression of a poor, destitute creature, sheltered and cared for here
out of charity, and he could hardly believe that this was the heiress of
the five huge buildings.

He mentioned his name and pressed her hand, a large, cold, ugly hand;
she sat up, and, evidently accustomed to doctors, let herself be
sounded, without showing the least concern that her shoulders and chest
were uncovered.

"I have palpitations of the heart," she said, "It was so awful all
night.... I almost died of fright! Do give me something."

"The heart is all right," he said; "it''s all going on satisfactorily;
everything is in good order. Your nerves must have been playing pranks a
little, but that''s so common. The attack is over by now, one must
suppose; lie down and go to sleep."

At that moment a lamp was brought into the bed-room. The patient screwed
up her eyes at the light, then suddenly put her hands to her head and
broke into sobs. And the impression of a destitute, ugly creature
vanished, and Korolyov no longer noticed the little eyes or the heavy
development of the lower part of the face. He saw a soft, suffering
expression which was intelligent and touching: she seemed to him
altogether graceful, feminine, and simple; and he longed to soothe her,
not with drugs, not with advice, but with simple, kindly words. Her
mother put her arms round her head and hugged her. What despair, what
grief was in the old woman''s face! She, her mother, had reared her and
brought her up, spared nothing, and devoted her whole life to having her
daughter taught French, dancing, music: had engaged a dozen teachers for
her; had consulted the best doctors, kept a governess. And now she could
not make out the reason of these tears, why there was all this misery,
she could not understand, and was bewildered; and she had a guilty,
agitated, despairing expression, as though she had omitted something
very important, had left something undone, had neglected to call in
somebody—and whom, she did not know.

"Lizanka, you are crying again ... again," she said, hugging her
daughter to her. "My own, my darling, my child, tell me what it is! Have
pity on me! Tell me."

"Come, give over; it''s no use crying," he said kindly. "Why, there is
nothing in the world that is worth those tears. Come, we won''t cry;
that''s no good...."

"Our doctor at the factory gave her kalibromati," said the governess,
"but I notice it only makes her worse. I should have thought that if she
is given anything for the heart it ought to be drops.... I forget the
name.... Convallaria, isn''t it?"

And there followed all sorts of details. She interrupted the doctor,
preventing his speaking, and there was a look of effort on her face, as
though she supposed that, as the woman of most education in the house,
she was duty bound to keep up a conversation with the doctor, and on no
other subject but medicine.

"I find nothing special the matter," he said, addressing the mother as
he went out of the bedroom. "If your daughter is being attended by the
factory doctor, let him go on attending her. The treatment so far has
been perfectly correct, and I see no reason for changing your doctor.
Why change? It''s such an ordinary trouble; there''s nothing seriously
wrong."

He spoke deliberately as he put on his gloves, while Madame Lyalikov
stood without moving, and looked at him with her tearful eyes.

"And can''t you stay?" she asked, and tears trickled down her cheeks
again. "I am ashamed to trouble you, but if you would be so good.... For
God''s sake," she went on in an undertone, glancing towards the door, "do
stay to-night with us! She is all I have ... my only daughter.... She
frightened me last night; I can''t get over it.... Don''t go away, for
goodness'' sake!..."

He wanted to tell her that he had a great deal of work in Moscow, that
his family were expecting him home; it was disagreeable to him to spend
the evening and the whole night in a strange house quite needlessly; but
he looked at her face, heaved a sigh, and began taking off his gloves
without a word.

All the lamps and candles were lighted in his honour in the drawing-room
and the dining-room. He sat down at the piano and began turning over the
music. Then he looked at the pictures on the walls, at the portraits.
The pictures, oil-paintings in gold frames, were views of the Crimea—a
stormy sea with a ship, a Catholic monk with a wineglass; they were all
dull, smooth daubs, with no trace of talent in them. There was not a
single good-looking face among the portraits, nothing but broad
cheekbones and astonished-looking eyes. Lyalikov, Liza''s father, had a
low forehead and a self-satisfied expression; his uniform sat like a
sack on his bulky plebeian figure; on his breast was a medal and a Red
Cross Badge. There was little sign of culture, and the luxury was
senseless and haphazard, and was as ill fitting as that uniform. The
floors irritated him with their brilliant polish, the lustres on the
chandelier irritated him, and he was reminded for some reason of the
story of the merchant who used to go to the baths with a medal on his
neck....

He heard a whispering in the entry; some one was softly snoring. And
suddenly from outside came harsh, abrupt, metallic sounds, such as
Korolyov had never heard before, and which he did not understand now;
they roused strange, unpleasant echoes in his soul.

"I believe nothing would induce me to remain here to live ..." he
thought, and went back to the music-books again.

He went into supper. The table was large and laid with a vast number of
dishes and wines, but there were only two to supper: himself and
Christina Dmitryevna. She drank Madeira, ate rapidly, and talked,
looking at him through her pince-nez:

"Our workpeople are very contented. We have performances at the factory
every winter; the workpeople act themselves. They have lectures with a
magic lantern, a splendid tea-room, and everything they want. They are
very much attached to us, and when they heard that Lizanka was worse
they had a service sung for her. Though they have no education, they
have their feelings, too."

"Not one. Pyotr Nikanoritch died a year and a half ago, and left us
alone. And so there are the three of us. In the summer we live here, and
in winter we live in Moscow, in Polianka. I have been living with them
for eleven years—as one of the family."

At supper they served sterlet, chicken rissoles, and stewed fruit; the
wines were expensive French wines.

"Please don''t stand on ceremony, doctor," said Christina Dmitryevna,
eating and wiping her mouth with her fist, and it was evident she found
her life here exceedingly pleasant. "Please have some more."

After supper the doctor was shown to his room, where a bed had been made
up for him, but he did not feel sleepy. The room was stuffy and it smelt
of paint; he put on his coat and went out.

It was cool in the open air; there was already a glimmer of dawn, and
all the five blocks of buildings, with their tall chimneys, barracks,
and warehouses, were distinctly outlined against the damp air. As it was
a holiday, they were not working, and the windows were dark, and in only
one of the buildings was there a furnace burning; two windows were
crimson, and fire mixed with smoke came from time to time from the
chimney. Far away beyond the yard the frogs were croaking and the
nightingales singing.

Looking at the factory buildings and the barracks, where the workpeople
were asleep, he thought again what he always thought when he saw a
factory. They may have performances for the workpeople, magic lanterns,
factory doctors, and improvements of all sorts, but, all the same, the
workpeople he had met that day on his way from the station did not look
in any way different from those he had known long ago in his childhood,
before there were factory performances and improvements. As a doctor
accustomed to judging correctly of chronic complaints, the radical cause
of which was incomprehensible and incurable, he looked upon factories as
something baffling, the cause of which also was obscure and not
removable, and all the improvements in the life of the factory hands he
looked upon not as superfluous, but as comparable with the treatment of
incurable illnesses.

"There is something baffling in it, of course ..." he thought, looking
at the crimson windows. "Fifteen hundred or two thousand workpeople are
working without rest in unhealthy surroundings, making bad cotton goods,
living on the verge of starvation, and only waking from this nightmare
at rare intervals in the tavern; a hundred people act as overseers, and
the whole life of that hundred is spent in imposing fines, in abuse, in
injustice, and only two or three so-called owners enjoy the profits,
though they don''t work at all, and despise the wretched cotton. But what
are the profits, and how do they enjoy them? Madame Lyalikov and her
daughter are unhappy—it makes one wretched to look at them; the only
one who enjoys her life is Christina Dmitryevna, a stupid, middle-aged
maiden lady in pince-nez. And so it appears that all these five blocks
of buildings are at work, and inferior cotton is sold in the Eastern
markets, simply that Christina Dmitryevna may eat sterlet and drink
Madeira."

Suddenly there came a strange noise, the same sound Korolyov had heard
before supper. Some one was striking on a sheet of metal near one of the
buildings; he struck a note, and then at once checked the vibrations, so
that short, abrupt, discordant sounds were produced, rather like "Dair
... dair ... dair...." Then there was half a minute of stillness, and
from another building there came sounds equally abrupt and unpleasant,
lower bass notes: "Drin ... drin ... drin ..." Eleven times. Evidently
it was the watchman striking the hour. Near the third building he heard:
"Zhuk ... zhuk ... zhuk...." And so near all the buildings, and then
behind the barracks and beyond the gates. And in the stillness of the
night it seemed as though these sounds were uttered by a monster with
crimson eyes—the devil himself, who controlled the owners and the
work-people alike, and was deceiving both.

Here the nightingales and the frogs could be heard more distinctly, and
one could feel it was a night in May. From the station came the noise of
a train; somewhere in the distance drowsy cocks were crowing; but, all
the same, the night was still, the world was sleeping tranquilly. In a
field not far from the factory there could be seen the framework of a
house and heaps of building material.

"The only person who feels happy here is the governess, and the factory
hands are working for her gratification. But that''s only apparent: she
is only the figurehead. The real person, for whom everything is being
done, is the devil."

And he thought about the devil, in whom he did not believe, and he
looked round at the two windows where the fires were gleaming. It seemed
to him that out of those crimson eyes the devil himself was looking at
him—that unknown force that had created the mutual relation of the
strong and the weak, that coarse blunder which one could never correct.
The strong must hinder the weak from living—such was the law of
Nature; but only in a newspaper article or in a school book was that
intelligible and easily accepted. In the hotchpotch which was everyday
life, in the tangle of trivialities out of which human relations were
woven, it was no longer a law, but a logical absurdity, when the strong
and the weak were both equally victims of their mutual relations,
unwillingly submitting to some directing force, unknown, standing
outside life, apart from man.

So thought Korolyov, sitting on the planks, and little by little he was
possessed by a feeling that this unknown and mysterious force was really
close by and looking at him. Meanwhile the east was growing paler, time
passed rapidly; when there was not a soul anywhere near, as though
everything were dead, the five buildings and their chimneys against the
grey background of the dawn had a peculiar look—not the same as by day;
one forgot altogether that inside there were steam motors, electricity,
telephones, and kept thinking of lake-dwellings, of the Stone Age,
feeling the presence of a crude, unconscious force....

And again there came the sound: "Dair ... dair ... dair ... dair ..."
twelve times. Then there was stillness, stillness for half a minute, and
at the other end of the yard there rang out.

"Zhuk ... zhuk ..." there resounded from a third place, abruptly,
sharply, as though with annoyance—"Zhuk ... zhuk...."

And it took four minutes to strike twelve. Then there was a hush; and
again it seemed as though everything were dead.

Korolyov sat a little longer, then went to the house, but sat up for a
good while longer. In the adjoining rooms there was whispering, there
was a sound of shuffling slippers and bare feet.

He went out to have a look at the patient. By now it was quite light in
the rooms, and a faint glimmer of sunlight, piercing through the morning
mist, quivered on the floor and on the wall of the drawing-room. The
door of Liza''s room was open, and she was sitting in a low chair beside
her bed, with her hair down, wearing a dressing-gown and wrapped in a
shawl. The blinds were down on the windows.

"You are not asleep," he said. "It''s beautiful weather outside. It''s
spring. The nightingales are singing, and you sit in the dark and think
of something."

She listened and looked into his face; her eyes were sorrowful and
intelligent, and it was evident she wanted to say something to him.

At that moment the watchman in the yard began striking two o''clock. They
heard: "Dair ... dair ..." and she shuddered.

"I don''t know. Everything here worries me," she answered, and pondered.
"Everything worries me. I hear sympathy in your voice; it seemed to me
as soon as I saw you that I could tell you all about it."

"I want to tell you of my opinion. It seems to me that I have no
illness, but that I am weary and frightened, because it is bound to be
so and cannot be otherwise. Even the healthiest person can''t help being
uneasy if, for instance, a robber is moving about under his window. I am
constantly being doctored," she went on, looking at her knees, and she
gave a shy smile. "I am very grateful, of course, and I do not deny that
the treatment is a benefit; but I should like to talk, not with a
doctor, but with some intimate friend who would understand me and would
convince me that I was right or wrong."

"I am lonely. I have a mother; I love her, but, all the same, I am
lonely. That''s how it happens to be.... Lonely people read a great deal,
but say little and hear little. Life for them is mysterious; they are
mystics and often see the devil where he is not. Lermontov''s Tamara was
lonely and she saw the devil."

"Yes. You see, my whole time is free from morning till night. I read by
day, and by night my head is empty; instead of thoughts there are
shadows in it."

She smiled again, raised her eyes to the doctor, and looked at him so
sorrowfully, so intelligently; and it seemed to him that she trusted
him, and that she wanted to speak frankly to him, and that she thought
the same as he did. But she was silent, perhaps waiting for him to
speak.

And he knew what to say to her. It was clear to him that she needed as
quickly as possible to give up the five buildings and the million if she
had it—to leave that devil that looked out at night; it was clear to
him, too, that she thought so herself, and was only waiting for some one
she trusted to confirm her.

But he did not know how to say it. How? One is shy of asking men under
sentence what they have been sentenced for; and in the same way it is
awkward to ask very rich people what they want so much money for, why
they make such a poor use of their wealth, why they don''t give it up,
even when they see in it their unhappiness; and if they begin a
conversation about it themselves, it is usually embarrassing, awkward,
and long.

"You in the position of a factory owner and a wealthy heiress are
dissatisfied; you don''t believe in your right to it; and here now you
can''t sleep. That, of course, is better than if you were satisfied,
slept soundly, and thought everything was satisfactory. Your
sleeplessness does you credit; in any case, it is a good sign. In
reality, such a conversation as this between us now would have been
unthinkable for our parents. At night they did not talk, but slept
sound; we, our generation, sleep badly, are restless, but talk a great
deal, and are always trying to settle whether we are right or not. For
our children or grandchildren that question—whether they are right or
not—will have been settled. Things will be clearer for them than for
us. Life will be good in fifty years'' time; it''s only a pity we shall
not last out till then. It would be interesting to have a peep at it."

"Where?... Why, where they like," said Korolyov; and he laughed. "There
are lots of places a good, intelligent person can go to."

"The sun has risen, though," he said. "It is time you were asleep.
Undress and sleep soundly. Very glad to have made your acquaintance," he
went on, pressing her hand. "You are a good, interesting woman.
Good-night!"

In the morning when the carriage was brought round they all came out on
to the steps to see him off. Liza, pale and exhausted, was in a white
dress as though for a holiday, with a flower in her hair; she looked at
him, as yesterday, sorrowfully and intelligently, smiled and talked, and
all with an expression as though she wanted to tell him something
special, important—him alone. They could hear the larks trilling and
the church bells pealing. The windows in the factory buildings were
sparkling gaily, and, driving across the yard and afterwards along the
road to the station, Korolyov thought neither of the workpeople nor of
lake dwellings, nor of the devil, but thought of the time, perhaps close
at hand, when life would be as bright and joyous as that still Sunday
morning; and he thought how pleasant it was on such a morning in the
spring to drive with three horses in a good carriage, and to bask in the
sunshine.

MASHENKA PAVLETSKY, a young girl who had only just finished her studies
at a boarding school, returning from a walk to the house of the
Kushkins, with whom she was living as a governess, found the household
in a terrible turmoil. Mihailo, the porter who opened the door to her,
was excited and red as a crab.

"Madame Kushkin is in a fit, most likely, or else she has quarrelled
with her husband," thought Mashenka.

In the hall and in the corridor she met maid-servants. One of them was
crying. Then Mashenka saw, running out of her room, the master of the
house himself, Nikolay Sergeitch, a little man with a flabby face and a
bald head, though he was not old. He was red in the face and twitching
all over. He passed the governess without noticing her, and throwing up
his arms, exclaimed:

Mashenka went into her room, and then, for the first time in her life,
it was her lot to experience in all its acuteness the feeling that is so
familiar to persons in dependent positions, who eat the bread of the
rich and powerful, and cannot speak their minds. There was a search
going on in her room. The lady of the house, Fedosya Vassilyevna, a
stout, broad-shouldered, uncouth woman with thick black eyebrows, a
faintly perceptible moustache, and red hands, who was exactly like a
plain, illiterate cook in face and manners, was standing, without her
cap on, at the table, putting back into Mashenka''s workbag balls of
wool, scraps of materials, and bits of paper.... Evidently the
governess''s arrival took her by surprise, since, on looking round and
seeing the girl''s pale and astonished face, she was a little taken
aback, and muttered:

And saying something more, Madame Kushkin rustled her long skirts and
went out. Mashenka looked round her room with wondering eyes, and,
unable to understand it, not knowing what to think, shrugged her
shoulders, and turned cold with dismay. What had Fedosya Vassilyevna
been looking for in her work-bag? If she really had, as she said, caught
her sleeve in it and upset everything, why had Nikolay Sergeitch dashed
out of her room so excited and red in the face? Why was one drawer of
the table pulled out a little way? The money-box, in which the governess
put away ten kopeck pieces and old stamps, was open. They had opened it,
but did not know how to shut it, though they had scratched the lock all
over. The whatnot with her books on it, the things on the table, the
bed—all bore fresh traces of a search. Her linen-basket, too. The linen
had been carefully folded, but it was not in the same order as Mashenka
had left it when she went out. So the search had been thorough, most
thorough. But what was it for? Why? What had happened? Mashenka
remembered the excited porter, the general turmoil which was still going
on, the weeping servant-girl; had it not all some connection with the
search that had just been made in her room? Was not she mixed up in
something dreadful? Mashenka turned pale, and feeling cold all over,
sank on to her linen-basket.

"They''ve been searching every one, miss. They''ve searched all my things,
too. They stripped us all naked and searched us.... God knows, miss, I
never went near her toilet-table, let alone touching the brooch. I shall
say the same at the police-station."

"A brooch has been stolen, I tell you. The mistress has been rummaging
in everything with her own hands. She even searched Mihailo, the porter,
herself. It''s a perfect disgrace! Nikolay Sergeitch simply looks on and
cackles like a hen. But you''ve no need to tremble like that, miss. They
found nothing here. You''ve nothing to be afraid of if you didn''t take
the brooch."

"But, Liza, it''s vile ... it''s insulting," said Mashenka, breathless
with indignation. "It''s so mean, so low! What right had she to suspect
me and to rummage in my things?"

"You are living with strangers, miss," sighed Liza. "Though you are a
young lady, still you are ... as it were ... a servant.... It''s not like
living with your papa and mamma."

Mashenka threw herself on the bed and sobbed bitterly. Never in her life
had she been subjected to such an outrage, never had she been so deeply
insulted.... She, well-educated, refined, the daughter of a teacher, was
suspected of theft; she had been searched like a street-walker! She
could not imagine a greater insult. And to this feeling of resentment
was added an oppressive dread of what would come next. All sorts of
absurd ideas came into her mind. If they could suspect her of theft,
then they might arrest her, strip her naked, and search her, then lead
her through the street with an escort of soldiers, cast her into a cold,
dark cell with mice and woodlice, exactly like the dungeon in which
Princess Tarakanov was imprisoned. Who would stand up for her? Her
parents lived far away in the provinces; they had not the money to come
to her. In the capital she was as solitary as in a desert, without
friends or kindred. They could do what they liked with her.

"I will go to all the courts and all the lawyers," Mashenka thought,
trembling. "I will explain to them, I will take an oath.... They will
believe that I could not be a thief!"

Mashenka remembered that under the sheets in her basket she had some
sweetmeats, which, following the habits of her schooldays, she had put
in her pocket at dinner and carried off to her room. She felt hot all
over, and was ashamed at the thought that her little secret was known to
the lady of the house; and all this terror, shame, resentment, brought
on an attack of palpitation of the heart, which set up a throbbing in
her temples, in her heart, and deep down in her stomach.

Mashenka brushed her hair, wiped her face with a wet towel, and went
into the dining-room. There they had already begun dinner. At one end of
the table sat Fedosya Vassilyevna with a stupid, solemn, serious face;
at the other end Nikolay Sergeitch. At the sides there were the visitors
and the children. The dishes were handed by two footmen in swallowtails
and white gloves. Every one knew that there was an upset in the house,
that Madame Kushkin was in trouble, and every one was silent. Nothing
was heard but the sound of munching and the rattle of spoons on the
plates.

"I ordered that, Fenya," Nikolay Sergeitch hastened to observe. "I
wanted some fish. If you don''t like it, ma chÃ¨re, don''t let them serve
it. I just ordered it...."

Fedosya Vassilyevna did not like dishes that she had not ordered
herself, and now her eyes filled with tears.

"Come, don''t let us agitate ourselves," Mamikov, her household doctor,
observed in a honeyed voice, just touching her arm, with a smile as
honeyed. "We are nervous enough as it is. Let us forget the brooch!
Health is worth more than two thousand roubles!"

"It''s not the two thousand I regret," answered the lady, and a big tear
rolled down her cheek. "It''s the fact itself that revolts me! I cannot
put up with thieves in my house. I don''t regret it—I regret nothing;
but to steal from me is such ingratitude! That''s how they repay me for
my kindness...."

They all looked into their plates, but Mashenka fancied after the lady''s
words that every one was looking at her. A lump rose in her throat; she
began crying and put her handkerchief to her lips.

And she got up from the table, scraping her chair awkwardly, and went
out quickly, still more overcome with confusion.

"It''s beyond everything!" said Nikolay Sergeitch, frowning. "What need
was there to search her room? How out of place it was!"

"I don''t say she took the brooch," said Fedosya Vassilyevna, "but can
you answer for her? To tell the truth, I haven''t much confidence in
these learned paupers."

"It really was unsuitable, Fenya.... Excuse me, Fenya, but you''ve no
kind of legal right to make a search."

"I know nothing about your laws. All I know is that I''ve lost my brooch.
And I will find the brooch!" She brought her fork down on the plate with
a clatter, and her eyes flashed angrily. "And you eat your dinner, and
don''t interfere in what doesn''t concern you!"

Nikolay Sergeitch dropped his eyes mildly and sighed. Meanwhile
Mashenka, reaching her room, flung herself on her bed. She felt now
neither alarm nor shame, but she felt an intense longing to go and slap
the cheeks of this hard, arrogant, dull-witted, prosperous woman.

Lying on her bed she breathed into her pillow and dreamed of how nice it
would be to go and buy the most expensive brooch and fling it into the
face of this bullying woman. If only it were God''s will that Fedosya
Vassilyevna should come to ruin and wander about begging, and should
taste all the horrors of poverty and dependence, and that Mashenka, whom
she had insulted, might give her alms! Oh, if only she could come in for
a big fortune, could buy a carriage, and could drive noisily past the
windows so as to be envied by that woman!

But all these were only dreams, in reality there was only one thing left
to do—to get away as quickly as possible, not to stay another hour in
this place. It was true it was terrible to lose her place, to go back to
her parents, who had nothing; but what could she do? Mashenka could not
bear the sight of the lady of the house nor of her little room; she felt
stifled and wretched here. She was so disgusted with Fedosya
Vassilyevna, who was so obsessed by her illnesses and her supposed
aristocratic rank, that everything in the world seemed to have become
coarse and unattractive because this woman was living in it. Mashenka
jumped up from the bed and began packing.

"May I come in?" asked Nikolay Sergeitch at the door; he had come up
noiselessly to the door, and spoke in a soft, subdued voice. "May I?"

He came in and stood still near the door. His eyes looked dim and his
red little nose was shiny. After dinner he used to drink beer, and the
fact was perceptible in his walk, in his feeble, flabby hands.

"I am packing. Forgive me, Nikolay Sergeitch, but I cannot remain in
your house. I feel deeply insulted by this search!"

"I understand.... Only you are wrong to go. Why should you? They''ve
searched your things, but you ... what does it matter to you? You will
be none the worse for it."

Mashenka was silent and went on packing. Nikolay Sergeitch pinched his
moustache, as though wondering what he should say next, and went on in
an ingratiating voice:

"I understand, of course, but you must make allowances. You know my wife
is nervous, headstrong; you mustn''t judge her too harshly."

"If you are so offended," Nikolay Sergeitch went on, "well, if you like,
I''m ready to apologise. I ask your pardon."

Mashenka made no answer, but only bent lower over her box. This
exhausted, irresolute man was of absolutely no significance in the
household. He stood in the pitiful position of a dependent and
hanger-on, even with the servants, and his apology meant nothing either.

"H''m!... You say nothing! That''s not enough for you. In that case, I
will apologise for my wife. In my wife''s name.... She behaved
tactlessly, I admit it as a gentleman...."

"Then you want me to have it rankling here, under my heart.... You want
my conscience to torment me...."

"I know it''s not your fault, Nikolay Sergeitch," said Mashenka, looking
him full in the face with her big tear-stained eyes. "Why should you
worry yourself?"

Mashenka shook her head. Nikolay Sergeitch stopped at the window and
drummed on the pane with his finger-tips.

"Such misunderstandings are simply torture to me," he said. "Why, do you
want me to go down on my knees to you, or what? Your pride is wounded,
and here you''ve been crying and packing up to go; but I have pride, too,
and you do not spare it! Or do you want me to tell you what I would not
tell as Confession? Do you? Listen; you want me to tell you what I won''t
tell the priest on my deathbed?"

"I took my wife''s brooch," Nikolay Sergeitch said quickly. "Is that
enough now? Are you satisfied? Yes, I ... took it.... But, of course, I
count on your discretion.... For God''s sake, not a word, not half a hint
to any one!"

Mashenka, amazed and frightened, went on packing; she snatched her
things, crumpled them up, and thrust them anyhow into the box and the
basket. Now, after this candid avowal on the part of Nikolay Sergeitch,
she could not remain another minute, and could not understand how she
could have gone on living in the house before.

"And it''s nothing to wonder at," Nikolay Sergeitch went on after a
pause. "It''s an everyday story! I need money, and she ... won''t give it
to me. It was my father''s money that bought this house and everything,
you know! It''s all mine, and the brooch belonged to my mother, and ...
it''s all mine! And she took it, took possession of everything.... I
can''t go to law with her, you''ll admit.... I beg you most earnestly,
overlook it ... stay on. Tout comprendre, tout pardonner. Will you
stay?"

"Well, God bless you!" sighed Nikolay Sergeitch, sitting down on the
stool near the box. "I must own I like people who still can feel
resentment, contempt, and so on. I could sit here forever and look at
your indignant face.... So you won''t stay, then? I understand.... It''s
bound to be so ... Yes, of course.... It''s all right for you, but for
me—wo-o-o-o!... I can''t stir a step out of this cellar. I''d go off to
one of our estates, but in every one of them there are some of my wife''s
rascals ... stewards, experts, damn them all! They mortgage and
remortgage.... You mustn''t catch fish, must keep off the grass, mustn''t
break the trees."

"Then you won''t stay?" asked Nikolay Sergeitch, getting up quickly and
going towards the door. "You might as well stay, really. In the evenings
I could come and have a talk with you. Eh? Stay! If you go, there won''t
be a human face left in the house. It''s awful!"

Nikolay Sergeitch''s pale, exhausted face besought her, but Mashenka
shook her head, and with a wave of his hand he went out.

WHEN visitors to the provincial town S—— complained of the dreariness
and monotony of life, the inhabitants of the town, as though defending
themselves, declared that it was very nice in S——, that there was a
library, a theatre, a club; that they had balls; and, finally, that
there were clever, agreeable, and interesting families with whom one
could make acquaintance. And they used to point to the family of the
Turkins as the most highly cultivated and talented.

This family lived in their own house in the principal street, near the
Governor''s. Ivan Petrovitch Turkin himself—a stout, handsome, dark man
with whiskers—used to get up amateur performances for benevolent
objects, and used to take the part of an elderly general and cough very
amusingly. He knew a number of anecdotes, charades, proverbs, and was
fond of being humorous and witty, and he always wore an expression from
which it was impossible to tell whether he were joking or in earnest.
His wife, Vera Iosifovna—a thin, nice-looking lady who wore a
pince-nez—used to write novels and stories, and was very fond of
reading them aloud to her visitors. The daughter, Ekaterina Ivanovna, a
young girl, used to play on the piano. In short, every member of the
family had a special talent. The Turkins welcomed visitors, and
good-humouredly displayed their talents with genuine simplicity. Their
stone house was roomy and cool in summer; half of the windows looked
into a shady old garden, where nightingales used to sing in the spring.
When there were visitors in the house, there was a clatter of knives in
the kitchen and a smell of fried onions in the yard—and that was always
a sure sign of a plentiful and savoury supper to follow.

And as soon as Dmitri Ionitch Startsev was appointed the district
doctor, and took up his abode at Dyalizh, six miles from S——, he, too,
was told that as a cultivated man it was essential for him to make the
acquaintance of the Turkins. In the winter he was introduced to Ivan
Petrovitch in the street; they talked about the weather, about the
theatre, about the cholera; an invitation followed. On a holiday in the
spring—it was Ascension Day—after seeing his patients, Startsev set
off for town in search of a little recreation and to make some
purchases. He walked in a leisurely way (he had not yet set up his
carriage), humming all the time:

In town he dined, went for a walk in the gardens, then Ivan
Petrovitch''s invitation came into his mind, as it were of itself,
and he decided to call on the Turkins and see what sort of people
they were.

"How do you do, if you please?" said Ivan Petrovitch, meeting him
on the steps. "Delighted, delighted to see such an agreeable visitor.
Come along; I will introduce you to my better half. I tell him,
Verotchka," he went on, as he presented the doctor to his wife—"I
tell him that he has no human right to sit at home in a hospital;
he ought to devote his leisure to society. Oughtn''t he, darling?"

"Sit here," said Vera Iosifovna, making her visitor sit down beside
her. "You can dance attendance on me. My husband is jealous—he
is an Othello; but we will try and behave so well that he will
notice nothing."

"Ah, you spoilt chicken!" Ivan Petrovitch muttered tenderly, and
he kissed her on the forehead. "You have come just in the nick of
time," he said, addressing the doctor again. "My better half has
written a ''hugeous'' novel, and she is going to read it aloud to-day."

Startsev was introduced to Ekaterina Ivanovna, a girl of eighteen,
very much like her mother, thin and pretty. Her expression was still
childish and her figure was soft and slim; and her developed girlish
bosom, healthy and beautiful, was suggestive of spring, real spring.

Then they drank tea with jam, honey, and sweetmeats, and with very
nice cakes, which melted in the mouth. As the evening came on, other
visitors gradually arrived, and Ivan Petrovitch fixed his laughing
eyes on each of them and said:

Then they all sat down in the drawing-room with very serious faces,
and Vera Iosifovna read her novel. It began like this: "The frost
was intense...." The windows were wide open; from the kitchen
came the clatter of knives and the smell of fried onions.... It
was comfortable in the soft deep arm-chair; the lights had such a
friendly twinkle in the twilight of the drawing-room, and at the
moment on a summer evening when sounds of voices and laughter floated
in from the street and whiffs of lilac from the yard, it was difficult
to grasp that the frost was intense, and that the setting sun was
lighting with its chilly rays a solitary wayfarer on the snowy
plain. Vera Iosifovna read how a beautiful young countess founded
a school, a hospital, a library, in her village, and fell in love
with a wandering artist; she read of what never happens in real
life, and yet it was pleasant to listen—it was comfortable, and
such agreeable, serene thoughts kept coming into the mind, one had
no desire to get up.

One hour passed, another. In the town gardens close by a band was
playing and a chorus was singing. When Vera Iosifovna shut her
manuscript book, the company was silent for five minutes, listening
to "Lutchina" being sung by the chorus, and the song gave what was
not in the novel and is in real life.

"No," she answered. "I never publish. I write it and put it away
in my cupboard. Why publish?" she explained. "We have enough to
live on."

The lid of the piano was raised and the music lying ready was opened.
Ekaterina Ivanovna sat down and banged on the piano with both hands,
and then banged again with all her might, and then again and again;
her shoulders and bosom shook. She obstinately banged on the same
notes, and it sounded as if she would not leave off until she had
hammered the keys into the piano. The drawing-room was filled with
the din; everything was resounding; the floor, the ceiling, the
furniture.... Ekaterina Ivanovna was playing a difficult passage,
interesting simply on account of its difficulty, long and monotonous,
and Startsev, listening, pictured stones dropping down a steep hill
and going on dropping, and he wished they would leave off dropping;
and at the same time Ekaterina Ivanovna, rosy from the violent
exercise, strong and vigorous, with a lock of hair falling over her
forehead, attracted him very much. After the winter spent at Dyalizh
among patients and peasants, to sit in a drawing-room, to watch
this young, elegant, and, in all probability, pure creature, and
to listen to these noisy, tedious but still cultured sounds, was
so pleasant, so novel....

"Well, Kitten, you have played as never before," said Ivan Petrovitch,
with tears in his eyes, when his daughter had finished and stood
up. "Die, Denis; you won''t write anything better."

All flocked round her, congratulated her, expressed astonishment,
declared that it was long since they had heard such music, and she
listened in silence with a faint smile, and her whole figure was
expressive of triumph.

"Splendid," said Startsev, too, carried away by the general enthusiasm.
"Where have you studied?" he asked Ekaterina Ivanovna. "At the
Conservatoire?"

"No, I am only preparing for the Conservatoire, and till now have
been working with Madame Zavlovsky."

"Oh, no," Vera Iosifovna answered for her, "We have teachers for
her at home; there might be bad influences at the high school or a
boarding school, you know. While a young girl is growing up, she
ought to be under no influence but her mother''s."

And at supper it was Ivan Petrovitch who displayed his talents.
Laughing only with his eyes, he told anecdotes, made epigrams, asked
ridiculous riddles and answered them himself, talking the whole
time in his extraordinary language, evolved in the course of prolonged
practice in witticism and evidently now become a habit: "Badsome,"
"Hugeous," "Thank you most dumbly," and so on.

But that was not all. When the guests, replete and satisfied, trooped
into the hall, looking for their coats and sticks, there bustled
about them the footman Pavlusha, or, as he was called in the family,
Pava—a lad of fourteen with shaven head and chubby cheeks.

He went to a restaurant and drank some beer, then set off to walk
home to Dyalizh; he walked all the way singing:

On going to bed, he felt not the slightest fatigue after the six miles''
walk. On the contrary, he felt as though he could with pleasure have
walked another twenty.

Startsev kept meaning to go to the Turkins'' again, but there was a great
deal of work in the hospital, and he was unable to find free time. In
this way more than a year passed in work and solitude. But one day a
letter in a light blue envelope was brought him from the town.

Vera Iosifovna had been suffering for some time from migraine, but now
since Kitten frightened her every day by saying that she was going away
to the Conservatoire, the attacks began to be more frequent. All the
doctors of the town had been at the Turkins''; at last it was the
district doctor''s turn. Vera Iosifovna wrote him a touching letter in
which she begged him to come and relieve her sufferings. Startsev went,
and after that he began to be often, very often at the Turkins''.... He
really did something for Vera Iosifovna, and she was already telling all
her visitors that he was a wonderful and exceptional doctor. But it was
not for the sake of her migraine that he visited the Turkins'' now....

It was a holiday. Ekaterina Ivanovna finished her long, wearisome
exercises on the piano. Then they sat a long time in the dining-room,
drinking tea, and Ivan Petrovitch told some amusing story. Then there
was a ring and he had to go into the hall to welcome a guest; Startsev
took advantage of the momentary commotion, a' WHERE id = 'cbd83e9f-3d67-42b4-b9b7-2f43b116e644';
