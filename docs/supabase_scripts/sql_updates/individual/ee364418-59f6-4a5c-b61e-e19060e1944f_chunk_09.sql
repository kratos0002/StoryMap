      prepared to resume reading, and that seemed to precipitate his next
      remark. He leant forward almost as though he would touch me.

"Mental trouble! Yes. I daresay there are. It''s the right place for them.
      But what I mean——" He looked at his bony knuckles. "Is that
      sort of thing always dreaming? Is it dreaming? Or is it something
      else? Mightn''t it be something else?"

I should have snubbed his persistent conversation but for the drawn
      anxiety of his face. I remember now the look of his faded eyes and the
      lids red stained—perhaps you know that look.

"If you call them dreams. Night after night. Vivid!—so vivid ...
      this—" (he indicated the landscape that went streaming by the
      window) "seems unreal in comparison! I can scarcely remember who I am,
      what business I am on ..."

"Smashed and killed, and now so much of me as that dream was is dead. Dead
      for ever. I dreamt I was another man, you know, living in a different part
      of the world and in a different time. I dreamt that night after night.
      Night after night I woke into that other life. Fresh scenes and fresh
      happenings—until I came upon the last—"

It was clear I was in for this dream. And, after all, I had an hour before
      me, the light was fading fast, and Fortnum-Roscoe has a dreary way with
      him. "Living in a different time," I said: "do you mean in some different
      age?"

"I don''t know what year it was. I did when I was asleep, when I was
      dreaming, that is, but not now—not now that I am awake. There''s a
      lot of things I have forgotten since I woke out of these dreams, though I
      knew them at the time when I was—I suppose it was dreaming. They
      called the year differently from our way of calling the year... What did
      they call it?" He put his hand to his forehead. "No," said he, "I forget."

He sat smiling weakly. For a moment I feared he did not mean to tell me
      his dream. As a rule, I hate people who tell their dreams, but this struck
      me differently. I proffered assistance even. "It began——" I
      suggested.

"It was vivid from the first. I seemed to wake up in it suddenly. And it''s
      curious that in these dreams I am speaking of I never remembered this life
      I am living now. It seemed as if the dream life was enough while it
      lasted. Perhaps——But I will tell you how I find myself when I
      do my best to recall it all. I don''t remember anything clearly until I
      found myself sitting in a sort of loggia looking out over the sea. I had
      been dozing, and suddenly I woke up—fresh and vivid—not a bit
      dreamlike— because the girl had stopped fanning me."

"I woke up, I say, because the girl had stopped fanning me. I was not
      surprised to find myself there or anything of that sort, you understand. I
      did not feel I had fallen into it suddenly. I simply took it up at that
      point. Whatever memory I had of this life, this nineteenth-century
      life, faded as I woke, vanished like a dream. I knew all about myself,
      knew that my name was no longer Cooper but Hedon, and all about my
      position in the world. I''ve forgotten a lot since I woke—there''s a
      want of connection—but it was all quite clear and matter-of-fact
      then."

He hesitated again, gripping the window strap, putting his face forward,
      and looking up to me appealingly.

"It was not really a loggia—I don''t know what to call it. It faced
      south. It was small. It was all in shadow except the semicircle above the
      balcony that showed the sky and sea and the corner where the girl stood. I
      was on a couch—it was a metal couch with light striped cushions—and
      the girl was leaning over the balcony with her back to me. The light of
      the sunrise fell on her ear and cheek. Her pretty white neck and the
      little curls that nestled there, and her white shoulder were in the sun,
      and all the grace of her body was in the cool blue shadow. She was dressed—how
      can I describe it? It was easy and flowing. And altogether there she
      stood, so that it came to me how beautiful and desirable she was, as
      though I had never seen her before. And when at last I sighed and raised
      myself upon my arm she turned her face to me—"

"I have lived three-and-fifty years in this world. I have had mother,
      sisters, friends, wife and daughters—all their faces, the play of
      their faces, I know. But the face of this girl—it is much more real
      to me. I can bring it back into memory so that I see it again—I
      could draw it or paint it. And after all—"

"The face of a dream—the face of a dream. She was beautiful. Not
      that beauty which is terrible, cold, and worshipful, like the beauty of a
      saint; nor that beauty that stirs fierce passions; but a sort of
      radiation, sweet lips that softened into smiles, and grave gray eyes. And
      she moved gracefully, she seemed to have part with all pleasant and
      gracious things—"

He stopped, and his face was downcast and hidden. Then he looked up at me
      and went on, making no further attempt to disguise his absolute belief in
      the reality of his story.

"You see, I had thrown up my plans and ambitions, thrown up all I had ever
      worked for or desired, for her sake. I had been a master man away there in
      the north, with influence and property and a great reputation, but none of
      it had seemed worth having beside her. I had come to the place, this city
      of sunny pleasures, with her, and left all those things to wreck and ruin
      just to save a remnant at least of my life. While I had been in love with
      her before I knew that she had any care for me, before I had imagined that
      she would dare—that we should dare—all my life had seemed vain
      and hollow, dust and ashes. It was dust and ashes. Night after
      night, and through the long days I had longed and desired—my soul
      had beaten against the thing forbidden!

"But it is impossible for one man to tell another just these things. It''s
      emotion, it''s a tint, a light that comes and goes. Only while it''s there,
      everything changes, everything. The thing is I came away and left them in
      their crisis to do what they could."

"The people up in the north there. You see—in this dream, anyhow—I
      had been a big man, the sort of man men come to trust in, to group
      themselves about. Millions of men who had never seen me were ready to do
      things and risk things because of their confidence in me. I had been
      playing that game for years, that big laborious game, that vague,
      monstrous political game amidst intrigues and betrayals, speech and
      agitation. It was a vast weltering world, and at last I had a sort of
      leadership against the Gang— you know it was called the Gang—a
      sort of compromise of scoundrelly projects and base ambitions and vast
      public emotional stupidities and catch-words—the Gang that kept the
      world noisy and blind year by year, and all the while that it was
      drifting, drifting towards infinite disaster. But I can''t expect you to
      understand the shades and complications of the year—the year
      something or other ahead. I had it all—down to the smallest details—in
      my dream. I suppose I had been dreaming of it before I awoke, and the
      fading outline of some queer new development I had imagined still hung
      about me as I rubbed my eyes. It was some grubby affair that made me thank
      God for the sunlight. I sat up on the couch and remained looking at the
      woman, and rejoicing—rejoicing that I had come away out of all that
      tumult and folly and violence before it was too late. After all, I
      thought, this is life—love and beauty, desire and delight, are they
      not worth all those dismal struggles for vague, gigantic ends? And I
      blamed myself for having ever sought to be a leader when I might have
      given my days to love. But then, thought I, if I had not spent my early
      days sternly and austerely, I might have wasted myself upon vain and
      worthless women, and at the thought all my being went out in love and
      tenderness to my dear mistress, my dear lady, who had come at last and
      compelled me—compelled me by her invincible charm for me—to
      lay that life aside.

"''You are worth it,'' I said, speaking without intending her to hear; ''you
      are worth it, my dearest one; worth pride and praise and all things. Love!
      to have you is worth them all together.'' And at the murmur of my
      voice she turned about.

"I remember how I sprang to my feet and joined her at the balcony. She put
      a white hand upon my shoulder and pointed towards great masses of
      limestone flushing, as it were, into life. I looked. But first I noted the
      sunlight on her face caressing the lines of her cheeks and neck. How can I
      describe to you the scene we had before us? We were at Capri——"

"I have been there," I said. "I have clambered up Monte Solaro and drunk
      vero Capri—muddy stuff like cider—at the summit."

"Ah!" said the man with the white face; "then perhaps you can tell me—you
      will know if this was indeed Capri. For in this life I have never been
      there. Let me describe it. We were in a little room, one of a vast
      multitude of little rooms, very cool and sunny, hollowed out of the
      limestone of a sort of cape, very high above the sea. The whole island,
      you know, was one enormous hotel, complex beyond explaining, and on the
      other side there were miles of floating hotels, and huge floating stages
      to which the flying machines came. They called it a Pleasure City. Of
      course, there was none of that in your time—rather, I should say, is
      none of that now. Of course. Now!—yes.

"Well, this room of ours was at the extremity of the cape, so that one
      could see east and west. Eastward was a great cliff—a thousand feet
      high perhaps, coldly grey except for one bright edge of gold, and beyond
      it the Isle of the Sirens, and a falling coast that faded and passed into
      the hot sunrise. And when one turned to the west, distinct and near was a
      little bay, a little beach still in shadow. And out of that shadow rose
      Solaro, straight and tall, flushed and golden-crested, like a beauty
      throned, and the white moon was floating behind her in the sky. And before
      us from east to west stretched the many-tinted sea all dotted with little
      sailing-boats.

"To the eastward, of course, these little boats were gray and very minute
      and clear, but to the westward they were little boats of gold—shining
      gold—almost like little flames. And just below us was a rock with an
      arch worn through it. The blue sea-water broke to green and foam all round
      the rock, and a galley came gliding out of the arch."

"Faraglioni? Yes, she called it that," answered the man with
      the white face. "There was some story—but that——"

"Well, that is the first thing I remember, the first dream I had, that
      little shaded room and the beautiful air and sky and that dear lady of
      mine, with her shining arms and her graceful robe, and how we sat and
      talked in half whispers to one another. We talked in whispers, not because
      there was any one to hear, but because there was still such a freshness of
      mind between us that our thoughts were a little frightened, I think, to
      find themselves at last in words. And so they went softly.

"Presently we were hungry, and we went from our apartment, going by a
      strange passage with a moving floor, until we came to the great
      breakfast-room—there was a fountain and music. A pleasant and joyful
      place it was, with its sunlight and splashing, and the murmur of plucked
      strings. And we sat and ate and smiled at one another, and I would not
      heed a man who was watching me from a table near by.

"And afterwards we went on to the dancing-hall. But I cannot describe that
      hall. The place was enormous, larger than any building you have ever seen—and
      in one place there was the old gate of Capri, caught into the wall of a
      gallery high overhead. Light girders, stems and threads of gold, burst
      from the pillars like fountains, streamed like an Aurora across the roof
      and interlaced, like—like conjuring tricks. All about the great
      circle for the dancers there were beautiful figures, strange dragons, and
      intricate and wonderful grotesques bearing lights. The place was inundated
      with artificial light that shamed the newborn day. And as we went through
      the throng the people turned about and looked at us, for all through the
      world my name and face were known, and how I had suddenly thrown up pride,
      and struggle to come to this place. And they looked also at the lady
      beside me, though half the story of how at last she had come to me was
      unknown or mistold. And few of the men who were there, I know, but judged
      me a happy man, in spite of all the shame and dishonour that had come upon
      my name.

"The air was full of music, full of harmonious scents, full of the rhythm
      of beautiful motions. Thousands of beautiful people swarmed about the
      hall, crowded the galleries, sat in a myriad recesses; they were dressed
      in splendid colours and crowned with flowers; thousands danced about the
      great circle beneath the white images of the ancient gods, and glorious
      processions of youths and maidens came and went. We two danced, not the
      dreary monotonies of your days—of this time, I mean—but dances
      that were beautiful, intoxicating. And even now I can see my lady dancing—dancing
      joyously. She danced, you know, with a serious face; she danced with a
      serious dignity, and yet she was smiling at me and caressing me—smiling
      and caressing with her eyes.

"The music was different," he murmured. "It went—I cannot describe
      it; but it was infinitely richer and more varied than any music that has
      ever come to me awake.

"And then—it was when we had done dancing—a man came to speak
      to me. He was a lean, resolute man, very soberly clad for that place, and
      already I had marked his face watching me in the breakfasting hall, and
      afterwards as we went along the passage I had avoided his eye. But now, as
      we sat in a little alcove smiling at the pleasure of all the people who
      went to and fro across the shining floor, he came and touched me, and
      spoke to me so that I was forced to listen. And he asked that he might
      speak to me for a little time apart.

"''Perhaps for me to hear,'' said I. — "He glanced at her, as though
      almost he would appeal to her. Then he asked me suddenly if I had heard
      of a great and avenging declaration that Gresham had made. Now, Gresham
      had always before been the man next to myself in the leadership of that
      great party in the north. He was a forcible, hard, and tactless man, and
      only I had been able to control and soften him. It was on his account even
      more than my own, I think, that the others had been so dismayed at my
      retreat. So this question about what he had done re-awakened my old
      interest in the life I had put aside just for a moment.

"And with that the man began, nothing loth, and I must confess ever; I was
      struck by Gresham''s reckless folly in the wild and threatening words he
      had used. And this messenger they had sent to me not only told me of
      Gresham''s speech, but went on to ask counsel and to point out what need
      they had of me. While he talked, my lady sat a little forward and watched
      his face and mine.

"My old habits of scheming and organising reasserted themselves. I could
      even see myself suddenly returning to the north, and all the dramatic
      effect of it. All that this man said witnessed to the disorder of the
      party indeed, but not to its damage. I should go back stronger than I had
      come. And then I thought of my lady. You see—how can I tell you?
      There were certain peculiarities of our relationship—as things are I
      need not tell about that—which would render her presence with me
      impossible. I should have had to leave her; indeed, I should have had to
      renounce her clearly and openly, if I was to do all that I could do in the
      north. And the man knew that, even as he talked to her and me, knew
      it as well as she did, that my steps to duty were—first, separation,
      then abandonment. At the touch of that thought my dream of a return was
      shattered. I turned on the man suddenly, as he was imagining his eloquence
      was gaining ground with me.

"''What have I to do with these things now?'' I said. ''I have done with
      them. Do you think I am coquetting with your people in coming here?''

"''Why cannot you leave me alone? I have done with these things. I have
      ceased to be anything but a private man.''

"''Yes,'' he answered. ''But have you thought?—this talk of war, these
      reckless challenges, these wild aggressions——''

"''No,'' I cried. ''I won''t hear you. I took count of all those things, I
      weighed them—and I have come away."

"He seemed to consider the possibility of persistence. He looked from me
      to where the lady sat regarding us.

"''War,'' he said, as if he were speaking to himself, and then turned slowly
      from me and walked away.

"She did not finish her sentence, she let it rest there. I turned to her
      sweet face, and the balance of my mood swayed and reeled.

"''They want me only to do the thing they dare not do themselves,'' I said.
      ''If they distrust Gresham they must settle with him themselves.''

"I saw a doubt on her face that I had seen before, a doubt of herself and
      me, the first shadow of the discovery that, seen strongly and completely,
      must drive us apart for ever.

"''My dear one,'' I said, ''you must not trouble over these things. There
      will be no war. Certainly there will be no war. The age of wars is past.
      Trust me to know the justice of this case. They have no right upon me,
      dearest, and no one has a right upon me. I have been free to choose my
      life, and I have chosen this.''

"I sat down beside her. I put an arm behind her and took her hand in mine.
      I set myself to drive that doubt away—I set myself to fill her mind
      with pleasant things again. I lied to her, and in lying to her I lied also
      to myself. And she was only too ready to believe me, only too ready to
      forget.

"Very soon the shadow had gone again, and we were hastening to our
      bathing-place in the Grotta del Bovo Marino, where it was our custom to
      bathe every day. We swam and splashed one another, and in that buoyant
      water I seemed to become something lighter and stronger than a man. And at
      last we came out dripping and rejoicing and raced among the rocks. And
      then I put on a dry bathing-dress, and we sat to bask in the sun, and
      presently I nodded, resting my head against her knee, and she put her hand
      upon my hair and stroked it softly and I dozed. And behold! as it were
      with the snapping of the string of a violin, I was awakening, and I was in
      my own bed in Liverpool, in the life of to-day.

"Only for a time I could not believe that all these vivid moments had been
      no more than the substance of a dream.

"In truth, I could not believe it a dream, for all the sobering reality of
      things about me. I bathed and dressed as it were by habit, and as I shaved
      I argued why I of all men should leave the woman I loved to go back to
      fantastic politics in the hard and strenuous north. Even if Gresham did
      force the world back to war, what was that to me? I was a man, with the
      heart of a man, and why should I feel the responsibility of a deity for
      the way the world might go?

"You know that is not quite the way I think about affairs, about my real
      affairs. I am a solicitor, you know, with a point of view.

"The vision was so real, you must understand, so utterly unlike a dream,
      that I kept perpetually recalling little irrelevant details; even the
      ornament of a bookcover that lay on my wife''s sewing-machine in the
      breakfast-room recalled with the utmost vividness the gilt line that ran
      about the seat in the alcove where I had talked with the messenger from my
      deserted party. Have you ever heard of a dream that had a quality like
      that?"

"No," he answered. "But that is just what I did. I am a solicitor, you
      must understand, in Liverpool, and I could not help wondering what the
      clients and business people I found myself talking to in my office would
      think if I told them suddenly I was in love with a girl who would be born
      a couple of hundred years or so hence, and worried about the politics of
      my great-great-great-grandchildren. I was chiefly busy that day
      negotiating a ninety-nine-year building lease. It was a private builder in
      a hurry, and we wanted to tie him in every possible way. I had an
      interview with him, and he showed a certain want of temper that sent me to
      bed still irritated. That night I had no dream. Nor did I dream the next
      night, at least, to remember.

"Something of that intense reality of conviction vanished. I began to feel
      sure it was a dream. And then it came again.

"When the dream came again, nearly four days later, it was very different.
      I think it certain that four days had also elapsed in the dream.
      Many things had happened in the north, and the shadow of them was back
      again between us, and this time it was not so easily dispelled. I began, I
      know, with moody musings. Why, in spite of all, should I go back, go back
      for all the rest of my days, to toil and stress, insults, and perpetual
      dissatisfaction, simply to save hundreds of millions of common people,
      whom I did not love, whom too often I could not do other than despise,
      from the stress and anguish of war and infinite misrule? And, after all, I
      might fail. They all sought their own narrow ends, and why should
      not I—why should not I also live as a man? And out of such thoughts
      her voice summoned me, and I lifted my eyes.

"I found myself awake and walking. We had come out above the Pleasure
      City, we were near the summit of Monte Solaro and looking towards the bay.
      It was the late afternoon and very clear. Far away to the left Ischia hung
      in a golden haze between sea and sky, and Naples was coldly white against
      the hills, and before us was Vesuvius with a tall and slender streamer
      feathering at last towards the south, and the ruins of Torre dell''
      Annunziata and Castellammare glittering and near."

"Only in this dream," he said, "only in this dream. All across the bay
      beyond Sorrento were the floating palaces of the Pleasure City moored and
      chained. And northward were the broad floating stages that received the
      aeroplanes. Aeroplanes fell out of the sky every afternoon, each bringing
      its thousands of pleasure-seekers from the uttermost parts of the earth to
      Capri and its delights. All these things, I say, stretched below.

"But we noticed them only incidentally because of an unusual sight that
      evening had to show. Five war aeroplanes that had long slumbered useless
      in the distant arsenals of the Rhine-mouth were manoeuvring now in the
      eastward sky. Gresham had astonished the world by producing them and
      others, and sending them to circle here and there. It was the threat
      material in the great game of bluff he was playing, and it had taken even
      me by surprise. He was one of those incredibly stupid energetic people who
      seem sent by heaven to create disasters. His energy to the first glance
      seemed so wonderfully like capacity! But he had no imagination, no
      invention, only a stupid, vast, driving force of will, and a mad faith in
      his stupid idiot ''luck'' to pull him through. I remember how we stood out
      upon the headland watching the squadron circling far away, and how I
      weighed the full meaning of the sight, seeing clearly the way things must
      go. And then even it was not too late. I might have gone back, I
      think, and saved the world. The people of the north would follow me, I
      knew, granted only that in one thing I respected their moral standards.
      The east and south would trust me as they would trust no other northern
      man. And I knew I had only to put it to her and she would have let me
      go... Not because she did not love me!

"Only I did not want to go; my will was all the other way about. I had so
      newly thrown off the incubus of responsibility: I was still so fresh a
      renegade from duty that the daylight clearness of what I ought to
      do had no power at all to touch my will. My will was to live, to gather
      pleasures, and make my dear lady happy. But though this sense of vast
      neglected duties had no power to draw me, it could make me silent and
      preoccupied, it robbed the days I had spent of half their brightness and
      roused me into dark meditations in the silence of the night. And as I
      stood and watched Gresham''s aeroplanes sweep to and fro—those birds
      of infinite ill omen—she stood beside me, watching me, perceiving
      the trouble indeed, but not perceiving it clearly—her eyes
      questioning my face, her expression shaded with perplexity. Her face was
      grey because the sunset was fading out of the sky. It was no fault of hers
      that she held me. She had asked me to go from her, and again in the
      night-time and with tears she had asked me to go.

"At last it was the sense of her that roused me from my mood. I turned
      upon her suddenly and challenged her to race down the mountain slopes.
      ''No,'' she said, as if I jarred with her gravity, but I was resolved to end
      that gravity and made her run—no one can be very grey and sad who is
      out of breath—-and when she stumbled I ran with my hand beneath her
      arm. We ran down past a couple of men, who turned back staring in
      astonishment at my behaviour—they must have recognised my face. And
      half-way down the slope came a tumult in the air—clang-clank,
      clang-clank—and we stopped, and presently over the hill-crest those
      war things came flying one behind the other."

"They had never fought," he said. "They were just like our ironclads are
      nowadays; they had never fought. No one knew what they might do, with
      excited men inside them; few even cared to speculate. They were great
      driving things shaped like spear-heads without a shaft, with a propeller
      in the place of the shaft."

"No, no, nothing of that sort. An alloy that was very common—as
      common as brass, for example. It was called—let me see—" He
      squeezed his forehead with the fingers of one hand. "I am forgetting
      everything," he said.

"Little guns, firing high explosive shells. They fired the guns backwards,
      out of the base of the leaf, so to speak, and rammed with the beak. That
      was the theory, you know, but they had never been fought. No one could
      tell exactly what was going to happen. And meanwhile I suppose it was very
      fine to go whirling through the air like a flight of young swallows, swift
      and easy. I guess the captains tried not to think too clearly what the
      real thing would be like. And these flying war machines, you know, were
      only one sort of the endless war contrivances that had been invented and
      had fallen into abeyance during the long peace. There were all sorts of
      these things that people were routing out and furbishing up; infernal
      things, silly things; things that had never been tried; big engines,
      terrible explosives, great guns. You know the silly way of these ingenious
      sort of men who make these things; they turn ''em out as beavers build
      dams, and with no more sense of the rivers they''re going to divert and the
      lands they''re going to flood!

"As we went down the winding stepway to our hotel again in the twilight I
      foresaw it all: I saw how clearly and inevitably things were driving for
      war in Gresham''s silly, violent hands, and I had some inkling of what war
      was bound to be under these new conditions. And even then, though I knew
      it was drawing near the limit of my opportunity, I could find no will to
      go back."

"We did not go into the city until the sky was full of stars, so we walked
      out upon the high terrace, to and fro, and—she counselled me to go
      back.

"''My dearest,'' she said, and her sweet face looked up to me, ''this is
      Death. This life you lead is Death. Go back to them, go back to your duty—''

"She began to weep, saying between her sobs, and clinging to my arm as she
      said it, ''Go back—go back.''

"Then suddenly she fell mute, and glancing down at her face, I read in an
      instant the thing she had thought to do. It was one of those moments when
      one sees.

"''Nothing,'' I said, ''shall send me back. Nothing! I have chosen. Love, I
      have chosen, and the world must go. Whatever happens, I will live this
      life—I will live for you! It—nothing shall turn me
      aside; nothing, my dear one. Even if you died—even if you died—''

"And before she could speak again I began to talk, talking eloquently—as
      I could do in that life—talking to exalt love, to make the
      life we were living seem heroic and glorious; and the thing I was
      deserting something hard and enormously ignoble that it was a fine thing
      to set aside. I bent all my mind to throw that glamour upon it, seeking
      not only to convert her but myself to that. We talked, and she clung to
      me, torn too between all that she deemed noble and all that she knew was
      sweet. And at last I did make it heroic, made all the thickening disaster
      of the world only a sort of glorious setting to our unparalleled love, and
      we two poor foolish souls strutted there at last, clad in that splendid
      delusion, drunken rather with that glorious delusion, under the still
      stars.

"It was my last chance. Even as we went to and fro there, the leaders of
      the south and east were gathering their resolve, and the hot answer that
      shattered Gresham''s bluffing for ever took shape and waited. And all over
      Asia, and the ocean, and the south, the air and the wires were throbbing
      with their warnings to prepare—prepare.

"No one living, you know, knew what war was; no one could imagine, with
      all these new inventions, what horror war might bring. I believe most
      people still believed it would be a matter of bright uniforms and shouting
      charges and triumphs and flags and bands—in a time when half the
      world drew its food-supply from regions ten thousand miles away——"

The man with the white face paused. I glanced at him, and his face was
      intent on the floor of the carriage. A little railway station, a string of
      loaded trucks, a signal-box, and the back of a cottage shot by the
      carriage window, and a bridge passed with a clap of noise, echoing the
      tumult of the train.

"After that," he said, "I dreamt often. For three weeks of nights that
      dream was my life. And the worst of it was there were nights when I could
      not dream, when I lay tossing on a bed in this accursed life; and
      there—somewhere lost to me—things were happening—momentous,
      terrible things... I lived at nights—my days, my waking days, this
      life I am living now, became a faded, far-away dream, a drab setting, the
      cover of the book."

"I could tell you all, tell you every little thing in the dream, but as to
      what I did in the daytime—no. I could not tell—I do not
      remember. My memory—my memory has gone. The business of life slips
      from me—"

"One touch of unreality," he said, in the low tone of a man who speaks to
      himself, "and they would have been nightmares. But they were not
      nightmares—they were not nightmares. No!"

He was silent for so long that it dawned upon me that there was a danger
      of losing the rest of the story. But he went on talking again in the same
      tone of questioning self-communion.

"What was there to do but flight? I had not thought the war would touch
      Capri—I had seemed to see Capri as being out of it all, as the
      contrast to it all; but two nights after the whole place was shouting and
      bawling, every woman almost and every other man wore a badge—Gresham''s
      badge—and there was no music but a jangling war-song over and over
      again, and everywhere men enlisting, and in the dancing halls they were
      drilling. The whole island was a-whirl with rumours; it was said again and
      again, that fighting had begun. I had not expected this. I had seen so
      little of the life of pleasure that I had failed to reckon with this
      violence of the amateurs. And as for me, I was out of it. I was like a man
      who might have prevented the firing of a magazine. The time had gone. I
      was no one; the vainest stripling with a badge counted for more than I.
      The crowd jostled us and bawled in our ears; that accursed song deafened
      us; a woman shrieked at my lady because no badge was on her, and we two
      went back to our own place again, ruffled and insulted—my lady white
      and silent, and I a-quiver with rage. So furious was I, I could have
      quarrelled with her if I could have found one shade of accusation in her
      eyes.

"All my magnificence had gone from me. I walked up and down our rock cell,
      and outside was the darkling sea and a light to the southward that flared
      and passed and came again.

"''We must get out of this place,'' I said over and over. ''I have made my
      choice, and I will have no hand in these troubles. I will have nothing of
      this war. We have taken our lives out of all these things. This is no
      refuge for us. Let us go.''

I questioned him no more. Presently I thought he was beginning again. He
      broke out in an argumentative monotone:

"But why should it be? If, indeed, this battle, this slaughter and stress,
      is life, why have we this craving for pleasure and beauty? If there
      is no refuge, if there is no place of peace, and if all our dreams
      of quiet places are a folly and a snare, why have we such dreams? Surely
      it was no ignoble cravings, no base intentions, had brought us to this; it
      was love had isolated us. Love had come to me with her eyes and robed in
      her beauty, more glorious than all else in life, in the very shape and
      colour of life, and summoned me away. I had silenced all the voices, I had
      answered all the questions—I had come to her. And suddenly there was
      nothing but War and Death!"

For the first time he became animated. A faint flush crept into his cheek.
      He raised his open hand and clenched it, and dropped it to his knee. He
      spoke, looking away from me, and for all the rest of the time he looked
      away. "We are but phantoms," he said, "and the phantoms of phantoms,
      desires like cloud shadows and wills of straw that eddy in the wind; the
      days pass, use and wont carry us through as a train carries the shadow of
      its lights—so be it? But one thing is real and certain, one thing is
      no dream stuff, but eternal and enduring. It is the centre of my life, and
      all other things about it are subordinate or altogether vain. I loved her,
      that woman of a dream. And she and I are dead together!

"A dream! How can it be a dream, when it drenched a living life with
      unappeasable sorrow, when it makes all that I have lived for and cared for
      worthless and unmeaning?

"Until that very moment when she was killed I believed we had still a
      chance of getting away," he said. "All through the night and morning that
      we sailed across the sea from Capri to Salerno we talked of escape. We
      were full of hope, and it clung about us to the end, hope for the life
      together we should lead, out of it all, out of the battle and struggle,
      the wild and empty passions, the empty, arbitrary ''thou shalt'' and ''thou
      shalt not'' of the world. We were uplifted, as though our quest was a holy
      thing, as though love for one another was a mission...

"Even when from our boat we saw the fair face of that great rock Capri—
      already scarred and gashed by the gun emplacements and hiding-places that
      were to make it a fastness—we reckoned nothing of the imminent
      slaughter, though the fury of preparation hung about in puffs and clouds
      of dust at a hundred points amidst the grey; but, indeed, I made a text of
      that and talked. There, you know, was the rock, still beautiful for all
      its scars, with its countless windows and arches and ways, tier upon tier,
      for a thousand feet, a vast carving of grey, broken by vine-clad terraces,
      and lemon and orange groves, and masses of agave and prickly pear, and
      puffs of almond blossom. And out under the archway that is built over the
      Piccola Marina other boats were coming; and as we came round the cape and
      within sight of the mainland, another little string of boats came into
      view, driving before the wind towards the south-west. In a little while a
      multitude had come out, the remoter just little specks of ultramarine in
      the shadow of the eastward cliff.

"And though we presently saw a squadron of aeroplanes flying across the
      southern sky we did not heed it. There it was—a line of little dots
      in the sky—and then more, dotting the south-eastern horizon, and
      then still more, until all that quarter of the sky was stippled with blue
      specks. Now they were all thin little strokes of blue, and now one and now
      a multitude would heel and catch the sun and become short flashes of
      light. They came, rising and falling and growing larger, like some huge
      flight of gulls or rooks or such-like birds, moving with a marvellous
      uniformity, and ever as they drew nearer they spread over a greater width
      of sky. The southward wing flung itself in an arrow-headed cloud athwart
      the sun. And then suddenly they swept round to the eastward and streamed
      eastward, growing smaller and smaller and clearer and clearer again until
      they vanished from the sky. And after that we noted to the northward, and
      very high, Gresham''s fighting machines hanging high over Naples like an
      evening swarm of gnats.

"Each day, each dream after that, we were still exalted, still seeking
      that refuge where we might live and love. Fatigue had come upon us, pain
      and many distresses. For though we were dusty and stained by our toilsome
      tramping, and half starved, and with the horror of the dead men we had
      seen and the flight of the peasants—for very soon a gust of fighting
      swept up the peninsula—with these things haunting our minds it still
      resulted only in a deepening resolution to escape. Oh, but she was brave
      and patient! She who had never faced hardship and exposure had courage for
      herself—and me. We went to and fro seeking an outlet, over a country
      all commandeered and ransacked by the gathering hosts of war. Always we
      went on foot. At first there were other fugitives, but we did not mingle
      with them. Some escaped northward, some were caught in the torrent of
      peasantry that swept along the main roads; many gave themselves into the
      hands of the soldiery and were sent northward. Many of the men were
      impressed. But we kept away from these things; we had brought no money to
      bribe a passage north, and I feared for my lady at the hands of these
      conscript crowds. We had landed at Salerno, and we had been turned back
      from Cava, and we had tried to cross towards Taranto by a pass over Mount
      Alburno, but we had been driven back for want of food, and so we had come
      down among the marshes by Paestum, where those great temples stand alone.
      I had some vague idea that by Paestum it might be possible to find a boat
      or something, and take once more to sea. And there it was the battle
      overtook us.

"A sort of soul-blindness had me. Plainly I could see that we were being
      hemmed in; that the great net of that giant Warfare had us in its toils.
      Many times we had seen the levies that had come down from the north going
      to and fro, and had come upon them in the distance amidst the mountains
      making ways for the ammunition and preparing the mounting of the guns.
      Once we fancied they had fired at us, taking us for spies—at any
      rate a shot had gone shuddering over us. Several times we had hidden in
      woods from hovering aeroplanes.

"But all these things do not matter now, these nights of flight and
      pain... We were in an open place near those great temples at Paestum, at
      last, on a blank stony place dotted with spiky bushes, empty and desolate
      and so flat that a grove of eucalyptus far away showed to the feet of its
      stems. How I can see it! My lady was sitting down under a bush resting a
      little, for she was very weak and weary, and I was standing up watching to
      see if I could tell the distance of the firing that came and went. They
      were still, you know, fighting far from each other, with these terrible
      new weapons that had never before been used: guns that would carry beyond
      sight, and aeroplanes that would do——What they would do
      no man could foretell.

"I knew that we were between the two armies, and that they drew together.
      I knew we were in danger, and that we could not stop there and rest!

"Though all those things were in my mind, they were in the background.
      They seemed to be affairs beyond our concern. Chiefly, I was thinking of
      my lady. An aching distress filled me. For the first time she had owned
      herself beaten and had fallen a-weeping. Behind me I could hear her
      sobbing, but I would not turn round to her because I knew she had need of
      weeping, and had held herself so far and so long for me. It was well, I
      thought, that she would weep and rest, and then we would toil on again,
      for I had no inkling of the thing that hung so near. Even now I can see
      her as she sat there, her lovely hair upon her shoulder, can mark again
      the deepening hollow of her cheek.

"''No,'' said I. ''Even now I do not repent. I will not repent; I made my
      choice, and I will hold on to the end.''

"Overhead in the sky flashed something and burst, and all about us I heard
      the bullets making a noise like a handful of peas suddenly thrown. They
      chipped the stones about us, and whirled fragments from the bricks and
      passed..."

He stopped and stared at me. I felt all that foolish incapacity an
      Englishman feels on such occasions. I met his eyes for a moment, and then
      stared out of the window. For a long space we kept silence. When at last I
      looked at him he was sitting back in his corner, his arms folded and his
      teeth gnawing at his knuckles.

"I carried her," he said, "towards the temples, in my arms—as though
      it mattered. I don''t know why. They seemed a sort of sanctuary, you know,
      they had lasted so long, I suppose.

"I have seen those temples," I said abruptly, and indeed he had brought
      those still, sunlit arcades of worn sandstone very vividly before me.

"It was the brown one, the big brown one. I sat down on a fallen pillar
      and held her in my arms... Silent after the first babble was over. And
      after a little while the lizards came out and ran about again, as though
      nothing unusual was going on, as though nothing had changed... It was
      tremendously still there, the sun high and the shadows still; even the
      shadows of the weeds upon the entablature were still—in spite of the
      thudding and banging that went all about the sky.

"I seem to remember that the aeroplanes came up out of the south, and that
      the battle went away to the west. One aeroplane was struck, and overset
      and fell. I remember that—though it didn''t interest me in the least.
      It didn''t seem to signify. It was like a wounded gull, you know—flapping
      for a time in the water. I could see it down the aisle of the temple—a
      black thing in the bright blue water.

"Three or four times shells burst about the beach, and then that ceased.
      Each time that happened all the lizards scuttled in and hid for a space.
      That was all the mischief done, except that once a stray bullet gashed the
      stone hard by—made just a fresh bright surface.

"The curious thing," he remarked, with the manner of a man who makes a
      trivial conversation, "is that I didn''t think—I didn''t think
      at all. I sat with her in my arms amidst the stones—in a sort of
      lethargy— stagnant.

"And I don''t remember waking up. I don''t remember dressing that day. I
      know I found myself in my office, with my letters all slit open in front
      of me, and how I was struck by the absurdity of being there, seeing that
      in reality I was sitting, stunned, in that Paestum Temple with a dead
      woman in my arms. I read my letters like a machine. I have forgotten what
      they were about."

Suddenly I perceived that we were running down the incline from Chalk Farm
      to Euston. I started at this passing of time. I turned on him with a
      brutal question with the tone of "Now or never."

"Once more, and as it were only for a few instants. I seemed to have
      suddenly awakened out of a great apathy, to have risen into a sitting
      position, and the body lay there on the stones beside me. A gaunt body.
      Not her, you know. So soon—it was not her...

"I may have heard voices. I do not know. Only I knew clearly that men were
      coming into the solitude and that that was a last outrage.

"I stood up and walked through the temple, and then there came into sight—first
      one man with a yellow face, dressed in a uniform of dirty white, trimmed
      with blue, and then several, climbing to the crest of the old wall of the
      vanished city, and crouching there. They were little bright figures in the
      sunlight, and there they hung, weapon in hand, peering cautiously before
      them.

"And further away I saw others, and then more at another point in the
      wall. It was a long lax line of men in open order.

"Presently the man I had first seen stood up and shouted a command, and
      his men came tumbling down the wall and into the high weeds towards the
      temple. He scrambled down with them and led them. He came facing towards
      me, and when he saw me he stopped.

"At first I had watched these men with a mere curiosity, but when I had
      seen they meant to come to the temple I was moved to forbid them. I
      shouted to the officer.

"He shouted again, and I folded my arms and stood still. Presently he
      spoke to his men and came forward. He carried a drawn sword.

"I signed to him to keep away, but he continued to advance. I told him
      again very patiently and clearly: ''You must not come here. These are old
      temples, and I am here with my dead.''

"Presently he was so close I could see his face clearly. It was a narrow
      face, with dull grey eyes, and a black moustache. He had a scar on his
      upper lip, and he was dirty and unshaven. He kept shouting unintelligible
      things, questions perhaps, at me.

"I know now that he was afraid of me, but at the time that did not occur
      to me. As I tried to explain to him he interrupted me in imperious tones,
      bidding me, I suppose, stand aside.

"I saw a sort of exultant resolve leap into them—delight. Then
      suddenly, with a scowl, he swept his sword back—so—and
      thrust."

I became aware of a change in the rhythm of the train. The brakes lifted
      their voices and the carriage jarred and jerked. This present world
      insisted upon itself, became clamorous. I saw through the steamy window
      huge electric lights glaring down from tall masts upon a fog, saw rows of
      stationary empty carriages passing by, and then a signal-box, hoisting its
      constellation of green and red into the murky London twilight, marched
      after them. I looked again at his drawn features.

"He ran me through the heart. It was with a sort of astonishment—no
      fear, no pain—but just amazement, that I felt it pierce me, felt the
      sword drive home into my body. It didn''t hurt, you know. It didn''t hurt at
      all."

The yellow platform lights came into the field of view, passing first
      rapidly, then slowly, and at last stopping with a jerk. Dim shapes of men
      passed to and fro without.

"There was no pain, no sting or smart. Amazement and then darkness
      sweeping over everything. The hot, brutal face before me, the face of the
      man who had killed me, seemed to recede. It swept out of existence—"

The carriage door opened, admitting a flood of sound, and a porter stood
      regarding us. The sounds of doors slamming, and the hoof-clatter of
      cab-horses, and behind these things the featureless remote roar of the
      London cobble-stones, came to my ears. A truck-load of lighted lamps
      blazed along the platform.

Towards mid-day the three pursuers came abruptly round a bend in the
      torrent bed upon the sight of a very broad and spacious valley. The
      difficult and winding trench of pebbles along which they had tracked the
      fugitives for so long expanded to a broad slope, and with a common impulse
      the three men left the trail, and rode to a little eminence set with
      olive-dun trees, and there halted, the two others, as became them, a
      little behind the man with the silver-studded bridle.

For a space they scanned the great expanse below them with eager eyes. It
      spread remoter and remoter, with only a few clusters of sere thorn bushes
      here and there, and the dim suggestions of some now waterless ravine to
      break its desolation of yellow grass. Its purple distances melted at last
      into the bluish slopes of the further hills—hills it might be of a
      greener kind—and above them, invisibly supported, and seeming indeed
      to hang in the blue, were the snow-clad summits of mountains—that
      grew larger and bolder to the northwestward as the sides of the valley
      drew together. And westward the valley opened until a distant darkness
      under the sky told where the forests began. But the three men looked
      neither east nor west, but only steadfastly across the valley.

The gaunt man with the scarred lip was the first to speak. "Nowhere," he
      said, with a sigh of disappointment in his voice. "But, after all, they
      had a full day''s start."

"Even then they can''t go fast. They''ve got no beast but the mule, and all
      to-day the girl''s foot has been bleeding——"

The man with the silver bridle flashed a quick intensity of rage on him.
      "Do you think I haven''t seen that?" he snarled.

The gaunt man with the scarred lip stared impassively. "They can''t be over
      the valley," he said. "If we ride hard——"

"Curse all white horses!" said the man with the silver bridle, and turned
      to scan the beast his curse included.

The two others stared again across the valley for a space. The gaunt man
      passed the back of his hand across the scarred lip.

"Come up!" said the man who owned the silver bridle, suddenly. The little
      man started and jerked his rein, and the horse hoofs of the three made a
      multitudinous faint pattering upon the withered grass as they turned back
      towards the trail...

They rode cautiously down the long slope before them, and so came through
      a waste of prickly twisted bushes and strange dry shapes of thorny
      branches that grew amongst the rocks, into the levels below. And there the
      trail grew faint, for the soil was scanty, and the only herbage was this
      scorched dead straw that lay upon the ground. Still, by hard scanning, by
      leaning beside the horses'' necks and pausing ever and again, even these
      white men could contrive to follow after their prey.

There were trodden places, bent and broken blades of the coarse grass, and
      ever and again the sufficient intimation of a footmark. And once the
      leader saw a brown smear of blood where the half-caste girl may have trod.
      And at that under his breath he cursed her for a fool.

The gaunt man checked his leader''s tracking, and the little man on the
      white horse rode behind, a man lost in a dream. They rode one after
      another, the man with the silver bridle led the way, and they spoke never
      a word. After a time it came to the little man on the white horse that the
      world was very still. He started out of his dream. Besides the little
      noises of their horses and equipment, the whole great valley kept the
      brooding quiet of a painted scene.

Before him went his master and his fellow, each intently leaning forward
      to the left, each impassively moving with the paces of his horse; their
      shadows went before them—still, noiseless, tapering attendants; and
      nearer a crouched cool shape was his own. He looked about him. What was it
      had gone? Then he remembered the reverberation from the banks of the gorge
      and the perpetual accompaniment of shifting, jostling pebbles. And,
      moreover——? There was no breeze. That was it! What a vast,
      still place it was, a monotonous afternoon slumber! And the sky open and
      blank except for a sombre veil of haze that had gathered in the upper
      valley.

He straightened his back, fretted with his bridle, puckered his lips to
      whistle, and simply sighed. He turned in his saddle for a time, and stared
      at the throat of the mountain gorge out of which they had come. Blank!
      Blank slopes on either side, with never a sign of a decent beast or tree—
      much less a man. What a land it was! What a wilderness! He dropped again
      into his former pose.

It filled him with a momentary pleasure to see a wry stick of purple black
      flash out into the form of a snake, and vanish amidst the brown. After
      all, the infernal valley was alive. And then, to rejoice him still
      more, came a little breath across his face, a whisper that came and went,
      the faintest inclination of a stiff black-antlered bush upon a little
      crest, the first intimations of a possible breeze. Idly he wetted his
      finger, and held it up.

He pulled up sharply to avoid a collision with the gaunt man, who had
      stopped at fault upon the trail. Just at that guilty moment he caught his
      master''s eye looking towards him.

For a time he forced an interest in the tracking. Then, as they rode on
      again, he studied his master''s shadow and hat and shoulder, appearing and
      disappearing behind the gaunt man''s nearer contours. They had ridden four
      days out of the very limits of the world into this desolate place, short
      of water, with nothing but a strip of dried meat under their saddles, over
      rocks and mountains, where surely none but these fugitives had ever been
      before—for that!

And all this was for a girl, a mere wilful child! And the man had whole
      cityfuls of people to do his basest bidding—girls, women! Why in the
      name of passionate folly this one in particular? asked the little
      man, and scowled at the world, and licked his parched lips with a
      blackened tongue. It was the way of the master, and that was all he knew.
      Just because she sought to evade him...

His eye caught a whole row of high-plumed canes bending in unison, and
      then the tails of silk that hung before his neck flapped and fell. The
      breeze was growing stronger. Somehow it took the stiff stillness out of
      things—and that was well.

And as he spoke a yellow animal crested a rise and came bearing down upon
      them. It was a big wild dog, coming before the wind, tongue out, at a
      steady pace, and running with such an intensity of purpose that he did not
      seem to see the horsemen he approached. He ran with his nose up,
      following, it was plain, neither scent nor quarry. As he drew nearer the
      little man felt for his sword. "He''s mad," said the gaunt rider.

The dog came on. Then when the little man''s blade was already out, it
      swerved aside and went panting by them and passed. The eyes of the little
      man followed its flight. "There was no foam," he said. For a space the man
      with the silver-studded bridle stared up the valley. "Oh, come on!" he
      cried at last. "What does it matter?" and jerked his horse into movement
      again.

The little man left the insoluble mystery of a dog that fled from nothing
      but the wind, and lapsed into profound musings on human character. "Come
      on!" he whispered to himself. "Why should it be given to one man to say
      ''Come on!'' with that stupendous violence of effect? Always, all his life,
      the man with the silver bridle has been saying that. If I said it—!"
      thought the little man. But people marvelled when the master was disobeyed
      even in the wildest things. This half-caste girl seemed to him, seemed to
      every one, mad—blasphemous almost. The little man, by way of
      comparison, reflected on the gaunt rider with the scarred lip, as stalwart
      as his master, as brave and, indeed, perhaps braver, and yet for him there
      was obedience, nothing but to give obedience duly and stoutly...

Certain sensations of the hands and knees called the little man back to
      more immediate things. He became aware of something. He rode up beside his
      gaunt fellow. "Do you notice the horses?" he said in an undertone.

"They don''t like this wind," said the little man, and dropped behind as
      the man with the silver bridle turned upon him.

They rode on again for a space in silence. The foremost two rode downcast
      upon the trail, the hindmost man watched the haze that crept down the
      vastness of the valley, nearer and nearer, and noted how the wind grew in
      strength moment by moment. Far away on the left he saw a line of dark
      bulks—wild hog, perhaps, galloping down the valley, but of that he
      said nothing, nor did he remark again upon the uneasiness of the horses.

And then he saw first one and then a second great white ball, a great
      shining white ball like a gigantic head of thistledown, that drove before
      the wind athwart the path. These balls soared high in the air, and dropped
      and rose again and caught for a moment, and hurried on and passed, but at
      the sight of them the restlessness of the horses increased.

Then presently he saw that more of these drifting globes—and then
      soon very many more—were hurrying towards him down the valley.

They became aware of a squealing. Athwart the path a huge boar rushed,
      turning his head but for one instant to glance at them, and then hurling
      on down the valley again. And at that all three stopped and sat in their
      saddles, staring into the thickening haze that was coming upon them.

But now a big globe came drifting past within a score of yards of them. It
      was really not an even sphere at all, but a vast, soft, ragged, filmy
      thing, a sheet gathered by the corners, an aerial jelly-fish, as it were,
      but rolling over and over as it advanced, and trailing long cobwebby
      threads and streamers that floated in its wake.

"Curse it!" cried the leader. "The air''s full of lit up there. If it keeps
      on at this pace long, it will stop us altogether."

An instinctive feeling, such as lines out a herd of deer at the approach
      of some ambiguous thing, prompted them to turn their horses to the wind,
      ride forward for a few paces, and stare at that advancing multitude of
      floating masses. They came on before the wind with a sort of smooth
      swiftness, rising and falling noiselessly, sinking to earth, rebounding
      high, soaring—all with a perfect unanimity, with a still, deliberate
      assurance.

Right and left of the horsemen the pioneers of this strange army passed.
      At one that rolled along the ground, breaking shapelessly and trailing out
      reluctantly into long grappling ribbons and bands, all three horses began
      to shy and dance. The master was seized with a sudden, unreasonable
      impatience. He cursed the drifting globes roundly. "Get on!" he cried;
      "get on! What do these things matter? How can they matter? Back to
      the trail!" He fell swearing at his horse and sawed the bit across its
      mouth.

He shouted aloud with rage. "I will follow that trail, I tell you," he
      cried. "Where is the trail?"

He gripped the bridle of his prancing horse and searched amidst the grass.
      A long and clinging thread fell across his face, a grey streamer dropped
      about his bridle arm, some big, active thing with many legs ran down the
      back of his head. He looked up to discover one of those grey masses
      anchored as it were above him by these things and flapping out ends as a
      sail flaps when a boat comes about—but noiselessly.

He had an impression of many eyes, of a dense crew of squat bodies, of
      long, many-jointed limbs hauling at their mooring ropes to bring the thing
      down upon him. For a space he stared up, reining in his prancing horse
      with the instinct born of years of horsemanship. Then the flat of a sword
      smote his back, and a blade flashed overhead and cut the drifting balloon
      of spider-web free, and the whole mass lifted softly and drove clear and
      away.

"Spiders!" cried the voice of the gaunt man. "The things are full of big
      spiders! Look, my lord!"

The master found himself staring down at a red smashed thing on the ground
      that, in spite of partial obliteration, could still wriggle unavailing
      legs. Then, when the gaunt man pointed to another mass that bore down upon
      them, he drew his sword hastily. Up the valley now it was like a fog bank
      torn to rags. He tried to grasp the situation.

What happened then was like the confusion of a battle. The man with the
      silver bridle saw the little man go past him, slashing furiously at
      imaginary cobwebs, saw him cannon into the horse of the gaunt man and hurl
      it and its rider to earth. His own horse went a dozen paces before he
      could rein it in. Then he looked up to avoid imaginary dangers, and then
      back again to see a horse rolling on the ground, the gaunt man standing
      and slashing over it at a rent and fluttering mass of grey that streamed
      and wrapped about them both. And thick and fast as thistle-down on waste
      land on a windy day in July the cobweb masses were coming on.

The little man had dismounted, but he dared not release his horse. He was
      endeavouring to lug the struggling brute back with the strength of one
      arm, while with the other he slashed aimlessly. The tentacles of a second
      grey mass had entangled themselves with the struggle, and this second grey
      mass came to its moorings, and slowly sank.

The master set his teeth, gripped his bridle, lowered his head, and
      spurred his horse forward. The horse on the ground rolled over, there was
      blood and moving shapes upon the flanks, and the gaunt man suddenly
      leaving it, ran forward towards his master, perhaps ten paces. His legs
      were swathed and encumbered with grey; he made ineffectual movements with
      his sword. Grey streamers waved from him; there was a thin veil of grey
      across his face. With his left hand he beat at something on his body, and
      suddenly he stumbled and fell. He struggled to rise, and fell again, and
      suddenly, horribly, began to howl, "Oh—ohoo, ohooh!"

As he strove to force his horse nearer to this gesticulating, screaming
      grey object that struggled up and down, there came a clatter of hoofs, and
      the little man, in act of mounting, swordless, balanced on his belly
      athwart the white horse, and clutching its mane, whirled past. And again a
      clinging thread of grey gossamer swept across the master''s face. All about
      him, and over him, it seemed this drifting, noiseless cobweb circled and
      drew nearer him...

To the day of his death he never knew just how the event of that moment
      happened. Did he, indeed, turn his horse, or did it really of its own
      accord stampede after its fellow? Suffice it that in another second he was
      galloping full tilt down the valley with his sword whirling furiously
      overhead. And all about him on the quickening breeze, the spiders''
      air-ships, their air bundles and air sheets, seemed to him to hurry in a
      conscious pursuit.

Clatter, clatter, thud, thud,—the man with the silver bridle rode,
      heedless of his direction, with his fearful face looking up now right, now
      left, and his sword arm ready to slash. And a few hundred yards ahead of
      him, with a tail of torn cobweb trailing behind him, rode the little man
      on the white horse, still but imperfectly in the saddle. The reeds bent
      before them, the wind blew fresh and strong, over his shoulder the master
      could see the webs hurrying to overtake...

He was so intent to escape the spiders'' webs that only as his horse
      gathered together for a leap did he realise the ravine ahead. And then he
      realised it only to misunderstand and interfere. He was leaning forward on
      his horse''s neck and sat up and back all too late.

But if in his excitement he had failed to leap, at any rate he had not
      forgotten how to fall. He was horseman again in mid-air. He came off clear
      with a mere bruise upon his shoulder, and his horse rolled, kicking
      spasmodic legs, and lay still. But the master''s sword drove its point into
      the hard soil, and snapped clean across, as though Chance refused him any
      longer as her Knight, and the splintered end missed his face by an inch or
      so.

He was on his feet in a moment, breathlessly scanning the on-rushing
      spider-webs. For a moment he was minded to run, and then thought of the
      ravine, and turned back. He ran aside once to dodge one drifting terror,
      and then he was swiftly clambering down the precipitous sides, and out of
      the touch of the gale.

There, under the lee of the dry torrent''s steeper banks, he might crouch
      and watch these strange, grey masses pass and pass in safety till the wind
      fell, and it became possible to escape. And there for a long time he
      crouched, watching the strange, grey, ragged masses trail their streamers
      across his narrowed sky.

Once a stray spider fell into the ravine close beside him—a full
      foot it measured from leg to leg and its body was half a man''s hand—and
      after he had watched its monstrous alacrity of search and escape for a
      little while and tempted it to bite his broken sword, he lifted up his
      iron-heeled boot and smashed it into a pulp. He swore as he did so, and
      for a time sought up and down for another.

Then presently, when he was surer these spider swarms could not drop into
      the ravine, he found a place where he could sit down, and sat and fell
      into deep thought and began, after his manner, to gnaw his knuckles and
      bite his nails. And from this he was moved by the coming of the man with
      the white horse.

He heard him long before he saw him, as a clattering of hoofs, stumbling
      footsteps, and a reassuring voice. Then the little man appeared, a rueful
      figure, still with a tail of white cobweb trailing behind him. They
      approached each other without speaking, without a salutation. The little
      man was fatigued and shamed to the pitch of hopeless bitterness, and came
      to a stop at last, face to face with his seated master. The latter winced
      a little under his dependent''s eye. "Well?" he said at last, with no
      pretence of authority.

"A coward possibly. There is a limit beyond which every man must fear.
      That I have learnt at last. But not like yourself. That is where the
      difference comes in."

"I never could have dreamt you would have left him. He saved your life two
      minutes before... Why are you our lord?"

"No man calls me a coward," he said. "No ... A broken sword is better than
      none ... One spavined white horse cannot be expected to carry two men a
      four days'' journey. I hate white horses, but this time it cannot be
      helped. You begin to understand me? I perceive that you are minded, on the
      strength of what you have seen and fancy, to taint my reputation. It is
      men of your sort who unmake kings. Besides which—I never liked you."

He stood up sharply as the little man moved. For a minute perhaps they
      faced one another. Overhead the spiders'' balls went driving. There was a
      quick movement among the pebbles; a running of feet, a cry of despair, a
      gasp and a blow...

Towards nightfall the wind fell. The sun set in a calm serenity, and the
      man who had once possessed the silver bridle came at last very cautiously
      and by an easy slope out of the ravine again; but now he led the white
      horse that once belonged to the little man. He would have gone back to his
      horse to get his silver-mounted bridle again, but he feared night and a
      quickening breeze might still find him in the valley, and besides, he
      disliked greatly to think he might discover his horse all swathed in
      cobwebs and perhaps unpleasantly eaten.

And as he thought of those cobwebs, and of all the dangers he had been
      through, and the manner in which he had been preserved that day, his hand
      sought a little reliquary that hung about his neck, and he clasped it for
      a moment with heartfelt gratitude. As he did so his eyes went across the
      valley.

And behold! far away out of the wooded slopes across the valley, but in
      the clearness of the sunset, distinct and unmistakable, he saw a little
      spire of smoke.

At that his expression of serene resignation changed to an amazed anger.
      Smoke? He turned the head of the white horse about, and hesitated. And as
      he did so a little rustle of air went through the grass about him. Far
      away upon some reeds swayed a tattered sheet of grey. He looked at the
      cobwebs; he looked at the smoke.

As he rode, he picked his way amidst stranded masses of web. For some
      reason there were many dead spiders on the ground, and those that lived
      feasted guiltily on their fellows. At the sound of his horse''s hoofs they
      fled.

Their time had passed. From the ground, without either a wind to carry
      them or a winding-sheet ready, these things, for all their poison, could
      do him little evil.

He flicked with his belt at those he fancied came too near. Once, where a
      number ran together over a bare place, he was minded to dismount and
      trample them with his boots, but this impulse he overcame. Ever and again
      he turned in his saddle, and looked back at the smoke.

"Spiders," he muttered over and over again. "Spiders. Well, well... The
      next time I must spin a web."

Certainly, if ever a man found a guinea when he was looking for a pin, it
      is my good friend Professor Gibberne. I have heard before of investigators
      overshooting the mark, but never quite to the extent that he has done. He
      has really, this time at any rate, without any touch of exaggeration in
      the phrase, found something to revolutionise human life. And that when he
      was simply seeking an all-round nervous stimulant to bring languid people
      up to the stresses of these pushful days. I have tasted the stuff now
      several times, and I cannot do better than describe the effect the thing
      had on me. That there are astonishing experiences in store for all in
      search of new sensations will become apparent enough.

Professor Gibberne, as many people know, is my neighbour in Folkestone.
      Unless my memory plays me a trick, his portrait at various ages has
      already appeared in The Strand Magazine—think late in 1899
      but I am unable to look it up because I have lent that volume to someone
      who has never sent it back. The reader may, perhaps, recall the high
      forehead and the singularly long black eyebrows that give such a
      Mephistophelean touch to his face. He occupies one of those pleasant
      little detached houses in the mixed style that make the western end of the
      Upper Sandgate Road so interesting. His is the one with the Flemish gables
      and the Moorish portico, and it is in the little room with the mullioned
      bay window that he works when he is down here, and in which of an evening
      we have so often smoked and talked together. He is a mighty jester, but,
      besides, he likes to talk to me about his work; he is one of those men who
      find a help and stimulus in talking, and so I have been able to follow the
      conception of the New Accelerator right up from a very early stage. Of
      course, the greater portion of his experimental work is not done in
      Folkestone, but in Gower Street, in the fine new laboratory next to the
      hospital that he has been the first to use.

As every one knows, or at least as all intelligent people know, the
      special department in which Gibberne has gained so great and deserved a
      reputation among physiologists is the action of drugs upon the nervous
      system. Upon soporifics, sedatives, and anaesthetics he is, I am told,
      unequalled. He is also a chemist of considerable eminence, and I suppose
      in the subtle and complex jungle of riddles that centres about the
      ganglion cell and the axis fibre there are little cleared places of his
      making, little glades of illumination, that, until he sees fit to publish
      his results, are still inaccessible to every other living man. And in the
      last few years he has been particularly assiduous upon this question of
      nervous stimulants, and already, before the discovery of the New
      Accelerator, very successful with them. Medical science has to thank him
      for at least three distinct and absolutely safe invigorators of unrivalled
      value to practising men. In cases of exhaustion the preparation known as
      Gibberne''s B Syrup has, I suppose, saved more lives already than any
      lifeboat round the coast.

"But none of these little things begin to satisfy me yet," he told me
      nearly a year ago. "Either they increase the central energy without
      affecting the nerves, or they simply increase the available energy by
      lowering the nervous conductivity; and all of them are unequal and local
      in their operation. One wakes up the heart and viscera and leaves the
      brain stupefied, one gets at the brain champagne fashion, and does nothing
      good for the solar plexus, and what I want—and what, if it''s an
      earthly possibility, I mean to have—is a stimulant that stimulates
      all round, that wakes you up for a time from the crown of your head to the
      tip of your great toe, and makes you go two—or even three—to
      everybody else''s one. Eh? That''s the thing I''m after."

"Not a doubt of it. And you''d eat double or treble—and all that. But
      just think what the thing would mean. Imagine yourself with a little phial
      like this"—he held up a little bottle of green glass and marked his
      points with it—"and in this precious phial is the power to think
      twice as fast, move twice as quickly, do twice as much work in a given
      time as you could otherwise do."

"I believe so. If it isn''t, I''ve wasted my time for a year. These various
      preparations of the hypophosphites, for example, seem to show that
      something of the sort... Even if it was only one and a half times as fast
      it would do."

"If you were a statesman in a corner, for example, time rushing up against
      you, something urgent to be done, eh?"

"Or a doctor, driven to death, wants to sit down and think out a case. Or
      a barrister—or a man cramming for an examination."

"And in a duel, again," said Gibberne, "where it all depends on your
      quickness in pulling the trigger."

"You see," said Gibberne, "if I get it as an all-round thing, it will
      really do you no harm at all—except perhaps to an infinitesimal
      degree it brings you nearer old age. You will just have lived twice to
      other people''s once—"

"As possible," said Gibberne, and glanced at something that went throbbing
      by the window, "as a motor-bus. As a matter of fact—"

He paused and smiled at me deeply, and tapped slowly on the edge of his
      desk with the green phial. "I think I know the stuff... Already I''ve got
      something coming." The nervous smile upon his face betrayed the gravity of
      his revelation. He rarely talked of his actual experimental work unless
      things were very near the end. "And it may be, it may be—I shouldn''t
      be surprised—it may even do the thing at a greater rate than twice."

I remember we had several talks about the stuff after that. "The New
      Accelerator" he called it, and his tone about it grew more confident on
      each occasion. Sometimes he talked nervously of unexpected physiological
      results its use might have, and then he would get a little unhappy; at
      others he was frankly mercenary, and we debated long and anxiously how the
      preparation might be turned to commercial account. "It''s a good thing,"
      said Gibberne, "a tremendous thing. I know I''m giving the world something,
      and I think it only reasonable we should expect the world to pay. The
      dignity of science is all very well, but I think somehow I must have the
      monopoly of the stuff for, say, ten years. I don''t see why all the
      fun in life should go to the dealers in ham."

My own interest in the coming drug certainly did not wane in the time. I
      have always had a queer little twist towards metaphysics in my mind. I
      have always been given to paradoxes about space and time, and it seemed to
      me that Gibberne was really preparing no less than the absolute
      acceleration of life. Suppose a man repeatedly dosed with such a
      preparation: he would live an active and record life indeed, but he would
      be an adult at eleven, middle-aged at twenty-five, and by thirty well on
      the road ' WHERE id = 'ee364418-59f6-4a5c-b61e-e19060e1944f';
