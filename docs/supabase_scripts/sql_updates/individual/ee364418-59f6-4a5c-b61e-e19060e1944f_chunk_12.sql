UPDATE stories SET original_text = original_text || 'roof of the universe, from which the
      dew and the avalanches fell; and when he maintained stoutly the world had
      neither end nor roof such as they supposed, they said his thoughts were
      wicked. So far as he could describe sky and clouds and stars to them it
      seemed to them a hideous void, a terrible blankness in the place of the
      smooth roof to things in which they believed—it was an article of
      faith with them that the cavern roof was exquisitely smooth to the touch.
      He saw that in some manner he shocked them, and gave up that aspect of the
      matter altogether, and tried to show them the practical value of sight.
      One morning he saw Pedro in the path called Seventeen and coming towards
      the central houses, but still too far off for hearing or scent, and he
      told them as much. "In a little while," he prophesied, "Pedro will be
      here." An old man remarked that Pedro had no business on path Seventeen,
      and then, as if in confirmation, that individual as he drew near turned
      and went transversely into path Ten, and so back with nimble paces towards
      the outer wall. They mocked Nunez when Pedro did not arrive, and
      afterwards, when he asked Pedro questions to clear his character, Pedro
      denied and outfaced him, and was afterwards hostile to him.

Then he induced them to let him go a long way up the sloping meadows
      towards the wall with one complacent individual, and to him he promised to
      describe all that happened among the houses. He noted certain goings and
      comings, but the things that really seemed to signify to these people
      happened inside of or behind the windowless houses—the only things
      they took note of to test him by—and of these he could see or tell
      nothing; and it was after the failure of this attempt, and the ridicule
      they could not repress, that he resorted to force. He thought of seizing a
      spade and suddenly smiting one or two of them to earth, and so in fair
      combat showing the advantage of eyes. He went so far with that resolution
      as to seize his spade, and then he discovered a new thing about himself,
      and that was that it was impossible for him to hit a blind man in cold
      blood.

He hesitated, and found them all aware that he had snatched up the spade.
      They stood alert, with their heads on one side, and bent ears towards him
      for what he would do next.

"Put that spade down," said one, and he felt a sort of helpless horror. He
      came near obedience.

He went athwart one of their meadows, leaving a track of trampled grass
      behind his feet, and presently sat down by the side of one of their ways.
      He felt something of the buoyancy that comes to all men in the beginning
      of a fight, but more perplexity. He began to realise that you cannot even
      fight happily with creatures who stand upon a different mental basis to
      yourself. Far away he saw a number of men carrying spades and sticks come
      out of the street of houses, and advance in a spreading line along the
      several paths towards him. They advanced slowly, speaking frequently to
      one another, and ever and again the whole cordon would halt and sniff the
      air and listen.

For five minutes he watched the slow extension of the cordon, and then his
      vague disposition to do something forthwith became frantic. He stood up,
      went a pace or so towards the circumferential wall, turned, and went back
      a little way. There they all stood in a crescent, still and listening.

The pulse in his ears ran into the rhythm of "In the Country of the Blind
      the One-eyed Man is King!"

He looked back at the high and unclimbable wall behind—unclimbable
      because of its smooth plastering, but withal pierced with many little
      doors, and at the approaching line of seekers. Behind these others were
      now coming out of the street of houses.

He gripped his spade still tighter, and advanced down the meadows towards
      the place of habitations, and directly he moved they converged upon him.
      "I''ll hit them if they touch me," he swore; "by Heaven, I will. I''ll hit."
      He called aloud, "Look here, I''m going to do what I like in this valley.
      Do you hear? I''m going to do what I like and go where I like!"

They were moving in upon him quickly, groping, yet moving rapidly. It was
      like playing blind man''s buff, with everyone blindfolded except one. "Get
      hold of him!" cried one. He found himself in the arc of a loose curve of
      pursuers. He felt suddenly he must be active and resolute.

"You don''t understand," he cried in a voice that was meant to be great and
      resolute, and which broke. "You are blind, and I can see. Leave me alone!"

He began to run, not knowing clearly where to run. He ran from the nearest
      blind man, because it was a horror to hit him. He stopped, and then made a
      dash to escape from their closing ranks. He made for where a gap was wide,
      and the men on either side, with a quick perception of the approach of his
      paces, rushed in on one another. He sprang forward, and then saw he must
      be caught, and swish! the spade had struck. He felt the soft thud
      of hand and arm, and the man was down with a yell of pain, and he was
      through.

Through! And then he was close to the street of houses again, and blind
      men, whirling spades and stakes, were running with a sort of reasoned
      swiftness hither and thither.

He heard steps behind him just in time, and found a tall man rushing
      forward and swiping at the sound of him. He lost his nerve, hurled his
      spade a yard wide at his antagonist, and whirled about and fled, fairly
      yelling as he dodged another.

He was panic-stricken. He ran furiously to and fro, dodging when there was
      no need to dodge, and in his anxiety to see on every side of him at once,
      stumbling. For a moment he was down and they heard his fall. Far away in
      the circumferential wall a little doorway looked like heaven, and he set
      off in a wild rush for it. He did not even look round at his pursuers
      until it was gained, and he had stumbled across the bridge, clambered a
      little way among the rocks, to the surprise and dismay of a young llama,
      who went leaping out of sight, and lay down sobbing for breath.

He stayed outside the wall of the valley of the Blind for two nights and
      days without food or shelter, and meditated upon the unexpected. During
      these meditations he repeated very frequently and always with a profounder
      note of derision the exploded proverb: "In the Country of the Blind the
      One-Eyed Man is King." He thought chiefly of ways of fighting and
      conquering these people, and it grew clear that for him no practicable way
      was possible. He had no weapons, and now it would be hard to get one.

The canker of civilisation had got to him even in Bogota, and he could not
      find it in himself to go down and assassinate a blind man. Of course, if
      he did that, he might then dictate terms on the threat of assassinating
      them all. But—sooner or later he must sleep!...

He tried also to find food among the pine trees, to be comfortable under
      pine boughs while the frost fell at night, and—with less confidence—to
      catch a llama by artifice in order to try to kill it—perhaps by
      hammering it with a stone—and so finally, perhaps, to eat some of
      it. But the llamas had a doubt of him and regarded him with distrustful
      brown eyes, and spat when he drew near. Fear came on him the second day
      and fits of shivering. Finally he crawled down to the wall of the Country
      of the Blind and tried to make terms. He crawled along by the stream,
      shouting, until two blind men came out to the gate and talked to him.

Then he wept without intention, for he was very weak and ill now, and they
      took that as a favourable sign.

"About ten times ten the height of a man there is a roof above the world—
      of rock—and very, very smooth." ... He burst again into hysterical
      tears. "Before you ask me any more, give me some food or I shall die."

He expected dire punishments, but these blind people were capable of
      toleration. They regarded his rebellion as but one more proof of his
      general idiocy and inferiority; and after they had whipped him they
      appointed him to do the simplest and heaviest work they had for anyone to
      do, and he, seeing no other way of living, did submissively what he was
      told.

He was ill for some days, and they nursed him kindly. That refined his
      submission. But they insisted on his lying in the dark, and that was a
      great misery. And blind philosophers came and talked to him of the wicked
      levity of his mind, and reproved him so impressively for his doubts about
      the lid of rock that covered their cosmic casserole that he almost doubted
      whether indeed he was not the victim of hallucination in not seeing it
      overhead.

So Nunez became a citizen of the Country of the Blind, and these people
      ceased to be a generalised people and became individualities and familiar
      to him, while the world beyond the mountains became more and more remote
      and unreal. There was Yacob, his master, a kindly man when not annoyed;
      there was Pedro, Yacob''s nephew; and there was Medina-saroti, who was the
      youngest daughter of Yacob. She was little esteemed in the world of the
      blind, because she had a clear-cut face, and lacked that satisfying,
      glossy smoothness that is the blind man''s ideal of feminine beauty; but
      Nunez thought her beautiful at first, and presently the most beautiful
      thing in the whole creation. Her closed eyelids were not sunken and red
      after the common way of the valley, but lay as though they might open
      again at any moment; and she had long eyelashes, which were considered a
      grave disfigurement. And her voice was strong, and did not satisfy the
      acute hearing of the valley swains. So that she had no lover.

There came a time when Nunez thought that, could he win her, he would be
      resigned to live in the valley for all the rest of his days.

He watched her; he sought opportunities of doing her little services, and
      presently he found that she observed him. Once at a rest-day gathering
      they sat side by side in the dim starlight, and the music was sweet. His
      hand came upon hers and he dared to clasp it. Then very tenderly she
      returned his pressure. And one day, as they were at their meal in the
      darkness, he felt her hand very softly seeking him, and as it chanced the
      fire leapt then and he saw the tenderness of her face.

He went to her one day when she was sitting in the summer moonlight
      spinning. The light made her a thing of silver and mystery. He sat down at
      her feet and told her he loved her, and told her how beautiful she seemed
      to him. He had a lover''s voice, he spoke with a tender reverence that came
      near to awe, and she had never before been touched by adoration. She made
      him no definite answer, but it was clear his words pleased her.

After that he talked to her whenever he could take an opportunity. The
      valley became the world for him, and the world beyond the mountains where
      men lived in sunlight seemed no more than a fairy tale he would some day
      pour into her ears. Very tentatively and timidly he spoke to her of sight.

Sight seemed to her the most poetical of fancies, and she listened to his
      description of the stars and the mountains and her own sweet white-lit
      beauty as though it was a guilty indulgence. She did not believe, she
      could only half understand, but she was mysteriously delighted, and it
      seemed to him that she completely understood.

His love lost its awe and took courage. Presently he was for demanding her
      of Yacob and the elders in marriage, but she became fearful and delayed.
      And it was one of her elder sisters who first told Yacob that
      Medina-saroti and Nunez were in love.

There was from the first very great opposition to the marriage of Nunez
      and Medina-saroti; not so much because they valued her as because they
      held him as a being apart, an idiot, incompetent thing below the
      permissible level of a man. Her sisters opposed it bitterly as bringing
      discredit on them all; and old Yacob, though he had formed a sort of
      liking for his clumsy, obedient serf, shook his head and said the thing
      could not be. The young men were all angry at the idea of corrupting the
      race, and one went so far as to revile and strike Nunez. He struck back.
      Then for the first time he found an advantage in seeing, even by twilight,
      and after that fight was over no one was disposed to raise a hand against
      him. But they still found his marriage impossible.

Old Yacob had a tenderness for his last little daughter, and was grieved
      to have her weep upon his shoulder.

"I know," wept Medina-saroti. "But he''s better than he was. He''s getting
      better. And he''s strong, dear father, and kind—stronger and kinder
      than any other man in the world. And he loves me—and, father, I
      love him."

Old Yacob was greatly distressed to find her inconsolable, and, besides—
      what made it more distressing—he liked Nunez for many things. So he
      went and sat in the windowless council-chamber with the other elders and
      watched the trend of the talk, and said, at the proper time, "He''s better
      than he was. Very likely, some day, we shall find him as sane as
      ourselves."

Then afterwards one of the elders, who thought deeply, had an idea. He was
      the great doctor among these people, their medicine-man, and he had a very
      philosophical and inventive mind, and the idea of curing Nunez of his
      peculiarities appealed to him. One day when Yacob was present he returned
      to the topic of Nunez.

"I have examined Bogota," he said, "and the case is clearer to me. I think
      very probably he might be cured."

"This," said the doctor, answering his own question. "Those queer
      things that are called the eyes, and which exist to make an agreeable soft
      depression in the face, are diseased, in the case of Bogota, in such a way
      as to affect his brain. They are greatly distended, he has eyelashes, and
      his eyelids move, and consequently his brain is in a state of constant
      irritation and distraction."

"And I think I may say with reasonable certainty that, in order to cure
      him completely, all that we need do is a simple and easy surgical
      operation—namely, to remove these irritant bodies."

"Thank Heaven for science!" said old Yacob, and went forth at once to tell
      Nunez of his happy hopes.

"There are the beautiful things, the beautiful little things—the
      flowers, the lichens among the rocks, the lightness and softness on a
      piece of fur, the far sky with its drifting down of clouds, the sunsets
      and the stars. And there is you. For you alone it is good to have
      sight, to see your sweet, serene face, your kindly lips, your dear,
      beautiful hands folded together... It is these eyes of mine you won, these
      eyes that hold me to you, that these idiots seek. Instead, I must touch
      you, hear you, and never see you again. I must come under that roof of
      rock and stone and darkness, that horrible roof under which your
      imagination stoops... No; you would not have me do that?"

He was realising things very swiftly. He felt anger, indeed, anger at the
      dull course of fate, but also sympathy for her lack of understanding—a
      sympathy near akin to pity.

"Dear," he said, and he could see by her whiteness how intensely
      her spirit pressed against the things she could not say. He put his arms
      about her, he kissed her ear, and they sat for a time in silence.

She flung her arms about him, weeping wildly. "Oh, if you would," she
      sobbed, "if only you would!"

For a week before the operation that was to raise him from his servitude
      and inferiority to the level of a blind citizen, Nunez knew nothing of
      sleep, and all through the warm sunlit hours, while the others slumbered
      happily, he sat brooding or wandered aimlessly, trying to bring his mind
      to bear on his dilemma. He had given his answer, he had given his consent,
      and still he was not sure. And at last work-time was over, the sun rose in
      splendour over the golden crests, and his last day of vision began for
      him. He had a few minutes with Medina-saroti before she went apart to
      sleep.

"They will hurt you but little," she said; "and you are going through this
      pain—you are going through it, dear lover, for me... Dear, if
      a woman''s heart and life can do it, I will repay you. My dearest one, my
      dearest with the tender voice, I will repay."

He held her in his arms, and pressed his lips to hers, and looked on her
      sweet face for the last time. "Good-bye!" he whispered at that dear sight,
      "good-bye!"

She could hear his slow retreating footsteps, and something in the rhythm
      of them threw her into a passion of weeping.

He had fully meant to go to a lonely place where the meadows were
      beautiful with white narcissus, and there remain until the hour of his
      sacrifice should come, but as he went he lifted up his eyes and saw the
      morning, the morning like an angel in golden armour, marching down the
      steeps...

It seemed to him that before this splendour he, and this blind world in
      the valley, and his love, and all, were no more than a pit of sin.

He did not turn aside as he had meant to do, but went on, and passed
      through the wall of the circumference and out upon the rocks, and his eyes
      were always upon the sunlit ice and snow.

He saw their infinite beauty, and his imagination soared over them to the
      things beyond he was now to resign for ever.

He thought of that great free world he was parted from, the world that was
      his own, and he had a vision of those further slopes, distance beyond
      distance, with Bogota, a place of multitudinous stirring beauty, a glory
      by day, a luminous mystery by night, a place of palaces and fountains and
      statues and white houses, lying beautifully in the middle distance. He
      thought how for a day or so one might come down through passes, drawing
      ever nearer and nearer to its busy streets and ways. He thought of the
      river journey, day by day, from great Bogota to the still vaster world
      beyond, through towns and villages, forest and desert places, the rushing
      river day by day, until its banks receded and the big steamers came
      splashing by, and one had reached the sea—the limitless sea, with
      its thousand islands, its thousands of islands, and its ships seen dimly
      far away in their incessant journeyings round and about that greater
      world. And there, unpent by mountains, one saw the sky—the sky, not
      such a disc as one saw it here, but an arch of immeasurable blue, a deep
      of deeps in which the circling stars were floating...

For example, if one went so, up that gully and to that chimney there, then
      one might come out high among those stunted pines that ran round in a sort
      of shelf and rose still higher and higher as it passed above the gorge.
      And then? That talus might be managed. Thence perhaps a climb might be
      found to take him up to the precipice that came below the snow; and if
      that chimney failed, then another farther to the east might serve his
      purpose better. And then? Then one would be out upon the amber-lit snow
      there, and half-way up to the crest of those beautiful desolations.

When sunset came he was no longer climbing, but he was far and high. He
      had been higher, but he was still very high. His clothes were torn, his
      limbs were blood-stained, he was bruised in many places, but he lay as if
      he were at his ease, and there was a smile on his face.

From where he rested the valley seemed as if it were in a pit and nearly a
      mile below. Already it was dim with haze and shadow, though the mountain
      summits around him were things of light and fire. The mountain summits
      around him were things of light and fire, and the little details of the
      rocks near at hand were drenched with subtle beauty—a vein of green
      mineral piercing the grey, the flash of crystal faces here and there, a
      minute, minutely-beautiful orange lichen close beside his face. There were
      deep mysterious shadows in the gorge, blue deepening into purple, and
      purple into a luminous darkness, and overhead was the illimitable vastness
      of the sky. But he heeded these things no longer, but lay quite inactive
      there, smiling as if he were satisfied merely to have escaped from the
      valley of the Blind in which he had thought to be King.

The glow of the sunset passed, and the night came, and still he lay
      peacefully contented under the cold clear stars.

There was once a little man whose mother made him a beautiful suit of
      clothes. It was green and gold, and woven so that I cannot describe how
      delicate and fine it was, and there was a tie of orange fluffiness that
      tied up under his chin. And the buttons in their newness shone like stars.
      He was proud and pleased by his suit beyond measure, and stood before the
      long looking-glass when first he put it on, so astonished and delighted
      with it that he could hardly turn himself away. He wanted to wear it
      everywhere, and show it to all sorts of people. He thought over all the
      places he had ever visited, and all the scenes he had ever heard
      described, and tried to imagine what the feel of it would be if he were to
      go now to those scenes and places wearing his shining suit, and he wanted
      to go out forthwith into the long grass and the hot sunshine of the meadow
      wearing it. Just to wear it! But his mother told him "No." She told him he
      must take great care of his suit, for never would he have another nearly
      so fine; he must save it and save it, and only wear it on rare and great
      occasions. It was his wedding-suit, she said. And she took the buttons and
      twisted them up with tissue paper for fear their bright newness should be
      tarnished, and she tacked little guards over the cuffs and elbows, and
      wherever the suit was most likely to come to harm. He hated and resisted
      these things, but what could he do? And at last her warnings and
      persuasions had effect, and he consented to take off his beautiful suit
      and fold it into its proper creases, and put it away. It was almost as
      though he gave it up again. But he was always thinking of wearing it, and
      of the supreme occasions when some day it might be worn without the
      guards, without the tissue paper on the buttons, utterly and delightfully,
      never caring, beautiful beyond measure.

One night, when he was dreaming of it after his habit, he dreamt he took
      the tissue paper from one of the buttons, and found its brightness a
      little faded, and that distressed him mightily in his dream. He polished
      the poor faded button and polished it, and, if anything, it grew duller.
      He woke up and lay awake, thinking of the brightness a little dulled, and
      wondering how he would feel if perhaps when the great occasion (whatever
      it might be) should arrive, one button should chance to be ever so little
      short of its first glittering freshness, and for days and days that
      thought remained with him distressingly. And when next his mother let him
      wear his suit, he was tempted and nearly gave way to the temptation just
      to fumble off one little bit of tissue paper and see if indeed the buttons
      were keeping as bright as ever.

He went trimly along on his way to church, full of this wild desire. For
      you must know his mother did, with repeated and careful warnings, let him
      wear his suit at times, on Sundays, for example, to and fro from church,
      when there was no threatening of rain, no dust blowing, nor anything to
      injure it, with its buttons covered and its protections tacked upon it,
      and a sun-shade in his hand to shadow it if there seemed too strong a
      sunlight for its colours. And always, after such occasions, he brushed it
      over and folded it exquisitely as she had taught him, and put it away
      again.

Now all these restrictions his mother set to the wearing of his suit he
      obeyed, always he obeyed them, until one strange night he woke up and saw
      the moonlight shining outside his window. It seemed to him the moonlight
      was not common moonlight, nor the night a common night, and for awhile he
      lay quite drowsily, with this odd persuasion in his mind. Thought joined
      on to thought like things that whisper warmly in the shadows. Then he sat
      up in his little bed suddenly very alert, with his heart beating very
      fast, and a quiver in his body from top to toe. He had made up his mind.
      He knew that now he was going to wear his suit as it should be worn. He
      had no doubt in the matter. He was afraid, terribly afraid, but glad,
      glad.

He got out of his bed and stood for a moment by the window looking at the
      moonshine-flooded garden, and trembling at the thing he meant to do. The
      air was full of a minute clamour of crickets and murmurings, of the
      infinitesimal shoutings of little living things. He went very gently
      across the creaking boards, for fear that he might wake the sleeping
      house, to the big dark clothes-press wherein his beautiful suit lay
      folded, and he took it out garment by garment, and softly and very eagerly
      tore off its tissue-paper covering and its tacked protections until there
      it was, perfect and delightful as he had seen it when first his mother had
      given it to him—a long time it seemed ago. Not a button had
      tarnished, not a thread had faded on this dear suit of his; he was glad
      enough for weeping as in a noiseless hurry he put it on. And then back he
      went, soft and quick, to the window that looked out upon the garden, and
      stood there for a minute, shining in the moonlight, with his buttons
      twinkling like stars, before he got out on the sill, and, making as little
      of a rustling as he could, clambered down to the garden path below. He
      stood before his mother''s house, and it was white and nearly as plain as
      by day, with every window-blind but his own shut like an eye that sleeps.
      The trees cast still shadows like intricate black lace upon the wall.

The garden in the moonlight was very different from the garden by day;
      moonshine was tangled in the hedges and stretched in phantom cobwebs from
      spray to spray. Every flower was gleaming white or crimson black, and the
      air was a-quiver with the thridding of small crickets and nightingales
      singing unseen in the depths of the trees.

There was no darkness in the world, but only warm, mysterious shadows, and
      all the leaves and spikes were edged and lined with iridescent jewels of
      dew. The night was warmer than any night had ever been, the heavens by
      some miracle at once vaster and nearer, and, spite of the great
      ivory-tinted moon that ruled the world, the sky was full of stars.

The little man did not shout nor sing for all his infinite gladness. He
      stood for a time like one awestricken, and then, with a queer small cry
      and holding out his arms, he ran out as if he would embrace at once the
      whole round immensity of the world. He did not follow the neat set paths
      that cut the garden squarely, but thrust across the beds and through the
      wet, tall, scented herbs, through the night-stock and the nicotine and the
      clusters of phantom white mallow flowers and through the thickets of
      southernwood and lavender, and knee-deep across a wide space of
      mignonette. He came to the great hedge, and he thrust his way through it;
      and though the thorns of the brambles scored him deeply and tore threads
      from his wonderful suit, and though burrs and goose-grass and havers
      caught and clung to him, he did not care. He did not care, for he knew it
      was all part of the wearing for which he had longed. "I am glad I put on
      my suit," he said; "I am glad I wore my suit."

Beyond the hedge he came to the duck-pond, or at least to what was the
      duck-pond by day. But by night it was a great bowl of silver moonshine all
      noisy with singing frogs, of wonderful silver moonshine twisted and
      clotted with strange patternings, and the little man ran down into its
      waters between the thin black rushes, knee-deep and waist-deep and to his
      shoulders, smiting the water to black and shining wavelets with either
      hand, swaying and shivering wavelets, amidst which the stars were netted
      in the tangled reflections of the brooding trees upon the bank. He waded
      until he swam, and so he crossed the pond and came out upon the other
      side, trailing, as it seemed to him, not duckweed, but very silver in
      long, clinging, dripping masses. And up he went through the transfigured
      tangles of the willow-herb and the uncut seeding grasses of the farther
      bank. He came glad and breathless into the high-road. "I am glad," he
      said, "beyond measure, that I had clothes that fitted this occasion."

The high-road ran straight as an arrow flies, straight into the deep-blue
      pit of sky beneath the moon, a white and shining road between the singing
      nightingales, and along it he went, running now and leaping, and now
      walking and rejoicing, in the clothes his mother had made for him with
      tireless, loving hands. The road was deep in dust, but that for him was
      only soft whiteness; and as he went a great dim moth came fluttering round
      his wet and shimmering and hastening figure. At first he did not heed the
      moth, and then he waved his hands at it, and made a sort of dance with it
      as it circled round his head. "Soft moth!" he cried, "dear moth! And
      wonderful night, wonderful night of the world! Do you think my clothes are
      beautiful, dear moth? As beautiful as your scales and all this silver
      vesture of the earth and sky?"

And the moth circled closer and closer until at last its velvet wings just
      brushed his lips...

And next morning they found him dead, with his neck broken, in the bottom
      of the stone pit, with his beautiful clothes a little bloody, and foul and
      stained with the duckweed from the pond. But his face was a face of such
      happiness that, had you seen it, you would have understood indeed how that
      he had died happy, never knowing that cool and streaming silver for the
      duckweed in the pond.' WHERE id = 'ee364418-59f6-4a5c-b61e-e19060e1944f';
