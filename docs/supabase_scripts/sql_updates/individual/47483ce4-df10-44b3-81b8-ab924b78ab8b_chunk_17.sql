      every one of us has retained the type of some animal or other as the mark
      of his primitive origin. How many people have jaws like a bulldog, or
      heads like goats, rabbits, foxes, horses, or oxen. Paul is a squirrel
      turned into a man. He has its bright, quick eyes, its hair, its pointed
      nose, its small, fine, supple, active body, and a certain mysterious
      resemblance in his general bearing; in fact, a similarity of movement, of
      gesture, and of bearing which might almost be taken for a recollection.

At last we both went to sleep with that uncomfortable slumber of the
      railway carriage, which is interrupted by horrible cramps in the arms and
      neck, and by the sudden stoppages of the train.

We woke up as we were passing along the Rhone. Soon the continued noise of
      crickets came in through the windows, that cry which seems to be the voice
      of the warm earth, the song of Provence; and seemed to instill into our
      looks, our breasts, and our souls the light and happy feeling of the
      south, that odor of the parched earth, of the stony and light soil of the
      olive with its gray-green foliage.

When the train stopped again a railway guard ran along the train calling
      out “Valence” in a sonorous voice, with an accent that again
      gave us a taste of that Provence which the shrill note of the crickets had
      already imparted to us.

Nothing fresh happened till we got to Marseilles, where we alighted for
      breakfast, but when we returned to our carriage we found a woman installed
      there.

Paul, with a delighted glance at me, gave his short mustache a mechanical
      twirl, and passed his fingers through his, hair, which had become slightly
      out of order with the night''s journey. Then he sat down opposite the
      newcomer.

Whenever I happen to see a striking new face, either in travelling or in
      society, I always have the strongest inclination to find out what
      character, mind, and intellectual capacities are hidden beneath those
      features.

She was a young and pretty woman, certainly a native of the south of
      France, with splendid eyes, beautiful wavy black hair, which was so thick
      and long that it seemed almost too heavy for her head. She was dressed
      with a certain southern bad taste which made her look a little vulgar. Her
      regular features had none of the grace and finish of the refined races, of
      that slight delicacy which members of the aristocracy inherit from their
      birth, and which is the hereditary mark of thinner blood.

Her bracelets were too big to be of gold; she wore earrings with large
      white stones that were certainly not diamonds, and she belonged
      unmistakably to the People. One surmised that she would talk too loud, and
      shout on every occasion with exaggerated gestures.

When the train started she remained motionless in her place, in the
      attitude of a woman who was indignant, without even looking at us.

Paul began to talk to me, evidently with an eye to effect, trying to
      attract her attention, as shopkeepers expose their choice wares to catch
      the notice of passersby.

“She is an uncommonly fresh and pretty girl. What eyes she has, and
      how cross she looks. She must have been dreadfully worried, for she takes
      no notice of anything.”

“I am not taking any trouble, my dear fellow. I think her an
      extremely pretty woman, that is all. If one could only speak to her! But I
      don''t know how to begin. Cannot you give me an idea? Can''t you guess who
      she is?”

“Upon my word, I cannot. However, I should rather think she is some
      strolling actress who is going to rejoin her company after a love
      adventure.”

“Just look at her bracelets,” I said, “her earrings and
      her whole dress. I should not be the least surprised if she were a dancer
      or a circus rider, but most likely a dancer. Her whole style smacks very
      much of the theatre.”

“Well,” I replied, “there are many things which one can
      do before one is twenty; dancing and elocution are among them.”

We got in; our fellow passenger was eating an orange, and certainly she
      did not do it elegantly. She had spread her pocket-handkerchief on her
      knees, and the way in which she tore off the peel and opened her mouth to
      put in the pieces, and then spat the pips out of the window, showed that
      her training had been decidedly vulgar.

She seemed, also, more put out than ever, and swallowed the fruit with an
      exceedingly comic air of rage.

Paul devoured her with his eyes, and tried to attract her attention and
      excite her curiosity; but in spite of his talk, and of the manner in which
      he brought in well-known names, she did not pay the least attention to
      him.

After passing Frejus and St. Raphael, the train passed through a veritable
      garden, a paradise of roses, and groves of oranges and lemons covered with
      fruits and flowers at the same time. That delightful coast from Marseilles
      to Genoa is a kingdom of perfumes in a home of flowers.

June is the time to see it in all its beauty, when in every narrow valley
      and on every slope, the most exquisite flowers are growing luxuriantly.
      And the roses! fields, hedges, groves of roses. They climb up the walls,
      blossom on the roofs, hang from the trees, peep out from among the bushes;
      they are white, red, yellow, large and small, single, with a simple
      self-colored dress, or full and heavy in brilliant toilettes.

Their breath makes the air heavy and relaxing, and the still more
      penetrating odor of the orange blossoms sweetens the atmosphere till it
      might almost be called the refinement of odor.

The shore, with its brown rocks, was bathed by the motionless
      Mediterranean. The hot summer sun stretched like a fiery cloth over the
      mountains, over the long expanses of sand, and over the motionless,
      apparently solid blue sea. The train went on through the tunnels, along
      the slopes, above the water, on straight, wall-like viaducts, and a soft,
      vague, saltish smell, a smell of drying seaweed, mingled at times with the
      strong, heavy perfume of the flowers.

But Paul neither saw, looked at, nor smelled anything, for our fellow
      traveller engrossed all his attention.

When we reached Cannes, as he wished to speak to me he signed to me to get
      out, and as soon as I did so, he took me by the arm.

“Do you know, she is really charming. Just look at her eyes; and I
      never saw anything like her hair.”

“Don''t excite yourself,” I replied, “or else address
      her, if you have any intentions that way. She does not look
      unapproachable; I fancy, although she appear to be a little bit grumpy.”

“I don''t know what to say, for I am always terribly stupid at first;
      I can never make advances to a woman in the street. I follow them, go
      round and round them, and quite close to them, but never know what to say
      at first. I only once tried to enter into conversation with a woman in
      that way. As I clearly saw that she was waiting for me to make overtures,
      and as I felt bound to say something, I stammered out, ''I hope you are
      quite well, madame?'' She laughed in my face, and I made my escape.”

I promised Paul to do all I could to bring about a conversation, and when
      we had taken our places again, I politely asked our neighbor:

So she was an Italian! I felt an absurd inclination to laugh. As Paul did
      not understand a word of that language, I was obliged to act as his
      interpreter, so I said in Italian:

She had neither turned her head nor looked at me, and I really did not
      know whether to take this “What do I care” for an
      authorization, a refusal, a real sign of indifference, or for a mere
      “Let me alone.”

She again said, “Mica,” in a tone which seemed to mean,
      “I wish to goodness you would leave me alone!” It was,
      however, a kind of permission, so I said to Paul:

He looked at me in that curious sort of way that people have when they try
      to understand others who are talking in a strange language before them,
      and asked me:

“If you had counted her words you would have noticed that she used
      exactly six, two of which gave me to understand that she knew no French,
      so four remained, and much can be said in four words.”

But suddenly the Italian asked me, in that tone of discontent which seemed
      habitual to her, “Do you know at what time we shall get to Genoa?”

“My friend and I are also going to Genoa, and if we can be of any
      service to you, we shall be very happy, as you are quite alone.” But
      she interrupted with such a “Mica!” that I did not venture on
      another word.

But he was in no humor for joking, and begged me dryly not to make fun of
      him; so I translated her question and my polite offer, which had been so
      rudely rejected.

“If we only knew,” he said, “what hotel she was going
      to, we would go to the same. Try to find out so as to have another
      opportunity to make her talk.”

It was not particularly easy, and I did not know what pretext to invent,
      desirous as I was to make the acquaintance of this unapproachable person.

We passed Nice, Monaco, Mentone, and the train stopped at the frontier for
      the examination of luggage.

Although I hate those ill-bred people who breakfast and dine in
      railway-carriages, I went and bought a quantity of good things to make one
      last attack on her by their means. I felt sure that this girl must,
      ordinarily, be by no means inaccessible. Something had put her out and
      made her irritable, but very little would suffice, a mere word or some
      agreeable offer, to decide her and vanquish her.

We started again, and we three were still alone. I spread my eatables on
      the seat. I cut up the fowl, put the slices of ham neatly on a piece of
      paper, and then carefully laid out our dessert, strawberries, plums,
      cherries and cakes, close to the girl.

When she saw that we were about to eat she took a piece of chocolate and
      two little crisp cakes out of her pocket and began to munch them.

As she, however, glanced from time to time at our provisions, I felt sure
      that she would still be hungry when she had finished what she had with
      her; so, as soon as her frugal meal was over, I said to her:

“Well, then,” I said, “may I offer you a little wine? I
      see you have not drunk anything. It is Italian wine, and as we are now in
      your own country, we should be very pleased to see such a pretty Italian
      mouth accept the offer of its French neighbors.”

She shook her head slightly, evidently wishing to refuse, but very
      desirous of accepting, and her mica this time was almost polite. I took
      the flask, which was covered with straw in the Italian fashion, and
      filling the glass, I offered it to her.

She took the glass with her usual look, and emptied it at a draught, like
      a woman consumed with thirst, and then gave it back to me without even
      saying “Thank you.”

I then offered her the cherries. “Please take some,” I said;
      “we shall be so glad if you will.”

Out of her corner she looked at all the fruit spread out beside her, and
      said so rapidly that I could scarcely follow her: “A me non
      piacciono ne le ciriegie ne le susine; amo soltano le fragole.”

I put a newspaper full of wild strawberries on her lap, and she ate them
      quickly, tossing them into her mouth from some distance in a coquettish
      and charming manner.

When she had finished the little red heap, which soon disappeared under
      the rapid action of her hands, I asked her:

She certainly devoured half of it, tearing it to pieces with the rapid
      movements of her jaws like some carnivorous animal. Then she made up her
      mind to have some cherries, which she “did not like,” and then
      some plums, then some little cakes. Then she said, “I have had
      enough,” and sat back in her corner.

I was much amused, and tried to make her eat more, insisting, in fact,
      till she suddenly flew into a rage, and flung such a furious mica at me,
      that I would no longer run the risk of spoiling her digestion.

I turned to my friend. “My poor Paul,” I said, “I am
      afraid we have had our trouble for nothing.”

The night came on, one of those hot summer nights which extend their warm
      shade over the burning and exhausted earth. Here and there, in the
      distance, by the sea, on capes and promontories, bright stars, which I
      was, at times, almost inclined to confound with lighthouses, began to
      shine on the dark horizon:

The scent of the orange trees became more penetrating, and we breathed
      with delight, distending our lungs to inhale it more deeply. The balmy air
      was soft, delicious, almost divine.

Suddenly I noticed something like a shower of stars under the dense shade
      of the trees along the line, where it was quite dark. It might have been
      taken for drops of light, leaping, flying, playing and running among the
      leaves, or for small stars fallen from the skies in order to have an
      excursion on the earth; but they were only fireflies dancing a strange
      fiery ballet in the perfumed air.

One of them happened to come into our carriage, and shed its intermittent
      light, which seemed to be extinguished one moment and to be burning the
      next. I covered the carriage-lamp with its blue shade and watched the
      strange fly careering about in its fiery flight. Suddenly it settled on
      the dark hair of our neighbor, who was half dozing after dinner. Paul
      seemed delighted, with his eyes fixed on the bright, sparkling spot, which
      looked like a living jewel on the forehead of the sleeping woman.

The Italian woke up about eleven o''clock, with the bright insect still in
      her hair. When I saw her move, I said: “We are just getting to
      Genoa, madame,” and she murmured, without answering me, as if
      possessed by some obstinate and embarrassing thought:

“I don''t know, but she made this strange proposal to me in a most
      irritated voice. I told her that we were going to the hotel, and she said:
      ''Very well, let us all go there!'' I suppose she is without a penny. She
      certainly has a very strange way of making acquaintances.”

“I am quite agreeable. Tell her that we will go wherever she likes.”
      Then, after a moment''s hesitation, he said uneasily:

“We shall be very happy to have you with us, but my friend wishes to
      know whether you will take my arm or his?”

I was obliged to explain myself. “In Italy, I believe, when a man
      looks after a woman, fulfils all her wishes, and satisfies all her
      caprices, he is called a patito. Which of us two will you take for your
      patito?”

“All the better for you,” he replied in a rage. Then, after
      thinking for a few moments, he went on:

“Do you really care about taking this creature with you? She will
      spoil our journey. What are we to do with this woman, who looks like I
      don''t know what? They will not take us in at any decent hotel.”

I, however, just began to find the Italian much nicer than I had thought
      her at first, and I was now very desirous to take her with us. The idea
      delighted me.

I replied, “My dear fellow, we have accepted, and it is too late to
      recede. You were the first to advise me to say ''Yes.''”

I got out of the carriage, and offered my new companion my hand. She
      jumped out lightly, and I gave her my arm, which she took with an air of
      seeming repugnance. As soon as we had claimed our luggage we set off into
      the town, Paul walking in utter silence.

“To what hotel shall we go?” I asked him. “It may be
      difficult to get into the City of Paris with a woman, especially with this
      Italian.”

Paul interrupted me. “Yes, with an Italian who looks more like a
      dancer than a duchess. However, that is no business of mine. Do just as
      you please.”

I was in a state of perplexity. I had written to the City of Paris to
      retain our rooms, and now I did not know what to do.

Two commissionaires followed us with our luggage. I continued: “You
      might as well go on first, and say that we are coming; and give the
      landlord to understand that I have a—a friend with me and that we
      should like rooms quite by themselves for us three, so as not to be
      brought in contact with other travellers. He will understand, and we will
      decide according to his answer.”

But Paul growled, “Thank you, such commissions and such parts do not
      suit me, by any means. I did not come here to select your apartments or to
      minister to your pleasures.”

But I was urgent: “Look here, don''t be angry. It is surely far
      better to go to a good hotel than to a bad one, and it is not difficult to
      ask the landlord for three separate bedrooms and a dining-room.”

He went on first, and I saw him go into a large hotel while I remained on
      the other side of the street, with my fair Italian, who did not say a
      word, and followed the porters with the luggage.

“That is settled,” he said, “and they will take us in;
      but here are only two bedrooms. You must settle it as you can.”

There were two bedrooms separated by a small sitting-room. I ordered a
      cold supper, and then I turned to the Italian with a perplexed look.

She replied with her eternal “Che mi fa!” I thereupon took up
      her little black wooden trunk, such as servants use, and took it into the
      room on the right, which I had chosen for her. A bit of paper was fastened
      to the box, on which was written, Mademoiselle Francesca Rondoli, Genoa.

“We shall have supper directly,” I continued. “Meanwhile,
      I dare say you would like to arrange your toilette a little?”

She answered with a ''mica'', a word which she employed just as frequently
      as ''Che me fa'', but I went on: “It is always pleasant after a
      journey.”

Then I suddenly remembered that she had not, perhaps, the necessary
      requisites, for she appeared to me in a very singular position, as if she
      had just escaped from some disagreeable adventure, and I brought her my
      dressing-case.

I put out all the little instruments for cleanliness and comfort which it
      contained: a nail-brush, a new toothbrush—I always carry a selection
      of them about with me—my nail-scissors, a nail-file, and sponges. I
      uncorked a bottle of eau de cologne, one of lavender-water, and a little
      bottle of new-mown hay, so that she might have a choice. Then I opened my
      powder-box, and put out the powder-puff, placed my fine towels over the
      water-jug, and a piece of new soap near the basin.

She watched my movements with a look of annoyance in her wide-open eyes,
      without appearing either astonished or pleased at my forethought.

When I returned to the sitting-room I found that Paul had shut himself in
      the other room, so I sat down to wait.

A waiter went to and fro, bringing plates and glasses. He laid the table
      slowly, then put a cold chicken on it, and told me that all was ready.

I knocked gently at Mademoiselle Rondoli''s door. “Come in,”
      she said, and when I did so I was struck by a strong, heavy smell of
      perfumes, as if I were in a hairdresser''s shop.

The Italian was sitting on her trunk in an attitude either of thoughtful
      discontent or absent-mindedness. The towel was still folded over the
      waterjug that was full of water, and the soap, untouched and dry, was
      lying beside the empty basin; but one would have thought that the young
      woman had used half the contents of the bottles of perfume. The eau de
      cologne, however, had been spared, as only about a third of it had gone;
      but to make up for that she had used a surprising amount of lavender-water
      and new-mown hay. A cloud of violet powder, a vague white mist, seemed
      still to be floating in the air, from the effects of her over-powdering
      her face and neck. It seemed to cover her eyelashes, eyebrows, and the
      hair on her temples like snow, while her cheeks were plastered with it,
      and layers of it covered her nostrils, the corners of her eyes, and her
      chin.

When we sat down to supper, I found that Paul was in a most execrable
      temper, and I could get nothing out of him but blame, irritable words, and
      disagreeable remarks.

Mademoiselle Francesca ate like an ogre, and as soon as she had finished
      her meal she threw herself upon the sofa in the sitting-room. Sitting down
      beside her, I said gallantly, kissing her hand:

She got up, yawned, gave her hand to Paul, who took it with a furious
      look, and I lighted her into the bedroom. A disquieting feeling haunted
      me. “Here is all you want,” I said again.

The next morning she got up early, like a woman who is accustomed to work.
      She woke me by doing so, and I watched her through my half-closed eyelids.

She came and went without hurrying herself, as if she were astonished at
      having nothing to do. At length she went to the dressing-table, and in a
      moment emptied all my bottles of perfume. She certainly also used some
      water, but very little.

When she was quite dressed, she sat down on her trunk again, and clasping
      one knee between her hands, she seemed to be thinking.

Without seeming in at all a better temper than the previous night, she
      murmured, “Good-morning!”

When I asked her whether she had slept well, she nodded her head, and
      jumping out of bed, I went and kissed her.

She turned her face toward me like a child who is being kissed against its
      will; but I took her tenderly in my arms, and gently pressed my lips on
      her eyelids, which she closed with evident distaste under my kisses on her
      fresh cheek and full lips, which she turned away.

I sat down on the trunk by her side, and passing my arm through hers, I
      said: “Mica! mica! mica! in reply to everything. I shall call you
      Mademoiselle Mica, I think.”

For the first time I fancied that I saw the shadow of a smile on her lips,
      but it passed by so quickly that I may have been mistaken.

“But if you never say anything but Mica, I shall not know what to do
      to please you. Let me see; what shall we do to-day?”

She hesitated a moment, as if some fancy had flitted through her head, and
      then she said carelessly: “It is all the same to me; whatever you
      like.”

Paul was waiting for us in the dining-room, looking as bored as third
      parties usually do in love affairs. I assumed a delighted air, and shook
      hands with him with triumphant energy.

“First of all, we will go and see a little of the town, and then we
      might get a carriage and take a drive in the neighborhood.”

We breakfasted almost in silence, and then set out. I dragged Francesca
      from palace to palace, and she either looked at nothing or merely glanced
      carelessly at the various masterpieces. Paul followed us, growling all
      sorts of disagreeable things. Then we all three took a drive in silence
      into the country and returned to dinner.

The next day it was the same thing and the next day again; and on the
      third Paul said to me: “Look here, I am going to leave you; I am not
      going to stop here for three weeks watching you make love to this
      creature.”

I was perplexed and annoyed, for to my great surprise I had become
      singularly attached to Francesca. A man is but weak and foolish, carried
      away by the merest trifle, and a coward every time that his senses are
      excited or mastered. I clung to this unknown girl, silent and dissatisfied
      as she always was. I liked her somewhat ill-tempered face, the
      dissatisfied droop of her mouth, the weariness of her look; I liked her
      fatigued movements, the contemptuous way in which she let me kiss her, the
      very indifference of her caresses. A secret bond, that mysterious bond of
      physical love, which does not satisfy, bound me to her. I told Paul so,
      quite frankly. He treated me as if I were a fool, and then said:

But she obstinately refused to leave Genoa, without giving any reason. I
      besought, I reasoned, I promised, but all was of no avail, and so I stayed
      on.

Paul declared that he would go by himself, and went so far as to pack up
      his portmanteau; but he remained all the same.

Thus a fortnight passed. Francesca was always silent and irritable, lived
      beside me rather than with me, responded to all my requirements and all my
      propositions with her perpetual Che mi fa, or with her no less perpetual
      Mica.

My friend became more and more furious, but my only answer was, “You
      can go if you are tired of staying. I am not detaining you.”

Then he called me names, overwhelmed me with reproaches, and exclaimed:
      “Where do you think I can go now? We had three weeks at our
      disposal, and here is a fortnight gone! I cannot continue my journey now;
      and, in any case, I am not going to Venice, Florence and Rome all by
      myself. But you will pay for it, and more dearly than you think, most
      likely. You are not going to bring a man all the way from Paris in order
      to shut him up at a hotel in Genoa with an Italian adventuress.”

When I told him, very calmly, to return to Paris, he exclaimed that he
      intended to do so the very next day; but the next day he was still there,
      still in a rage and swearing.

By this time we began to be known in the streets through which we wandered
      from morning till night. Sometimes French people would turn round
      astonished at meeting their fellow-countrymen in the company of this girl
      with her striking costume, who looked singularly out of place, not to say
      compromising, beside us.

She used to walk along, leaning on my arm, without looking at anything.
      Why did she remain with me, with us, who seemed to do so little to amuse
      her? Who was she? Where did she come from? What was she doing? Had she any
      plan or idea? Where did she live? As an adventuress, or by chance
      meetings? I tried in vain to find out and to explain it. The better I knew
      her the more enigmatical she became. She seemed to be a girl of poor
      family who had been taken away, and then cast aside and lost. What did she
      think would become of her, or whom was she waiting for? She certainly did
      not appear to be trying to make a conquest of me, or to make any real
      profit out of me.

I tried to question her, to speak to her of her childhood and family; but
      she never gave me an answer. I stayed with her, my heart unfettered and my
      senses enchained, never wearied of holding her in my arms, that proud and
      quarrelsome woman, captivated by my senses, or rather carried away,
      overcome by a youthful, healthy, powerful charm, which emanated from her
      fragrant person and from the well-molded lines of her body.

Another week passed, and the term of my journey was drawing on, for I had
      to be back in Paris by the eleventh of July. By this time Paul had come to
      take his part in the adventure, though still grumbling at me, while I
      invented pleasures, distractions and excursions to amuse Francesca and my
      friend; and in order to do this I gave myself a great amount of trouble.

One day I proposed an excursion to Sta Margarita, that charming little
      town in the midst of gardens, hidden at the foot of a slope which
      stretches far into the sea up to the village of Portofino. We three walked
      along the excellent road which goes along the foot of the mountain.
      Suddenly Francesca said to me: “I shall not be able to go with you
      to-morrow; I must go and see some of my relatives.”

The next morning she got up very early. When she spoke to me it was in a
      constrained and hesitating voice:

Then she explained: “You must go into the Street Victor-Emmanuel,
      down the Falcone road and the side street San-Rafael and into the
      furniture shop in the building at the right at the end of a court, and
      there you must ask for Madame Rondoli. That is the place.”

When Paul saw that I was alone, he stammered out: “Where; is
      Francesca?” And when I told him what had happened, he exclaimed:

“My dear fellow, let us make use of our opportunity, and bolt; as it
      is, our time is up. Two days, more or less, make no difference. Let us go
      at once; go and pack up your things. Off we go!”

But I refused. I could not, as I told him, leave the girl in that manner
      after such companionship for nearly three weeks. At any rate, I ought to
      say good-by to her, and make her accept a present; I certainly had no
      intention of behaving badly to her.

I remained indoors for several hours, expecting Francesca''s return, but
      she did not come, and at last, at dinner, Paul said with a triumphant air:

I must acknowledge that I was surprised and rather vexed. He laughed in my
      face, and made fun of me.

“It is not exactly a bad way of getting rid of you, though rather
      primitive. ''Just wait for me, I shall be back in a moment,'' they often
      say. How long are you going to wait? I should not wonder if you were
      foolish enough to go and look for her at the address she gave you. ''Does
      Madame Rondoli live here, please?'' ''No, monsieur.'' I''ll bet that you are
      longing to go there.”

“Not in the least,” I protested, “and I assure you that
      if she does not come back to-morrow morning I shall leave by the express
      at eight o''clock. I shall have waited twenty-four hours, and that is
      enough; my conscience will be quite clear.”

I spent an uneasy and unpleasant evening, for I really had at heart a very
      tender feeling for her. I went to bed at twelve o''clock, and hardly slept
      at all. I got up at six, called Paul, packed up my things, and two hours
      later we set out for France together.

The next year, at just about the same period, I was seized as one is with
      a periodical fever, with a new desire to go to Italy, and I immediately
      made up my mind to carry it into effect. There is no doubt that every
      really well-educated man ought to see Florence, Venice and Rome. This
      travel has, also, the additional advantage of providing many subjects of
      conversation in society, and of giving one an opportunity for bringing
      forward artistic generalities which appear profound.

This time I went alone, and I arrived at Genoa at the same time as the
      year before, but without any adventure on the road. I went to the same
      hotel, and actually happened to have the same room.

I was hardly in bed when the recollection of Francesca which, since the
      evening before, had been floating vaguely through my mind, haunted me with
      strange persistency. I thought of her nearly the whole night, and by
      degrees the wish to see her again seized me, a confused desire at first,
      which gradually grew stronger and more intense. At last I made up my mind
      to spend the next day in Genoa to try to find her, and if I should not
      succeed, to take the evening train.

Early in the morning I set out on my search. I remembered the directions
      she had given me when she left me, perfectly—Victor-Emmanuel Street,
      house of the furniture-dealer, at the bottom of the yard on the right.

I found it without the least difficulty, and I knocked at the door of a
      somewhat dilapidated-looking dwelling. It was opened by a stout woman, who
      must have been very handsome, but who actually was only very dirty.
      Although she had too much embonpoint, she still bore the lines of majestic
      beauty; her untidy hair fell over her forehead and shoulders, and one
      fancied one could see her floating about in an enormous dressing-gown
      covered with spots of dirt and grease. Round her neck she wore a great
      gilt necklace, and on her wrists were splendid bracelets of Genoa filigree
      work.

In rather a hostile manner she asked me what I wanted, and I replied by
      requesting her to tell me whether Francesca Rondoli lived there.

I hesitated a moment, and then I told her. I had hardly done so when the
      Italian put out her arms as if to embrace me. “Oh! you are the
      Frenchman how glad I am to see you! But what grief you caused the poor
      child! She waited for you a month; yes, a whole month. At first she
      thought you would come to fetch her. She wanted to see whether you loved
      her. If you only knew how she cried when she saw that you were not coming!
      She cried till she seemed to have no tears left. Then she went to the
      hotel, but you had gone. She thought that most likely you were travelling
      in Italy, and that you would return by Genoa to fetch her, as she would
      not go with you. And she waited more than a month, monsieur; and she was
      so unhappy; so unhappy. I am her mother.”

“She has gone to Paris with a painter, a delightful man, who loves
      her very much, and who gives her everything that she wants. Just look at
      what she sent me; they are very pretty, are they not?”

And she showed me, with quite southern animation, her heavy bracelets and
      necklace. “I have also,” she continued, “earrings with
      stones in them, a silk dress, and some rings; but I only wear them on
      grand occasions. Oh! she is very happy, monsieur, very happy. She will be
      so pleased when I tell her you have been here. But pray come in and sit
      down. You will take something or other, surely?”

But I refused, as I now wished to get away by the first train; but she
      took me by the arm and pulled me in, saying:

She continued: “Oh, she is very happy now, very happy. When you met
      her in the train she was very miserable; she had had an unfortunate love
      affair in Marseilles, and she was coming home, poor child. But she liked
      you at once, though she was still rather sad, you understand. Now she has
      all she wants, and she writes and tells me everything that she does. His
      name is Bellemin, and they say he is a great painter in your country. He
      fell in love with her at first sight. But you will take a glass of
      sirup?-it is very good. Are you quite alone, this year?”

I felt an increasing inclination to laugh, as my first disappointment was
      dispelled by what Mother Rondoli said. I was obliged; however, to drink a
      glass of her sirup.

“So you are quite alone?” she continued. “How sorry I am
      that Francesca is not here now; she would have been company for you all
      the time you stayed. It is not very amusing to go about all by oneself,
      and she will be very sorry also.”

“But would you not like Carlotta to go with you? She knows all the
      walks very well. She is my second daughter, monsieur.”

No doubt she took my look of surprise for consent, for she opened the
      inner door and called out up the dark stairs which I could not see:

“No; she will be very glad to go with you; she is very nice, and
      much more cheerful than her sister, and she is a good girl, a very good
      girl, whom I love very much.”

In a few moments a tall, slender, dark girl appeared, her hair hanging
      down, and her youthful figure showing unmistakably beneath an old dress of
      her mother''s.

“This is Francesca''s Frenchman, you know, the one whom she knew last
      year. He is quite alone, and has come to look for her, poor fellow; so I
      told him that you would go with him to keep him company.”

Her mother pushed her out. “Go and get dressed directly; put on your
      blue dress and your hat with the flowers, and make haste.”

As soon as she had left the room the old woman explained herself: “I
      have two others, but they are much younger. It costs a lot of money to
      bring up four children. Luckily the eldest is off my hands at present.”

Then she told all about herself, about her husband, who had been an
      employee on the railway, but who was dead, and she expatiated on the good
      qualities of Carlotta, her second girl, who soon returned, dressed, as her
      sister had been, in a striking, peculiar manner.

“Now, my children, you can go.” Then turning to the girl, she
      said: “Be sure you are back by ten o''clock to-night; you know the
      door is locked then.” The answer was:

She took my arm and we went wandering about the streets, just as I had
      wandered the previous year with her sister.

We returned to the hotel for lunch, and then I took my new friend to Santa
      Margarita, just as I had taken her sister the year previously.

During the whole fortnight which I had at my disposal, I took Carlotta to
      all the places of interest in and about Genoa. She gave me no cause to
      regret her sister.

She cried when I left her, and the morning of my departure I gave her four
      bracelets for her mother, besides a substantial token of my affection for
      herself.

One of these days I intend to return to Italy, and I cannot help
      remembering with a certain amount of uneasiness, mingled with hope, that
      Madame Rondoli has two more daughters.

Monsieur Lantin had met the young girl at a reception at the house of the
      second head of his department, and had fallen head over heels in love with
      her.

She was the daughter of a provincial tax collector, who had been dead
      several years. She and her mother came to live in Paris, where the latter,
      who made the acquaintance of some of the families in her neighborhood,
      hoped to find a husband for her daughter.

The young girl was a perfect type of the virtuous woman in whose hands
      every sensible young man dreams of one day intrusting his happiness. Her
      simple beauty had the charm of angelic modesty, and the imperceptible
      smile which constantly hovered about the lips seemed to be the reflection
      of a pure and lovely soul. Her praises resounded on every side. People
      never tired of repeating: “Happy the man who wins her love! He could
      not find a better wife.”

Monsieur Lantin, then chief clerk in the Department of the Interior,
      enjoyed a snug little salary of three thousand five hundred francs, and he
      proposed to this model young girl, and was accepted.

He was unspeakably happy with her. She governed his household with such
      clever economy that they seemed to live in luxury. She lavished the most
      delicate attentions on her husband, coaxed and fondled him; and so great
      was her charm that six years after their marriage, Monsieur Lantin
      discovered that he loved his wife even more than during the first days of
      their honeymoon.

He found fault with only two of her tastes: Her love for the theatre, and
      her taste for imitation jewelry. Her friends (the wives of some petty
      officials) frequently procured for her a box at the theatre, often for the
      first representations of the new plays; and her husband was obliged to
      accompany her, whether he wished it or not, to these entertainments which
      bored him excessively after his day''s work at the office.

After a time, Monsieur Lantin begged his wife to request some lady of her
      acquaintance to accompany her, and to bring her home after the theatre.
      She opposed this arrangement, at first; but, after much persuasion,
      finally consented, to the infinite delight of her husband.

Now, with her love for the theatre, came also the desire for ornaments.
      Her costumes remained as before, simple, in good taste, and always modest;
      but she soon began to adorn her ears with huge rhinestones, which
      glittered and sparkled like real diamonds. Around her neck she wore
      strings of false pearls, on her arms bracelets of imitation gold, and
      combs set with glass jewels.

“My dear, as you cannot afford to buy real jewelry, you ought to
      appear adorned with your beauty and modesty alone, which are the rarest
      ornaments of your sex.”

“What can I do? I am so fond of jewelry. It is my only weakness. We
      cannot change our nature.”

Then she would wind the pearl necklace round her fingers, make the facets
      of the crystal gems sparkle, and say:

Sometimes, of an evening, when they were enjoying a tete-a-tete by the
      fireside, she would place on the tea table the morocco leather box
      containing the “trash,” as Monsieur Lantin called it. She
      would examine the false gems with a passionate attention, as though they
      imparted some deep and secret joy; and she often persisted in passing a
      necklace around her husband''s neck, and, laughing heartily, would exclaim:
      “How droll you look!” Then she would throw herself into his
      arms, and kiss him affectionately.

One evening, in winter, she had been to the opera, and returned home
      chilled through and through. The next morning she coughed, and eight days
      later she died of inflammation of the lungs.

Monsieur Lantin''s despair was so great that his hair became white in one
      month. He wept unceasingly; his heart was broken as he remembered her
      smile, her voice, every charm of his dead wife.

Time did not assuage his grief. Often, during office hours, while his
      colleagues were discussing the topics of the day, his eyes would suddenly
      fill with tears, and he would give vent to his grief in heartrending sobs.
      Everything in his wife''s room remained as it was during her lifetime; all
      her furniture, even her clothing, being left as it was on the day of her
      death. Here he was wont to seclude himself daily and think of her who had
      been his treasure-the joy of his existence.

But life soon became a struggle. His income, which, in the hands of his
      wife, covered all household expenses, was now no longer sufficient for his
      own immediate wants; and he wondered how she could have managed to buy
      such excellent wine and the rare delicacies which he could no longer
      procure with his modest resources.

He incurred some debts, and was soon reduced to absolute poverty. One
      morning, finding himself without a cent in his pocket, he resolved to sell
      something, and immediately the thought occurred to him of disposing of his
      wife''s paste jewels, for he cherished in his heart a sort of rancor
      against these “deceptions,” which had always irritated him in
      the past. The very sight of them spoiled, somewhat, the memory of his lost
      darling.

To the last days of her life she had continued to make purchases, bringing
      home new gems almost every evening, and he turned them over some time
      before finally deciding to sell the heavy necklace, which she seemed to
      prefer, and which, he thought, ought to be worth about six or seven
      francs; for it was of very fine workmanship, though only imitation.

He put it in his pocket, and started out in search of what seemed a
      reliable jeweler''s shop. At length he found one, and went in, feeling a
      little ashamed to expose his misery, and also to offer such a worthless
      article for sale.

The man took the necklace, examined it, called his clerk, and made some
      remarks in an undertone; he then put the ornament back on the counter, and
      looked at it from a distance to judge of the effect.

Monsieur Lantin, annoyed at all these ceremonies, was on the point of
      saying: “Oh! I know well enough it is not worth anything,”
      when the jeweler said: “Sir, that necklace is worth from twelve to
      fifteen thousand francs; but I could not buy it, unless you can tell me
      exactly where it came from.”

The widower opened his eyes wide and remained gaping, not comprehending
      the merchant''s meaning. Finally he stammered: “You say—are you
      sure?” The other replied, drily: “You can try elsewhere and
      see if any one will offer you more. I consider it worth fifteen thousand
      at the most. Come back; here, if you cannot do better.”

Monsieur Lantin, beside himself with astonishment, took up the necklace
      and left the store. He wished time for reflection.

Once outside, he felt inclined to laugh, and said to himself: “The
      fool! Oh, the fool! Had I only taken him at his word! That jeweler cannot
      distinguish real diamonds from the imitation article.”

A few minutes after, he entered another store, in the Rue de la Paix. As
      soon as the proprietor glanced at the necklace, he cried out:

“Well, I sold it for twenty thousand francs. I am willing to take it
      back for eighteen thousand, when you inform me, according to our legal
      formality, how it came to be in your possession.”

“But—but—examine it well. Until this moment I was under
      the impression that it was imitation.”

“Lantin—I am in the employ of the Minister of the Interior. I
      live at number sixteen Rue des Martyrs.”

The merchant looked through his books, found the entry, and said: “That
      necklace was sent to Madame Lantin''s address, sixteen Rue des Martyrs,
      July 20, 1876.”

The two men looked into each other''s eyes—the widower speechless
      with astonishment; the jeweler scenting a thief. The latter broke the
      silence.

“Will you leave this necklace here for twenty-four hours?”
      said he; “I will give you a receipt.”

Monsieur Lantin answered hastily: “Yes, certainly.” Then,
      putting the ticket in his pocket, he left the store.

He wandered aimlessly through the streets, his mind in a state of dreadful
      confusion. He tried to reason, to understand. His wife could not afford to
      purchase such a costly ornament. Certainly not.

But, then, it must have been a present!—a present!—a present,
      from whom? Why was it given her?

He stopped, and remained standing in the middle of the street. A horrible
      doubt entered his mind—She? Then, all the other jewels must have
      been presents, too! The earth seemed to tremble beneath him—the tree
      before him to be falling; he threw up his arms, and fell to the ground,
      unconscious. He recovered his senses in a pharmacy, into which the
      passers-by had borne him. He asked to be taken home, and, when he reached
      the house, he shut himself up in his room, and wept until nightfall.
      Finally, overcome with fatigue, he went to bed and fell into a heavy
      sleep.

The sun awoke him next morning, and he began to dress slowly to go to the
      office. It was hard to work after such shocks. He sent a letter to his
      employer, requesting to be excused. Then he remembered that he had to
      return to the jeweler''s. He did not like the idea; but he could not leave
      the necklace with that man. He dressed and went out.

It was a lovely day; a clear, blue sky smiled on the busy city below. Men
      of leisure were strolling about with their hands in their pockets.

Monsieur Lantin, observing them, said to himself: “The rich, indeed,
      are happy. With money it is possible to forget even the deepest sorrow.
      One can go where one pleases, and in travel find that distraction which is
      the surest cure for grief. Oh if I were only rich!”

He perceived that he was hungry, but his pocket was empty. He again
      remembered the necklace. Eighteen thousand francs! Eighteen thousand
      francs! What a sum!

He soon arrived in the Rue de la Paix, opposite the jeweler''s. Eighteen
      thousand francs! Twenty times he resolved to go in, but shame kept him
      back. He was hungry, however—very hungry—and not a cent in his
      pocket. He decided quickly, ran across the street, in order not to have
      time for reflection, and rushed into the store.

The proprietor immediately came forward, and politely offered him a chair;
      the clerks glanced at him knowingly.

“I have made inquiries, Monsieur Lantin,” said the jeweler,
      “and if you are still resolved to dispose of the gems, I am ready to
      pay you the price I offered.”

Whereupon the proprietor took from a drawer eighteen large bills, counted,
      and handed them to Monsieur Lantin, who signed a receipt; and, with
      trembling hand, put the money into his pocket.

As he was about to leave the store, he turned toward the merchant, who
      still wore the same knowing smile, and lowering his eyes, said:

Monsieur Lantin said gravely: “I will bring them to you.” An
      hour later, he returned with the gems.

The large diamond earrings were worth twenty thousand francs; the
      bracelets, thirty-five thousand; the rings, sixteen thousand; a set of
      emeralds and sapphires, fourteen thousand; a gold chain with solitaire
      pendant, forty thousand—making the sum of one hundred and
      forty-three thousand francs.

That day he lunched at Voisin''s, and drank wine worth twenty francs a
      bottle. Then he hired a carriage and made a tour of the Bois. He gazed at
      the various turnouts with a kind of disdain, and could hardly refrain from
      crying out to the occupants:

“Sir, I have come to resign my position. I have just inherited three
      hundred thousand francs.”

He shook hands with his former colleagues, and confided to them some of
      his projects for the future; he then went off to dine at the Cafe Anglais.

He seated himself beside a gentleman of aristocratic bearing; and, during
      the meal, informed the latter confidentially that he had just inherited a
      fortune of four hundred thousand francs.

For the first time in his life, he was not bored at the theatre, and spent
      the remainder of the night in a gay frolic.

Six months afterward, he married again. His second wife was a very
      virtuous woman; but had a violent temper. She caused him much sorrow.

I can tell you neither the name of the country, nor the name of the man.
      It was a long, long way from here on a fertile and burning shore. We had
      been walking since the morning along the coast, with the blue sea bathed
      in sunlight on one side of us, and the shore covered with crops on the
      other. Flowers were growing quite close to the waves, those light, gentle,
      lulling waves. It was very warm, a soft warmth permeated with the odor of
      the rich, damp, fertile soil. One fancied one was inhaling germs.

I had been told, that evening, that I should meet with hospitality at the
      house of a Frenchman who lived in an orange grove at the end of a
      promontory. Who was he? I did not know. He had come there one morning ten
      years before, and had bought land which he planted with vines and sowed
      with grain. He had worked, this man, with passionate energy, with fury.
      Then as he went on from month to month, year to year, enlarging his
      boundaries, cultivating incessantly the strong virgin soil, he accumulated
      a fortune by his indefatigable labor.

But he kept on working, they said. Rising at daybreak, he would remain in
      the fields till evening, superintending everything without ceasing,
      tormented by one fixed idea, the insatiable desire for money, which
      nothing can quiet, nothing satisfy. He now appeared to be very rich. The
      sun was setting as I reached his house. It was situated as described, at
      the end of a promontory in the midst of a grove of orange trees. It was a
      large square house, quite plain, and overlooked the sea. As I approached,
      a man wearing a long beard appeared in the doorway. Having greeted him, I
      asked if he would give me shelter for the night. He held out his hand and
      said, smiling:

He led me into a room, and put a man servant at my disposal with the
      perfect ease and familiar graciousness of a man-of-the-world. Then he left
      me saying:

We took dinner, sitting opposite each other, on a terrace facing the sea.
      I began to talk about this rich, distant, unknown land. He smiled, as he
      replied carelessly:

“Yes, this country is beautiful. But no country satisfies one when
      they are far from the one they love.”

And gradually we began to talk of French society, of the boulevards, and
      things Parisian. He asked me questions that showed he knew all about these
      things, mentioned names, all the familiar names in vaudeville known on the
      sidewalks.

“Always the same crowd, except those who died.” I looked at
      him attentively, haunted by a vague recollection. I certainly had seen
      that head somewhere. But where? And when? He seemed tired, although he was
      vigorous; and sad, although he was determined. His long, fair beard fell
      on his chest. He was somewhat bald and had heavy eyebrows and a thick
      mustache.

The sun was sinking into the sea, turning the vapor from the earth into a
      fiery mist. The orange blossoms exhaled their powerful, delicious
      fragrance. He seemed to see nothing besides me, and gazing steadfastly he
      appeared to discover in the depths of my mind the far-away, beloved and
      well-known image of the wide, shady pavement leading from the Madeleine to
      the Rue Drouot.

But he ceased abruptly: And then, in a changed voice, his face suddenly
      turning pale, he continued:

And he preceded me into the house. The downstairs rooms were enormous,
      bare and mournful, and had a deserted look. Plates and glasses were
      scattered on the tables, left there by the dark-skinned servants who
      wandered incessantly about this spacious dwelling.

Two rifles were banging from two nails, on the wall; and in the corners of
      the rooms were spades, fishing poles, dried palm leaves, every imaginable
      thing set down at random when people came home in the evening and ready to
      hand when they went out at any time, or went to work.

“This is the dwelling, or rather the kennel, of an exile, but my own
      room is cleaner. Let us go there.”

As I entered I thought I was in a second-hand store, it was so full of
      things of all descriptions, strange things of various kinds that one felt
      must be souvenirs. On the walls were two pretty paintings by well-known
      artists, draperies, weapons, swords and pistols, and exactly in the
      middle, on the principal panel, a square of white satin in a gold frame.

Somewhat surprised, I approached to look at it, and perceived a hairpin
      fastened in the centre of the glossy satin. My host placed his hand on my
      shoulder.

“That,” said he, “is the only thing that I look at here,
      and the only thing that I have seen for ten years. M. Prudhomme said:
      ''This sword is the most memorable day of my life.'' I can say: ''This
      hairpin is all my life.''”

“But come out on my balcony. A name rose to my lips just now which I
      dared not utter; for if you had said ''Dead'' as you did of Sophie Astier, I
      should have fired a bullet into my brain, this very day.”

We had gone out on the wide balcony from whence we could see two gulfs,
      one to the right and the other to the left, enclosed by high gray
      mountains. It was just twilight and the reflection of the sunset still
      lingered in the sky.

“Why, I have nothing to tell. She is one of the most charming women,
      or, rather, girls, and the most admired in Paris. She leads a delightful
      existence and lives like a princess, that is all.”

“I love her,” he murmured in a tone in which he might have
      said “I am going to die.” Then suddenly he continued:

“Ah! For three years we lived in a state of terror and delight. I
      almost killed her five or six times. She tried to pierce my eyes with that
      hairpin that you saw just now. Look, do you see that little white spot
      beneath my left eye? We loved each other. How can I explain that
      infatuation? You would not understand it.”

“There must be a simple form of love, the result of the mutual
      impulse of two hearts and two souls. But there is also assuredly an
      atrocious form, that tortures one cruelly, the result of the occult
      blending of two unlike personalities who detest each other at the same
      time that they adore one another.”

“In three years this woman had ruined me. I had four million francs
      which she squandered in her calm manner, quietly, eat them up with a
      gentle smile that seemed to fall from her eyes on to her lips.”

“You know her? There is something irresistible about her. What is
      it? I do not know. Is it those gray eyes whose glance penetrates you like
      a gimlet and remains there like the point of an arrow? It is more likely
      the gentle, indifferent and fascinating smile that she wears like a mask.
      Her slow grace pervades you little by little; exhales from her like a
      perfume, from her slim figure that scarcely sways as she passes you, for
      she seems to glide rather than walk; from her pretty voice with its slight
      drawl that would seem to be the music of her smile; from her gestures,
      also, which are never exaggerated, but always appropriate, and intoxicate
      your vision with their harmony. For three years she was the only being
      that existed for me on the earth! How I suffered; for she deceived me as
      she deceived everyone! Why? For no reason; just for the pleasure of
      deceiving. And when I found it out, when I treated her as a common girl
      and a beggar, she said quietly: ''Are we married?''

“Since I have been here I have thought so much about her that at
      last I understand her. She is Manon Lescaut come back to life. It is
      Marion, who could not love without deceiving; Marion for whom love,
      amusement, money, are all one.”

“''You understand, my dear boy, that I cannot live on air and
      weather. I love you very much, better than anyone, but I must live.
      Poverty and I could not keep house together.”

“And if I should tell you what a horrible life I led with her! When
      I looked at her I would just as soon have killed her as kissed her. When I
      looked at her . . . I felt a furious desire to open my arms to embrace and
      strangle her. She had, back of her eyes, something false and intangible
      that made me execrate her; and that was, perhaps, the reason I loved her
      so well. The eternal feminine, the odious and seductive feminine, was
      stronger in her than in any other woman. She was full of it, overcharged,
      as with a venomous and intoxicating fluid. She was a woman to a greater
      extent than any one has ever been.”

“And when I went out with her she would look at all men in such a
      manner that she seemed to offer herself to each in a single glance. This
      exasperated me, and still it attached me to her all the more. This
      creature in just walking along the street belonged to everyone, in spite
      of me, in spite of herself, by the very fact of her nature, although she
      had a modest, gentle carriage. Do you understand?

“And what torture! At the theatre, at the restaurant she seemed to
      belong to others under my very eyes. And as soon as I left her she did
      belong to others.

“Parbleu! I now have here, in land and money, seven to eight
      thousand francs. When I reach a million I shall sell out and go away. I
      shall have enough to live on with her for a year—one whole year. And
      then, good-bye, my life will be finished.”

“After that, I do not know. That will be all, I may possibly ask her
      to take me as a valet de chambre.”

“Almost nothing. Many courtesans are born to be virtuous women, they
      say; and many women called virtuous are born to be courtesans—is
      that not so? Now, Madame Samoris, who was born a courtesan, had a daughter
      born a virtuous woman, that''s all.”

“I''ll—explain what I mean. The comtesse is nothing but a
      common, ordinary parvenue originating no one knows where. A Hungarian or
      Wallachian countess or I know not what. She appeared one winter in
      apartments she had taken in the Champs Elysees, that quarter for
      adventurers and adventuresses, and opened her drawing-room to the first
      comer or to any one that turned up.

“I went there. Why? you will say. I really can''t tell you. I went
      there, as every one goes to such places because the women are facile and
      the men are dishonest. You know that set composed of filibusters with
      varied decorations, all noble, all titled, all unknown at the embassies,
      with the exception of those who are spies. All talk of their honor without
      the slightest occasion for doing so, boast of their ancestors, tell you
      about their lives, braggarts, liars, sharpers, as dangerous as the false
      cards they have up their sleeves, as delusive as their names—in
      short, the aristocracy of the bagnio.

“I adore these people. They are interesting to study, interesting to
      know, amusing to understand, often clever, never commonplace like public
      functionaries. Their wives are always pretty, with a slight flavor of
      foreign roguery, with the mystery of their existence, half of it perhaps
      spent in a house of correction. They have, as a rule, magnificent eyes and
      incredible hair. I adore them also.

“Madame Samoris is the type of these adventuresses, elegant, mature
      and still beautiful. Charming feline creatures, you feel that they are
      vicious to the marrow of their bones. You find them very amusing when you
      visit them; they give card parties; they have dances and suppers; in
      short, they offer you all the pleasures of social life.

“And she had a daughter—a tall, fine-looking girl, always
      ready for amusement, always full of laughter and reckless gaiety—a
      true adventuress'' daughter—but, at the same time, an innocent,
      unsophisticated, artless girl, who saw nothing, knew nothing, understood
      nothing of all the things that happened in her father''s house.

“The girl was simply a puzzle to me. She was a mystery. She lived
      amid those infamous surroundings with a quiet, tranquil ease that was
      either terribly criminal or else the result of innocence. She sprang from
      the filth of that class like a beautiful flower fed on corruption.”

“How do I know? That''s the funniest part of the business! One
      morning there was a ring at my door, and my valet came up to tell me that
      M. Joseph Bonenthal wanted to speak to me. I said directly:

“''And who is this gentleman?'' My valet replied: ''I don''t know,
      monsieur; perhaps ''tis some one that wants employment.'' And so it was. The
      man wanted me to take him as a servant. I asked him where he had been
      last. He answered: ''With the Comtesse Samoris.'' ''Ah!'' said I, ''but my
      house is not a bit like hers.'' ''I know that well, monsieur,'' he said, ''and
      that''s the very reason I want to take service with monsieur. I''ve had
      enough of these people: a man may stay a little while with them, but he
      won''t remain long with them.'' I required an additional man servant at the
      time and so I took him.

“A month later Mademoiselle Yvette Samoris died mysteriously, and
      here are all the details of her death I could gather from Joseph, who got
      them from his sweetheart, the comtesse''s chambermaid.

“It was a ball night, and two newly arrived guests were chatting
      behind a door. Mademoiselle Yvette, who had just been dancing, leaned
      against this door to get a little air.

“They did not see her approaching, but she heard what they were
      saying. And this was what they said:

“''That English prince standing near the window; Madame Samoris
      adores him. But her adoration of any one never lasts longer than a month
      or six weeks. Nevertheless, as you see, she has a large circle of
      admirers. All are called—and nearly all are chosen. That kind of
      thing costs a good deal, but—hang it, what can you expect?''

“''From the only man perhaps that she ever loved—a Jewish
      banker from Berlin who goes by the name of Samuel Morris.''

“What a shock this was to the mind of a young girl endowed with all
      the instincts of a virtuous woman! What despair overwhelmed that simple
      soul! What mental tortures quenched her unbounded gaiety, her delightful
      laughter, her exultant satisfaction with life! What a conflict took place
      in that youthful heart up to the moment when the last guest had left!
      Those were things that Joseph could not tell me. But, the same night,
      Yvette abruptly entered her mother''s room just as the comtesse was getting
      into bed, sent out the lady''s maid, who was close to the door, and,
      standing erect and pale and with great staring eyes, she said:

“The comtesse was so stunned that she did not know what to say in
      reply at first. When she recovered her self-possession she denied
      everything and called God to witness that there was no truth in the story.

“I remember distinctly the strange alteration that then took place
      in her. She became grave and melancholy. She would fix on us her great
      earnest eyes as if she wanted to read what was at the bottom of our
      hearts. We did not know what to think of her and used to imagine that she
      was looking out for a husband.

“One evening she overheard her mother talking to her admirer and
      later saw them together, and her doubts were confirmed. She was
      heartbroken, and after telling her mother what she had seen, she said
      coldly, like a man of business laying down the terms of an agreement:

“''Here is what I have determined to do, mamma: We will both go away
      to some little town, or rather into the country. We will live there
      quietly as well as we can. Your jewelry alone may be called a fortune. If
      you wish to marry some honest man, so much the better; still better will
      it be if I can find one. If you don''t consent to do this, I will kill
      myself.''

“This time the comtesse ordered her daughter to go to bed and never
      to speak again in this manner, so unbecoming in the mouth of a child
      toward her mother.

“Yvette''s answer to this was: ''I give you a month to reflect. If, at
      the end of that month, we have not changed our way of living, I will kill
      myself, since there is no other honorable issue left to my life.''

“At the end of a month the Comtesse Samoris had resumed her usual
      entertainments, as though nothing had occurred. One day, under the pretext
      that she had a bad toothache, Yvette purchased a few drops of chloroform
      from a neighboring chemist. The next day she purchased more, and every
      time she went out she managed to procure small doses of the narcotic. She
      filled a bottle with it.

“One morning she was found in bed, lifeless and already quite cold,
      with a cotton mask soaked in chloroform over her face.

“Her coffin was covered with flowers, the church was hung in white.
      There was a large crowd at the funeral ceremony.

“Ah! well, if I had known—but you never can know—I would
      have married that girl, for she was infernally pretty.”

“Oh! she shed a lot of tears over it. She has only begun to receive
      visits again for the past week.”

“Oh! they pretended that it was an accident caused by a new stove,
      the mechanism of which got out of order. As a good many such accidents
      have occurred, the thing seemed probable enough.”

The widow of Paolo Saverini lived alone with her son in a poor little
      house on the outskirts of Bonifacio. The town, built on an outjutting part
      of the mountain, in places even overhanging the sea, looks across the
      straits, full of sandbanks, towards the southernmost coast of Sardinia.
      Beneath it, on the other side and almost surrounding it, is a cleft in the
      cliff like an immense corridor which serves as a harbor, and along it the
      little Italian and Sardinian fishing boats come by a circuitous route
      between precipitous cliffs as far as the first houses, and every two weeks
      the old, wheezy steamer which makes the trip to Ajaccio.

On the white mountain the houses, massed together, makes an even whiter
      spot. They look like the nests of wild birds, clinging to this peak,
      overlooking this terrible passage, where vessels rarely venture. The wind,
      which blows uninterruptedly, has swept bare the forbidding coast; it
      drives through the narrow straits and lays waste both sides. The pale
      streaks of foam, clinging to the black rocks, whose countless peaks rise
      up out of the water, look like bits of rag floating and drifting on the
      surface of the sea.

The house of widow Saverini, clinging to the very edge of the precipice,
      looks out, through its three windows, over this wild and desolate picture.

She lived there alone, with her son Antonia and their dog “Semillante,”
      a big, thin beast, with a long rough coat, of the sheep-dog breed. The
      young man took her with him when out hunting.

One night, after some kind of a quarrel, Antoine Saverini was
      treacherously stabbed by Nicolas Ravolati, who escaped the same evening to
      Sardinia.

When the old mother received the body of her child, which the neighbors
      had brought back to her, she did not cry, but she stayed there for a long
      time motionless, watching him. Then, stretching her wrinkled hand over the
      body, she promised him a vendetta. She did not wish anybody near her, and
      she shut herself up beside the body with the dog, which howled
      continuously, standing at the foot of the bed, her head stretched towards
      her master and her tail between her legs. She did not move any more than
      did the mother, who, now leaning over the body with a blank stare, was
      weeping silently and watching it.

The young man, lying on his back, dressed in his jacket of coarse cloth,
      torn at the chest, seemed to be asleep. But he had blood all over him; on
      his shirt, which had been torn off in order to administer the first aid;
      on his vest, on his trousers, on his face, on his hands. Clots of blood
      had hardened in his beard and in his hair.

“Never fear, my boy, my little baby, you shall be avenged. Sleep,
      sleep; you shall be avenged. Do you hear? It''s your mother''s promise! And
      she always keeps her word, your mother does, you know she does.”

Antoine Saverini was buried the next day and soon his name ceased to be
      mentioned in Bonifacio.

He had neither brothers nor cousins. No man was there to carry on the
      vendetta. His mother, the old woman, alone pondered over it.

On the other side of the straits she saw, from morning until night, a
      little white speck on the coast. It was the little Sardinian village
      Longosardo, where Corsican criminals take refuge when they are too closely
      pursued. They compose almost the entire population of this hamlet,
      opposite their native island, awaiting the time to return, to go back to
      the “maquis.” She knew that Nicolas Ravolati had sought refuge
      in this village.

All alone, all day long, seated at her window, she was looking over there
      and thinking of revenge. How could she do anything without help—she,
      an invalid and so near death? But she had promised, she had sworn on the
      body. She could not forget, she could not wait. What could she do? She no
      longer slept at night; she had neither rest nor peace of mind; she thought
      persistently. The dog, dozing at her feet, would sometimes lift her head
      and howl. Since her master''s death she often howled thus, as though she
      were calling him, as though her beast''s soul, inconsolable too, had also
      retained a recollection that nothing could wipe out.

One night, as Semillante began to howl, the mother suddenly got hold of an
      idea, a savage, vindictive, fierce idea. She thought it over until
      morning. Then, having arisen at daybreak she went to church. She prayed,
      prostrate on the floor, begging the Lord to help her, to support her, to
      give to her poor, broken-down body the strength which she needed in order
      to avenge her son.

She returned home. In her yard she had an old barrel, which acted as a
      cistern. She turned it over, emptied it, made it fast to the ground with
      sticks and stones. Then she chained Semillante to this improvised kennel
      and went into the house.

She walked ceaselessly now, her eyes always fixed on the distant coast of
      Sardinia. He was over there, the murderer.

All day and all night the dog howled. In the morning the old woman brought
      her some water in a bowl, but nothing more; no soup, no bread.

Another day went by. Semillante, exhausted, was sleeping. The following
      day her eyes were shining, her hair on end and she was pulling wildly at
      her chain.

All this day the old woman gave her nothing to eat. The beast, furious,
      was barking hoarsely. Another night went by.

Then, at daybreak, Mother Saverini asked a neighbor for some straw. She
      took the old rags which had formerly been worn by her husband and stuffed
      them so as to make them look like a human body.

Having planted a stick in the ground, in front of Semillante''s kennel, she
      tied to it this dummy, which seemed to be standing up. Then she made a
      head out of some old rags.

The dog, surprised, was watching this straw man, and was quiet, although
      famished. Then the old woman went to the store and bought a piece of black
      sausage. When she got home she started a fire in the yard, near the
      kennel, and cooked the sausage. Semillante, frantic, was jumping about,
      frothing at the mouth, her eyes fixed on the food, the odor of which went
      right to her stomach.

Then the mother made of the smoking sausage a necktie for the dummy. She
      tied it very tight around the neck with string, and when she had finished
      she untied the dog.

With one leap the beast jumped at the dummy''s throat, and with her paws on
      its shoulders she began to tear at it. She would fall back with a piece of
      food in her mouth, then would jump again, sinking her fangs into the
      string, and snatching few pieces of meat she would fall back again and
      once more spring forward. She was tearing up the face with her teeth and
      the whole neck was in tatters.

The old woman, motionless and silent, was watching eagerly. Then she
      chained the beast up again, made her fast for two more days and began this
      strange performance again.

For three months she accustomed her to this battle, to this meal conquered
      by a fight. She no longer chained her up, but just pointed to the dummy.

She had taught her to tear him up and to devour him without even leaving
      any traces in her throat.

As soon as she saw the man, Semillante would begin to tremble. Then she
      would look up to her mistress, who, lifting her finger, would cry, “Go!”
      in a shrill tone.

When she thought that the proper time had come, the widow went to
      confession and, one Sunday morning she partook of communion with an
      ecstatic fervor. Then, putting on men''s clothes and looking like an old
      tramp, she struck a bargain with a Sardinian fisherman who carried her and
      her dog to the other side of the straits.

In a bag she had a large piece of sausage. Semillante had had nothing to
      eat for two days. The old woman kept letting her smell the food and
      whetting her appetite.

They got to Longosardo. The Corsican woman walked with a limp. She went to
      a baker''s shop and asked for Nicolas Ravolati. He had taken up his old
      trade, that of carpenter. He was working alone at the back of his store.

The maddened animal sprang for his throat. The man stretched out his arms,
      clasped the dog and rolled to the ground. For a few seconds he squirmed,
      beating the ground with his feet. Then he stopped moving, while Semillante
      dug her fangs into his throat and tore it to ribbons. Two neighbors,
      seated before their door, remembered perfectly having seen an old beggar
      come out with a thin, black dog which was eating something that its master
      was giving him.

I had just taken possession of my room in the hotel, a narrow den between
      two papered partitions, through which I could hear every sound made by my
      neighbors; and I was beginning to arrange my clothes and linen in the
      wardrobe with a long mirror, when I opened the drawer which is in this
      piece of furniture. I immediately noticed a roll of paper. Having opened
      it, I spread it out before me, and read this title:

It was the diary of a guest at the watering place, of the last occupant of
      my room, and had been forgotten at the moment of departure.

These notes may be of some interest to sensible and healthy persons who
      never leave their own homes. It is for their benefit that I transcribe
      them without altering a letter.

“At the first glance it is not lively, this country. However, I am
      going to spend twenty-five days here, to have my liver and stomach
      treated, and to get thin. The twenty-five days of any one taking the baths
      are very like the twenty-eight days of the reserves; they are all devoted
      to fatigue duty, severe fatigue duty. To-day I have done nothing as yet; I
      have been getting settled. I have made the acquaintance of the locality
      and of the doctor. Chatel-Guyon consists of a stream in which flows yellow
      water, in the midst of several hillocks on which are a casino, some
      houses, and some stone crosses. On the bank of the stream, at the end of
      the valley, may be seen a square building surrounded by a little garden;
      this is the bathing establishment. Sad people wander around this building—the
      invalids. A great silence reigns in the walks shaded by trees, for this is
      not a pleasure resort, but a true health resort; one takes care of one''s
      health as a business, and one gets well, so it seems.

“Those who know affirm, even, that the mineral springs perform true
      miracles here. However, no votive offering is hung around the cashier''s
      office.

“From time to time a gentleman or a lady comes over to a kiosk with
      a slate roof, which shelters a woman of smiling and gentle aspect, and a
      spring boiling in a basin of cement: Not a word is exchanged between the
      invalid and the female custodian of the healing water. She hands the
      newcomer a little glass in which air bubbles sparkle in the transparent
      liquid. The guest drinks and goes off with a grave step to resume his
      interrupted walk beneath the trees.

“No noise in the little park, no breath of air in the leaves; no
      voice passes through this silence. One ought to write at the entrance to
      this district: ''No one laughs here; they take care of their health.''
