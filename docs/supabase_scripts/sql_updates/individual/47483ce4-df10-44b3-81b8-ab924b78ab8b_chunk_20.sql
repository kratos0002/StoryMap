      taken to my heels like a coward.

“A tall woman dressed in white, stood gazing at me from the back of
      the chair where I had been sitting an instant before.

“Such a shudder ran through all my limbs that I nearly fell
      backward. No one who has not experienced it can understand that frightful,
      unreasoning terror! The mind becomes vague, the heart ceases to beat, the
      entire body grows as limp as a sponge.

“I do not believe in ghosts, nevertheless I collapsed from a hideous
      dread of the dead, and I suffered, oh! I suffered in a few moments more
      than in all the rest of my life from the irresistible terror of the
      supernatural. If she had not spoken I should have died perhaps. But she
      spoke, she spoke in a sweet, sad voice that set my nerves vibrating. I
      dare not say that I became master of myself and recovered my reason. No! I
      was terrified and scarcely knew what I was doing. But a certain innate
      pride, a remnant of soldierly instinct, made me, almost in spite of
      myself, maintain a bold front. She said:

“I wanted to reply, but it was impossible for me to pronounce a
      word. Only a vague sound came from my throat. She continued:

“''Will you? You can save me, cure me. I suffer frightfully. I
      suffer, oh! how I suffer!'' and she slowly seated herself in my armchair,
      still looking at me.

“''Comb my hair, oh! comb my hair; that will cure me; it must be
      combed. Look at my head—how I suffer; and my hair pulls so!''

“Her hair, unbound, very long and very black, it seemed to me, hung
      over the back of the armchair and touched the floor.

“Why did I promise? Why did I take that comb with a shudder, and why
      did I hold in my hands her long black hair that gave my skin a frightful
      cold sensation, as though I were handling snakes? I cannot tell.

“I combed her hair. I handled, I know not how, those icy locks. I
      twisted, knotted, and unknotted, and braided them. She sighed, bowed her
      head, seemed happy. Suddenly she said, ''Thank you!'' snatched the comb from
      my hands and fled by the door that I had noticed ajar.

“Left alone, I experienced for several seconds the horrible
      agitation of one who awakens from a nightmare. At length I regained my
      senses. I ran to the window and with a mighty effort burst open the
      shutters, letting a flood of light into the room. Immediately I sprang to
      the door by which that being had departed. I found it closed and
      immovable!

“Then the mad desire to flee overcame me like a panic the panic
      which soldiers know in battle. I seized the three packets of letters on
      the open desk, ran from the room, dashed down the stairs four steps at a
      time, found myself outside, I know not how, and, perceiving my horse a few
      steps off, leaped into the saddle and galloped away.

“I stopped only when I reached Rouen and alighted at my lodgings.
      Throwing the reins to my orderly, I fled to my room and shut myself in to
      reflect. For an hour I anxiously asked myself if I were not the victim of
      a hallucination. Undoubtedly I had had one of those incomprehensible
      nervous attacks those exaltations of mind that give rise to visions and
      are the stronghold of the supernatural. And I was about to believe I had
      seen a vision, had a hallucination, when, as I approached the window, my
      eyes fell, by chance, upon my breast. My military cape was covered with
      long black hairs! One by one, with trembling fingers, I plucked them off
      and threw them away.

“I then called my orderly. I was too disturbed, too upset to go and
      see my friend that day, and I also wished to reflect more fully upon what
      I ought to tell him. I sent him his letters, for which he gave the soldier
      a receipt. He asked after me most particularly, and, on being told I was
      ill—had had a sunstroke—appeared exceedingly anxious. Next
      morning I went to him, determined to tell him the truth. He had gone out
      the evening before and had not yet returned. I called again during the
      day; my friend was still absent. After waiting a week longer without news
      of him, I notified the authorities and a judicial search was instituted.
      Not the slightest trace of his whereabouts or manner of disappearance was
      discovered.

“A minute inspection of the abandoned chateau revealed nothing of a
      suspicious character. There was no indication that a woman had been
      concealed there.

“After fruitless researches all further efforts were abandoned, and
      for fifty-six years I have heard nothing; I know no more than before.”

How strange those old recollections are which haunt us, without our being
      able to get rid of them.

This one is so very old that I cannot understand how it has clung so
      vividly and tenaciously to my memory. Since then I have seen so many
      sinister things, which were either affecting or terrible, that I am
      astonished at not being able to pass a single day without the face of
      Mother Bellflower recurring to my mind''s eye, just as I knew her formerly,
      now so long ago, when I was ten or twelve years old.

She was an old seamstress who came to my parents'' house once a week, every
      Thursday, to mend the linen. My parents lived in one of those country
      houses called chateaux, which are merely old houses with gable roofs, to
      which are attached three or four farms lying around them.

The village, a large village, almost a market town, was a few hundred
      yards away, closely circling the church, a red brick church, black with
      age.

Well, every Thursday Mother Clochette came between half-past six and seven
      in the morning, and went immediately into the linen-room and began to
      work. She was a tall, thin, bearded or rather hairy woman, for she had a
      beard all over her face, a surprising, an unexpected beard, growing in
      improbable tufts, in curly bunches which looked as if they had been sown
      by a madman over that great face of a gendarme in petticoats. She had them
      on her nose, under her nose, round her nose, on her chin, on her cheeks;
      and her eyebrows, which were extraordinarily thick and long, and quite
      gray, bushy and bristling, looked exactly like a pair of mustaches stuck
      on there by mistake.

She limped, not as lame people generally do, but like a ship at anchor.
      When she planted her great, bony, swerving body on her sound leg, she
      seemed to be preparing to mount some enormous wave, and then suddenly she
      dipped as if to disappear in an abyss, and buried herself in the ground.
      Her walk reminded one of a storm, as she swayed about, and her head, which
      was always covered with an enormous white cap, whose ribbons fluttered
      down her back, seemed to traverse the horizon from north to south and from
      south to north, at each step.

I adored Mother Clochette. As soon as I was up I went into the linen-room
      where I found her installed at work, with a foot-warmer under her feet. As
      soon as I arrived, she made me take the foot-warmer and sit upon it, so
      that I might not catch cold in that large, chilly room under the roof.

She told me stories, whilst mending the linen with her long crooked nimble
      fingers; her eyes behind her magnifying spectacles, for age had impaired
      her sight, appeared enormous to me, strangely profound, double.

She had, as far as I can remember the things which she told me and by
      which my childish heart was moved, the large heart of a poor woman. She
      told me what had happened in the village, how a cow had escaped from the
      cow-house and had been found the next morning in front of Prosper Malet''s
      windmill, looking at the sails turning, or about a hen''s egg which had
      been found in the church belfry without any one being able to understand
      what creature had been there to lay it, or the story of Jean-Jean Pila''s
      dog, who had been ten leagues to bring back his master''s breeches which a
      tramp had stolen whilst they were hanging up to dry out of doors, after he
      had been in the rain. She told me these simple adventures
      in such a manner, that in my mind they assumed the proportions of
      never-to-be-forgotten dramas, of grand and mysterious poems; and the ingenious
      stories invented by the poets which my mother told me in the evening, had
      none of the flavor, none of the breadth or vigor of the peasant woman''s
      narratives.

Well, one Tuesday, when I had spent all the morning in listening to Mother
      Clochette, I wanted to go upstairs to her again during the day after
      picking hazelnuts with the manservant in the wood behind the farm. I
      remember it all as clearly as what happened only yesterday.

On opening the door of the linen-room, I saw the old seamstress lying on
      the ground by the side of her chair, with her face to the ground and her
      arms stretched out, but still holding her needle in one hand and one of my
      shirts in the other. One of her legs in a blue stocking, the longer one,
      no doubt, was extended under her chair, and her spectacles glistened
      against the wall, as they had rolled away from her.

I ran away uttering shrill cries. They all came running, and in a few
      minutes I was told that Mother Clochette was dead.

I cannot describe the profound, poignant, terrible emotion which stirred
      my childish heart. I went slowly down into the drawing-room and hid myself
      in a dark corner, in the depths of an immense old armchair, where I knelt
      down and wept. I remained there a long time, no doubt, for night came on.
      Suddenly somebody came in with a lamp, without seeing me, however, and I
      heard my father and mother talking with the medical man, whose voice I
      recognized.

He had been sent for immediately, and he was explaining the causes of the
      accident, of which I understood nothing, however. Then he sat down and had
      a glass of liqueur and a biscuit.

He went on talking, and what he then said will remain engraved on my mind
      until I die! I think that I can give the exact words which he used.

“Ah!” said he, “the poor woman! She broke her leg the
      day of my arrival here, and I had not even had time to wash my hands after
      getting off the diligence before I was sent for in all haste, for it was a
      bad case, very bad.

“She was seventeen, and a pretty girl, very pretty! Would any one
      believe it? I have never told her story before, and nobody except myself
      and one other person who is no longer living in this part of the country
      ever knew it. Now that she is dead, I may be less discreet.

“Just then a young assistant-teacher came to live in the village; he
      was a handsome, well-made fellow, and looked like a non-commissioned
      officer. All the girls ran after him, but he paid no attention to them,
      partly because he was very much afraid of his superior, the schoolmaster,
      old Grabu, who occasionally got out of bed the wrong foot first.

“Old Grabu already employed pretty Hortense who has just died here,
      and who was afterwards nicknamed Clochette. The assistant master singled
      out the pretty young girl, who was, no doubt, flattered at being chosen by
      this impregnable conqueror; at any rate, she fell in love with him, and he
      succeeded in persuading her to give him a first meeting in the hay-loft
      behind the school, at night, after she had done her day''s sewing.

“She pretended to go home, but instead of going downstairs when she
      left the Grabus'' she went upstairs and hid among the hay, to wait for her
      lover. He soon joined her, and was beginning to say pretty things to her,
      when the door of the hay-loft opened and the schoolmaster appeared, and
      asked: ''What are you doing up there, Sigisbert?'' Feeling sure that he
      would be caught, the young schoolmaster lost his presence of mind and
      replied stupidly: ''I came up here to rest a little amongst the bundles of
      hay, Monsieur Grabu.''

“The loft was very large and absolutely dark, and Sigisbert pushed
      the frightened girl to the further end and said: ''Go over there and hide
      yourself. I shall lose my position, so get away and hide yourself.''

“When the schoolmaster heard the whispering, he continued: ''Why, you
      are not by yourself?'' ''Yes, I am, Monsieur Grabu!'' ''But you are not, for
      you are talking.'' ''I swear I am, Monsieur Grabu.'' ''I will soon find out,''
      the old man replied, and double locking the door, he went down to get a
      light.

“Then the young man, who was a coward such as one frequently meets,
      lost his head, and becoming furious all of a sudden, he repeated: ''Hide
      yourself, so that he may not find you. You will keep me from making a
      living for the rest of my life; you will ruin my whole career. Do hide
      yourself!'' They could hear the key turning in the lock again, and Hortense
      ran to the window which looked out on the street, opened it quickly, and
      then said in a low and determined voice: ''You will come and pick me up
      when he is gone,'' and she jumped out.

“Old Grabu found nobody, and went down again in great surprise, and
      a quarter of an hour later, Monsieur Sigisbert came to me and related his
      adventure. The girl had remained at the foot of the wall unable to get up,
      as she had fallen from the second story, and I went with him to fetch her.
      It was raining in torrents, and I brought the unfortunate girl home with
      me, for the right leg was broken in three places, and the bones had come
      trough the flesh. She did not complain, and merely said, with admirable
      resignation: ''I am punished, well punished!''

“I sent for assistance and for the work-girl''s relatives and told
      them a, made-up story of a runaway carriage which had knocked her down and
      lamed her outside my door. They believed me, and the gendarmes for a whole
      month tried in vain to find the author of this accident.

“That is all! And I say that this woman was a heroine and belonged
      to the race of those who accomplish the grandest deeds of history.

“That was her only love affair, and she died a virgin. She was a
      martyr, a noble soul, a sublimely devoted woman! And if I did not
      absolutely admire her, I should not have told you this story, which I
      would never tell any one during her life; you understand why.”

The doctor ceased. Mamma cried and papa said some words which I did not
      catch; then they left the room and I remained on my knees in the armchair
      and sobbed, whilst I heard a strange noise of heavy footsteps and
      something knocking against the side of the staircase.

My Little Darling: So you are crying from morning until night and from
      night until morning, because your husband leaves you; you do not know what
      to do and so you ask your old aunt for advice; you must consider her quite
      an expert. I don''t know as much as you think I do, and yet I am not
      entirely ignorant of the art of loving, or, rather, of making one''s self
      loved, in which you are a little lacking. I can admit that at my age.

You say that you are all attention, love, kisses and caresses for him.
      Perhaps that is the very trouble; I think you kiss him too much.

Man is gifted with physical strength, and he exercises force. Woman is
      gifted with charm, and she rules with caresses. It is our weapon,
      formidable and invincible, but we should know how to use it.

Know well that we are the mistresses of the world! To tell the history of
      Love from the beginning of the world would be to tell the history of man
      himself: Everything springs from it, the arts, great events, customs,
      wars, the overthrow of empires.

In the Bible you find Delila, Judith; in fables we find Omphale, Helen; in
      history the Sabines, Cleopatra and many others.

Therefore we reign supreme, all-powerful. But, like kings, we must make
      use of delicate diplomacy.

Love, my dear, is made up of imperceptible sensations. We know that it is
      as strong as death, but also as frail as glass. The slightest shock breaks
      it, and our power crumbles, and we are never able to raise it again.

We have the power of making ourselves adored, but we lack one tiny thing,
      the understanding of the various kinds of caresses. In embraces we lose
      the sentiment of delicacy, while the man over whom we rule remains master
      of himself, capable of judging the foolishness of certain words. Take
      care, my dear; that is the defect in our armor. It is our Achilles'' heel.

Do you know whence comes our real power? From the kiss, the kiss alone!
      When we know how to hold out and give up our lips we can become queens.

The kiss is only a preface, however, but a charming preface. More charming
      than the realization itself. A preface which can always be read over
      again, whereas one cannot always read over the book.

Yes, the meeting of lips is the most perfect, the most divine sensation
      given to human beings, the supreme limit of happiness: It is in the kiss
      alone that one sometimes seems to feel this union of souls after which we
      strive, the intermingling of hearts, as it were.

One caress alone gives this deep sensation of two beings welded into one
      —it is the kiss. No violent delirium of complete possession is worth
      this trembling approach of the lips, this first moist and fresh contact,
      and then the long, lingering, motionless rapture.

Therefore, my dear, the kiss is our strongest weapon, but we must take
      care not to dull it. Do not forget that its value is only relative, purely
      conventional. It continually changes according to circumstances, the state
      of expectancy and the ecstasy of the mind. I will call attention to one
      example.

Another poet, Francois Coppee, has written a line which we all remember, a
      line which we find delightful, which moves our very hearts.

After describing the expectancy of a lover, waiting in a room one winter''s
      evening, his anxiety, his nervous impatience, the terrible fear of not
      seeing her, he describes the arrival of the beloved woman, who at last
      enters hurriedly, out of breath, bringing with her part of the winter
      breeze, and he exclaims:

Is that not a line of exquisite sentiment, a delicate and charming
      observation, a perfect truth? All those who have hastened to a clandestine
      meeting, whom passion has thrown into the arms of a man, well do they know
      these first delicious kisses through the veil; and they tremble at the
      memory of them. And yet their sole charm lies in the circumstances, from
      being late, from the anxious expectancy, but from the purely—or,
      rather, impurely, if you prefer—sensual point of view, they are
      detestable.

Think! Outside it is cold. The young woman has walked quickly; the veil is
      moist from her cold breath. Little drops of water shine in the lace. The
      lover seizes her and presses his burning lips to her liquid breath. The
      moist veil, which discolors and carries the dreadful odor of chemical dye,
      penetrates into the young man''s mouth, moistens his mustache. He does not
      taste the lips of his beloved, he tastes the dye of this lace moistened
      with cold breath. And yet, like the poet, we would all exclaim:

Therefore, the value of this caress being entirely a matter of convention,
      we must be careful not to abuse it.

Well, my dear, I have several times noticed that you are very clumsy.
      However, you were not alone in that fault; the majority of women lose
      their authority by abusing the kiss with untimely kisses. When they feel
      that their husband or their lover is a little tired, at those times when
      the heart as well as the body needs rest, instead of understanding what is
      going on within him, they persist in giving inopportune caresses, tire him
      by the obstinacy of begging lips and give caresses lavished with neither
      rhyme nor reason.

Trust in the advice of my experience. First, never kiss your husband in
      public, in the train, at the restaurant. It is bad taste; do not give in
      to your desires. He would feel ridiculous and would never forgive you.

Beware of useless kisses lavished in intimacy. I am sure that you abuse
      them. For instance, I remember one day that you did something quite
      shocking. Probably you do not remember it.

All three of us were together in the drawing-room, and, as you did not
      stand on ceremony before me, your husband was holding you on his knees and
      kissing you at great length on the neck, the lips and throat. Suddenly you
      exclaimed: “Oh! the fire!” You had been paying no attention to
      it, and it was almost out. A few lingering embers were glowing on the
      hearth. Then he rose, ran to the woodbox, from which he dragged two
      enormous logs with great difficulty, when you came to him with begging
      lips, murmuring:

“Kiss me!” He turned his head with difficulty and tried to
      hold up the logs at the same time. Then you gently and slowly placed your
      mouth on that of the poor fellow, who remained with his neck out of joint,
      his sides twisted, his arms almost dropping off, trembling with fatigue
      and tired from his desperate effort. And you kept drawing out this
      torturing kiss, without seeing or understanding. Then when you freed him,
      you began to grumble: “How badly you kiss!” No wonder!

Oh, take care of that! We all have this foolish habit, this unconscious
      need of choosing the most inconvenient moments. When he is carrying a
      glass of water, when he is putting on his shoes, when he is tying his
      scarf—in short, when he finds himself in any uncomfortable position
      —then is the time which we choose for a caress which makes him stop
      for a whole minute in the middle of a gesture with the sole desire of
      getting rid of us!

Do not think that this criticism is insignificant. Love, my dear, is a
      delicate thing. The least little thing offends it; know that everything
      depends on the tact of our caresses. An ill-placed kiss may do any amount
      of harm.

From the time some people begin to talk they seem to have an overmastering
      desire or vocation.

Ever since he was a child, M. Caillard had only had one idea in his head
      —to wear the ribbon of an order. When he was still quite a small boy
      he used to wear a zinc cross of the Legion of Honor pinned on his tunic,
      just as other children wear a soldier''s cap, and he took his mother''s hand
      in the street with a proud air, sticking out his little chest with its red
      ribbon and metal star so that it might show to advantage.

His studies were not a success, and he failed in his examination for
      Bachelor of Arts; so, not knowing what to do, he married a pretty girl, as
      he had plenty of money of his own.

They lived in Paris, as many rich middle-class people do, mixing with
      their own particular set, and proud of knowing a deputy, who might perhaps
      be a minister some day, and counting two heads of departments among their
      friends.

But M. Caillard could not get rid of his one absorbing idea, and he felt
      constantly unhappy because he had not the right to wear a little bit of
      colored ribbon in his buttonhole.

When he met any men who were decorated on the boulevards, he looked at
      them askance, with intense jealousy. Sometimes, when he had nothing to do
      in the afternoon, he would count them, and say to himself: “Just let
      me see how many I shall meet between the Madeleine and the Rue Drouot.”

Then he would walk slowly, looking at every coat with a practiced eye for
      the little bit of red ribbon, and when he had got to the end of his walk
      he always repeated the numbers aloud.

“Eight officers and seventeen knights. As many as that! It is stupid
      to sow the cross broadcast in that fashion. I wonder how many I shall meet
      going back?”

He knew the places where most were to be found. They swarmed in the Palais
      Royal. Fewer were seen in the Avenue de l''Opera than in the Rue de la
      Paix, while the right side of the boulevard was more frequented by them
      than the left.

They also seemed to prefer certain cafes and theatres. Whenever he saw a
      group of white-haired old gentlemen standing together in the middle of the
      pavement, interfering with the traffic, he used to say to himself:

He had often remarked that the officers had a different bearing to the
      mere knights. They carried their head differently, and one felt that they
      enjoyed a higher official consideration and a more widely extended
      importance.

Sometimes, however, the worthy man would be seized with a furious hatred
      for every one who was decorated; he felt like a Socialist toward them.

Then, when he got home, excited at meeting so many crosses—just as a
      poor, hungry wretch might be on passing some dainty provision shop—he
      used to ask in a loud voice:

“I am indignant,” he replied, “at the injustice I see
      going on around us. Oh, the Communards were certainly right!”

After dinner he would go out again and look at the shops where the
      decorations were sold, and he examined all the emblems of various shapes
      and colors. He would have liked to possess them all, and to have walked
      gravely at the head of a procession, with his crush hat under his arm and
      his breast covered with decorations, radiant as a star, amid a buzz of
      admiring whispers and a hum of respect.

He used to say to himself: “It is really too difficult for any man
      to obtain the Legion of Honor unless he is some public functionary.
      Suppose I try to be appointed an officer of the Academy!”

But he did not know how to set about it, and spoke on the subject to his
      wife, who was stupefied.

He got angry. “I know what I am talking about. I only want to know
      how to set about it. You are quite stupid at times.”

An idea struck him: “Suppose you were to speak to M. Rosselin, the
      deputy; he might be able to advise me. You understand I cannot broach the
      subject to him directly. It is rather difficult and delicate, but coming
      from you it might seem quite natural.”

Mme. Caillard did what he asked her, and M. Rosselin promised to speak to
      the minister about it; and then Caillard began to worry him, till the
      deputy told him he must make a formal application and put forward his
      claims.

“What were his charms?” he said. “He was not even a
      Bachelor of Arts.” However, he set to work and produced a pamphlet,
      with the title, “The People''s Right to Instruction,” but he
      could not finish it for want of ideas.

He sought for easier subjects, and began several in succession. The first
      was, “The Instruction of Children by Means of the Eye.” He
      wanted gratuitous theatres to be established in every poor quarter of
      Paris for little children. Their parents were to take them there when they
      were quite young, and, by means of a magic lantern, all the notions of
      human knowledge were to be imparted to them. There were to be regular
      courses. The sight would educate the mind, while the pictures would remain
      impressed on the brain, and thus science would, so to say, be made
      visible. What could be more simple than to teach universal history,
      natural history, geography, botany, zoology, anatomy, etc., etc., in this
      manner?

He had his ideas printed in pamphlets, and sent a copy to each deputy, ten
      to each minister, fifty to the President of the Republic, ten to each
      Parisian, and five to each provincial newspaper.

Then he wrote on “Street Lending-Libraries.” His idea was to
      have little pushcarts full of books drawn about the streets. Everyone
      would have a right to ten volumes a month in his home on payment of one
      sou.

“The people,” M. Caillard said, “will only disturb
      itself for the sake of its pleasures, and since it will not go to
      instruction, instruction must come to it,” etc., etc.

His essays attracted no attention, but he sent in his application, and he
      got the usual formal official reply. He thought himself sure of success,
      but nothing came of it.

Then he made up his mind to apply personally. He begged for an interview
      with the Minister of Public Instruction, and he was received by a young
      subordinate, who was very grave and important, and kept touching the knobs
      of electric bells to summon ushers, and footmen, and officials inferior to
      himself. He declared to M. Caillard that his matter was going on quite
      favorably, and advised him to continue his remarkable labors, and M.
      Caillard set at it again.

M. Rosselin, the deputy, seemed now to take a great interest in his
      success, and gave him a lot of excellent, practical advice. He, himself,
      was decorated, although nobody knew exactly what he had done to deserve
      such a distinction.

He told Caillard what new studies he ought to undertake; he introduced him
      to learned societies which took up particularly obscure points of science,
      in the hope of gaining credit and honors thereby; and he even took him
      under his wing at the ministry.

One day, when he came to lunch with his friend—for several months
      past he had constantly taken his meals there—he said to him in a
      whisper as he shook hands: “I have just obtained a great favor for
      you. The Committee of Historical Works is going to intrust you with a
      commission. There are some researches to be made in various libraries in
      France.”

Caillard was so delighted that he could scarcely eat or drink, and a week
      later he set out. He went from town to town, studying catalogues,
      rummaging in lofts full of dusty volumes, and was hated by all the
      librarians.

One day, happening to be at Rouen, he thought he should like to go and
      visit his wife, whom he had not seen for more than a week, so he took the
      nine o''clock train, which would land him at home by twelve at night.

He had his latchkey, so he went in without making any noise, delighted at
      the idea of the surprise he was going to give her. She had locked herself
      in. How tiresome! However, he cried out through the door:

She must have been very frightened, for he heard her jump out of her bed
      and speak to herself, as if she were in a dream. Then she went to her
      dressing room, opened and closed the door, and went quickly up and down
      her room barefoot two or three times, shaking the furniture till the vases
      and glasses sounded. Then at last she asked:

He began to undress himself methodically, as he did everything, and took
      from a chair his overcoat, which he was in the habit of hanging up in the
      hall. But suddenly he remained motionless, struck dumb with astonishment—there
      was a red ribbon in the buttonhole:

But he still held it by one of the sleeves, without letting it go,
      repeating in a half-dazed manner:

“Oh! Why? Just explain—Whose overcoat is it? It is not mine,
      as it has the Legion of Honor on it.”

“Yes,” she continued, “it is a new overcoat that I have
      had made for you. But I swore that I would not tell you anything about it,
      as it will not be officially announced for a month or six weeks, and you
      were not to have known till your return from your business journey. M.
      Rosselin managed it for you.”

A little piece of white paper fell to the floor out of the pocket of the
      overcoat. Caillard picked it up; it was a visiting card, and he read out:

He almost cried with joy, and, a week later, it was announced in the
      Journal Officiel that M. Caillard had been awarded the Legion of Honor on
      account of his exceptional services.

The Bondels were a happy family, and although they frequently quarrelled
      about trifles, they soon became friends again.

Bondel was a merchant who had retired from active business after saving
      enough to allow him to live quietly; he had rented a little house at
      Saint-Germain and lived there with his wife. He was a quiet man with very
      decided opinions; he had a certain degree of education and read serious
      newspapers; nevertheless, he appreciated the gaulois wit. Endowed with a
      logical mind, and that practical common sense which is the master quality
      of the industrial French bourgeois, he thought little, but clearly, and
      reached a decision only after careful consideration of the matter in hand.
      He was of medium size, with a distinguished look, and was beginning to
      turn gray.

His wife, who was full of serious qualities, had also several faults. She
      had a quick temper and a frankness that bordered upon violence. She bore a
      grudge a long time. She had once been pretty, but had now become too stout
      and too red; but in her neighborhood at Saint-Germain she still passed for
      a very beautiful woman, who exemplified health and an uncertain temper.

Their dissensions almost always began at breakfast, over some trivial
      matter, and they often continued all day and even until the following day.
      Their simple, common, limited life imparted seriousness to the most
      unimportant matters, and every topic of conversation became a subject of
      dispute. This had not been so in the days when business occupied their
      minds, drew their hearts together, and gave them common interests and
      occupation.

But at Saint-Germain they saw fewer people. It had been necessary to make
      new acquaintances, to create for themselves a new world among strangers, a
      new existence devoid of occupations. Then the monotony of loneliness had
      soured each of them a little; and the quiet happiness which they had hoped
      and waited for with the coming of riches did not appear.

His wife looked at him in a displeased manner. She continued: “You
      would have done just as well to avoid him.”

The discussion gradually grew more heated, always on the same subject for
      lack of others. Madame Bondel obstinately refused to say what she had
      heard about these neighbors, allowing things to be understood without
      saying exactly what they were. Bendel would shrug his shoulders, grin, and
      exasperate his wife. She finally cried out: “Well! that gentleman is
      deceived by his wife, there!”

She seemed dumfounded: “What! you don''t see?—you don''t see?—well,
      that''s too much! You don''t see!—why, it''s a public scandal! he is
      disgraced!”

He answered: “Ah! by no means! Should a man be considered disgraced
      because he is deceived, because he is betrayed, robbed? No, indeed! I''ll
      grant you that that may be the case for the wife, but as for him—”

She became furious, exclaiming: “For him as well as for her. They
      are both in disgrace; it''s a public shame.”

Bondel, very calm, asked: “First of all, is it true? Who can assert
      such a thing as long as no one has been caught in the act?”

Madame Bondel was growing uneasy; she snapped: “What? Who can assert
      it? Why, everybody! everybody! it''s as clear as the nose on your face.
      Everybody knows it and is talking about it. There is not the slightest
      doubt.”

He was grinning: “For a long time people thought that the sun
      revolved around the earth. This man loves his wife and speaks of her
      tenderly and reverently. This whole business is nothing but lies!”

Stamping her foot, she stammered: “Do you think that that fool, that
      idiot, knows anything about it?”

Bondel did not grow angry; he was reasoning clearly: “Excuse me.
      This gentleman is no fool. He seemed to me, on the contrary, to be very
      intelligent and shrewd; and you can''t make me believe that a man with
      brains doesn''t notice such a thing in his own house, when the neighbors,
      who are not there, are ignorant of no detail of this liaison—for
      I''ll warrant that they know everything.”

Madame Bondel had a fit of angry mirth, which irritated her husband''s
      nerves. She laughed: “Ha! ha! ha! they''re all the same! There''s not
      a man alive who could discover a thing like that unless his nose was stuck
      into it!”

The discussion was wandering to other topics now. She was exclaiming over
      the blindness of deceived husbands, a thing which he doubted and which she
      affirmed with such airs of personal contempt that he finally grew angry.
      Then the discussion became an angry quarrel, where she took the side of
      the women and he defended the men. He had the conceit to declare: “Well,
      I swear that if I had ever been deceived, I should have noticed it, and
      immediately, too. And I should have taken away your desire for such things
      in such a manner that it would have taken more than one doctor to set you
      on foot again!”

Boiling with anger, she cried out to him: “You! you! why, you''re as
      big a fool as the others, do you hear!”

She laughed so impertinently that he felt his heart beat and a chill run
      down his back. For the third time he said:

She rose, still laughing in the same manner. She slammed the door and left
      the room, saying: “Well! if that isn''t too much!”

Bondel remained alone, ill at ease. That insolent, provoking laugh had
      touched him to the quick. He went outside, walked, dreamed. The
      realization of the loneliness of his new life made him sad and morbid. The
      neighbor, whom he had met that morning, came to him with outstretched
      hands. They continued their walk together. After touching on various
      subjects they came to talk of their wives. Both seemed to have something
      to confide, something inexpressible, vague, about these beings associated
      with their lives; their wives. The neighbor was saying:

“Really, at times, one might think that they bear some particular
      ill-will toward their husband, just because he is a husband. I love my
      wife—I love her very much; I appreciate and respect her; well! there
      are times when she seems to have more confidence and faith in our friends
      than in me.”

When he left this man he began to think things over again. He felt in his
      soul a strange confusion of contradictory ideas, a sort of interior
      burning; that mocking, impertinent laugh kept ringing in his ears and
      seemed to say: “Why; you are just the same as the others, you fool!”
      That was indeed bravado, one of those pieces of impudence of which a woman
      makes use when she dares everything, risks everything, to wound and
      humiliate the man who has aroused her ire. This poor man must also be one
      of those deceived husbands, like so many others. He had said sadly:
      “There are times when she seems to have more confidence and faith in
      our friends than in me.” That is how a husband formulated his
      observations on the particular attentions of his wife for another man.
      That was all. He had seen nothing more. He was like the rest—all the
      rest!

And how strangely Bondel''s own wife had laughed as she said: “You,
      too —you, too.” How wild and imprudent these creatures are who
      can arouse such suspicions in the heart for the sole purpose of revenge!

He ran over their whole life since their marriage, reviewed his mental
      list of their acquaintances, to see whether she had ever appeared to show
      more confidence in any one else than in himself. He never had suspected
      any one, he was so calm, so sure of her, so confident.

But, now he thought of it, she had had a friend, an intimate friend, who
      for almost a year had dined with them three times a week. Tancret, good
      old Tancret, whom he, Bendel, loved as a brother and whom he continued to
      see on the sly, since his wife, he did not know why, had grown angry at
      the charming fellow.

He stopped to think, looking over the past with anxious eyes. Then he grew
      angry at himself for harboring this shameful insinuation of the defiant,
      jealous, bad ego which lives in all of us. He blamed and accused himself
      when he remembered the visits and the demeanor of this friend whom his
      wife had dismissed for no apparent reason. But, suddenly, other memories
      returned to him, similar ruptures due to the vindictive character of
      Madame Bondel, who never pardoned a slight. Then he laughed frankly at
      himself for the doubts which he had nursed; and he remembered the angry
      looks of his wife as he would tell her, when he returned at night: “I
      saw good old Tancret, and he wished to be remembered to you,” and he
      reassured himself.

She would invariably answer: “When you see that gentleman you can
      tell him that I can very well dispense with his remembrances.” With
      what an irritated, angry look she would say these words! How well one
      could feel that she did not and would not forgive—and he had
      suspected her even for a second? Such foolishness!

But why did she grow so angry? She never had given the exact reason for
      this quarrel. She still bore him that grudge! Was it?—But no—no—and
      Bondel declared that he was lowering himself by even thinking of such
      things.

Yes, he was undoubtedly lowering himself, but he could not help thinking
      of it, and he asked himself with terror if this thought which had entered
      into his mind had not come to stop, if he did not carry in his heart the
      seed of fearful torment. He knew himself; he was a man to think over his
      doubts, as formerly he would ruminate over his commercial operations, for
      days and nights, endlessly weighing the pros and the cons.

He was already becoming excited; he was walking fast and losing his
      calmness. A thought cannot be downed. It is intangible, cannot be caught,
      cannot be killed.

Suddenly a plan occurred to him; it was bold, so bold that at first he
      doubted whether he would carry it out.

Each time that he met Tancret, his friend would ask for news of Madame
      Bondel, and Bondel would answer: “She is still a little angry.”
      Nothing more. Good Lord! What a fool he had been! Perhaps!

Well, he would take the train to Paris, go to Tancret, and bring him back
      with him that very evening, assuring him that his wife''s mysterious anger
      had disappeared. But how would Madame Bondel act? What a scene there would
      be! What anger! what scandal! What of it?—that would be revenge!
      When she should come face to face with him, unexpectedly, he certainly
      ought to be able to read the truth in their expressions.

He immediately went to the station, bought his ticket, got into the car,
      and as soon as he felt him self being carried away by the train, he felt a
      fear, a kind of dizziness, at what he was going to do. In order not to
      weaken, back down, and return alone, he tried not to think of the matter
      any longer, to bring his mind to bear on other affairs, to do what he had
      decided to do with a blind resolution; and he began to hum tunes from
      operettas and music halls until he reached Paris.

As soon as he found himself walking along the streets that led to
      Tancret''s, he felt like stopping, He paused in front of several shops,
      noticed the prices of certain objects, was interested in new things, felt
      like taking a glass of beer, which was not his usual custom; and as he
      approached his friend''s dwelling he ardently hoped not meet him. But
      Tancret was at home, alone, reading. He jumped up in surprise, crying:
      “Ah! Bondel! what luck!”

Bondel, embarrassed, answered: “Yes, my dear fellow, I happened to
      be in Paris, and I thought I''d drop in and shake hands with you.”

“That''s very nice, very nice! The more so that for some time you
      have not favored me with your presence very often.”

“Well, you see—even against one''s will, one is often
      influenced by surrounding conditions, and as my wife seemed to bear you
      some ill-will”

“Ah! really. Well, I think that my wife has forgotten her grudge,
      for this very morning she spoke to me of you in very pleasant terms.”

Tancret started and seemed so dumfounded that for a few minutes he could
      find nothing to say. Then he asked: “She spoke of me—in
      pleasant terms?”

“And then—as I was coming to Paris I thought that I would
      please you by coming to tell you the good news.”

Tancret, who was naturally prudent, seemed a little worried by this
      proposition, and he asked: “Oh! really—is it possible? Are we
      not exposing ourselves to—to—a scene?”

“Yes, but I can assure you that she no longer bears you any ill—will.
      I am even convinced that it will be a great pleasure for her to see you
      thus, unexpectedly.”

“Well, then! let us go along. I am delighted. You see, this
      misunderstanding was very unpleasant for me.”

They set out together toward the Saint-Lazare station, arm in arm. They
      made the trip in silence. Both seemed absorbed in deep meditation. Seated
      in the car, one opposite the other, they looked at each other without
      speaking, each observing that the other was pale.

Then they left the train and once more linked arms as if to unite against
      some common danger. After a walk of a few minutes they stopped, a little
      out of breath, before Bondel''s house. Bondel ushered his friend into the
      parlor, called the servant, and asked: “Is madame at home?”

They dropped into two armchairs and waited. Both were filled with the same
      longing to escape before the appearance of the much-feared person.

A well-known, heavy tread could be heard descending the stairs. A hand
      moved the knob, and both men watched the brass handle turn. Then the door
      opened wide, and Madame Bondel stopped and looked to see who was there
      before she entered. She looked, blushed, trembled, retreated a step, then
      stood motionless, her cheeks aflame and her hands resting against the
      sides of the door frame.

Tancret, as pale as if about to faint, had arisen, letting fall his hat,
      which rolled along the floor. He stammered out: “Mon Dieu—madame—it
      is I—I thought—I ventured—I was so sorry—”

Then, quickly, carried away by some impulse, she walked toward him with
      her hands outstretched; and when he had taken, pressed, and held these two
      hands, she said, in a trembling, weak little voice, which was new to her
      husband:

And Bondel, who was watching them, felt an icy chill run over him, as if
      he had been dipped in a cold bath.

Madame, you ask me whether I am laughing at you? You cannot believe that a
      man has never been in love. Well, then, no, no, I have never loved, never!

Why is this? I really cannot tell. I have never experienced that
      intoxication of the heart which we call love! Never have I lived in that
      dream, in that exaltation, in that state of madness into which the image
      of a woman casts us. I have never been pursued, haunted, roused to fever
      heat, lifted up to Paradise by the thought of meeting, or by the
      possession of, a being who had suddenly become for me more desirable than
      any good fortune, more beautiful than any other creature, of more
      consequence than the whole world! I have never wept, I have never suffered
      on account of any of you. I have not passed my nights sleepless, while
      thinking of her. I have no experience of waking thoughts bright with
      thought and memories of her. I have never known the wild rapture of hope
      before her arrival, or the divine sadness of regret when she went from me,
      leaving behind her a delicate odor of violet powder.

I have also often asked myself why this is. And truly I can scarcely tell.
      Nevertheless I have found some reasons for it; but they are of a
      metaphysical character, and perhaps you will not be able to appreciate
      them.

I suppose I am too critical of women to submit to their fascination. I ask
      you to forgive me for this remark. I will explain what I mean. In every
      creature there is a moral being and a physical being. In order to love, it
      would be necessary for me to find a harmony between these two beings which
      I have never found. One always predominates; sometimes the moral,
      sometimes the physical.

The intellect which we have a right to require in a woman, in order to
      love her, is not the same as the virile intellect. It is more, and it is
      less. A woman must be frank, delicate, sensitive, refined, impressionable.
      She has no need of either power or initiative in thought, but she must
      have kindness, elegance, tenderness, coquetry and that faculty of
      assimilation which, in a little while, raises her to an equality with him
      who shares her life. Her greatest quality must be tact, that subtle sense
      which is to the mind what touch is to the body. It reveals to her a
      thousand little things, contours, angles and forms on the plane of the
      intellectual.

Very frequently pretty women have not intellect to correspond with their
      personal charms. Now, the slightest lack of harmony strikes me and pains
      me at the first glance. In friendship this is not of importance.
      Friendship is a compact in which one fairly shares defects and merits. We
      may judge of friends, whether man or woman, giving them credit for what is
      good, and overlooking what is bad in them, appreciating them at their just
      value, while giving ourselves up to an intimate, intense and charming
      sympathy.

In order to love, one must be blind, surrender one''s self absolutely, see
      nothing, question nothing, understand nothing. One must adore the weakness
      as well as the beauty of the beloved object, renounce all judgment, all
      reflection, all perspicacity.

I am incapable of such blindness and rebel at unreasoning subjugation.
      This is not all. I have such a high and subtle idea of harmony that
      nothing can ever fulfill my ideal. But you will call me a madman. Listen
      to me. A woman, in my opinion, may have an exquisite soul and charming
      body without that body and that soul being in perfect harmony with one
      another. I mean that persons who have noses made in a certain shape should
      not be expected to think in a certain fashion. The fat have no right to
      make use of the same words and phrases as the thin. You, who have blue
      eyes, madame, cannot look at life and judge of things and events as if you
      had black eyes. The shade of your eyes should correspond, by a sort of
      fatality, with the shade of your thought. In perceiving these things, I
      have the scent of a bloodhound. Laugh if you like, but it is so.

And yet, once I imagined that I was in love for an hour, for a day. I had
      foolishly yielded to the influence of surrounding circumstances. I allowed
      myself to be beguiled by a mirage of Dawn. Would you like me to tell you
      this short story?

I met, one evening, a pretty, enthusiastic little woman who took a poetic
      fancy to spend a night with me in a boat on a river. I would have
      preferred a room and a bed; however, I consented to the river and the
      boat.

It was in the month of June. My fair companion chose a moonlight night in
      order the better to stimulate her imagination.

We had dined at a riverside inn and set out in the boat about ten o''clock.
      I thought it a rather foolish kind of adventure, but as my companion
      pleased me I did not worry about it. I sat down on the seat facing her; I
      seized the oars, and off we starred.

I could not deny that the scene was picturesque. We glided past a wooded
      isle full of nightingales, and the current carried us rapidly over the
      river covered with silvery ripples. The tree toads uttered their shrill,
      monotonous cry; the frogs croaked in the grass by the river''s bank, and
      the lapping of the water as it flowed on made around us a kind of confused
      murmur almost imperceptible, disquieting, and gave us a vague sensation of
      mysterious fear.

The sweet charm of warm nights and of streams glittering in the moonlight
      penetrated us. It was delightful to be alive and to float along thus, and
      to dream and to feel at one''s side a sympathetic and beautiful young
      woman.

I was somewhat affected, somewhat agitated, somewhat intoxicated by the
      pale brightness of the night and the consciousness of my proximity to a
      lovely woman.

This appeared to be rather too much. I declined; she persisted. She
      certainly wanted to play the game, to have a whole orchestra of sentiment,
      from the moon to the rhymes of poets. In the end I had to yield, and, as
      if in mockery, I repeated to her a charming little poem by Louis Bouilhet,
      of which the following are the last verses:

Our boat had gradually approached the bank and become entangled in the
      branches of a willow which impeded its progress. I placed my arm round my
      companion''s waist, and very gently approached my lips towards her neck.
      But she repulsed me with an abrupt, angry movement.

I tried to draw her toward me. She resisted, caught hold of the tree, and
      was near flinging us both into the water. I deemed it prudent to cease my
      importunities.

“I would rather capsize you. I feel so happy. I want to dream. This
      is so delightful.” Then, in a slightly malicious tone, she added:

“Here is what I mean: I want to lie down on my back at the bottom of
      the boat with you by my side. But I forbid you to touch me, to embrace me
      —in short—to caress me.”

And then we lay down side by side, our eyes turned toward the sky, while
      the boat glided slowly through the water. We were rocked by its gentle
      motion. The slight sounds of the night came to us more distinctly in the
      bottom of the boat, sometimes causing us to start. And I felt springing up
      within me a strange, poignant emotion, an infinite tenderness, something
      like an irresistible impulse to open my arms in order to embrace, to open
      my heart in order to love, to give myself, to give my thoughts, my body,
      my life, my entire being to some one.

“Where are we; Where are we going? It seems to me that I am leaving
      the earth. How sweet it is! Ah, if you loved me—a little!!!”

My heart began to throb. I had no answer to give. It seemed to me that I
      loved her. I had no longer any violent desire. I felt happy there by her
      side, and that was enough for me.

And thus we remained for a long, long time without stirring. We had
      clasped each other''s hands; some delightful force rendered us motionless,
      an unknown force stronger than ourselves, an alliance, chaste, intimate,
      absolute, of our beings lying there side by side, belonging to each other
      without contact. What was this? How do I know? Love, perhaps?

Little by little the dawn appeared. It was three o''clock in the morning.
      Slowly a great brightness spread over the sky. The boat knocked up against
      something. I rose up. We had come close to a tiny islet.

But I remained enchanted, in an ecstasy. Before us stretched the
      firmament, red, pink, violet, spotted with fiery clouds resembling golden
      vapor. The river was glowing with purple and three houses on one side of
      it seemed to be burning.

I bent toward my companion. I was going to say, “Oh! look!”
      But I held my tongue, quite dazed, and I could no longer see anything
      except her. She, too, was rosy, with rosy flesh tints with a deeper tinge
      that was partly a reflection of the hue of the sky. Her tresses were rosy;
      her eyes were rosy; her teeth were rosy; her dress, her laces, her smile,
      all were rosy. And in truth I believed, so overpowering was the illusion,
      that the dawn was there in the flesh before me.

She rose softly to her feet, holding out her lips to me; and I moved
      toward her, trembling, delirious feeling indeed that I was going to kiss
      Heaven, to kiss happiness, to kiss a dream that had become a woman, to
      kiss the ideal which had descended into human flesh.

She said to me: “You have a caterpillar in your hair.” And,
      suddenly, I felt as sad as if I had lost all hope in life.

That is all, madame. It is puerile, silly, stupid. But I am sure that
      since that day it would be impossible for me to love. And yet—who
      can tell?

[The young man upon whom this letter was found was yesterday taken out of
      the Seine between Bougival and Marly. An obliging bargeman, who had
      searched the pockets in order to ascertain the name of the deceased,
      brought this paper to the author.]

Mademoiselle Source had adopted this boy under very sad circumstances. She
      was at the time thirty-six years old. Being disfigured through having as a
      child slipped off her nurse''s lap into the fireplace and burned her face
      shockingly, she had determined not to marry, for she did not want any man
      to marry her for her money.

A neighbor of hers, left a widow just before her child was born, died in
      giving birth, without leaving a sou. Mademoiselle Source took the new-born
      child, put him out to nurse, reared him, sent him to a boarding-school,
      then brought him home in his fourteenth year, in order to have in her
      empty house somebody who would love her, who would look after her, and
      make her old age pleasant.

She had a little country place four leagues from Rennes, and she now
      dispensed with a servant; her expenses having increased to more than
      double since this orphan''s arrival, her income of three thousand francs
      was no longer sufficient to support three persons.

She attended to the housekeeping and cooking herself, and sent out the boy
      on errands, letting him also occupy himself in cultivating the garden. He
      was gentle, timid, silent, and affectionate. And she experienced a deep
      happiness, a fresh happiness when he kissed her without surprise or horror
      at her disfigurement. He called her “Aunt,” and treated her as
      a mother.

In the evening they both sat down at the fireside, and she made nice
      little dainties for him. She heated some wine and toasted a slice of
      bread, and it made a charming little meal before going to bed. She often
      took him on her knees and covered him with kisses, murmuring tender words
      in his ear. She called him: “My little flower, my cherub, my adored
      angel, my divine jewel.” He softly accepted her caresses, hiding his
      head on the old maid''s shoulder. Although he was now nearly fifteen, he
      had remained small and weak, and had a rather sickly appearance.

Sometimes Mademoiselle Source took him to the city, to see two married
      female relatives of hers, distant cousins, who were living in the suburbs,
      and who were the only members of her family in existence. The two women
      had always found fault with her, for having adopted this boy, on account
      of the inheritance; but for all that, they gave her a cordial welcome,
      having still hopes of getting a share for themselves, a third, no doubt,
      if what she possessed were only equally divided.

She was happy, very happy, always occupied with her adopted child. She
      bought books for him to improve his mind, and he became passionately fond
      of reading.

He no longer climbed on her knee to pet her as he had formerly done; but,
      instead, would go and sit down in his little chair in the chimney-corner
      and open a volume. The lamp placed at the edge of the Tittle table above
      his head shone on his curly hair, and on a portion of his forehead; he did
      not move, he did not raise his eyes or make any gesture. He read on,
      interested, entirely absorbed in the story he was reading.

Seated opposite to him, she would gaze at him earnestly, astonished at his
      studiousness, often on the point of bursting into tears.

She said to him occasionally: “You will fatigue yourself, my
      treasure!” hoping that he would raise his head, and come across to
      embrace her; but he did not even answer her; he had not heard or
      understood what she was saying; he paid no attention to anything save what
      he read in those pages.

After this, he asked Mademoiselle Source several times for money, which
      she gave him. As he always wanted more, she ended by refusing, for she was
      both methodical and decided, and knew how to act rationally when it was
      necessary to do so. By dint of entreaties he obtained a large sum from her
      one night; but when he begged her for more a few days later, she showed
      herself inflexible, and did not give way to him further, in fact.

He again became quiet, as he had formerly been, remaining seated for
      entire hours, without moving, plunged in deep reverie. He now did not even
      talk to Madame Source, merely answering her remarks with short, formal
      words. Nevertheless, he was agreeable and attentive in his manner toward
      her; but he never embraced her now.

She had by this time grown slightly afraid of him when they sat facing one
      another at night on opposite sides of the fireplace. She wanted to wake
      him up, to make him say something, no matter what, that would break this
      dreadful silence, which was like the darkness of a wood. But he did not
      appear to listen to her, and she shuddered with the terror of a poor
      feeble woman when she had spoken to him five or six times successively
      without being able to get a word out of him.

What was the matter with him? What was going on in that closed-up head?
      When she had remained thus two or three hours opposite him, she felt as if
      she were going insane, and longed to rush away and to escape into the open
      country in order to avoid that mute, eternal companionship and also some
      vague danger, which she could not define, but of which she had a
      presentiment.

She frequently wept when she was alone. What was the matter with him? When
      she expressed a wish, he unmurmuringly carried it into execution. When she
      wanted anything brought from the city, he immediately went there to
      procure it. She had no complaint to make of him; no, indeed! And yet—

Another year flitted by, and it seemed to her that a fresh change had
      taken place in the mind of the young man. She perceived it; she felt it;
      she divined it. How? No matter! She was sure she was not mistaken; but she
      could not have explained in what manner the unknown thoughts of this
      strange youth had changed.

It seemed to her that, until now, he had been like a person in a
      hesitating frame of mind, who had suddenly arrived at a determination.
      This idea came to her one evening as she met his glance, a fixed, singular
      glance which she had not seen in his face before.

Then he commenced to watch her incessantly, and she wished she could hide
      herself in order to avoid that cold eye riveted on her.

He kept staring at her, evening after evening, for hours together, only
      averting his eyes when she said, utterly unnerved:

But the moment her back was turned she once more felt that his eyes were
      upon her. Wherever she went, he pursued her with his persistent gaze.

Sometimes, when she was walking in her little garden, she suddenly noticed
      him hidden behind a bush, as if he were lying in wait for her; and, again,
      when she sat in front of the house mending stockings while he was digging
      some vegetable bed, he kept continually watching her in a surreptitious
      manner, as he worked.

“What''s the matter with you, my boy? For the last three years, you
      have become very different. I don''t recognize you. Do tell me what ails
      you, and what you are thinking of.”

“Ah! my child, answer me, answer me when I speak to you. If you knew
      what grief you caused me, you would always answer, and you would not look
      at me that way. Have you any trouble? Tell me! I''ll comfort you!”

He had not grown much, having always a childish look, although his
      features were those of a man. They were, however, hard and badly cut. He
      seemed incomplete, abortive, only half finished, and disquieting as a
      mystery. He was a self-contained, unapproachable being, in whom there
      seemed always to be some active, dangerous mental labor going on.
      Mademoiselle Source was quite conscious of all this, and she could not
      sleep at night, so great was her anxiety. Frightful terrors, dreadful
      nightmares assailed her. She shut herself up in her own room, and
      barricaded the door, tortured by fear.

She feared everything, the night, the walls, the shadows thrown by the
      moon on the white curtains of the windows, and, above all, she feared him.

She could live this way no longer! She felt certain that a misfortune
      threatened her, a frightful misfortune.

She set forth secretly one morning, and went into the city to see her
      relatives. She told them about the matter in a gasping voice. The two
      women thought she was going mad and tried to reassure her.

“If you knew the way he looks at me from morning till night. He
      never takes his eyes off me! At times, I feel a longing to cry for help,
      to call in the neighbors, so much am I afraid. But what could I say to
      them? He does nothing but look at me.”

“No, never; he does everything I wish; he works hard: he is steady;
      but I am so frightened that I care nothing for that. He is planning
      something, I am certain of that—quite certain. I don''t care to
      remain all alone like that with him in the country.”

The relatives, astonished at her words, declared that people would be
      amazed, would not understand; and they advised her to keep silent about
      her fears and her plans, without, however, dissuading her from coming to
      reside in the city, hoping in that way that the entire inheritance would
      eventually fall into their hands.

Mademoiselle Source returned home. But her mind was so much upset that she
      trembled at the slightest noise, and her hands shook whenever any trifling
      disturbance agitated her.

Twice she went again to consult her relatives, quite determined now not to
      remain any longer in this way in her lonely dwelling. At last, she found a
      little cottage in the suburbs, which suited her, and she privately bought
      it.

The signature of the contract took place on a Tuesday morning, and
      Mademoiselle Source devoted the rest of the day to the preparations for
      her change of residence.

At eight o''clock in the evening she got into the diligence which passed
      within a few hundred yards of her house, and she told the conductor to put
      her down in the place where she usually alighted. The man called out to
      her as he whipped his horses:

“Good evening, Pere Joseph.” Next morning, at half-past seven,
      the postman who conveyed letters to the village noticed at the cross-road,
      not far from the high road, a large splash of blood not yet dry. He said
      to himself: “Hallo! some boozer must have had a nose bleed.”

But he perceived ten paces farther on a pocket handkerchief also stained
      with blood. He picked it up. The linen was fine, and the postman, in
      alarm, made his way over to the ditch, where he fancied he saw a strange
      object.

An hour later, the gendarmes, the examining magistrate, and other
      authorities made an inquiry as to the cause of death.

The two female relatives, called as witnesses, told all about the old
      maid''s fears and her last plans.

The orphan was arrested. After the death of the woman who had adopted him,
      he wept from morning till night, plunged, at least to all appearance, in
      the most violent grief.

He proved that he had spent the evening up to eleven o''clock in a cafe.
      Ten persons had seen him, having remained there till his departure.

The driver of the diligence stated that he had set down the murdered woman
      on the road between half-past nine and ten o''clock.

The accused was acquitted. A will, drawn up a long time before, which had
      been left in the hands of a notary in Rennes, made him sole heir. So he
      inherited everything.

For a long time, the people of the country boycotted him, as they still
      suspected him. His house, that of the dead woman, was looked upon as
      accursed. People avoided him in the street.

But he showed himself so good-natured, so open, so familiar, that
      gradually these horrible doubts were forgotten. He was generous, obliging,
      ready to talk to the humblest about anything, as long as they cared to
      talk to him.

The notary, Maitre Rameau, was one of the first to take his part,
      attracted by his smiling loquacity. He said at a dinner, at the tax
      collector''s house:

“A man who speaks with such facility and who is always in good humor
      could not have such a crime on his conscience.”

Touched by his argument, the others who were present reflected, and they
      recalled to mind the long conversations with this man who would almost
      compel them to stop at the road corners to listen to his ideas, who
      insisted on their going into his house when they were passing by his
      garden, who could crack a joke better than the lieutenant of the gendarmes
      himself, and who possessed such contagious gaiety that, in spite of the
      repugnance with which he inspired them, they could not keep from always
      laughing in his company.

At the age of fifteen both his legs had been crushed by a carriage on the
      Varville highway. From that time forth he begged, dragging himself along
      the roads and through the farmyards, supported by crutches which forced
      his shoulders up to his ears. His head looked as if it were squeezed in
      between two mountains.

A foundling, picked up out of a ditch by the priest of Les Billettes on
      the eve of All Saints'' Day and baptized, for that reason, Nicholas
      Toussaint, reared by charity, utterly without education, crippled in
      consequence of having drunk several glasses of brandy given him by the
      baker (such a funny story!) and a vagabond all his life afterward—the
      only thing he knew how to do was to hold out his hand for alms.

At one time the Baroness d''Avary allowed him to sleep in a kind of recess
      spread with straw, close to the poultry yard in the farm adjoining the
      chateau, and if he was in great need he was sure of getting a glass of
      cider and a crust of bread in the kitchen. Moreover, the old lady often
      threw him a few pennies from her window. But she was dead now.

In the villages people gave him scarcely anything—he was too well
      known. Everybody had grown tired of seeing him, day after day for forty
      years, dragging his deformed and tattered person from door to door on his
      wooden crutches. But he could not make up his mind to go elsewhere,
      because he knew no place on earth but this particular corner of the
      country, these three or four villages where he had spent the whole of his
      miserable existence. He had limited his begging operations and would not
      for worlds have passed his accustomed bounds.

He did not even know whether the world extended for any distance beyond
      the trees which had always bounded his vision. He did not ask himself the
      question. And when the peasants, tired of constantly meeting him in their
      fields or along their lanes, exclaimed: “Why don''t you go to other
      villages instead of always limping about here?” he did not answer,
      but slunk away, possessed with a vague dread of the unknown—the
      dread of a poor wretch who fears confusedly a thousand things—new
      faces, taunts, insults, the suspicious glances of people who do not know
      him and the policemen walking in couples on the roads. These last he
      always instinctively avoided, taking refuge in the bushes or behind heaps
      of stones when he saw them coming.

When he perceived them in the distance, ''With uniforms gleaming in the
      sun, he was suddenly possessed with unwonted agility—the agility of
      a wild animal seeking its lair. He threw aside his crutches, fell to the
      ground like a limp rag, made himself as small as possible and crouched
      like a hare under cover, his tattered vestments blending in hue with the
      earth on which he cowered.

He had never had any trouble with the police, but the instinct to avoid
      them was in his blood. He seemed to have inherited it from the parents he
      had never known.

He had no refuge, no roof for his head, no shelter of any kind. In summer
      he slept out of doors and in winter he showed remarkable skill in slipping
      unperceived into barns and stables. He always decamped before his presence
      could be discovered. He knew all the holes through which one could creep
      into farm buildings, and the handling of his crutches having made his arms
      surprisingly muscular he often hauled himself up through sheer strength of
      wrist into hay-lofts, where he sometimes remained for four or five days at
      a time, provided he had collected a sufficient store of food beforehand.

He lived like the beasts of the field. He was in the midst of men, yet
      knew no one, loved no one, exciting in the breasts of the peasants only a
      sort of careless contempt and smoldering hostility. They nicknamed him
      “Bell,” because he hung between his two crutches like a church
      bell between its supports.

For two days he had eaten nothing. No one gave him anything now. Every
      one''s patience was exhausted. Women shouted to him from their doorsteps
      when they saw him coming:

“Be off with you, you good-for-nothing vagabond! Why, I gave you a
      piece of bread only three days ago!”

He had exhausted Saint-Hilaire, Varville and Les Billettes without getting
      a single copper or so much as a dry crust. His only hope was in
      Tournolles, but to reach this place he would have to walk five miles along
      the highroad, and he felt so weary that he could hardly drag himself
      another yard. His stomach and his pocket were equally empty, but he
      started on his way.

It was December and a cold wind blew over the fields and whistled through
      the bare branches of the trees; the clouds careered madly across the
      black, threatening sky. The cripple dragged himself slowly along, raising
      one crutch after the other with a painful effort, propping himself on the
      one distorted leg which remained to him.

Now and then he sat down beside a ditch for a few moments'' rest. Hunger
      was gnawing his vitals, and in his confused, slow-working mind he had only
      one idea-to eat-but how this was to be accomplished he did not know. For
      three hours he continued his painful journey. Then at last the sight of
      the trees of the village inspired him with new energy.

And “Bell” went on his way. At every door he got nothing but
      hard words. He made the round of the whole village, but received not a
      halfpenny for his pains.

Then he visited the neighboring farms, toiling through the muddy land, so
      exhausted that he could hardly raise his crutches from the ground. He met
      with the same reception everywhere. It was one of those cold, bleak days,
      when the heart is frozen and the temper irritable, and hands do not open
      either to give money or food.

When he had visited all the houses he knew, “Bell” sank down
      in the corner of a ditch running across Chiquet''s farmyard. Letting his
      crutches slip to the ground, he remained motionless, tortured by hunger,
      but hardly intelligent enough to realize to the full his unutterable
      misery.

He awaited he knew not what, possessed with that vague hope which persists
      in the human heart in spite of everything. He awaited in the corner of the
      farmyard in the biting December wind, some mysterious aid from Heaven or
      from men, without the least idea whence it was to arrive. A number of
      black hens ran hither and thither, seeking their food in the earth which
      supports all living things. Ever now and then they snapped up in their
      beaks a grain of corn or a tiny insect; then they continued their slow,
      sure search for nutriment.

“Bell” watched them at first without thinking of anything.
      Then a thought occurred rather to his stomach than to his mind—the
      thought that one of those fowls would be good to eat if it were cooked
      over a fire of dead wood.

He did not reflect that he was going to commit a theft. He took up a stone
      which lay within reach, and, being of skillful aim, killed at the first
      shot the fowl nearest to him. The bird fell on its side, flapping its
      wings. The others fled wildly hither and thither, and “Bell,”
      picking up his crutches, limped across to where his victim lay.

Just as he reached the little black body with its crimsoned head he
      received a violent blow in his back which made him let go his hold of his
      crutches and sent him flying ten paces distant. And Farmer Chiquet, beside
      himself with rage, cuffed and kicked the marauder with all the fury of a
      plundered peasant as “Bell” lay defenceless before him.

The farm hands came up also and joined their master in cuffing the lame
      beggar. Then when they were tired of beating him they carried him off and
      shut him up in the woodshed, while they went to fetch the police.

“Bell,” half dead, bleeding and perishing with hunger, lay on
      the floor. Evening came—then night—then dawn. And still he had
      not eaten.

About midday the police arrived. They opened the door of the woodshed with
      the utmost precaution, fearing resistance on the beggar''s part, for Farmer
      Chiquet asserted that he had been attacked by him and had had great,
      difficulty in defending himself.

But “Bell” could not move. He did his best to raise himself on
      his crutches, but without success. The police, thinking his weakness
      feigned, pulled him up by main force and set him between the crutches.

Fear seized him—his native fear of a uniform, the fear of the game
      in presence of the sportsman, the fear of a mouse for a cat-and by the
      exercise of almost superhuman effort he succeeded in remaining upright.

“Forward!” said the sergeant. He walk' WHERE id = '47483ce4-df10-44b3-81b8-ab924b78ab8b';
