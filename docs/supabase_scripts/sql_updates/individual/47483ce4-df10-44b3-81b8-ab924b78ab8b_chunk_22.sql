      nose, the other in the stomach. He threw up his arms and legs and fell on
      his back into the river, just into the hole.

“I should have fished him out most certainly, Monsieur le President,
      if I had had time. But, to make matters worse, the fat woman had the upper
      hand and was pounding Melie for all she was worth. I know I ought not to
      have interfered while the man was in the water, but I never thought that
      he would drown and said to myself: ''Bah, it will cool him.''

“I therefore ran up to the women to separate them and all I received
      was scratches and bites. Good Lord, what creatures! Well, it took me five
      minutes, and perhaps ten, to separate those two viragos. When I turned
      round there was nothing to be seen.

“The water was as smooth as a lake and the others yonder kept
      shouting: ''Fish him out! fish him out!'' It was all very well to say that,
      but I cannot swim and still less dive.

“At last the man from the dam came and two gentlemen with boathooks,
      but over a quarter of an hour had passed. He was found at the bottom of
      the hole, in eight feet of water, as I have said. There he was, the poor
      little man, in his linen suit! Those are the facts such as I have sworn
      to. I am innocent, on my honor.”

The hotel guests slowly entered the dining-room and took their places. The
      waiters did not hurry themselves, in order to give the late comers a
      chance and thus avoid the trouble of bringing in the dishes a second time.
      The old bathers, the habitues, whose season was almost over, glanced,
      gazed toward the door whenever it opened, to see what new faces might
      appear.

This is the principal distraction of watering places. People look forward
      to the dinner hour in order to inspect each day''s new arrivals, to find
      out who they are, what they do, and what they think. We always have a
      vague desire to meet pleasant people, to make agreeable acquaintances,
      perhaps to meet with a love adventure. In this life of elbowings, unknown
      strangers assume an extreme importance. Curiosity is aroused, sympathy is
      ready to exhibit itself, and sociability is the order of the day.

We cherish antipathies for a week and friendships for a month; we see
      people with different eyes, when we view them through the medium of
      acquaintanceship at watering places. We discover in men suddenly, after an
      hour''s chat, in the evening after dinner, under the trees in the park
      where the healing spring bubbles up, a high intelligence and astonishing
      merits, and a month afterward we have completely forgotten these new
      friends, who were so fascinating when we first met them.

Permanent and serious ties are also formed here sooner than anywhere else.
      People see each other every day; they become acquainted very quickly, and
      their affection is tinged with the sweetness and unrestraint of
      long-standing intimacies. We cherish in after years the dear and tender
      memories of those first hours of friendship, the memory of those first
      conversations in which a soul was unveiled, of those first glances which
      interrogate and respond to questions and secret thoughts which the mouth
      has not as yet uttered, the memory of that first cordial confidence, the
      memory of that delightful sensation of opening our hearts to those who
      seem to open theirs to us in return.

And the melancholy of watering places, the monotony of days that are all
      alike, proves hourly an incentive to this heart expansion.

Only two appeared, but they were very remarkable, a man and a woman
      —father and daughter. They immediately reminded me of some of Edgar
      Poe''s characters; and yet there was about them a charm, the charm
      associated with misfortune. I looked upon them as the victims of fate. The
      man was very tall and thin, rather stooped, with perfectly white hair, too
      white for his comparatively youthful physiognomy; and there was in his
      bearing and in his person that austerity peculiar to Protestants. The
      daughter, who was probably twenty-four or twenty-five, was small in
      stature, and was also very thin, very pale, and she had the air of one who
      was worn out with utter lassitude. We meet people like this from time to
      time, who seem too weak for the tasks and the needs of daily life, too
      weak to move about, to walk, to do all that we do every day. She was
      rather pretty; with a transparent, spiritual beauty. And she ate with
      extreme slowness, as if she were almost incapable of moving her arms.

They sat facing me, on the opposite side of the table; and I at once
      noticed that the father had a very singular, nervous twitching.

Every time he wanted to reach an object, his hand described a sort of
      zigzag before it succeeded in reaching what it was in search of, and after
      a little while this movement annoyed me so that I turned aside my head in
      order not to see it.

After dinner I went for a stroll in the park of the bathing establishment.
      This led toward the little Auvergnese station of Chatel-Guyon, hidden in a
      gorge at the foot of the high mountain, from which flowed so many boiling
      springs, arising from the deep bed of extinct volcanoes. Over yonder,
      above our heads, the domes of extinct craters lifted their ragged peaks
      above the rest in the long mountain chain. For Chatel-Guyon is situated at
      the entrance to the land of mountain domes.

Beyond it stretches out the region of peaks, and, farther on again the
      region of precipitous summits.

The “Puy de Dome” is the highest of the domes, the Peak of
      Sancy is the loftiest of the peaks, and Cantal is the most precipitous of
      these mountain heights.

It was a very warm evening, and I was walking up and down a shady path,
      listening to the opening, strains of the Casino band, which was playing on
      an elevation overlooking the park.

And I saw the father and the daughter advancing slowly in my direction. I
      bowed as one bows to one''s hotel companions at a watering place; and the
      man, coming to a sudden halt, said to me:

“Could you not, monsieur, tell us of a nice walk to take, short,
      pretty, and not steep; and pardon my troubling you?”

I offered to show them the way toward the valley through which the little
      river flowed, a deep valley forming a gorge between two tall, craggy,
      wooded slopes.

“Oh,” he said, “my daughter has a strange malady, the
      seat of which is unknown. She suffers from incomprehensible nervous
      attacks. At one time the doctors think she has an attack of heart disease,
      at another time they imagine it is some affection of the liver, and at
      another they declare it to be a disease of the spine. To-day this protean
      malady, that assumes a thousand forms and a thousand modes of attack, is
      attributed to the stomach, which is the great caldron and regulator of the
      body. This is why we have come here. For my part, I am rather inclined to
      think it is the nerves. In any case it is very sad.”

Immediately the remembrance of the violent spasmodic movement of his hand
      came back to my mind, and I asked him:

“Ah! You were alluding to the jerking movement of my hand every time
      I try to reach for anything? This arises from a terrible experience which
      I had. Just imagine, this daughter of mine was actually buried alive!”

“Here is the story. It is simple. Juliette had been subject for some
      time to serious attacks of the heart. We believed that she had disease of
      that organ, and were prepared for the worst.

“One day she was carried into the house cold, lifeless, dead. She
      had fallen down unconscious in the garden. The doctor certified that life
      was extinct. I watched by her side for a day and two nights. I laid her
      with my own hands in the coffin, which I accompanied to the cemetery,
      where she was deposited in the family vault. It is situated in the very
      heart of Lorraine.

“I wished to have her interred with her jewels, bracelets,
      necklaces, rings, all presents which she had received from me, and wearing
      her first ball dress.

“You may easily imagine my state of mind when I re-entered our home.
      She was the only one I had, for my wife had been dead for many years. I
      found my way to my own apartment in a half-distracted condition, utterly
      exhausted, and sank into my easy-chair, without the capacity to think or
      the strength to move. I was nothing better now than a suffering, vibrating
      machine, a human being who had, as it were, been flayed alive; my soul was
      like an open wound.

“My old valet, Prosper, who had assisted me in placing Juliette in
      her coffin, and aided me in preparing her for her last sleep, entered the
      room noiselessly, and asked:

“''Monsieur is wrong,'' he urged. ''He will injure his health. Would
      monsieur like me to put him to bed?''

“I know not how many hours slipped away. Oh, what a night, what a
      night! It was cold. My fire had died out in the huge grate; and the wind,
      the winter wind, an icy wind, a winter hurricane, blew with a regular,
      sinister noise against the windows.

“How many hours slipped away? There I was without sleeping,
      powerless, crushed, my eyes wide open, my legs stretched out, my body
      limp, inanimate, and my mind torpid with despair. Suddenly the great
      doorbell, the great bell of the vestibule, rang out.

“I started so that my chair cracked under me. The solemn, ponderous
      sound vibrated through the empty country house as through a vault. I
      turned round to see what the hour was by the clock. It was just two in the
      morning. Who could be coming at such an hour?

“And, abruptly, the bell again rang twice. The servants, without
      doubt, were afraid to get up. I took a wax candle and descended the
      stairs. I was on the point of asking: ''Who is there?''

“Then I felt ashamed of my weakness, and I slowly drew back the
      heavy bolts. My heart was throbbing wildly. I was frightened. I opened the
      door brusquely, and in the darkness I distinguished a white figure,
      standing erect, something that resembled an apparition.

“I really thought I must be mad, and I retreated backward before
      this advancing spectre. I kept moving away, making a sign with my hand,''
      as if to drive the phantom away, that gesture which you have noticed—that
      gesture which has remained with me ever since.

“''Do not be afraid, papa,'' said the apparition. ''I was not dead.
      Somebody tried to steal my rings and cut one of my fingers; the blood
      began to flow, and that restored me to life.''

“Then, when I had somewhat collected my thoughts, though I was still
      so bewildered that I scarcely realized the awesome happiness that had
      befallen me, I made her go up to my room and sit dawn in my easy-chair;
      then I rang excitedly for Prosper to get him to rekindle the fire and to
      bring some wine, and to summon assistance.

“The man entered, stared at my daughter, opened his mouth with a
      gasp of alarm and stupefaction, and then fell back dead.

“It was he who had opened the vault, who had mutilated and then
      abandoned my daughter; for he could not efface the traces of the theft. He
      had not even taken the trouble to put back the coffin into its place,
      feeling sure, besides, that he would not be suspected by me, as I trusted
      him absolutely.

The night had fallen, casting its shadows over the desolate, mournful
      vale, and a sort of mysterious fear possessed me at finding myself by the
      side of those strange beings, of this young girl who had come back from
      the tomb, and this father with his uncanny spasm.

As the mayor was about to sit down to breakfast, word was brought to him
      that the rural policeman, with two prisoners, was awaiting him at the
      Hotel de Ville. He went there at once and found old Hochedur standing
      guard before a middle-class couple whom he was regarding with a severe
      expression on his face.

The man, a fat old fellow with a red nose and white hair, seemed utterly
      dejected; while the woman, a little roundabout individual with shining
      cheeks, looked at the official who had arrested them, with defiant eyes.

The rural policeman made his deposition: He had gone out that morning at
      his usual time, in order to patrol his beat from the forest of Champioux
      as far as the boundaries of Argenteuil. He had not noticed anything
      unusual in the country except that it was a fine day, and that the wheat
      was doing well, when the son of old Bredel, who was going over his vines,
      called out to him: “Here, Daddy Hochedur, go and have a look at the
      outskirts of the wood. In the first thicket you will find a pair of
      pigeons who must be a hundred and thirty years old between them!”

He went in the direction indicated, entered the thicket, and there he
      heard words which made him suspect a flagrant breach of morality.
      Advancing, therefore, on his hands and knees as if to surprise a poacher,
      he had arrested the couple whom he found there.

The mayor looked at the culprits in astonishment, for the man was
      certainly sixty, and the woman fifty-five at least, and he began to
      question them, beginning with the man, who replied in such a weak voice
      that he could scarcely be heard.

The haberdasher remained silent, with his eyes on his fat paunch, and his
      hands hanging at his sides, and the mayor continued:

“But in that case—you must be mad, altogether mad, my dear
      sir, to get caught playing lovers in the country at ten o''clock in the
      morning.”

The haberdasher seemed ready to cry with shame, and he muttered: “It
      was she who enticed me! I told her it was very stupid, but when a woman
      once gets a thing into her head—you know—you cannot get it
      out.”

The mayor, who liked a joke, smiled and replied: “In your case, the
      contrary ought to have happened. You would not be here, if she had had the
      idea only in her head.”

Then Monsieur Beauain was seized with rage and turning to his wife, he
      said: “Do you see to what you have brought us with your poetry? And
      now we shall have to go before the courts at our age, for a breach of
      morals! And we shall have to shut up the shop, sell our good will, and go
      to some other neighborhood! That''s what it has come to.”

Madame Beaurain got up, and without looking at her husband, she explained
      herself without embarrassment, without useless modesty, and almost without
      hesitation.

“Of course, monsieur, I know that we have made ourselves ridiculous.
      Will you allow me to plead my cause like an advocate, or rather like a
      poor woman? And I hope that you will be kind enough to send us home, and
      to spare us the disgrace of a prosecution.

“Years ago, when I was young, I made Monsieur Beaurain''s
      acquaintance one Sunday in this neighborhood. He was employed in a
      draper''s shop, and I was a saleswoman in a ready-made clothing
      establishment. I remember it as if it were yesterday. I used to come and
      spend Sundays here occasionally with a friend of mine, Rose Leveque, with
      whom I lived in the Rue Pigalle, and Rose had a sweetheart, while I had
      none. He used to bring us here, and one Saturday he told me laughing that
      he should bring a friend with him the next day. I quite understood what he
      meant, but I replied that it would be no good; for I was virtuous,
      monsieur.

“The next day we met Monsieur Beaurain at the railway station, and
      in those days he was good-looking, but I had made up my mind not to
      encourage him, and I did not. Well, we arrived at Bezons. It was a lovely
      day, the sort of day that touches your heart. When it is fine even now,
      just as it used to be formerly, I grow quite foolish, and when I am in the
      country I utterly lose my head. The green grass, the swallows flying so
      swiftly, the smell of the grass, the scarlet poppies, the daisies, all
      that makes me crazy. It is like champagne when one is not accustomed to
      it!

“Well, it was lovely weather, warm and bright, and it seemed to
      penetrate your body through your eyes when you looked and through your
      mouth when you breathed. Rose and Simon hugged and kissed each other every
      minute, and that gave me a queer feeling! Monsieur Beaurain and I walked
      behind them, without speaking much, for when people do not know each
      other, they do not find anything to talk about. He looked timid, and I
      liked to see his embarrassment. At last we got to the little wood; it was
      as cool as in a bath there, and we four sat down. Rose and her lover
      teased me because I looked rather stern, but you will understand that I
      could not be otherwise. And then they began to kiss and hug again, without
      putting any more restraint upon themselves than if we had not been there;
      and then they whispered together, and got up and went off among the trees,
      without saying a word. You may fancy what I looked like, alone with this
      young fellow whom I saw for the first time. I felt so confused at seeing
      them go that it gave me courage, and I began to talk. I asked him what his
      business was, and he said he was a linen draper''s assistant, as I told you
      just now. We talked for a few minutes, and that made him bold, and he
      wanted to take liberties with me, but I told him sharply to keep his
      place. Is not that true, Monsieur Beaurain?”

Monsieur Beaurain, who was looking at his feet in confusion, did not
      reply, and she continued: “Then he saw that I was virtuous, and he
      began to make love to me nicely, like an honorable man, and from that time
      he came every Sunday, for he was very much in love with me. I was very
      fond of him also, very fond of him! He was a good-looking fellow,
      formerly, and in short he married me the next September, and we started in
      business in the Rue des Martyrs.

“It was a hard struggle for some years, monsieur. Business did not
      prosper, and we could not afford many country excursions, and, besides, we
      had got out of the way of them. One has other things in one''s head, and
      thinks more of the cash box than of pretty speeches, when one is in
      business. We were growing old by degrees without perceiving it, like quiet
      people who do not think much about love. One does not regret anything as
      long as one does not notice what one has lost.

“And then, monsieur, business became better, and we were tranquil as
      to the future! Then, you see, I do not exactly know what went on in my
      mind, no, I really do not know, but I began to dream like a little
      boarding-school girl. The sight of the little carts full of flowers which
      are drawn about the streets made me cry; the smell of violets sought me
      out in my easy-chair, behind my cash box, and made my heart beat! Then I
      would get up and go out on the doorstep to look at the blue sky between
      the roofs. When one looks up at the sky from the street, it looks like a
      river which is descending on Paris, winding as it flows, and the swallows
      pass to and fro in it like fish. These ideas are very stupid at my age!
      But how can one help it, monsieur, when one has worked all one''s life? A
      moment comes in which one perceives that one could have done something
      else, and that one regrets, oh! yes, one feels intense regret! Just think,
      for twenty years I might have gone and had kisses in the woods, like other
      women. I used to think how delightful it would be to lie under the trees
      and be in love with some one! And I thought of it every day and every
      night! I dreamed of the moonlight on the water, until I felt inclined to
      drown myself.

“I did not venture to speak to Monsieur Beaurain about this at
      first. I knew that he would make fun of me, and send me back to sell my
      needles and cotton! And then, to speak the truth, Monsieur Beaurain never
      said much to me, but when I looked in the glass, I also understood quite
      well that I no longer appealed to any one!

“Well, I made up my mind, and I proposed to him an excursion into
      the country, to the place where we had first become acquainted. He agreed
      without mistrusting anything, and we arrived here this morning, about nine
      o''clock.

“I felt quite young again when I got among the wheat, for a woman''s
      heart never grows old! And really, I no longer saw my husband as he is at
      present, but just as he was formerly! That I will swear to you, monsieur.
      As true as I am standing here I was crazy. I began to kiss him, and he was
      more surprised than if I had tried to murder him. He kept saying to me:
      ''Why, you must be mad! You are mad this morning! What is the matter with
      you?'' I did not listen to him, I only listened to my own heart, and I made
      him come into the wood with me. That is all. I have spoken the truth,
      Monsieur le Maire, the whole truth.”

The mayor was a sensible man. He rose from his chair, smiled, and said:
      “Go in peace, madame, and when you again visit our forests, be more
      discreet.”

It came to him one Sunday after mass. He was walking home from church
      along the by-road that led to his house when he saw ahead of him Martine,
      who was also going home.

Her father walked beside his daughter with the important gait of a rich
      farmer. Discarding the smock, he wore a short coat of gray cloth and on
      his head a round-topped hat with wide brim.

She, laced up in a corset which she wore only once a week, walked along
      erect, with her squeezed-in waist, her broad shoulders and prominent hips,
      swinging herself a little. She wore a hat trimmed with flowers, made by a
      milliner at Yvetot, and displayed the back of her full, round, supple
      neck, reddened by the sun and air, on which fluttered little stray locks
      of hair.

Benoist saw only her back; but he knew well the face he loved, without,
      however, having ever noticed it more closely than he did now.

Suddenly he said: “Nom d''un nom, she is a fine girl, all the same,
      that Martine.” He watched her as she walked, admiring her hastily,
      feeling a desire taking possession of him. He did not long to see her face
      again, no. He kept gazing at her figure, repeating to himself: “Nom
      d''un nom, she is a fine girl.”

Martine turned to the right to enter “La Martiniere,” the farm
      of her father, Jean Martin, and she cast a glance behind her as she turned
      round. She saw Benoist, who looked to her very comical. She called out:
      “Good-morning, Benoist.” He replied: “Good-morning,
      Martine; good-morning, mait Martin,” and went on his way.

When he reached home the soup was on the table. He sat down opposite his
      mother beside the farm hand and the hired man, while the maid servant went
      to draw some cider.

He watched the others eating, as he cut himself a piece of bread from time
      to time and carried it lazily to his mouth, masticating it slowly. He
      thought of Martine. “She is a fine girl, all the same.” And to
      think that he had not noticed it before, and that it came to him, just
      like that, all at once, and with such force that he could not eat.

“Come, Benoist, try and eat a little; it is loin of mutton, it will
      do you good. When one has no appetite, they should force themselves to
      eat.”

When they rose from table he walked round the farm, telling the farm hand
      he might go home and that he would drive up the animals as he passed by
      them.

The country was deserted, as it was the day of rest. Here and there in a
      field of clover cows were moving along heavily, with full bellies, chewing
      their cud under a blazing sun. Unharnessed plows were standing at the end
      of a furrow; and the upturned earth ready for the seed showed broad brown
      patches of stubble of wheat and oats that had lately been harvested.

A rather dry autumn wind blew across the plain, promising a cool evening
      after the sun had set. Benoist sat down on a ditch, placed his hat on his
      knees as if he needed to cool off his head, and said aloud in the
      stillness of the country: “If you want a fine girl, she is a fine
      girl.”

He was not sad, he was not discontented, he could not have told what ailed
      him. It was something that had hold of him, something fastened in his
      mind, an idea that would not leave him and that produced a sort of
      tickling sensation in his heart.

Sometimes a big fly is shut up in a room. You hear it flying about,
      buzzing, and the noise haunts you, irritates you. Suddenly it stops; you
      forget it; but all at once it begins again, obliging you to look up. You
      cannot catch it, nor drive it away, nor kill it, nor make it keep still.
      As soon as it settles for a second, it starts off buzzing again.

Then he longed to see her again and walked past the Martiniere several
      times. He saw her, at last, hanging out some clothes on a line stretched
      between two apple trees.

It was a warm day. She had on only a short skirt and her chemise, showing
      the curves of her figure as she hung up the towels. He remained there,
      concealed by the hedge, for more than an hour, even after she had left. He
      returned home more obsessed with her image than ever.

For a month his mind was full of her, he trembled when her name was
      mentioned in his presence. He could not eat, he had night sweats that kept
      him from sleeping.

On Sunday, at mass, he never took his eyes off her. She noticed it and
      smiled at him, flattered at his appreciation.

One evening, he suddenly met her in the road. She stopped short when she
      saw him coming. Then he walked right up to her, choking with fear and
      emotion, but determined to speak to her. He began falteringly:

From that day they met each other along the roadside, in by-roads or else
      at twilight on the edge of a field, when he was going home with his horses
      and she was driving her cows home to the stable.

He felt himself carried, cast toward her by a strong impulse of his heart
      and body. He would have liked to squeeze her, strangle her, eat her, make
      her part of himself. And he trembled with impotence, impatience, rage, to
      think she did not belong to him entirely, as if they were one being.

People gossiped about it in the countryside. They said they were engaged.
      He had, besides, asked her if she would be his wife, and she had answered
      “Yes.”

But, all at once, she stopped coming to meet him at the usual hour. He did
      not even see her as he wandered round the farm. He could only catch a
      glimpse of her at mass on Sunday. And one Sunday, after the sermon, the
      priest actually published the banns of marriage between Victoire-Adelaide
      Martin and Josephin-Isidore Vallin.

Benoist felt a sensation in his hands as if the blood had been drained
      off. He had a buzzing in the ears; and could hear nothing; and presently
      he perceived that his tears were falling on his prayer book.

But he was not cured, and it was always in his mind. He avoided the roads
      that led past her home, so that he might not even see the trees in the
      yard, and this obliged him to make a great circuit morning and evening.

She was now married to Vallin, the richest farmer in the district. Benoist
      and he did not speak now, though they had been comrades from childhood.

One evening, as Benoist was passing the town hall, he heard that she was
      enceinte. Instead of experiencing a feeling of sorrow, he experienced, on
      the contrary, a feeling of relief. It was over, now, all over. They were
      more separated by that than by her marriage. He really preferred that it
      should be so.

Months passed, and more months. He caught sight of her, occasionally,
      going to the village with a heavier step than usual. She blushed as she
      saw him, lowered her head and quickened her pace. And he turned out of his
      way so as not to pass her and meet her glance.

He dreaded the thought that he might one morning meet her face to face,
      and be obliged to speak to her. What could he say to her now, after all he
      had said formerly, when he held her hands as he kissed her hair beside her
      cheeks? He often thought of those meetings along the roadside. She had
      acted horridly after all her promises.

By degrees his grief diminished, leaving only sadness behind. And one day
      he took the old road that led past the farm where she now lived. He looked
      at the roof from a distance. It was there, in there, that she lived with
      another! The apple trees were in bloom, the cocks crowed on the dung hill.
      The whole dwelling seemed empty, the farm hands had gone to the fields to
      their spring toil. He stopped near the gate and looked into the yard. The
      dog was asleep outside his kennel, three calves were walking slowly, one
      behind the other, towards the pond. A big turkey was strutting before the
      door, parading before the turkey hens like a singer at the opera.

Benoist leaned against the gate post and was suddenly seized with a desire
      to weep. But suddenly, he heard a cry, a loud cry for help coming from the
      house. He was struck with dismay, his hands grasping the wooden bars of
      the gate, and listened attentively. Another cry, a prolonged, heartrending
      cry, reached his ears, his soul, his flesh. It was she who was crying like
      that! He darted inside, crossed the grass patch, pushed open the door, and
      saw her lying on the floor, her body drawn up, her face livid, her eyes
      haggard, in the throes of childbirth.

Benoist was suddenly seized with a frantic longing to help her, to quiet
      her, to remove her pain. He leaned over, lifted her up and laid her on her
      bed; and while she kept on moaning he began to take off her clothes, her
      jacket, her skirt and her petticoat. She bit her fists to keep from crying
      out. Then he did as he was accustomed to doing for cows, ewes, and mares:
      he assisted in delivering her and found in his hands a large infant who
      was moaning.

He wiped it off and wrapped it up in a towel that was drying in front of
      the fire, and laid it on a bundle of clothes ready for ironing that was on
      the table. Then he went back to the mother.

He took her up and placed her on the floor again, then he changed the
      bedclothes and put her back into bed. She faltered:

“Thank you, Benoist, you have a noble heart.” And then she
      wept a little as if she felt regretful.

He did not love her any longer, not the least bit. It was all over. Why?
      How? He could not have said. What had happened had cured him better than
      ten years of absence.

He took up the little one and was showing it to her as if he were holding
      the consecrated wafer, when the door opened, and Isidore Vallin appeared.

“I was passing, I was just passing by when I heard her crying out,
      and I came—there is your child, Vallin!”

Then the husband, his eyes full of tears, stepped forward, took the little
      mite of humanity that he held out to him, kissed it, unable to speak from
      emotion for a few seconds; then placing the child on the bed, he held out
      both hands to Benoist, saying:

“Your hand upon it, Benoist. From now on we understand each other.
      If you are willing, we will be a pair of friends, a pair of friends!”
      And Benoist replied: “Indeed I will, certainly, indeed I will.”

Compte de Lormerin had just finished dressing. He cast a parting glance at
      the large mirror which occupied an entire panel in his dressing-room and
      smiled.

He was really a fine-looking man still, although quite gray. Tall, slight,
      elegant, with no sign of a paunch, with a small mustache of doubtful
      shade, which might be called fair, he had a walk, a nobility, a “chic,”
      in short, that indescribable something which establishes a greater
      difference between two men than would millions of money. He murmured:

On his table, where everything had its place, the work table of the
      gentleman who never works, there were a dozen letters lying beside three
      newspapers of different opinions. With a single touch he spread out all
      these letters, like a gambler giving the choice of a card; and he scanned
      the handwriting, a thing he did each morning before opening the envelopes.

It was for him a moment of delightful expectancy, of inquiry and vague
      anxiety. What did these sealed mysterious letters bring him? What did they
      contain of pleasure, of happiness, or of grief? He surveyed them with a
      rapid sweep of the eye, recognizing the writing, selecting them, making
      two or three lots, according to what he expected from them. Here, friends;
      there, persons to whom he was indifferent; further on, strangers. The last
      kind always gave him a little uneasiness. What did they want from him?
      What hand had traced those curious characters full of thoughts, promises,
      or threats?

This day one letter in particular caught his eye. It was simple,
      nevertheless, without seeming to reveal anything; but he looked at it
      uneasily, with a sort of chill at his heart. He thought: “From whom
      can it be? I certainly know this writing, and yet I can''t identify it.”

He raised it to a level with his face, holding it delicately between two
      fingers, striving to read through the envelope, without making up his mind
      to open it.

Then he smelled it, and snatched up from the table a little magnifying
      glass which he used in studying all the niceties of handwriting. He
      suddenly felt unnerved. “Whom is it from? This hand is familiar to
      me, very familiar. I must have often read its tracings, yes, very often.
      But this must have been a long, long time ago. Whom the deuce can it be
      from? Pooh! it''s only somebody asking for money.”

Lormerin''s heart began to throb. He remained sunk in his armchair with the
      letter on his knees, staring straight before him, overcome by a poignant
      emotion that made the tears mount up to his eyes!

If he had ever loved a woman in his life it was this one, little Lise,
      Lise de Vance, whom he called “Ashflower,” on account of the
      strange color of her hair and the pale gray of her eyes. Oh! what a
      dainty, pretty, charming creature she was, this frail baronne, the wife of
      that gouty, pimply baron, who had abruptly carried her off to the
      provinces, shut her up, kept her in seclusion through jealousy, jealousy
      of the handsome Lormerin.

Yes, he had loved her, and he believed that he too, had been truly loved.
      She familiarly gave him, the name of Jaquelet, and would pronounce that
      word in a delicious fashion.

A thousand forgotten memories came back to him, far, off and sweet and
      melancholy now. One evening she had called on him on her way home from a
      ball, and they went for a stroll in the Bois de Boulogne, she in evening
      dress, he in his dressing-jacket. It was springtime; the weather was
      beautiful. The fragrance from her bodice embalmed the warm air-the odor of
      her bodice, and perhaps, too, the fragrance of her skin. What a divine
      night! When they reached the lake, as the moon''s rays fell across the
      branches into the water, she began to weep. A little surprised, he asked
      her why.

“I don''t know. The moon and the water have affected me. Every time I
      see poetic things I have a tightening at the heart, and I have to cry.”

He smiled, affected himself, considering her feminine emotion charming
      —the unaffected emotion of a poor little woman, whom every sensation
      overwhelms. And he embraced her passionately, stammering:

What a charming love affair, short-lived and dainty, it had been and over
      all too quickly, cut short in the midst of its ardor by this old brute of
      a baron, who had carried off his wife, and never let any one see her
      afterward.

Lormerin had forgotten, in fact, at the end of two or three months. One
      woman drives out another so quickly in Paris, when one is a bachelor! No
      matter; he had kept a little altar for her in his heart, for he had loved
      her alone! He assured himself now that this was so.

And instinctively he turned toward the mirror to inspect himself from head
      to foot. He reflected: “She must look very old, older than I look.”
      And he felt gratified at the thought of showing himself to her still
      handsome, still fresh, of astonishing her, perhaps of filling her with
      emotion, and making her regret those bygone days so far, far distant!

The whole day he kept thinking of this ghost of other days. What was she
      like now? How strange it was to meet in this way after twenty-five years!
      But would he recognize her?

He made his toilet with feminine coquetry, put on a white waistcoat, which
      suited him better with the coat than a black one, sent for the hairdresser
      to give him a finishing touch with the curling iron, for he had preserved
      his hair, and started very early in order to show his eagerness to see
      her.

The first thing he saw on entering a pretty drawing-room newly furnished
      was his own portrait, an old faded photograph, dating from the days when
      he was a beau, hanging on the wall in an antique silk frame.

He sat down and waited. A door opened behind him. He rose up abruptly,
      and, turning round, beheld an old woman with white hair who extended both
      hands toward him.

He seized them, kissed them one after the other several times; then,
      lifting up his head, he gazed at the woman he had loved.

Yes, it was an old lady, an old lady whom he did not recognize, and who,
      while she smiled, seemed ready to weep.

“Yes, it is I; it is I, indeed. You would not have known me, would
      you? I have had so much sorrow—so much sorrow. Sorrow has consumed
      my life. Look at me now—or, rather, don''t look at me! But how
      handsome you have kept—and young! If I had by chance met you in the
      street I would have exclaimed: ''Jaquelet!''. Now, sit down and let us,
      first of all, have a chat. And then I will call my daughter, my grown-up
      daughter. You''ll see how she resembles me—or, rather, how I
      resembled her—no, it is not quite that; she is just like the ''me'' of
      former days—you shall see! But I wanted to be alone with you first.
      I feared that there would be some emotion on my side, at the first moment.
      Now it is all over; it is past. Pray be seated, my friend.”

He sat down beside her, holding her hand; but he did not know what to say;
      he did not know this woman—it seemed to him that he had never seen
      her before. Why had he come to this house? What could he talk about? Of
      the long ago? What was there in common between him and her? He could no
      longer recall anything in presence of this grandmotherly face. He could no
      longer recall all the nice, tender things, so sweet, so bitter, that had
      come to his mind that morning when he thought of the other, of little
      Lise, of the dainty Ashflower. What, then, had become of her, the former
      one, the one he had loved? That woman of far-off dreams, the blonde with
      gray eyes, the young girl who used to call him “Jaquelet” so
      prettily?

As they talked only commonplaces, awkwardly and spasmodically and slowly,
      she rose and pressed the button of the bell.

In fact, it was she, she whom he had known in bygone days, the Lise who
      had vanished and come back! In her he found the woman he had won
      twenty-five years before. This one was even younger, fresher, more
      childlike.

He felt a wild desire to open his arms, to clasp her to his heart again,
      murmuring in her ear:

What passed at this dinner? What did they say to him, and what could he
      say in reply? He found himself plunged in one of those strange dreams
      which border on insanity. He gazed at the two women with a fixed idea in
      his mind, a morbid, self-contradictory idea:

“Do you remember?” And it was in the bright eyes of the young
      girl that he found again his memories of the past. Twenty times he opened
      his mouth to say to her: “Do you remember, Lison?” forgetting
      this white-haired lady who was looking at him tenderly.

And yet, there were moments when, he no longer felt sure, when he lost his
      head. He could see that the woman of to-day was not exactly the woman of
      long ago. The other one, the former one, had in her voice, in her glances,
      in her entire being, something which he did not find again. And he made
      prodigious efforts of mind to recall his lady love, to seize again what
      had escaped from her, what this resuscitated one did not possess.

But in his heart, touched with emotion, he felt his old love springing to
      life once more, like an awakened wild beast ready to bite him.

The young girl went on chattering, and every now and then some familiar
      intonation, some expression of her mother''s, a certain style of speaking
      and thinking, that resemblance of mind and manner which people acquire by
      living together, shook Lormerin from head to foot. All these things
      penetrated him, making the reopened wound of his passion bleed anew.

He got away early, and took a turn along the boulevard. But the image of
      this young girl pursued him, haunted him, quickened his heart, inflamed
      his blood. Apart from the two women, he now saw only one, a young one, the
      old one come back out of the past, and he loved her as he had loved her in
      bygone years. He loved her with greater ardor, after an interval of
      twenty-five years.

But, as he was passing, with a wax candle in his hand, before the glass,
      the large glass in which he had contemplated himself and admired himself
      before he started, he saw reflected there an elderly, gray-haired man; and
      suddenly he recollected what he had been in olden days, in the days of
      little Lise. He saw himself charming and handsome, as he had been when he
      was loved! Then, drawing the light nearer, he looked at himself more
      closely, as one inspects a strange thing with a magnifying glass, tracing
      the wrinkles, discovering those frightful ravages, which he had not
      perceived till now.

And he sat down, crushed at the sight of himself, at the sight of his
      lamentable image, murmuring:

Everybody in Fecamp knew Mother Patin''s story. She had certainly been
      unfortunate with her husband, for in his lifetime he used to beat her,
      just as wheat is threshed in the barn.

He was master of a fishing bark and had married her, formerly, because she
      was pretty, although poor.

Patin was a good sailor, but brutal. He used to frequent Father Auban''s
      inn, where he would usually drink four or five glasses of brandy, on lucky
      days eight or ten glasses and even more, according to his mood. The brandy
      was served to the customers by Father Auban''s daughter, a pleasing
      brunette, who attracted people to the house only by her pretty face, for
      nothing had ever been gossiped about her.

Patin, when he entered the inn, would be satisfied to look at her and to
      compliment her politely and respectfully. After he had had his first glass
      of brandy he would already find her much nicer; at the second he would
      wink; at the third he would say. “If you were only willing,
      Mam''zelle Desiree——” without ever finishing his
      sentence; at the fourth he would try to hold her back by her skirt in
      order to kiss her; and when he went as high as ten it was Father Auban who
      brought him the remaining drinks.

The old innkeeper, who knew all the tricks of the trade, made Desiree walk
      about between the tables in order to increase the consumption of drinks;
      and Desiree, who was a worthy daughter of Father Auban, flitted around
      among the benches and joked with them, her lips smiling and her eyes
      sparkling.

Patin got so well accustomed to Desiree''s face that he thought of it even
      while at sea, when throwing out his nets, in storms or in calms, on
      moonlit or dark evenings. He thought of her while holding the tiller in
      the stern of his boat, while his four companions were slumbering with
      their heads on their arms. He always saw her, smiling, pouring out the
      yellow brandy with a peculiar shoulder movement and then exclaiming as she
      turned away: “There, now; are you satisfied?”

He saw her so much in his mind''s eye that he was overcome by an
      irresistible desire to marry her, and, not being able to hold out any
      longer, he asked for her hand.

He was rich, owned his own vessel, his nets and a little house at the foot
      of the hill on the Retenue, whereas Father Auban had nothing. The marriage
      was therefore eagerly agreed upon and the wedding took place as soon as
      possible, as both parties were desirous for the affair to be concluded as
      early as convenient.

Three days after the wedding Patin could no longer understand how he had
      ever imagined Desiree to be different from other women. What a fool he had
      been to encumber himself with a penniless creature, who had undoubtedly
      inveigled him with some drug which she had put in his brandy!

He would curse all day lung, break his pipe with his teeth and maul his
      crew. After he had sworn by every known term at everything that came his
      way he would rid himself of his remaining anger on the fish and lobsters,
      which he pulled from the nets and threw into the baskets amid oaths and
      foul language. When he returned home he would find his wife, Father
      Auban''s daughter, within reach of his mouth and hand, and it was not long
      before he treated her like the lowest creature in the world. As she
      listened calmly, accustomed to paternal violence, he grew exasperated at
      her quiet, and one evening he beat her. Then life at his home became
      unbearable.

For ten years the principal topic of conversation on the Retenue was about
      the beatings that Patin gave his wife and his manner of cursing at her for
      the least thing. He could, indeed, curse with a richness of vocabulary in
      a roundness of tone unequalled by any other man in Fecamp. As soon as his
      ship was sighted at the entrance of the harbor, returning from the fishing
      expedition, every one awaited the first volley he would hurl from the
      bridge as soon as he perceived his wife''s white cap.

Standing at the stern he would steer, his eye fixed on the bows and on the
      sail, and, notwithstanding the difficulty of the narrow passage and the
      height of the turbulent waves, he would search among the watching women
      and try to recognize his wife, Father Auban''s daughter, the wretch!

Then, as soon as he saw her, notwithstanding the noise of the wind and
      waves, he would let loose upon her with such power and volubility that
      every one would laugh, although they pitied her greatly. When he arrived
      at the dock he would relieve his mind, while unloading the fish, in such
      an expressive manner that he attracted around him all the loafers of the
      neighborhood. The words left his mouth sometimes like shots from a cannon,
      short and terrible, sometimes like peals of thunder, which roll and rumble
      for five minutes, such a hurricane of oaths that he seemed to have in his
      lungs one of the storms of the Eternal Father.

When he left his ship and found himself face to face with her, surrounded
      by all the gossips of the neighborhood, he would bring up a new cargo of
      insults and bring her back to their dwelling, she in front, he behind, she
      weeping, he yelling at her.

At last, when alone with her behind closed doors, he would thrash her on
      the slightest pretext. The least thing was sufficient to make him raise
      his hand, and when he had once begun he did not stop, but he would throw
      into her face the true motive for his anger. At each blow he would roar:
      “There, you beggar! There, you wretch! There, you pauper! What a
      bright thing I did when I rinsed my mouth with your rascal of a father''s
      apology for brandy.”

The poor woman lived in continual fear, in a ceaseless trembling of body
      and soul, in everlasting expectation of outrageous thrashings.

This lasted ten years. She was so timorous that she would grow pale
      whenever she spoke to any one, and she thought of nothing but the blows
      with which she was threatened; and she became thinner, more yellow and
      drier than a smoked fish.

One night, when her husband was at sea, she was suddenly awakened by the
      wild roaring of the wind!

She sat up in her bed, trembling, but, as she hear nothing more, she lay
      down again; almost immediately there was a roar in the chimney which shook
      the entire house; it seemed to cross the heavens like a pack of furious
      animals snorting and roaring.

Then she arose and rushed to the harbor. Other women were arriving from
      all sides, carrying lanterns. The men also were gathering, and all were
      watching the foaming crests of the breaking wave.

In the neighborhood of Dieppe the wreck of his bark, the Jeune-Amelie, was
      found. The bodies of his sailors were found near Saint-Valery, but his
      body was never recovered. As his vessel seemed to have been cut in two,
      his wife expected and feared his return for a long time, for if there had
      been a collision he alone might have been picked up and carried afar off.

Little by little she grew accustomed to the thought that she was rid of
      him, although she would start every time that a neighbor, a beggar or a
      peddler would enter suddenly.

One afternoon, about four years after the disappearance of her husband,
      while she was walking along the Rue aux Juifs, she stopped before the
      house of an old sea captain who had recently died and whose furniture was
      for sale. Just at that moment a parrot was at auction. He had green
      feathers and a blue head and was watching everybody with a displeased
      look. “Three francs!” cried the auctioneer. “A bird that
      can talk like a lawyer, three francs!”

“You ought to buy that, you who are rich. It would be good company
      for you. That bird is worth more than thirty francs. Anyhow, you can
      always sell it for twenty or twenty-five!”

Patin''s widow added fifty centimes, and the bird was given her in a little
      cage, which she carried away. She took it home, and, as she was opening
      the wire door in order to give it something to drink, he bit her finger
      and drew blood.

Nevertheless she gave it some hemp-seed and corn and watched it pruning
      its feathers as it glanced warily at its new home and its new mistress. On
      the following morning, just as day was breaking, the Patin woman
      distinctly heard a loud, deep, roaring voice calling: “Are you going
      to get up, carrion?”

Her fear was so great that she hid her head under the sheets, for when
      Patin was with her as soon as he would open his eyes he would shout those
      well-known words into her ears.

Trembling, rolled into a ball, her back prepared for the thrashing which
      she already expected, her face buried in the pillows, she murmured:
      “Good Lord! he is here! Good Lord! he is here! Good Lord! he has
      come back!”

Minutes passed; no noise disturbed the quiet room. Then, trembling, she
      stuck her head out of the bed, sure that he was there, watching, ready to
      beat her. Except for a ray of sun shining through the window, she saw
      nothing, and she said to her self: “He must be hidden.”

She waited a long time and then, gaining courage, she said to herself:
      “I must have dreamed it, seeing there is nobody here.”

A little reassured, she closed her eyes, when from quite near a furious
      voice, the thunderous voice of the drowned man, could be heard crying:
      “Say! when in the name of all that''s holy are you going to get up,
      you b——?”

She jumped out of bed, moved by obedience, by the passive obedience of a
      woman accustomed to blows and who still remembers and always will remember
      that voice! She said: “Here I am, Patin; what do you want?”

Put Patin did not answer. Then, at a complete loss, she looked around her,
      then in the chimney and under the bed and finally sank into a chair, wild
      with anxiety, convinced that Patin''s soul alone was there, near her, and
      that he had returned in order to torture her.

Suddenly she remembered the loft, in order to reach which one had to take
      a ladder. Surely he must have hidden there in order to surprise her. He
      must have been held by savages on some distant shore, unable to escape
      until now, and he had returned, worse that ever. There was no doubting the
      quality of that voice. She raised her head and asked: “Are you up
      there, Patin?”

Patin did not answer. Then, with a terrible fear which made her heart
      tremble, she climbed the ladder, opened the skylight, looked, saw nothing,
      entered, looked about and found nothing. Sitting on some straw, she began
      to cry, but while she was weeping, overcome by a poignant and supernatural
      terror, she heard Patin talking in the room below.

He seemed less angry and he was saying: “Nasty weather! Fierce wind!
      Nasty weather! I haven''t eaten, damn it!”

She cried through the ceiling: “Here I am, Patin; I am getting your
      meal ready. Don''t get angry.”

She ran down again. There was no one in the room. She felt herself growing
      weak, as if death were touching her, and she tried to run and get help
      from the neighbors, when a voice near her cried out: “I haven''t had
      my breakfast, by G—!”

And the parrot in his cage watched her with his round, knowing, wicked
      eye. She, too, looked at him wildly, murmuring: “Ah! so it''s you!”

What happened within her? She felt, she understood that it was he, the
      dead man, who had come back, who had disguised himself in the feathers of
      this bird in order to continue to torment her; that he would curse, as
      formerly, all day long, and bite her, and swear at her, in order to
      attract the neighbors and make them laugh. Then she rushed for the cage
      and seized the bird, which scratched and tore her flesh with its claws and
      beak. But she held it with all her strength between her hands. She threw
      it on the ground and rolled over it with the frenzy of one possessed. She
      crushed it and finally made of it nothing but a little green, flabby lump
      which no longer moved or spoke. Then she wrapped it in a cloth, as in a
      shroud, and she went out in her nightgown, barefoot; she crossed the dock,
      against which the choppy waves of the sea were beating, and she shook the
      cloth and let drop this little, dead thing, which looked like so much
      grass. Then she returned, threw herself on her knees before the empty
      cage, and, overcome by what she had done, kneeled and prayed for
      forgiveness, as if she had committed some heinous crime.

It was market-day, and from all the country round Goderville the peasants
      and their wives were coming toward the town. The men walked slowly,
      throwing the whole body forward at every step of their long, crooked legs.
      They were deformed from pushing the plough which makes the left-shoulder
      higher, and bends their figures side-ways; from reaping the grain, when
      they have to spread their legs so as to keep on their feet. Their starched
      blue blouses, glossy as though varnished, ornamented at collar and cuffs
      with a little embroidered design and blown out around their bony bodies,
      looked very much like balloons about to soar, whence issued two arms and
      two feet.

Some of these fellows dragged a cow or a calf at the end of a rope. And
      just behind the animal followed their wives beating it over the back with
      a leaf-covered branch to hasten its pace, and carrying large baskets out
      of which protruded the heads of chickens or ducks. These women walked more
      quickly and energetically than the men, with their erect, dried-up
      figures, adorned with scanty little shawls pinned over their flat bosoms,
      and their heads wrapped round with a white cloth, enclosing the hair and
      surmounted by a cap.

Now a char-a-banc passed by, jogging along behind a nag and shaking up
      strangely the two men on the seat, and the woman at the bottom of the cart
      who held fast to its sides to lessen the hard jolting.

In the market-place at Goderville was a great crowd, a mingled multitude
      of men and beasts. The horns of cattle, the high, long-napped hats of
      wealthy peasants, the head-dresses of the women came to the surface of
      that sea. And the sharp, shrill, barking voices made a continuous, wild
      din, while above it occasionally rose a huge burst of laughter from the
      sturdy lungs of a merry peasant or a prolonged bellow from a cow tied fast
      to the wall of a house.

It all smelled of the stable, of milk, of hay and of perspiration, giving
      off that half-human, half-animal odor which is peculiar to country folks.

Maitre Hauchecorne, of Breaute, had just arrived at Goderville and was
      making his way toward the square when he perceived on the ground a little
      piece of string. Maitre Hauchecorne, economical as are all true Normans,
      reflected that everything was worth picking up which could be of any use,
      and he stooped down, but painfully, because he suffered from rheumatism.
      He took the bit of thin string from the ground and was carefully preparing
      to roll it up when he saw Maitre Malandain, the harness maker, on his
      doorstep staring at him. They had once had a quarrel about a halter, and
      they had borne each other malice ever since. Maitre Hauchecorne was
      overcome with a sort of shame at being seen by his enemy picking up a bit
      of string in the road. He quickly hid it beneath his blouse and then
      slipped it into his breeches, pocket, then pretended to be still looking
      for something on the ground which he did not discover and finally went off
      toward the market-place, his head bent forward and his body almost doubled
      in two by rheumatic pains.

He was at once lost in the crowd, which kept moving about slowly and
      noisily as it chaffered and bargained. The peasants examined the cows,
      went off, came back, always in doubt for fear of being cheated, never
      quite daring to decide, looking the seller square in the eye in the effort
      to discover the tricks of the man and the defect in the beast.

The women, having placed their great baskets at their feet, had taken out
      the poultry, which lay upon the ground, their legs tied together, with
      terrified eyes and scarlet combs.

They listened to propositions, maintaining their prices in a decided
      manner with an impassive face or perhaps deciding to accept the smaller
      price offered, suddenly calling out to the customer who was starting to go
      away:

Then, little by little, the square became empty, and when the Angelus
      struck midday those who lived at a distance poured into the inns.

At Jourdain''s the great room was filled with eaters, just as the vast
      court was filled with vehicles of every sort—wagons, gigs,
      chars-a-bancs, tilburies, innumerable vehicles which have no name, yellow
      with mud, misshapen, pieced together, raising their shafts to heaven like
      two arms, or it may be with their nose on the ground and their rear in the
      air.

Just opposite to where the diners were at table the huge fireplace, with
      its bright flame, gave out a burning heat on the backs of those who sat at
      the right. Three spits were turning, loaded with chickens, with pigeons
      and with joints of mutton, and a delectable odor of roast meat and of
      gravy flowing over crisp brown skin arose from the hearth, kindled
      merriment, caused mouths to water.

All the aristocracy of the plough were eating there at Mait'' Jourdain''s,
      the innkeeper''s, a dealer in horses also and a sharp fellow who had made a
      great deal of money in his day.

The dishes were passed round, were emptied, as were the jugs of yellow
      cider. Every one told of his affairs, of his purchases and his sales. They
      exchanged news about the crops. The weather was good for greens, but too
      wet for grain.

Suddenly the drum began to beat in the courtyard before the house. Every
      one, except some of the most indifferent, was on their feet at once and
      ran to the door, to the windows, their mouths full and napkins in their
      hand.

When the public crier had finished his tattoo he called forth in a jerky
      voice, pausing in the wrong places:

“Be it known to the inhabitants of Goderville and in general to all
      persons present at the market that there has been lost this morning on the
      Beuzeville road, between nine and ten o''clock, a black leather pocketbook
      containing five hundred francs and business papers. You are requested to
      return it to the mayor''s office at once or to Maitre Fortune Houlbreque,
      of Manneville. There will be twenty francs reward.”

Then the man went away. They heard once more at a distance the dull
      beating of the drum and the faint voice of the crier. Then they all began
      to talk of this incident, reckoning up the chances which Maitre Houlbreque
      had of finding or of not finding his pocketbook again.

The meal went on. They were finishing their coffee when the corporal of
      gendarmes appeared on the threshold.

The mayor was waiting for him, seated in an armchair. He was the notary of
      the place, a tall, grave man of pompous speech.

“Maitre Hauchecorne,” said he, “this morning on the
      Beuzeville road, you were seen to pick up the pocketbook lost by Maitre
      Houlbreque, of Manneville.”

The countryman looked at the mayor in amazement frightened already at this
      suspicion which rested on him, he knew not why.

“You will not make me believe, Maitre Hauchecorne, that M.
      Malandain, who is a man whose word can be relied on, has mistaken this
      string for a pocketbook.”

The peasant, furious, raised his hand and spat on the ground beside him as
      if to attest his good faith, repeating:

“For all that, it is God''s truth, M''sieu le Maire. There! On my
      soul''s salvation, I repeat it.”

“After you picked up the object in question, you even looked about
      for some time in the mud to see if a piece of money had not dropped out of
      it.”

“How can they tell—how can they tell such lies as that to
      slander an honest man! How can they?”

He was confronted with M. Malandain, who repeated and sustained his
      testimony. They railed at one another for an hour. At his own request
      Maitre Hauchecorne was searched. Nothing was found on him.

At last the mayor, much perplexed, sent him away, warning him that he
      would inform the public prosecutor and ask for orders.

The news had spread. When he left the mayor''s office the old man was
      surrounded, interrogated with a curiosity which was serious or mocking, as
      the case might be, but into which no indignation entered. And he began to
      tell the story of the string. They did not believe him. They laughed.

He passed on, buttonholed by every one, himself buttonholing his
      acquaintances, beginning over and over again his tale and his
      protestations, showing his pockets turned inside out to prove that he had
      nothing in them.

He grew more and more angry, feverish, in despair at not being believed,
      and kept on telling his story.

The night came. It was time to go home. He left with three of his
      neighbors, to whom he pointed out the place where he had picked up the
      string, and all the way he talked of his adventure.

That evening he made the round of the village of Breaute for the purpose
      of telling every one. He met only unbelievers.

The next day, about one in the afternoon, Marius Paumelle, a farm hand of
      Maitre Breton, the market gardener at Ymauville, returned the pocketbook
      and its contents to Maitre Holbreque, of Manneville.

This man said, indeed, that he had found it on the road, but not knowing
      how to read, he had carried it home and given it to his master.

The news spread to the environs. Maitre Hauchecorne was informed. He
      started off at once and began to relate his story with the denoument. He
      was triumphant.

“What grieved me,” said he, “was not the thing itself,
      do you understand, but it was being accused of lying. Nothing does you so
      much harm as being in disgrace for lying.”

All day he talked of his adventure. He told it on the roads to the people
      who passed, at the cabaret to the people who drank and next Sunday when
      they came out of church. He even stopped strangers to tell them about it.
      He was easy now, and yet something worried him without his knowing exactly
      what it was. People had a joking manner while they listened. They did not
      seem convinced. He seemed to feel their remarks behind his back.

On Tuesday of the following week he went to market at Goderville, prompted
      solely by the need of telling his story.

He accosted a farmer of Criquetot, who did not let him finish, and giving
      him a punch in the pit of the stomach cried in his face: “Oh, you
      great rogue!” Then he turned his heel upon him.

Maitre Hauchecorne remained speechless and grew more and more uneasy. Why
      had they called him “great rogue”?

“Hold your tongue, daddy; there''s one who finds it and there''s
      another who returns it. And no one the wiser.”

The farmer was speechless. He understood at last. They accused him of
      having had the pocketbook brought back by an accomplice, by a confederate.

He went home indignant, choking with rage, with confusion, the more cast
      down since with his Norman craftiness he was, perhaps, capable of having
      done what they accused him of and even of boasting of it as a good trick.
      He was dimly conscious that it was impossible to prove his innocence, his
      craftiness being so well known. He felt himself struck to the heart by the
      injustice of the suspicion.

He began anew to tell his tale, lengthening his recital every day, each
      day adding new proofs, more energetic declarations and more sacred oaths,
      which he thought of, which he prepared in his hours of solitude, for his
      mind was entirely occupied with the story of the string. The more he
      denied it, the more artful his arguments, the less he was believed.

Jokers would make him tell the story of “the piece of string”
      to amuse them, just as you make a soldier who has been on a campaign tell
      his story of the battle. His mind kept growing weaker and about the end of
      December he took to his bed.

He passed away early in January, and, in the ravings of death agony, he
      protested his innocence, repeating:

He was known for thirty miles round was father Toine—fat Toine,
      Toine-my-extra, Antoine Macheble, nicknamed Burnt-Brandy—the
      innkeeper of Tournevent.

It was he who had made famous this hamlet buried in a niche in the valley
      that led down to the sea, a poor little peasants'' hamlet consisting of ten
      Norman cottages surrounded by ditches and trees.

The houses were hidden behind a curve which had given the place the name
      of Tournevent. It seemed to have sought shelter in this ravine overgrown
      with grass and rushes, from the keen, salt sea wind—the ocean wind
      that devours and burns like fire, that drys up and withers like the
      sharpest frost of winter, just as birds seek shelter in the furrows of the
      fields in time of storm.

But the whole hamlet seemed to be the property of Antoine Macheble,
      nicknamed Burnt-Brandy, who was called also Toine, or
      Toine-My-Extra-Special, the latter in consequence of a phrase current in
      his mouth:

For the last twenty years he had served the whole countryside with his
      Extra-Special and his “Burnt-Brandy,” for whenever he was
      asked: “What shall I drink, Toine?” he invariably answered:
      “A burnt-brandy, my son-in-law; that warms the inside and clears the
      head—there''s nothing better for your body.”

He called everyone his son-in-law, though he had no daughter, either
      married or to be married.

Well known indeed was Toine Burnt-Brandy, the stoutest man in all
      Normandy. His little house seemed ridiculously small, far too small and
      too low to hold him; and when people saw him standing at his door, as he
      did all day long, they asked one another how he could possibly get through
      the door. But he went in whenever a customer appeared, for it was only
      right that Toine should be invited to take his thimbleful of whatever was
      drunk in his wine shop.

His inn bore the sign: “The Friends'' Meeting-Place”—and
      old Toine was, indeed, the friend of all. His customers came from Fecamp
      and Montvilliers, just for the fun of seeing him and hearing him talk; for
      fat Toine would have made a tombstone laugh. He had a way of chaffing
      people without offending them, or of winking to express what he didn''t
      say, of slapping his thighs when he was merry in such a way as to make you
      hold your sides, laughing. And then, merely to see him drink was a
      curiosity. He drank everything that was offered him, his roguish eyes
      twinkling, both with the enjoyment of drinking and at the thought of the
      money he was taking in. His was a double pleasure: first, that of
      drinking; and second, that of piling up the cash.

You should have heard him quarrelling with his wife! It was worth paying
      for to see them together. They had wrangled all the thirty years they had
      been married; but Toine was good-humored, while his better-half grew
      angry. She was a tall peasant woman, who walked with long steps like a
      stork, and had a head resembling that of an angry screech-owl. She spent
      her time rearing chickens in a little poultry-yard behind the inn, and she
      was noted for her success in fattening them for the table.

Whenever the gentry of Fecamp gave a dinner they always had at least one
      of Madame Toine''s chickens to be in the fashion.

But she was born ill-tempered, and she went through life in a mood of
      perpetual discontent. Annoyed at everyone, she seemed to be particularly
      annoyed at her husband. She disliked his gaiety, his reputation, his rude
      health, his embonpoint. She treated him as a good-for-nothing creature
      because he earned his money without working, and as a glutton because he
      ate and drank as much as ten ordinary men; and not a day went by without
      her declaring spitefully:

“You''d be better in the stye along with the pigs! You''re so fat it
      makes me sick to look at you!”

“Wait! Wait a bit! We''ll see! You''ll burst one of these fine days
      like a sack of corn-you old bloat, you!”

And the customers, doubled up with laughter, would thump the table with
      their fists and stamp their feet on the floor.

Toine was, in fact, an astonishing sight, he was so fat, so heavy, so red.
      He was one of those enormous beings with whom Death seems to be amusing
      himself—playing perfidious tricks and pranks, investing with an
      irresistibly comic air his slow work of destruction. Instead of
      manifesting his approach, as with others, in white hairs, in emaciation,
      in wrinkles, in the gradual collapse which makes the onlookers say:
      “Gad! how he has changed!” he took a malicious pleasure in
      fattening Toine, in making him monstrous and absurd, in tingeing his face
      with a deep crimson, in giving him the appearance of superhuman health,
      and the changes he inflicts on all were in the case of Toine laughable,
      comic, amusing, instead of being painful and distressing to witness.

At last Toine had an apoplectic fit, and was paralyzed in consequence. The
      giant was put to bed in the little room behind the partition of the
      drinking-room that he might hear what was said and talk to his friends,
      for his head was quite clear although his enormous body was helplessly
      inert. It was hoped at first that his immense legs would regain some
      degree of power; but this hope soon disappeared, and Toine spent his days
      and nights in the bed, which was only made up once a week, with the help
      of four neighbors who lifted the innkeeper, each holding a limb, while his
      mattress was turned.

He kept his spirits, nevertheless; but his gaiety was of a different kind—more
      timid, more humble; and he lived in a constant, childlike fear of his
      wife, who grumbled from morning till night:

“Look at him there—the great glutton! the good-for-nothing
      creature, the old boozer! Serve him right, serve him right!”

He no longer answered her. He contented himself with winking behind the
      old woman''s back, and turning over on his other side—the only
      movement of which he was now capable. He called this exercise a “tack
      to the north” or a “tack to the south.”

His great distraction nowadays was to listen to the conversations in the
      bar, and to shout through the wall when he recognized a friend''s voice:

“Not exactly getting about,” answered Toine. “But I
      haven''t grown thin; my carcass is still good.”

Soon he got into the way of asking his intimates into his room to keep him
      company, although it grieved him to see that they had to drink without
      him. It pained him to the quick that his customers should be drinking
      without him.

“That''s what hurts worst of all,” he would say: “that I
      cannot drink my Extra-Special any more. I can put up with everything else,
      but going without drink is the very deuce.”

Then his wife''s screech-owl face would appear at the window, and she would
      break in with the words:

“Look at him! Look at him now, the good-for-nothing wretch! I''ve got
      to feed him and wash him just as if he were a pig!”

And when the old woman had gone, a cock with red feathers would sometimes
      fly up to the window sill and looking into the room with his round
      inquisitive eye, would begin to crow loudly. Occasionally, too, a few hens
      would flutter as far as the foot of the bed, seeking crumbs on the floor.
      Toine''s friends soon deserted the drinking room to come and chat every
      afternoon beside the invalid''s bed. Helpless though he was, the jovial
      Toine still provided them with amusement. He would have made the devil
      himself laugh. Three men were regular in their attendance at the bedside:
      Celestin Maloisel, a tall, thin fellow, somewhat gnarled, like the trunk
      of an apple-tree; Prosper Horslaville, a withered little man with a ferret
      nose, cunning as a fox; and Cesaire Paumelle, who never spoke, but who
      enjoyed Toine''s society all the same.

They brought a plank from the yard, propped it upon the edge of the bed,
      and played dominoes from two till six.

But Toine''s wife soon became insufferable. She could not endure that her
      fat, lazy husband should amuse himself at games while lying in his bed;
      and whenever she caught him beginning a game she pounced furiously on the
      dominoes, overturned the plank, and carried all away into the bar,
      declaring that it was quite enough to have to feed that fat, lazy pig
      without seeing him amusing himself, as if to annoy poor people who had to
      work hard all day long.

Celestin Maloisel and Cesaire Paumelle bent their heads to the storm, but
      Prosper Horslaville egged on the old woman, and was only amused at her
      wrath.

“Your man is as hot as an oven, and he never leaves his bed—well,
      I''d make him hatch some eggs.”

She was struck dumb at the suggestion, thinking that Prosper could not
      possibly be in earnest. But he continued:

“I''d put five under one arm, and five under the other, the same day
      that I set a hen. They''d all come out at the same time; then I''d take your
      husband''s chickens to the hen to bring up with her own. You''d rear a fine
      lot that way.”

“Could it be done?” echoed the man. “Why not? Since eggs
      can be hatched in a warm box why shouldn''t they be hatched in a warm bed?”

He laughed at first; then, finding she was serious, he got angry, and
      refused absolutely to have the eggs put under his great arms, that the
      warmth of his body might hatch them.

He thought she must be joking, and waited a while. Then he begged,
      implored, swore, “tacked to the north” and “tacked to
      the south,” and beat on the wall with his fists, but had to consent
      at last to five eggs being placed against his left side; after which he
      had his soup.

When his friends arrived that afternoon they thought he must be ill, he
      seemed so constrained and queer.

They started the daily game of dominoes. But Tome appeared to take no
      pleasure in it, and reached forth his hand very slowly, and with great
      precaution.

It was the mayor with the deputy. They ordered two glasses of
      Extra-Special, and began to discuss local affairs. As they were talking in
      somewhat low tones Toine wanted to put his ear to the wall, and,
      forgetting all about his eggs, he made a sudden “tack to the north,”
      which had the effect of plunging him into the midst of an omelette.

At the loud oath he swore his wife came hurrying into the room, and,
      guessing what had happened, stripped the bedclothes from him with
      lightning rapidity. She stood at first without moving or uttering a
      syllable, speechless with indignation at sight of the yellow poultice
      sticking to her husband''s side.

Then, trembling with fury, she threw herself on the paralytic, showering
      on him blows such as those with which she cleaned her linen on the
      seashore. Tome''s three friends were choking with laughter, coughing,
      spluttering and shouting, an' WHERE id = '47483ce4-df10-44b3-81b8-ab924b78ab8b';
