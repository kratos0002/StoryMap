      the farm watched his departure. The women shook their fists at him the men
      scoffed at and insulted him. He was taken at last! Good riddance! He went
      off between his two guards. He mustered sufficient energy—the energy
      of despair—to drag himself along until the evening, too dazed to
      know what was happening to him, too frightened to understand.

Toward evening he reached the country town. He had never been so far
      before. He did not realize in the least what he was there for or what was
      to become of him. All the terrible and unexpected events of the last two
      days, all these unfamiliar faces and houses struck dismay into his heart.

He said not a word, having nothing to say because he understood nothing.
      Besides, he had spoken to no one for so many years past that he had almost
      lost the use of his tongue, and his thoughts were too indeterminate to be
      put into words.

He was shut up in the town jail. It did not occur to the police that he
      might need food, and he was left alone until the following day. But when
      in the early morning they came to examine him he was found dead on the
      floor. Such an astonishing thing!

Old Lecacheur appeared at the door of his house between five and a quarter
      past five in the morning, his usual hour, to watch his men going to work.

He was only half awake, his face was red, and with his right eye open and
      the left nearly closed, he was buttoning his braces over his fat stomach
      with some difficulty, at the same time looking into every corner of the
      farmyard with a searching glance. The sun darted its oblique rays through
      the beech trees by the side of the ditch and athwart the apple trees
      outside, and was making the cocks crow on the dunghill, and the pigeons
      coo on the roof. The smell of the cow stable came through the open door,
      and blended in the fresh morning air with the pungent odor of the stable,
      where the horses were neighing, with their heads turned toward the light.

As soon as his trousers were properly fastened, Lecacheur came out, and
      went, first of all, toward the hen house to count the morning''s eggs, for
      he had been afraid of thefts for some time; but the servant girl ran up to
      him with lifted arms and cried:

“Yes, master, the big gray rabbit, from the hutch on the left”;
      whereupon the farmer completely opened his left eye, and said, simply:

And off he went to inspect it. The hutch had been broken open and the
      rabbit was gone. Then he became thoughtful, closed his right eye again,
      and scratched his nose, and after a little consideration, he said to the
      frightened girl, who was standing stupidly before her master:

Lecacheur was mayor of the village, Pavigny-le-Gras, and ruled it like a
      master, on account of his money and position, and as soon as the servant
      had disappeared in the direction of the village, which was only about five
      hundred yards off, he went into the house to have his morning coffee and
      to discuss the matter with his wife, whom he found on her knees in front
      of the fire, trying to make it burn quickly, and as soon as he got to the
      door, he said:

She turned round so suddenly that she found herself sitting on the floor,
      and looking at her husband with distressed eyes, she said:

She was a little, thin, active, neat woman, who knew all about farming.
      Lecacheur had his own ideas about the matter.

“He did it! he did it! You need not look for any one else. He did
      it! You have said it, Cacheux!”

All her peasant''s fury, all her avarice, all her rage of a saving woman
      against the man of whom she had always been suspicious, and against the
      girl whom she had always suspected, showed themselves in the contraction
      of her mouth, and the wrinkles in the cheeks and forehead of her thin,
      exasperated face.

This Polyte was a laborer, who had been employed on the farm for a few
      days, and who had been dismissed by Lecacheur for an insolent answer. He
      was an old soldier, and was supposed to have retained his habits of
      marauding and debauchery from his campaigns in Africa. He did anything
      for a livelihood, but whether he were a mason, a navvy, a reaper, whether
      he broke stones or lopped trees, he was always lazy, and so he remained
      nowhere for long, and had, at times, to change his neighborhood to obtain
      work.

From the first day that he came to the farm, Lecacheur''s wife had detested
      him, and now she was sure that he had committed the theft.

In about half an hour the two gendarmes arrived. Brigadier Senateur was
      very tall and thin, and Gendarme Lenient short and fat. Lecacheur made
      them sit down, and told them the affair, and then they went and saw the
      scene of the theft, in order to verify the fact that the hutch had been
      broken open, and to collect all the proofs they could. When they got back
      to the kitchen, the mistress brought in some wine, filled their glasses,
      and asked with a distrustful look:

The brigadier, who had his sword between his legs, appeared thoughtful.
      Certainly, he was sure of taking him, if he was pointed out to him, but if
      not, he could not answer for being able to discover him, himself, and
      after reflecting for a long time, he put this simple question:

“As for knowing him, I do not, as I did not see him commit the
      theft. If I had seen him, I should have made him eat it raw, skin and
      flesh, without a drop of cider to wash it down. But as for saying who it
      is, I cannot, although I believe it is that good-for-nothing Polyte.”

Then he related at length his troubles with Polyte, his leaving his
      service, his bad reputation, things which had been told him, accumulating
      insignificant and minute proofs, and then, the brigadier, who had been
      listening very attentively while he emptied his glass and filled it again
      with an indifferent air, turned to his gendarme and said:

“We must go and look in the cottage of Severin''s wife.” At
      which the gendarme smiled and nodded three times.

Then Madame Lecacheur came to them, and very quietly, with all a peasant''s
      cunning, questioned the brigadier in her turn. That shepherd Severin, a
      simpleton, a sort of brute who had been brought up and had grown up among
      his bleating flocks, and who knew scarcely anything besides them in the
      world, had nevertheless preserved the peasant''s instinct for saving, at
      the bottom of his heart. For years and years he must have hidden in hollow
      trees and crevices in the rocks all that he earned, either as a shepherd
      or by curing animals'' sprains—for the bonesetter''s secret had been
      handed down to him by the old shepherd whose place he took-by touch or
      word, and one day he bought a small property, consisting of a cottage and
      a field, for three thousand francs.

A few months later it became known that he was going to marry a servant,
      notorious for her bad morals, the innkeeper''s servant. The young fellows
      said that the girl, knowing that he was pretty well off, had been to his
      cottage every night, and had taken him, captured him, led him on to
      matrimony, little by little night by night.

And then, having been to the mayor''s office and to church, she now lived
      in the house which her man had bought, while he continued to tend his
      flocks, day and night, on the plains.

“Polyte has been sleeping there for three weeks, for the thief has
      no place of his own to go to!”

Madame Lecacheur, who was seized by a fresh access of rage, of rage
      increased by a married woman''s anger against debauchery, exclaimed:

“One minute,” he said. “Let us wait until twelve
      o''clock, as he goes and dines there every day. I shall catch them with it
      under their noses.”

The gendarme smiled, pleased at his chief''s idea, and Lecacheur also
      smiled now, for the affair of the shepherd struck him as very funny;
      deceived husbands are always a joke.

Twelve o''clock had just struck when the brigadier, followed by his man,
      knocked gently three times at the door of a little lonely house, situated
      at the corner of a wood, five hundred yards from the village.

They had been standing close against the wall, so as not to be seen from
      within, and they waited. As nobody answered, the brigadier knocked again
      in a minute or two. It was so quiet that the house seemed uninhabited; but
      Lenient, the gendarme, who had very quick ears, said that he heard
      somebody moving about inside, and then Senateur got angry. He would not
      allow any one to resist the authority of the law for a moment, and,
      knocking at the door with the hilt of his sword, he cried out:

“If you do not obey, I shall smash the lock. I am the brigadier of
      the gendarmerie, by G—! Here, Lenient.”

He had not finished speaking when the door opened and Senateur saw before
      him a fat girl, with a very red, blowzy face, with drooping breasts, a big
      stomach and broad hips, a sort of animal, the wife of the shepherd
      Severin, and he went into the cottage.

“I have come to pay you a visit, as I want to make a little search,”
      he said, and he looked about him. On the table there was a plate, a jug of
      cider and a glass half full, which proved that a meal was in progress. Two
      knives were lying side by side, and the shrewd gendarme winked at his
      superior officer.

“Come, come, you are not going to try and make us believe that you
      live on couch grass. What were you eating there all by yourself for your
      dinner?”

“You are a novice, my good woman. A mite of butter on your bread.
      You are mistaken; you ought to have said: a mite of butter on the rabbit.
      By G—, your butter smells good! It is special butter, extra good
      butter, butter fit for a wedding; certainly, not household butter!”

As Brigadier Senateur was a joker, all the gendarmes had grown facetious,
      and the officer continued:

She brought out an old cup, at the bottom of which there was a layer of
      rancid salt butter, and the brigadier smelled of it, and said, with a
      shake of his head:

“It is not the same. I want the butter that smells of the rabbit.
      Come, Lenient, open your eyes; look under the sideboard, my good fellow,
      and I will look under the bed.”

Having shut the door, he went up to the bed and tried to move it; but it
      was fixed to the wall, and had not been moved for more than half a
      century, apparently. Then the brigadier stooped, and made his uniform
      crack. A button had flown off.

Lenient, who was short and stout, took off his kepi, laid himself on his
      stomach, and, putting his face on the floor, looked at the black cavity
      under the bed, and then, suddenly, he exclaimed:

The gendarme had put his arms under the bed and laid hold of something,
      and he was pulling with all his might, and at last a foot, shod in a thick
      boot, appeared, which he was holding in his right hand. The brigadier took
      it, crying:

And Lenient, who was on his knees by that time, was pulling at the other
      leg. But it was a hard job, for the prisoner kicked out hard, and arched
      up his back under the bed.

“Courage! courage! pull! pull!” Senateur cried, and they
      pulled him with all their strength, so that the wooden slat gave way, and
      he came out as far as his head; but at last they got that out also, and
      they saw the terrified and furious face of Polyte, whose arms remained
      stretched out under the bed.

“Pull away!” the brigadier kept on exclaiming. Then they heard
      a strange noise, and as the arms followed the shoulders, and the hands the
      arms, they saw in the hands the handle of a saucepan, and at the end of
      the handle the saucepan itself, which contained stewed rabbit.

“Good Lord! good Lord!” the brigadier shouted in his delight,
      while Lenient took charge of the man; the rabbit''s skin, an overwhelming
      proof, was discovered under the mattress, and then the gendarmes returned
      in triumph to the village with their prisoner and their booty.

A week later, as the affair had made much stir, Lecacheur, on going into
      the mairie to consult the schoolmaster, was told that the shepherd Severin
      had been waiting for him for more than an hour, and he found him sitting
      on a chair in a corner, with his stick between his legs. When he saw the
      mayor, he got up, took off his cap, and said:

“Pretty well everybody. I understand! And I suppose you know all
      about marriages, as you marry people?”

“Yes, has she any right before the law, and, seeing that she is my
      wife, to go to bed with Polyte?”

“Very well, then; I will tell you why I want to know. One night last
      week, as I had my suspicions, I came in suddenly, and they were not
      behaving properly. I chucked Polyte out, to go and sleep somewhere else;
      but that was all, as I did not know what my rights were. This time I did
      not see them; I only heard of it from others. That is over, and we will
      not say any more about it; but if I catch them again—by G—, if
      I catch them again, I will make them lose all taste for such nonsense,
      Maitre Cacheux, as sure as my name is Severin.”

When M. Antoine Leuillet married the widow, Madame Mathilde Souris, he had
      already been in love with her for ten years.

M. Souris has been his friend, his old college chum. Leuillet was very
      much attached to him, but thought he was somewhat of a simpleton. He would
      often remark: “That poor Souris who will never set the world on
      fire.”

When Souris married Miss Mathilde Duval, Leuillet was astonished and
      somewhat annoyed, as he was slightly devoted to her, himself. She was the
      daughter of a neighbor, a former proprietor of a draper''s establishment
      who had retired with quite a small fortune. She married Souris for his
      money.

Then Leuillet thought he would start a flirtation with his friend''s wife.
      He was a good-looking man, intelligent and also rich. He thought it would
      be all plain sailing, but he was mistaken. Then he really began to admire
      her with an admiration that his friendship for the husband obliged him to
      keep within the bounds of discretion, making him timid and embarrassed.
      Madame Souris believing that his presumptions had received a wholesome
      check now treated him as a good friend. This went on for nine years.

One morning a messenger brought Leuillet a distracted note from the poor
      woman. Souris had just died suddenly from the rupture of an aneurism. He
      was dreadfully shocked, for they were just the same age. But almost
      immediately a feeling of profound joy, of intense relief, of emancipation
      filled his being. Madame Souris was free.

He managed, however, to assume the sad, sympathetic expression that was
      appropriate, waited the required time, observed all social appearances. At
      the end of fifteen months he married the widow.

This was considered to be a very natural, and even a generous action. It
      was the act of a good friend of an upright man.

They lived in the most cordial intimacy, having understood and appreciated
      each other from the first. They had no secrets from one another and even
      confided to each other their most secret thoughts. Leuillet loved his wife
      now with a quiet and trustful affection; he loved her as a tender, devoted
      companion who is an equal and a confidante. But there lingered in his mind
      a strange and inexplicable bitterness towards the defunct Souris, who had
      first been the husband of this woman, who had had the flower of her youth
      and of her soul, and had even robbed her of some of her poetry. The memory
      of the dead husband marred the happiness of the living husband, and this
      posthumous jealousy tormented his heart by day and by night.

The consequence was he talked incessantly of Souris, asked about a
      thousand personal and secret minutia, wanted to know all about his habits
      and his person. And he sneered at him even in his grave, recalling with
      self-satisfaction his whims, ridiculing his absurdities, dwelling on his
      faults.

She would come, always smiling, knowing well that he would say something
      about Souris and ready to flatter her new husband''s inoffensive mania.

“Tell me, do you remember one day how Souris insisted on explaining
      to me that little men always commanded more affection than big men?”

And he made some remarks that were disparaging to the deceased, who was a
      small man, and decidedly flattering to himself, Leuillet, who was a tall
      man.

Mme. Leuillet allowed him to think he was right, quite right, and she
      laughed heartily, gently ridiculing her former husband for the sake of
      pleasing the present one, who always ended by saying:

Leuillet was delighted, forming in his mind a comparison, much in his own
      favor, between his wife''s former and present position. He was silent for a
      time, and then with a burst of laughter he asked:

Mme. Leuillet said: “Oh!” pretending to be shocked and hid her
      face again on her husband''s shoulder. But he saw that she was laughing.

“Come now, own up,” he persisted. “He looked like a
      ninny, that creature! It would be funny, so funny! Good old Souris! Come,
      come, dearie, you do not mind telling me, me, of all people.”

He insisted on the “me” thinking that if she had wished to
      deceive Souris she would have chosen him, and he was trembling in
      anticipation of her avowal, sure that if she had not been a virtuous woman
      she would have encouraged his own attentions.

But she did not answer, laughing still, as at the recollection of
      something exceedingly comical.

Leuillet, in his turn began to laugh, thinking he might have been the
      lucky man, and he muttered amid his mirth: “That poor Souris, that
      poor Souris, oh, yes, he looked like a fool!”

She was quieter now and putting her mouth to her husband''s ear, she
      whispered: “Yes, I did deceive him.”

He felt a chill run down his back and to his very bones, and he stammered
      out, dumfounded: “You—you—deceived him—criminally?”

He was obliged to sit up to recover his breath, he was so shocked and
      upset at what he had heard.

Then she said sorrowfully: “I was only in fun.” But he was
      trembling with rage. “What? How? You were only in fun? You were
      making fun of me, then? But I am not satisfied, do you hear? I want the
      name of the young man!”

He took her by the arm and squeezed it, saying: “Do you understand
      me, finally? I wish you to reply when I speak to you.”

He was wild with rage, not knowing what to say, exasperated, and he shook
      her with all his might, repeating:

She made an abrupt effort to disengage herself and the tips of her fingers
      touched her husband''s nose. He was furious, thinking she had tried to hit
      him, and he sprang upon her holding her down; and boxing her ears with all
      his might, he cried: “Take that, and that, there, there, wretch!”

When he was out of breath and exhausted, he rose and went toward the
      dressing table to prepare a glass of eau sucree with orange flower, for he
      felt as if he should faint.

She was weeping in bed, sobbing bitterly, for she felt as if her happiness
      was over, through her own fault.

And prepared to defend herself now, armed with excuses and artifice, she
      raised her disheveled head with its nightcap all awry.

Turning toward her, he approached, ashamed of having struck her, but
      feeling in the bottom of his heart as a husband, a relentless hatred
      toward this woman who had deceived the former husband, Souris.

A white-haired old man begged us for alms. My companion, Joseph Davranche,
      gave him five francs. Noticing my surprised look, he said:

“That poor unfortunate reminds me of a story which I shall tell you,
      the memory of which continually pursues me. Here it is:

“My family, which came originally from Havre, was not rich. We just
      managed to make both ends meet. My father worked hard, came home late from
      the office, and earned very little. I had two sisters.

“My mother suffered a good deal from our reduced circumstances, and
      she often had harsh words for her husband, veiled and sly reproaches. The
      poor man then made a gesture which used to distress me. He would pass his
      open hand over his forehead, as if to wipe away perspiration which did not
      exist, and he would answer nothing. I felt his helpless suffering. We
      economized on everything, and never would accept an invitation to dinner,
      so as not to have to return the courtesy. All our provisions were bought
      at bargain sales. My sisters made their own gowns, and long discussions
      would arise on the price of a piece of braid worth fifteen centimes a
      yard. Our meals usually consisted of soup and beef, prepared with every
      kind of sauce.

“Every Sunday, dressed in our best, we would take our walk along the
      breakwater. My father, in a frock coat, high hat and kid gloves, would
      offer his arm to my mother, decked out and beribboned like a ship on a
      holiday. My sisters, who were always ready first, would await the signal
      for leaving; but at the last minute some one always found a spot on my
      father''s frock coat, and it had to be wiped away quickly with a rag
      moistened with benzine.

“My father, in his shirt sleeves, his silk hat on his head, would
      await the completion of the operation, while my mother, putting on her
      spectacles, and taking off her gloves in order not to spoil them, would
      make haste.

“Then we set out ceremoniously. My sisters marched on ahead, arm in
      arm. They were of marriageable age and had to be displayed. I walked on
      the left of my mother and my father on her right. I remember the pompous
      air of my poor parents in these Sunday walks, their stern expression,
      their stiff walk. They moved slowly, with a serious expression, their
      bodies straight, their legs stiff, as if something of extreme importance
      depended upon their appearance.

“Every Sunday, when the big steamers were returning from unknown and
      distant countries, my father would invariably utter the same words:

“My Uncle Jules, my father''s brother, was the only hope of the
      family, after being its only fear. I had heard about him since childhood,
      and it seemed to me that I should recognize him immediately, knowing as
      much about him as I did. I knew every detail of his life up to the day of
      his departure for America, although this period of his life was spoken of
      only in hushed tones.

“It seems that he had led a bad life, that is to say, he had
      squandered a little money, which action, in a poor family, is one of the
      greatest crimes. With rich people a man who amuses himself only sows his
      wild oats. He is what is generally called a sport. But among needy
      families a boy who forces his parents to break into the capital becomes a
      good-for-nothing, a rascal, a scamp. And this distinction is just,
      although the action be the same, for consequences alone determine the
      seriousness of the act.

“Well, Uncle Jules had visibly diminished the inheritance on which
      my father had counted, after he had swallowed his own to the last penny.
      Then, according to the custom of the times, he had been shipped off to
      America on a freighter going from Havre to New York.

“Once there, my uncle began to sell something or other, and he soon
      wrote that he was making a little money and that he soon hoped to be able
      to indemnify my father for the harm he had done him. This letter caused a
      profound emotion in the family. Jules, who up to that time had not been
      worth his salt, suddenly became a good man, a kind-hearted fellow, true
      and honest like all the Davranches.

“One of the captains told us that he had rented a large shop and was
      doing an important business.

“Two years later a second letter came, saying: ''My dear Philippe, I
      am writing to tell you not to worry about my health, which is excellent.
      Business is good. I leave to-morrow for a long trip to South America. I
      may be away for several years without sending you any news. If I shouldn''t
      write, don''t worry. When my fortune is made I shall return to Havre. I
      hope that it will not be too long and that we shall all live happily
      together . . . .''

“This letter became the gospel of the family. It was read on the
      slightest provocation, and it was shown to everybody.

“For ten years nothing was heard from Uncle Jules; but as time went
      on my father''s hope grew, and my mother, also, often said:

“''When that good Jules is here, our position will be different.
      There is one who knew how to get along!''

“And every Sunday, while watching the big steamers approaching from
      the horizon, pouring out a stream of smoke, my father would repeat his
      eternal question:

“Thousands of schemes had been planned on the strength of this
      expected return; we were even to buy a little house with my uncle''s money—a
      little place in the country near Ingouville. In fact, I wouldn''t swear
      that my father had not already begun negotiations.

“The elder of my sisters was then twenty-eight, the other
      twenty-six. They were not yet married, and that was a great grief to every
      one.

“At last a suitor presented himself for the younger one. He was a
      clerk, not rich, but honorable. I have always been morally certain that
      Uncle Jules'' letter, which was shown him one evening, had swept away the
      young man''s hesitation and definitely decided him.

“He was accepted eagerly, and it was decided that after the wedding
      the whole family should take a trip to Jersey.

“Jersey is the ideal trip for poor people. It is not far; one
      crosses a strip of sea in a steamer and lands on foreign soil, as this
      little island belongs to England. Thus, a Frenchman, with a two hours''
      sail, can observe a neighboring people at home and study their customs.

“This trip to Jersey completely absorbed our ideas, was our sole
      anticipation, the constant thought of our minds.

“At last we left. I see it as plainly as if it had happened
      yesterday. The boat was getting up steam against the quay at Granville; my
      father, bewildered, was superintending the loading of our three pieces of
      baggage; my mother, nervous, had taken the arm of my unmarried sister, who
      seemed lost since the departure of the other one, like the last chicken of
      a brood; behind us came the bride and groom, who always stayed behind, a
      thing that often made me turn round.

“The whistle sounded. We got on board, and the vessel, leaving the
      breakwater, forged ahead through a sea as flat as a marble table. We
      watched the coast disappear in the distance, happy and proud, like all who
      do not travel much.

“My father was swelling out his chest in the breeze, beneath his
      frock coat, which had that morning been very carefully cleaned; and he
      spread around him that odor of benzine which always made me recognize
      Sunday. Suddenly he noticed two elegantly dressed ladies to whom two
      gentlemen were offering oysters. An old, ragged sailor was opening them
      with his knife and passing them to the gentlemen, who would then offer
      them to the ladies. They ate them in a dainty manner, holding the shell on
      a fine handkerchief and advancing their mouths a little in order not to
      spot their dresses. Then they would drink the liquid with a rapid little
      motion and throw the shell overboard.

“My father was probably pleased with this delicate manner of eating
      oysters on a moving ship. He considered it good form, refined, and, going
      up to my mother and sisters, he asked:

“My mother hesitated on account of the expense, but my two sisters
      immediately accepted. My mother said in a provoked manner:

“''I am afraid that they will hurt my stomach. Offer the children
      some, but not too much, it would make them sick.'' Then, turning toward me,
      she added:

“However, I remained beside my mother, finding this discrimination
      unjust. I watched my father as he pompously conducted my two sisters and
      his son-in-law toward the ragged old sailor.

“The two ladies had just left, and my father showed my sisters how
      to eat them without spilling the liquor. He even tried to give them an
      example, and seized an oyster. He attempted to imitate the ladies, and
      immediately spilled all the liquid over his coat. I heard my mother
      mutter:

“But, suddenly, my father appeared to be worried; he retreated a few
      steps, stared at his family gathered around the old shell opener, and
      quickly came toward us. He seemed very pale, with a peculiar look. In a
      low voice he said to my mother:

“''Why, my brother. If I did not know that he was well off in
      America, I should think it was he.''

“She arose and walked to her daughters. I, too, was watching the
      man. He was old, dirty, wrinkled, and did not lift his eyes from his work.

“''I believe that it is he. Why don''t you ask the captain? But be
      very careful that we don''t have this rogue on our hands again!''

“The captain, a tall, thin man, with blond whiskers, was walking
      along the bridge with an important air as if he were commanding the Indian
      mail steamer.

“My father addressed him ceremoniously, and questioned him about his
      profession, adding many compliments:

“''What might be the importance of Jersey? What did it produce? What
      was the population? The customs? The nature of the soil?'' etc., etc.

“''You have there an old shell opener who seems quite interesting. Do
      you know anything about him?''

“''He is some old French tramp whom I found last year in America, and
      I brought him back. It seems that he has some relatives in Havre, but that
      he doesn''t wish to return to them because he owes them money. His name is
      Jules—Jules Darmanche or Darvanche or something like that. It seems
      that he was once rich over there, but you can see what''s left of him now.''

“''Ah! ah! very well, very well. I''m not in the least surprised.
      Thank you very much, captain.''

“He went away, and the astonished sailor watched him disappear. He
      returned to my mother so upset that she said to him:

“''We must get the children out of the way. Since Joseph knows
      everything, he can go and get them. We must take good care that our
      son-in-law doesn''t find out.''

“''I always thought that that thief never would do anything, and that
      he would drop down on us again! As if one could expect anything from a
      Davranche!''

“My father passed his hand over his forehead, as he always did when
      his wife reproached him. She added:

“''Give Joseph some money so that he can pay for the oysters. All
      that it needed to cap the climax would be to be recognized by that beggar.
      That would be very pleasant! Let''s get down to the other end of the boat,
      and take care that that man doesn''t come near us!''

“Astonished, my sisters were awaiting their father. I said that
      mamma had felt a sudden attack of sea-sickness, and I asked the shell
      opener:

“I held out my five francs and he returned the change. I looked at
      his hand; it was a poor, wrinkled, sailor''s hand, and I looked at his
      face, an unhappy old face. I said to myself:

“He spoke like a poor man receiving alms. I couldn''t help thinking
      that he must have begged over there! My sisters looked at me, surprised at
      my generosity. When I returned the two francs to my father, my mother
      asked me in surprise:

“She stopped at a look from my father, who was pointing at his
      son-in-law. Then everybody was silent.

“Before us, on the distant horizon, a purple shadow seemed to rise
      out of the sea. It was Jersey.

“As we approached the breakwater a violent desire seized me once
      more to see my Uncle Jules, to be near him, to say to him something
      consoling, something tender. But as no one was eating any more oysters, he
      had disappeared, having probably gone below to the dirty hold which was
      the home of the poor wretch.”

Curving like a crescent moon, the little town of Etretat, with its white
      cliffs, its white, shingly beach and its blue sea, lay in the sunlight at
      high noon one July day. At either extremity of this crescent its two
      “gates,” the smaller to the right, the larger one at the left,
      stretched forth—one a dwarf and the other a colossal limb—into
      the water, and the bell tower, almost as tall as the cliff, wide below,
      narrowing at the top, raised its pointed summit to the sky.

On the sands beside the water a crowd was seated watching the bathers. On
      the terrace of, the Casino another crowd, seated or walking, displayed
      beneath the brilliant sky a perfect flower patch of bright costumes, with
      red and blue parasols embroidered with large flowers in silk.

On the walk at the end of the terrace, other persons, the restful, quiet
      ones, were walking slowly, far from the dressy throng.

A young man, well known and celebrated as a painter, Jean Sumner, was
      walking with a dejected air beside a wheeled chair in which sat a young
      woman, his wife. A manservant was gently pushing the chair, and the
      crippled woman was gazing sadly at the brightness of the sky, the gladness
      of the day, and the happiness of others.

Those who were passing behind the silent and motionless couple looked at
      them compassionately. A whole legend of devotion was attached to them. He
      had married her in spite of her infirmity, touched by her affection for
      him, it was said.

Not far from there, two young men were chatting, seated on a bench and
      looking out into the horizon.

“Just so. He married her—he married her—just as every
      one marries, parbleu! because he was an idiot!”

“But why—but why, my friend? There is no why. People do stupid
      things just because they do stupid things. And, besides, you know very
      well that painters make a specialty of foolish marriages. They almost
      always marry models, former sweethearts, in fact, women of doubtful
      reputation, frequently. Why do they do this? Who can say? One would
      suppose that constant association with the general run of models would
      disgust them forever with that class of women. Not at all. After having
      posed them they marry them. Read that little book, so true, so cruel and
      so beautiful, by Alphonse Daudet: ''Artists'' Wives.''

“In the case of the couple you see over there the accident occurred
      in a special and terrible manner. The little woman played a frightful
      comedy, or, rather, tragedy. She risked all to win all. Was she sincere?
      Did she love Jean? Shall we ever know? Who is able to determine precisely
      how much is put on and how much is real in the actions of a woman? They
      are always sincere in an eternal mobility of impressions. They are
      furious, criminal, devoted, admirable and base in obedience to intangible
      emotions. They tell lies incessantly without intention, without knowing or
      understanding why, and in spite of it all are absolutely frank in their
      feelings and sentiments, which they display by violent, unexpected,
      incomprehensible, foolish resolutions which overthrow our arguments, our
      customary poise and all our selfish plans. The unforeseenness and
      suddenness of their determinations will always render them undecipherable
      enigmas as far as we are concerned. We continually ask ourselves:

“But, my friend, they are sincere and insincere at one and the same
      time, because it is their nature to be extremists in both and to be
      neither one nor the other.

“See the methods that even the best of them employ to get what they
      desire. They are complex and simple, these methods. So complex that we can
      never guess at them beforehand, and so simple that after having been
      victimized we cannot help being astonished and exclaiming: ''What! Did she
      make a fool of me so easily as that?''

“The little woman was a model, of course. She posed for him. She was
      pretty, very stylish-looking, and had a divine figure, it seems. He
      fancied that he loved her with his whole soul. That is another strange
      thing. As soon as one likes a woman one sincerely believes that they could
      not get along without her for the rest of their life. One knows that one
      has felt the same way before and that disgust invariably succeeded
      gratification; that in order to pass one''s existence side by side with
      another there must be not a brutal, physical passion which soon dies out,
      but a sympathy of soul, temperament and temper. One should know how to
      determine in the enchantment to which one is subjected whether it proceeds
      from the physical, from a certain sensuous intoxication, or from a deep
      spiritual charm.

“Well, he believed himself in love; he made her no end of promises
      of fidelity, and was devoted to her.

“She was really attractive, gifted with that fashionable flippancy
      that little Parisians so readily affect. She chattered, babbled, made
      foolish remarks that sounded witty from the manner in which they were
      uttered. She used graceful gesture''s which were calculated to attract a
      painter''s eye. When she raised her arms, when she bent over, when she got
      into a carriage, when she held out her hand to you, her gestures were
      perfect and appropriate.

“As it was a beautiful evening we thought we would take a stroll
      along the bank of the river. The moon poured a flood of light on the
      trembling water, scattering yellow gleams along its ripples in the
      currents and all along the course of the wide, slow river.

“We strolled along the bank, a little enthused by that vague
      exaltation that these dreamy evenings produce in us. We would have liked
      to undertake some wonderful task, to love some unknown, deliciously poetic
      being. We felt ourselves vibrating with raptures, longings, strange
      aspirations. And we were silent, our beings pervaded by the serene and
      living coolness of the beautiful night, the coolness of the moonlight,
      which seemed to penetrate one''s body, permeate it, soothe one''s spirit,
      fill it with fragrance and steep it in happiness.

“''Do you think it is very amusing to walk along without speaking?
      People talk when they are not stupid.''

“He did not reply. Then, feeling with her woman''s instinct that she
      was going to make him angry, she began to sing a popular air that had
      harassed our ears and our minds for two years:

“Then followed a scene, a hateful, idiotic scene, with unexpected
      reproaches, unsuitable recriminations, then tears. Nothing was left
      unsaid. They went back to the house. He had allowed her to talk without
      replying, enervated by the beauty of the scene and dumfounded by this
      storm of abuse.

“Three months later he strove wildly to free himself from those
      invincible and invisible bonds with which such a friendship chains our
      lives. She kept him under her influence, tyrannizing over him, making his
      life a burden to him. They quarreled continually, vituperating and finally
      fighting each other.

“He wanted to break with her at any cost. He sold all his canvases,
      borrowed money from his friends, realizing twenty thousand francs (he was
      not well known then), and left them for her one morning with a note of
      farewell.

“About three o''clock that afternoon there was a ring at the bell. I
      went to the door. A woman sprang toward me, pushed me aside, came in and
      went into my atelier. It was she!

“She threw the envelope containing the banknotes at his feet with a
      truly noble gesture and said in a quick tone:

“She was very pale, trembling and ready undoubtedly to commit any
      folly. As for him, I saw him grow pale also, pale with rage and
      exasperation, ready also perhaps to commit any violence.

“''I do not choose to be treated like a common woman. You implored me
      to accept you. I asked you for nothing. Keep me with you!''

“I went toward her and quietly, little by little, I began to reason
      with her, exhausting all the arguments that are used under similar
      circumstances. She listened to me, motionless, with a fixed gaze,
      obstinate and silent.

“Finally, not knowing what more to say, and seeing that there would
      be a scene, I thought of a last resort and said:

“''He loves you still, my dear, but his family want him to marry some
      one, and you understand—''

“He began to laugh, walked toward the window, opened it, and bowing
      with the gesture of one who desires to let some one else precede him, he
      said:

“She looked at him for a second with terrible, wild, staring eyes.
      Then, taking a run as if she were going to jump a hedge in the country,
      she rushed past me and past him, jumped over the sill and disappeared.

“I shall never forget the impression made on me by that open window
      after I had seen that body pass through it to fall to the ground. It
      appeared to me in a second to be as large as the heavens and as hollow as
      space. And I drew back instinctively, not daring to look at it, as though
      I feared I might fall out myself.

“Jean, wild with remorse and also possibly touched with gratitude,
      made up his mind to marry her.

It was growing dusk. The young woman felt chilly and wanted to go home,
      and the servant wheeled the invalid chair in the direction of the village.
      The painter walked beside his wife, neither of them having exchanged a
      word for an hour.

He was a journeyman carpenter, a good workman and a steady fellow,
      twenty-seven years old, but, although the eldest son, Jacques Randel had
      been forced to live on his family for two months, owing to the general
      lack of work. He had walked about seeking work for over a month and had
      left his native town, Ville-Avary, in La Manche, because he could find
      nothing to do and would no longer deprive his family of the bread they
      needed themselves, when he was the strongest of them all. His two sisters
      earned but little as charwomen. He went and inquired at the town hall, and
      the mayor''s secretary told him that he would find work at the Labor
      Agency, and so he started, well provided with papers and certificates, and
      carrying another pair of shoes, a pair of trousers and a shirt in a blue
      handkerchief at the end of his stick.

And he had walked almost without stopping, day and night, along
      interminable roads, in sun and rain, without ever reaching that mysterious
      country where workmen find work. At first he had the fixed idea that he
      must only work as a carpenter, but at every carpenter''s shop where he
      applied he was told that they had just dismissed men on account of work
      being so slack, and, finding himself at the end of his resources, he made
      up his mind to undertake any job that he might come across on the road.
      And so by turns he was a navvy, stableman, stonecutter; he split wood,
      lopped the branches of trees, dug wells, mixed mortar, tied up fagots,
      tended goats on a mountain, and all for a few pence, for he only obtained
      two or three days'' work occasionally by offering himself at a shamefully
      low price, in order to tempt the avarice of employers and peasants.

And now for a week he had found nothing, and had no money left, and
      nothing to eat but a piece of bread, thanks to the charity of some women
      from whom he had begged at house doors on the road. It was getting dark,
      and Jacques Randel, jaded, his legs failing him, his stomach empty, and
      with despair in his heart, was walking barefoot on the grass by the side
      of the road, for he was taking care of his last pair of shoes, as the
      other pair had already ceased to exist for a long time. It was a Saturday,
      toward the end of autumn. The heavy gray clouds were being driven rapidly
      through the sky by the gusts of wind which whistled among the trees, and
      one felt that it would rain soon. The country was deserted at that hour on
      the eve of Sunday. Here and there in the fields there rose up stacks of
      wheat straw, like huge yellow mushrooms, and the fields looked bare, as
      they had already been sown for the next year.

Randel was hungry, with the hunger of some wild animal, such a hunger as
      drives wolves to attack men. Worn out and weakened with fatigue, he took
      longer strides, so as not to take so many steps, and with heavy head, the
      blood throbbing in his temples, with red eyes and dry mouth, he grasped
      his stick tightly in his hand, with a longing to strike the first passerby
      who might be going home to supper.

He looked at the sides of the road, imagining he saw potatoes dug up and
      lying on the ground before his eyes; if he had found any he would have
      gathered some dead wood, made a fire in the ditch and have had a capital
      supper off the warm, round vegetables with which he would first of all
      have warmed his cold hands. But it was too late in the year, and he would
      have to gnaw a raw beetroot which he might pick up in a field as he had
      done the day before.

For the last two days he had talked to himself as he quickened his steps
      under the influence of his thoughts. He had never thought much hitherto,
      as he had given all his mind, all his simple faculties to his mechanical
      work. But now fatigue and this desperate search for work which he could
      not get, refusals and rebuffs, nights spent in the open air lying on the
      grass, long fasting, the contempt which he knew people with a settled
      abode felt for a vagabond, and that question which he was continually
      asked, “Why do you not remain at home?” distress at not being
      able to use his strong arms which he felt so full of vigor, the
      recollection of the relations he had left at home and who also had not a
      penny, filled him by degrees with rage, which had been accumulating every
      day, every hour, every minute, and which now escaped his lips in spite of
      himself in short, growling sentences.

As he stumbled over the stones which tripped his bare feet, he grumbled:
      “How wretched! how miserable! A set of hogs—to let a man die
      of hunger—a carpenter—a set of hogs—not two sous—not
      two sous—and now it is raining—a set of hogs!”

He was indignant at the injustice of fate, and cast the blame on men, on
      all men, because nature, that great, blind mother, is unjust, cruel and
      perfidious, and he repeated through his clenched teeth:

“A set of hogs” as he looked at the thin gray smoke which rose
      from the roofs, for it was the dinner hour. And, without considering that
      there is another injustice which is human, and which is called robbery and
      violence, he felt inclined to go into one of those houses to murder the
      inhabitants and to sit down to table in their stead.

He said to himself: “I have no right to live now, as they are
      letting me die of hunger, and yet I only ask for work—a set of hogs!”
      And the pain in his limbs, the gnawing in his heart rose to his head like
      terrible intoxication, and gave rise to this simple thought in his brain:
      “I have the right to live because I breathe and because the air is
      the common property of everybody. So nobody has the right to leave me
      without bread!”

A fine, thick, icy cold rain was coming down, and he stopped and murmured:
      “Oh, misery! Another month of walking before I get home.” He
      was indeed returning home then, for he saw that he should more easily find
      work in his native town, where he was known—and he did not mind what
      he did—than on the highroads, where everybody suspected him. As the
      carpentering business was not prosperous, he would turn day laborer, be a
      mason''s hodman, a ditcher, break stones on the road. If he only earned a
      franc a day, that would at any rate buy him something to eat.

He tied the remains of his last pocket handkerchief round his neck to
      prevent the cold rain from running down his back and chest, but he soon
      found that it was penetrating the thin material of which his clothes were
      made, and he glanced about him with the agonized look of a man who does
      not know where to hide his body and to rest his head, and has no place of
      shelter in the whole world.

Night came on and wrapped the country in obscurity, and in the distance,
      in a meadow, he saw a dark spot on the grass; it was a cow, and so he got
      over the ditch by the roadside and went up to her without exactly knowing
      what he was doing. When he got close to her she raised her great head to
      him, and he thought: “If I only had a jug I could get a little milk.”
      He looked at the cow and the cow looked at him and then, suddenly giving
      her a kick in the side, he said: “Get up!”

The animal got up slowly, letting her heavy udders bang down. Then the man
      lay down on his back between the animal''s legs and drank for a long time,
      squeezing her warm, swollen teats, which tasted of the cowstall, with both
      hands, and he drank as long as she gave any milk. But the icy rain began
      to fall more heavily, and he saw no place of shelter on the whole of that
      bare plain. He was cold, and he looked at a light which was shining among
      the trees in the window of a house.

The cow had lain down again heavily, and he sat down by her side and
      stroked her head, grateful for the nourishment she had given him. The
      animal''s strong, thick breath, which came out of her nostrils like two
      jets of steam in the evening air, blew on the workman''s face, and he said:
      “You are not cold inside there!” He put his hands on her chest
      and under her stomach to find some warmth there, and then the idea struck
      him that he might pass the night beside that large, warm animal. So he
      found a comfortable place and laid his head on her side, and then, as he
      was worn out with fatigue, fell asleep immediately.

He woke up, however, several times, with his back or his stomach half
      frozen, according as he put one or the other against the animal''s flank.
      Then he turned over to warm and dry that part of his body which had
      remained exposed to the night air, and soon went soundly to sleep again.
      The crowing of a cock woke him; the day was breaking, it was no longer
      raining, and the sky was bright. The cow was resting with her muzzle on
      the ground, and he stooped down, resting on his hands, to kiss those wide,
      moist nostrils, and said: “Good-by, my beauty, until next time. You
      are a nice animal. Good-by.” Then he put on his shoes and went off,
      and for two hours walked straight before him, always following the same
      road, and then he felt so tired that he sat down on the grass. It was
      broad daylight by that time, and the church bells were ringing; men in
      blue blouses, women in white caps, some on foot, some in carts, began to
      pass along the road, going to the neighboring villages to spend Sunday
      with friends or relations.

A stout peasant came in sight, driving before him a score of frightened,
      bleating sheep, with the help of an active dog. Randel got up, and raising
      his cap, said: “You do not happen to have any work for a man who is
      dying of hunger?” But the other, giving an angry look at the
      vagabond, replied: “I have no work for fellows whom I meet on the
      road.”

And the carpenter went back and sat down by the side of the ditch again.
      He waited there for a long time, watching the country people pass and
      looking for a kind, compassionate face before he renewed his request, and
      finally selected a man in an overcoat, whose stomach was adorned with a
      gold chain. “I have been looking for work,” he said, “for
      the last two months and cannot find any, and I have not a sou in my
      pocket.” But the would-be gentleman replied: “You should have
      read the notice which is stuck up at the entrance to the village: ''Begging
      is prohibited within the boundaries of this parish.'' Let me tell you that
      I am the mayor, and if you do not get out of here pretty quickly I shall
      have you arrested.”

Randel, who was getting angry, replied: “Have me arrested if you
      like; I should prefer it, for, at any rate, I should not die of hunger.”
      And he went back and sat down by the side of his ditch again, and in about
      a quarter of an hour two gendarmes appeared on the road. They were walking
      slowly side by side, glittering in the sun with their shining hats, their
      yellow accoutrements and their metal buttons, as if to frighten evildoers,
      and to put them to flight at a distance. He knew that they were coming
      after him, but he did not move, for he was seized with a sudden desire to
      defy them, to be arrested by them, and to have his revenge later.

They came on without appearing to have seen him, walking heavily, with
      military step, and balancing themselves as if they were doing the goose
      step; and then, suddenly, as they passed him, appearing to have noticed
      him, they stopped and looked at him angrily and threateningly, and the
      brigadier came up to him and asked: “What are you doing here?”
      “I am resting,” the man replied calmly. “Where do you
      come from?” “If I had to tell you all the places I have been
      to it would take me more than an hour.” “Where are you going
      to?” “To Ville-Avary.” “Where is that?”
      “In La Manche.” “Is that where you belong?”
      “It is.” “Why did you leave it?” “To look
      for work.”

The brigadier turned to his gendarme and said in the angry voice of a man
      who is exasperated at last by an oft-repeated trick: “They all say
      that, these scamps. I know all about it.” And then he continued:
      “Have you any papers?” “Yes, I have some.” “Give
      them to me.”

Randel took his papers out of his pocket, his certificates, those poor,
      worn-out, dirty papers which were falling to pieces, and gave them to the
      soldier, who spelled them through, hemming and hawing, and then, having
      seen that they were all in order, he gave them back to Randel with the
      dissatisfied look of a man whom some one cleverer than himself has
      tricked.

After a few moments'' further reflection, he asked him: “Have you any
      money on you?” “No.” “None whatever?”
      “None.” “Not even a sou?” “Not even a son!”
      “How do you live then?” “On what people give me.”
      “Then you beg?” And Randel answered resolutely: “Yes,
      when I can.”

Then the gendarme said: “I have caught you on the highroad in the
      act of vagabondage and begging, without any resources or trade, and so I
      command you to come with me.” The carpenter got up and said: “Wherever
      you please.” And, placing himself between the two soldiers, even
      before he had received the order to do so, he added: “Well, lock me
      up; that will at any rate put a roof over my head when it rains.”

And they set off toward the village, the red tiles of which could be seen
      through the leafless trees, a quarter of a league off. Service was about
      to begin when they went through the village. The square was full of
      people, who immediately formed two lines to see the criminal pass. He was
      being followed by a crowd of excited children. Male and female peasants
      looked at the prisoner between the two gendarmes, with hatred in their
      eyes and a longing to throw stones at him, to tear his skin with their
      nails, to trample him under their feet. They asked each other whether he
      had committed murder or robbery. The butcher, who was an ex-''spahi'',
      declared that he was a deserter. The tobacconist thought that he
      recognized him as the man who had that very morning passed a bad
      half-franc piece off on him, and the ironmonger declared that he was the
      murderer of Widow Malet, whom the police had been looking for for six
      months.

In the municipal court, into which his custodians took him, Randel saw the
      mayor again, sitting on the magisterial bench, with the schoolmaster by
      his side. “Aha! aha!” the magistrate exclaimed, “so here
      you are again, my fine fellow. I told you I should have you locked up.
      Well, brigadier, what is he charged with?”

“He is a vagabond without house or home, Monsieur le Maire, without
      any resources or money, so he says, who was arrested in the act of
      begging, but he is provided with good testimonials, and his papers are all
      in order.”

“Show me his papers,” the mayor said. He took them, read them,
      reread, returned them and then said: “Search him.” So they
      searched him, but found nothing, and the mayor seemed perplexed, and asked
      the workman:

“What were you doing on the road this morning?” “I was
      looking for work.” “Work? On the highroad?” “How
      do you expect me to find any if I hide in the woods?”

They looked at each other with the hatred of two wild beasts which belong
      to different hostile species, and the magistrate continued: “I am
      going to have you set at liberty, but do not be brought up before me
      again.” To which the carpenter replied: “I would rather you
      locked me up; I have had enough running about the country.” But the
      magistrate replied severely: “be silent.” And then he said to
      the two gendarmes: “You will conduct this man two hundred yards from
      the village and let him continue his journey.”

“At any rate, give me something to eat,” the workman said, but
      the other grew indignant: “Have we nothing to do but to feed you?
      Ah! ah! ah! that is rather too much!” But Randel went on firmly:
      “If you let me nearly die of hunger again, you will force me to
      commit a crime, and then, so much the worse for you other fat fellows.”

The mayor had risen and he repeated: “Take him away immediately or I
      shall end by getting angry.”

The two gendarmes thereupon seized the carpenter by the arms and dragged
      him out. He allowed them to do it without resistance, passed through the
      village again and found himself on the highroad once more; and when the
      men had accompanied him two hundred yards beyond the village, the
      brigadier said: “Now off with you and do not let me catch you about
      here again, for if I do, you will know it.”

Randel went off without replying or knowing where he was going. He walked
      on for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, so stupefied that he no
      longer thought of anything. But suddenly, as he was passing a small house,
      where the window was half open, the smell of the soup and boiled meat
      stopped him suddenly, and hunger, fierce, devouring, maddening hunger,
      seized him and almost drove him against the walls of the house like a wild
      beast.

He said aloud in a grumbling voice: “In Heaven''s name! they must
      give me some this time!” And he began to knock at the door
      vigorously with his stick, and as no one came he knocked louder and called
      out: “Hey! hey! you people in there, open the door!” And then,
      as nothing stirred, he went up to the window and pushed it wider open with
      his hand, and the close warm air of the kitchen, full of the smell of hot
      soup, meat and cabbage, escaped into the cold outer air, and with a bound
      the carpenter was in the house. Two places were set at the table, and no
      doubt the proprietors of the house, on going to church, had left their
      dinner on the fire, their nice Sunday boiled beef and vegetable soup,
      while there was a loaf of new bread on the chimney-piece, between two
      bottles which seemed full.

Randel seized the bread first of all and broke it with as much violence as
      if he were strangling a man, and then he began to eat voraciously,
      swallowing great mouthfuls quickly. But almost immediately the smell of
      the meat attracted him to the fireplace, and, having taken off the lid of
      the saucepan, he plunged a fork into it and brought out a large piece of
      beef tied with a string. Then he took more cabbage, carrots and onions
      until his plate was full, and, having put it on the table, he sat down
      before it, cut the meat into four pieces, and dined as if he had been at
      home. When he had eaten nearly all the meat, besides a quantity of
      vegetables, he felt thirsty and took one of the bottles off the
      mantelpiece.

Scarcely had he poured the liquor into his glass when he saw it was
      brandy. So much the better; it was warming and would instill some fire
      into his veins, and that would be all right, after being so cold; and he
      drank some. He certainly enjoyed it, for he had grown unaccustomed to it,
      and he poured himself out another glassful, which he drank at two gulps.
      And then almost immediately he felt quite merry and light-hearted from the
      effects of the alcohol, just as if some great happiness filled his heart.

He continued to eat, but more slowly, and dipping his bread into the soup.
      His skin had become burning, and especially his forehead, where the veins
      were throbbing. But suddenly the church bells began to ring. Mass was
      over, and instinct rather than fear, the instinct of prudence, which
      guides all beings and makes them clear-sighted in danger, made the
      carpenter get up. He put the remains of the loaf into one pocket and the
      brandy bottle into the other, and he furtively went to the window and
      looked out into the road. It was still deserted, so he jumped out and set
      off walking again, but instead of following the highroad he ran across the
      fields toward a wood he saw a little way off.

He felt alert, strong, light-hearted, glad of what he had done, and so
      nimble that he sprang over the enclosure of the fields at a single bound,
      and as soon as he was under the trees he took the bottle out of his pocket
      again and began to drink once more, swallowing it down as he walked, and
      then his ideas began to get confused, his eyes grew dim, and his legs as
      elastic as springs, and he started singing the old popular song:

He was now walking on thick, damp, cool moss, and that soft carpet under
      his feet made him feel absurdly inclined to turn head over heels as he
      used to do when a child, so he took a run, turned a somersault, got up and
      began over again. And between each time he began to sing again:

Suddenly he found himself above a deep road, and in the road he saw a tall
      girl, a servant, who was returning to the village with two pails of milk.
      He watched, stooping down, and with his eyes as bright as those of a dog
      who scents a quail, but she saw him raised her head and said: “Was
      that you singing like that?” He did not reply, however, but jumped
      down into the road, although it was a fall of at least six feet and when
      she saw him suddenly standing in front of her, she exclaimed: “Oh!
      dear, how you frightened me!”

But he did not hear her, for he was drunk, he was mad, excited by another
      requirement which was more imperative than hunger, more feverish than
      alcohol; by the irresistible fury of the man who has been deprived of
      everything for two months, and who is drunk; who is young, ardent and
      inflamed by all the appetites which nature has implanted in the vigorous
      flesh of men.

The girl started back from him, frightened at his face, his eyes, his
      half-open mouth, his outstretched hands, but he seized her by the
      shoulders, and without a word, threw her down in the road.

She let her two pails fall, and they rolled over noisily, and all the milk
      was spilt, and then she screamed lustily, but it was of no avail in that
      lonely spot.

When she got up the thought of her overturned pails suddenly filled her
      with fury, and, taking off one of her wooden sabots, she threw it at the
      man to break his head if he did not pay her for her milk.

But he, mistaking the reason of this sudden violent attack, somewhat
      sobered, and frightened at what he had done, ran off as fast as he could,
      while she threw stones at him, some of which hit him in the back.

He ran for a long time, very long, until he felt more tired than he had
      ever been before. His legs were so weak that they could scarcely carry
      him; all his ideas were confused, he lost recollection of everything and
      could no longer think about anything, and so he sat down at the foot of a
      tree, and in five minutes was fast asleep. He was soon awakened, however,
      by a rough shake, and, on opening his eyes, he saw two cocked hats of
      shiny leather bending over him, and the two gendarmes of the morning, who
      were holding him and binding his arms.

“I knew I should catch you again,” said the brigadier
      jeeringly. But Randel got up without replying. The two men shook him,
      quite ready to ill treat him if he made a movement, for he was their prey
      now. He had become a jailbird, caught by those hunters of criminals who
      would not let him go again.

“Now, start!” the brigadier said, and they set off. It was
      late afternoon, and the autumn twilight was setting in over the land, and
      in half an hour they reached the village, where every door was open, for
      the people had heard what had happened. Peasants and peasant women and
      girls, excited with anger, as if every man had been robbed and every woman
      attacked, wished to see the wretch brought back, so that they might
      overwhelm him with abuse. They hooted him from the first house in the
      village until they reached the Hotel de Ville, where the mayor was waiting
      for him to be himself avenged on this vagabond, and as soon as he saw him
      approaching he cried:

“Ah! my fine fellow! here we are!” And he rubbed his hands,
      more pleased than he usually was, and continued: “I said so. I said
      so, the moment I saw him in the road.”

“Oh, you blackguard! Oh, you dirty blackguard! You will get your
      twenty years, my fine fellow!”

“Cuts and wounds which caused death.” Such was the charge upon
      which Leopold Renard, upholsterer, was summoned before the Court of
      Assizes.

Round him were the principal witnesses, Madame Flameche, widow of the
      victim, and Louis Ladureau, cabinetmaker, and Jean Durdent, plumber.

Near the criminal was his wife, dressed in black, an ugly little woman,
      who looked like a monkey dressed as a lady.

“Good heavens, it is a misfortune of which I was the prime victim
      all the time, and with which my will has nothing to do. The facts are
      their own commentary, Monsieur le President. I am an honest man, a
      hard-working man, an upholsterer, living in the same street for the last
      sixteen years, known, liked, respected and esteemed by all, as my
      neighbors can testify, even the porter''s wife, who is not amiable every
      day. I am fond of work, I am fond of saving, I like honest men and
      respectable amusements. That is what has ruined me, so much the worse for
      me; but as my will had nothing to do with it, I continue to respect
      myself.

“Every Sunday for the last five years my wife and I have spent the
      day at Passy. We get fresh air, and, besides, we are fond of fishing. Oh!
      we are as fond of it as we are of little onions. Melie inspired me with
      that enthusiasm, the jade, and she is more enthusiastic than I am, the
      scold, seeing that all the mischief in this business is her fault, as you
      will see immediately.

“I am strong and mild tempered, without a pennyworth of malice in
      me. But she! oh! la! la! she looks like nothing; she is short and thin.
      Very well, she does more mischief than a weasel. I do not deny that she
      has some good qualities; she has some, and very important ones for a man
      in business. But her character! Just ask about it in the neighborhood, and
      even the porter''s wife, who has just sent me about my business—she
      will tell you something about it.

“Every day she used to find fault with my mild temper: ''I would not
      put up with this! I would not put up with that.'' If I had listened to her,
      Monsieur le President, I should have had at least three hand-to-hand
      fights a month . . . .”

“I will continue. We used to go to Passy every Saturday evening, so
      as to begin fishing at daybreak the next morning. It is a habit which has
      become second nature with us, as the saying is. Three years ago this
      summer I discovered a place, oh! such a spot. Oh, dear, dear! In the
      shade, eight feet of water at least and perhaps ten, a hole with cavities
      under the bank, a regular nest for fish and a paradise for the fisherman.
      I might look upon that fishing hole as my property, Monsieur le President,
      as I was its Christopher Columbus. Everybody in the neighborhood knew it,
      without making any opposition. They would say: ''That is Renard''s place'';
      and nobody would have gone there, not even Monsieur Plumeau, who is well
      known, be it said without any offense, for poaching on other people''s
      preserves.

“Well, I returned to this place of which I felt certain, just as if
      I had owned it. I had scarcely got there on Saturday, when I got into
      Delila, with my wife. Delila is my Norwegian boat, which I had built by
      Fournaire, and which is light and safe. Well, as I said, we got into the
      boat and we were going to set bait, and for setting bait there is none to
      be compared with me, and they all know it. You want to know with what I
      bait? I cannot answer that question; it has nothing to do with the
      accident. I cannot answer; that is my secret. There are more than three
      hundred people who have asked me; I have been offered glasses of brandy
      and liqueur, fried fish, matelotes, to make me tell. But just go and try
      whether the chub will come. Ah! they have tempted my stomach to get at my
      secret, my recipe. Only my wife knows, and she will not tell it any more
      than I will. Is not that so, Melie?”

“Just get to the facts as soon as you can,” and the accused
      continued: “I am getting to them, I am getting to them. Well, on
      Saturday, July 8, we left by the twenty-five past five train and before
      dinner we went to set bait as usual. The weather promised to keep fine and
      I said to Melie: ''All right for tomorrow.'' And she replied: ''If looks like
      it,'' We never talk more than that together.

“And then we returned to dinner. I was happy and thirsty, and that
      was the cause of everything. I said to Melie: ''Look here, Melie, it is
      fine weather, suppose I drink a bottle of ''Casque a meche''.'' That is a
      weak white wine which we have christened so, because if you drink too much
      of it it prevents you from sleeping and takes the place of a nightcap. Do
      you understand me?

“She replied: ''You can do as you please, but you will be ill again
      and will not be able to get up tomorrow.'' That was true, sensible and
      prudent, clear-sighted, I must confess. Nevertheless I could not resist,
      and I drank my bottle. It all came from that.

“Well, I could not sleep. By Jove! it kept me awake till two o''clock
      in the morning, and then I went to sleep so soundly that I should not have
      heard the angel sounding his trump at the last judgment.

“In short, my wife woke me at six o''clock and I jumped out of bed,
      hastily put on my trousers and jersey, washed my face and jumped on board
      Delila. But it was too late, for when I arrived at my hole it was already
      occupied! Such a thing had never happened to me in three years, and it
      made me feel as if I were being robbed under my own eyes. I said to
      myself: ''Confound it all! confound it!'' And then my wife began to nag at
      me. ''Eh! what about your ''Casque a meche''? Get along, you drunkard! Are
      you satisfied, you great fool?'' I could say nothing, because it was all
      true, but I landed all the same near the spot and tried to profit by what
      was left. Perhaps after all the fellow might catch nothing and go away.

“He was a little thin man in white linen coat and waistcoat and a
      large straw hat, and his wife, a fat woman, doing embroidery, sat behind
      him.

“When she saw us take up our position close to them she murmured:
      ''Are there no other places on the river?'' My wife, who was furious,
      replied: ''People who have any manners make inquiries about the habits of
      the neighborhood before occupying reserved spots.''

“As I did not want a fuss, I said to her: ''Hold your tongue, Melie.
      Let them alone, let them alone; we shall see.''

“Well, we fastened Delila under the willows and had landed and were
      fishing side by side, Melie and I, close to the two others. But here,
      monsieur, I must enter into details.

“We had only been there about five minutes when our neighbor''s line
      began to jerk twice, thrice; and then he pulled out a chub as thick as my
      thigh; rather less, perhaps, but nearly as big! My heart beat, the
      perspiration stood on my forehead and Melie said to me: ''Well, you sot,
      did you see that?''

“Just then Monsieur Bru, the grocer of Poissy, who is fond of
      gudgeon fishing, passed in a boat and called out to me: ''So somebody has
      taken your usual place, Monsieur Renard?'' And I replied: ''Yes, Monsieur
      Bru, there are some people in this world who do not know the rules of
      common politeness.''

Here the president interrupted him a second time: “Take care, you
      are insulting the widow, Madame Flameche, who is present.”

Renard made his excuses: “I beg your pardon, I beg your pardon; my
      anger carried me away. Well, not a quarter of an hour had passed when the
      little man caught another chub, and another almost immediately, and
      another five minutes later.

“Tears were in my eyes, and I knew that Madame Renard was boiling
      with rage, for she kept on nagging at me: ''Oh, how horrid! Don''t you see
      that he is robbing you of your fish? Do you think that you will catch
      anything? Not even a frog, nothing whatever. Why, my hands are tingling,
      just to think of it.''

“But I said to myself: ''Let us wait until twelve o''clock. Then this
      poacher will go to lunch and I shall get my place again. As for me,
      Monsieur le President, I lunch on that spot every Sunday. We bring our
      provisions in Delila. But there! At noon the wretch produced a chicken in
      a newspaper, and while he was eating, he actually caught another chub!

“Then I took up my newspaper to aid my digestion. Every Sunday I
      read the Gil Blas in the shade by the side of the water. It is Columbine''s
      day, you know; Columbine, who writes the articles in the Gil Blas. I
      generally put Madame Renard into a rage by pretending to know this
      Columbine. It is not true, for I do not know her and have never seen her,
      but that does not matter. She writes very well, and then she says things
      that are pretty plain for a woman. She suits me and there are not many of
      her sort.

“Well, I began to tease my wife, but she got angry immediately, and
      very angry, so I held my tongue. At that moment our two witnesses who are
      present here, Monsieur Ladureau and Monsieur Durdent, appeared on the
      other side of the river. We knew each other by sight. The little man began
      to fish again and he caught so many that I trembled with vexation and his
      wife said: ''It is an uncommonly good spot, and we will come here always,
      Desire.'' As for me, a cold shiver ran down my back, and Madame Renard kept
      repeating: ''You are not a man; you have the blood of a chicken in your
      veins''; and suddenly I said to her: ''Look here, I would rather go away or
      I shall be doing something foolish.''

“And she whispered to me, as if she had put a red-hot iron under my
      nose: ''You are not a man. Now you are going to run away and surrender your
      place! Go, then, Bazaine!''

“I felt hurt, but yet I did not move, while the other fellow pulled
      out a bream: Oh, I never saw such a large one before, never! And then my
      wife began to talk aloud, as if she were thinking, and you can see her
      tricks. She said: ''That is what one might call stolen fish, seeing that we
      set the bait ourselves. At any rate, they ought to give us back the money
      we have spent on bait.''

“Then the fat woman in the cotton dress said in her turn: ''Do you
      mean to call us thieves, madame?'' Explanations followed and compliments
      began to fly. Oh, Lord! those creatures know some good ones. They shouted
      so loud that our two witnesses, who were on the other bank, began to call
      out by way of a joke: ''Less noise over there; you will interfere with your
      husbands'' fishing.''

“The fact is that neither the little man nor I moved any more than
      if we had been two tree stumps. We remained there, with our eyes fixed on
      the water, as if we had heard nothing; but, by Jove! we heard all the
      same. ''You are a thief! You are nothing better than a tramp! You are a
      regular jade!'' and so on and so on. A sailor could not have said more.

“Suddenly I heard a noise behind me and turned round. It was the
      other one, the fat woman, who had attacked my wife with her parasol.
      Whack, whack! Melie got two of them. But she was furious, and she hits
      hard when she is in a rage. She caught the fat woman by the hair and then
      thump! thump! slaps in the face rained down like ripe plums. I should have
      let them fight it out: women together, men together. It does not do to mix
      the blows. But the little man in the linen jacket jumped up like a devil
      and was going to rush at my wife. Ah! no, no, not that, my friend! I
      caught the gentleman with the en' WHERE id = '6b5a5bab-cb6d-4c60-9071-cb95b01bf8ca';
