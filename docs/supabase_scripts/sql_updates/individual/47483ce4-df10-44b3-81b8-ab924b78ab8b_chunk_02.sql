      delicate phrases and charming subtleties of expression to describe the
      most improper things. A stranger would have understood none of their
      allusions, so guarded was the language they employed. But, seeing that the
      thin veneer of modesty with which every woman of the world is furnished
      goes but a very little way below the surface, they began rather to enjoy
      this unedifying episode, and at bottom were hugely delighted —feeling
      themselves in their element, furthering the schemes of lawless love with
      the gusto of a gourmand cook who prepares supper for another.

Their gaiety returned of itself, so amusing at last did the whole business
      seem to them. The count uttered several rather risky witticisms, but so
      tactfully were they said that his audience could not help smiling. Loiseau
      in turn made some considerably broader jokes, but no one took offence; and
      the thought expressed with such brutal directness by his wife was
      uppermost in the minds of all: “Since it''s the girl''s trade, why
      should she refuse this man more than another?” Dainty Madame
      Carre-Lamadon seemed to think even that in Boule de Suif''s place she would
      be less inclined to refuse him than another.

The blockade was as carefully arranged as if they were investing a
      fortress. Each agreed on the role which he or she was to play, the
      arguments to be used, the maneuvers to be executed. They decided on the
      plan of campaign, the stratagems they were to employ, and the surprise
      attacks which were to reduce this human citadel and force it to receive
      the enemy within its walls.

So absorbed was the attention of all that Boule de Suif''s entrance was
      almost unnoticed. But the count whispered a gentle “Hush!”
      which made the others look up. She was there. They suddenly stopped
      talking, and a vague embarrassment prevented them for a few moments from
      addressing her. But the countess, more practiced than the others in the
      wiles of the drawing-room, asked her:

The girl, still under the stress of emotion, told what she had seen and
      heard, described the faces, the attitudes of those present, and even the
      appearance of the church. She concluded with the words:

Until lunch time the ladies contented themselves with being pleasant to
      her, so as to increase her confidence and make her amenable to their
      advice.

As soon as they took their seats at table the attack began. First they
      opened a vague conversation on the subject of self-sacrifice. Ancient
      examples were quoted: Judith and Holofernes; then, irrationally enough,
      Lucrece and Sextus; Cleopatra and the hostile generals whom she reduced to
      abject slavery by a surrender of her charms. Next was recounted an
      extraordinary story, born of the imagination of these ignorant
      millionaires, which told how the matrons of Rome seduced Hannibal, his
      lieutenants, and all his mercenaries at Capua. They held up to admiration
      all those women who from time to time have arrested the victorious
      progress of conquerors, made of their bodies a field of battle, a means of
      ruling, a weapon; who have vanquished by their heroic caresses hideous or
      detested beings, and sacrificed their chastity to vengeance and devotion.

All was said with due restraint and regard for propriety, the effect
      heightened now and then by an outburst of forced enthusiasm calculated to
      excite emulation.

A listener would have thought at last that the one role of woman on earth
      was a perpetual sacrifice of her person, a continual abandonment of
      herself to the caprices of a hostile soldiery.

The two nuns seemed to hear nothing, and to be lost in thought. Boule de
      Suif also was silent.

During the whole afternoon she was left to her reflections. But instead of
      calling her “madame” as they had done hitherto, her companions
      addressed her simply as “mademoiselle,” without exactly
      knowing why, but as if desirous of making her descend a step in the esteem
      she had won, and forcing her to realize her degraded position.

Just as soup was served, Monsieur Follenvie reappeared, repeating his
      phrase of the evening before:

But at dinner the coalition weakened. Loiseau made three unfortunate
      remarks. Each was cudgeling his brains for further examples of
      self-sacrifice, and could find none, when the countess, possibly without
      ulterior motive, and moved simply by a vague desire to do homage to
      religion, began to question the elder of the two nuns on the most striking
      facts in the lives of the saints. Now, it fell out that many of these had
      committed acts which would be crimes in our eyes, but the Church readily
      pardons such deeds when they are accomplished for the glory of God or the
      good of mankind. This was a powerful argument, and the countess made the
      most of it. Then, whether by reason of a tacit understanding, a thinly
      veiled act of complaisance such as those who wear the ecclesiastical habit
      excel in, or whether merely as the result of sheer stupidity—a
      stupidity admirably adapted to further their designs—the old nun
      rendered formidable aid to the conspirator. They had thought her timid;
      she proved herself bold, talkative, bigoted. She was not troubled by the
      ins and outs of casuistry; her doctrines were as iron bars; her faith knew
      no doubt; her conscience no scruples. She looked on Abraham''s sacrifice as
      natural enough, for she herself would not have hesitated to kill both
      father and mother if she had received a divine order to that effect; and
      nothing, in her opinion, could displease our Lord, provided the motive
      were praiseworthy. The countess, putting to good use the consecrated
      authority of her unexpected ally, led her on to make a lengthy and
      edifying paraphrase of that axiom enunciated by a certain school of
      moralists: “The end justifies the means.”

“Then, sister,” she asked, “you think God accepts all
      methods, and pardons the act when the motive is pure?”

“Undoubtedly, madame. An action reprehensible in itself often
      derives merit from the thought which inspires it.”

And in this wise they talked on, fathoming the wishes of God, predicting
      His judgments, describing Him as interested in matters which assuredly
      concern Him but little.

All was said with the utmost care and discretion, but every word uttered
      by the holy woman in her nun''s garb weakened the indignant resistance of
      the courtesan. Then the conversation drifted somewhat, and the nun began
      to talk of the convents of her order, of her Superior, of herself, and of
      her fragile little neighbor, Sister St. Nicephore. They had been sent for
      from Havre to nurse the hundreds of soldiers who were in hospitals,
      stricken with smallpox. She described these wretched invalids and their
      malady. And, while they themselves were detained on their way by the
      caprices of the Prussian officer, scores of Frenchmen might be dying, whom
      they would otherwise have saved! For the nursing of soldiers was the old
      nun''s specialty; she had been in the Crimea, in Italy, in Austria; and as
      she told the story of her campaigns she revealed herself as one of those
      holy sisters of the fife and drum who seem designed by nature to follow
      camps, to snatch the wounded from amid the strife of battle, and to quell
      with a word, more effectually than any general, the rough and
      insubordinate troopers—a masterful woman, her seamed and pitted face
      itself an image of the devastations of war.

As soon as the meal was over the travellers retired to their rooms, whence
      they emerged the following day at a late hour of the morning.

Luncheon passed off quietly. The seed sown the preceding evening was being
      given time to germinate and bring forth fruit.

In the afternoon the countess proposed a walk; then the count, as had been
      arranged beforehand, took Boule de Suif''s arm, and walked with her at some
      distance behind the rest.

He began talking to her in that familiar, paternal, slightly contemptuous
      tone which men of his class adopt in speaking to women like her, calling
      her “my dear child,” and talking down to her from the height
      of his exalted social position and stainless reputation. He came straight
      to the point.

“So you prefer to leave us here, exposed like yourself to all the
      violence which would follow on a repulse of the Prussian troops, rather
      than consent to surrender yourself, as you have done so many times in your
      life?”

He tried kindness, argument, sentiment. He still bore himself as count,
      even while adopting, when desirable, an attitude of gallantry, and making
      pretty—nay, even tender—speeches. He exalted the service she
      would render them, spoke of their gratitude; then, suddenly, using the
      familiar “thou”:

“And you know, my dear, he could boast then of having made a
      conquest of a pretty girl such as he won''t often find in his own country.”

As soon as they returned she went to her room, and was seen no more. The
      general anxiety was at its height. What would she do? If she still
      resisted, how awkward for them all!

The dinner hour struck; they waited for her in vain. At last Monsieur
      Follenvie entered, announcing that Mademoiselle Rousset was not well, and
      that they might sit down to table. They all pricked up their ears. The
      count drew near the innkeeper, and whispered:

Out of regard for propriety he said nothing to his companions, but merely
      nodded slightly toward them. A great sigh of relief went up from all
      breasts; every face was lighted up with joy.

“By Gad!” shouted Loiseau, “I''ll stand champagne all
      round if there''s any to be found in this place.” And great was
      Madame Loiseau''s dismay when the proprietor came back with four bottles in
      his hands. They had all suddenly become talkative and merry; a lively joy
      filled all hearts. The count seemed to perceive for the first time that
      Madame Carre-Lamadon was charming; the manufacturer paid compliments to
      the countess. The conversation was animated, sprightly, witty, and,
      although many of the jokes were in the worst possible taste, all the
      company were amused by them, and none offended—indignation being
      dependent, like other emotions, on surroundings. And the mental atmosphere
      had gradually become filled with gross imaginings and unclean thoughts.

At dessert even the women indulged in discreetly worded allusions. Their
      glances were full of meaning; they had drunk much. The count, who even in
      his moments of relaxation preserved a dignified demeanor, hit on a
      much-appreciated comparison of the condition of things with the
      termination of a winter spent in the icy solitude of the North Pole and
      the joy of shipwrecked mariners who at last perceive a southward track
      opening out before their eyes.

All stood up, and greeted the toast with acclamation. Even the two good
      sisters yielded to the solicitations of the ladies, and consented to
      moisten their lips with the foaming wine, which they had never before
      tasted. They declared it was like effervescent lemonade, but with a
      pleasanter flavor.

Cornudet had not spoken a word or made a movement; he seemed plunged in
      serious thought, and now and then tugged furiously at his great beard, as
      if trying to add still further to its length. At last, toward midnight,
      when they were about to separate, Loiseau, whose gait was far from steady,
      suddenly slapped him on the back, saying thickly:

Cornudet threw back his head, cast one swift and scornful glance over the
      assemblage, and answered:

A chill fell on all. Loiseau himself looked foolish and disconcerted for a
      moment, but soon recovered his aplomb, and, writhing with laughter,
      exclaimed:

Pressed for an explanation, he related the “mysteries of the
      corridor,” whereat his listeners were hugely amused. The ladies
      could hardly contain their delight. The count and Monsieur Carre-Lamadon
      laughed till they cried. They could scarcely believe their ears.

Then they separated. But Madame Loiseau, who was nothing if not spiteful,
      remarked to her husband as they were on the way to bed that “that
      stuck-up little minx of a Carre-Lamadon had laughed on the wrong side of
      her mouth all the evening.”

“You know,” she said, “when women run after uniforms
      it''s all the same to them whether the men who wear them are French or
      Prussian. It''s perfectly sickening!”

The next morning the snow showed dazzling white tinder a clear winter sun.
      The coach, ready at last, waited before the door; while a flock of white
      pigeons, with pink eyes spotted in the centres with black, puffed out
      their white feathers and walked sedately between the legs of the six
      horses, picking at the steaming manure.

The driver, wrapped in his sheepskin coat, was smoking a pipe on the box,
      and all the passengers, radiant with delight at their approaching
      departure, were putting up provisions for the remainder of the journey.

She seemed rather shamefaced and embarrassed, and advanced with timid step
      toward her companions, who with one accord turned aside as if they had not
      seen her. The count, with much dignity, took his wife by the arm, and
      removed her from the unclean contact.

The girl stood still, stupefied with astonishment; then, plucking up
      courage, accosted the manufacturer''s wife with a humble “Good-morning,
      madame,” to which the other replied merely with a slight and
      insolent nod, accompanied by a look of outraged virtue. Every one suddenly
      appeared extremely busy, and kept as far from Boule de Suif as if her
      skirts had been infected with some deadly disease. Then they hurried to
      the coach, followed by the despised courtesan, who, arriving last of all,
      silently took the place she had occupied during the first part of the
      journey.

The rest seemed neither to see nor to know her—all save Madame
      Loiseau, who, glancing contemptuously in her direction, remarked, half
      aloud, to her husband:

At first no one spoke. Boule de Suif dared not even raise her eyes. She
      felt at once indignant with her neighbors, and humiliated at having
      yielded to the Prussian into whose arms they had so hypocritically cast
      her.

“Delightful! Exceptionally talented, and an artist to the finger
      tips. She sings marvellously and draws to perfection.”

The manufacturer was chatting with the count, and amid the clatter of the
      window-panes a word of their conversation was now and then
      distinguishable: “Shares—maturity—premium—time-limit.”

Loiseau, who had abstracted from the inn the timeworn pack of cards, thick
      with the grease of five years'' contact with half-wiped-off tables, started
      a game of bezique with his wife.

The good sisters, taking up simultaneously the long rosaries hanging from
      their waists, made the sign of the cross, and began to mutter in unison
      interminable prayers, their lips moving ever more and more swiftly, as if
      they sought which should outdistance the other in the race of orisons;
      from time to time they kissed a medal, and crossed themselves anew, then
      resumed their rapid and unintelligible murmur.

His wife thereupon produced a parcel tied with string, from which she
      extracted a piece of cold veal. This she cut into neat, thin slices, and
      both began to eat.

“We may as well do the same,” said the countess. The rest
      agreed, and she unpacked the provisions which had been prepared for
      herself, the count, and the Carre-Lamadons. In one of those oval dishes,
      the lids of which are decorated with an earthenware hare, by way of
      showing that a game pie lies within, was a succulent delicacy consisting
      of the brown flesh of the game larded with streaks of bacon and flavored
      with other meats chopped fine. A solid wedge of Gruyere cheese, which had
      been wrapped in a newspaper, bore the imprint: “Items of News,”
      on its rich, oily surface.

The two good sisters brought to light a hunk of sausage smelling strongly
      of garlic; and Cornudet, plunging both hands at once into the capacious
      pockets of his loose overcoat, produced from one four hard-boiled eggs and
      from the other a crust of bread. He removed the shells, threw them into
      the straw beneath his feet, and began to devour the eggs, letting morsels
      of the bright yellow yolk fall in his mighty beard, where they looked like
      stars.

Boule de Suif, in the haste and confusion of her departure, had not
      thought of anything, and, stifling with rage, she watched all these people
      placidly eating. At first, ill-suppressed wrath shook her whole person,
      and she opened her lips to shriek the truth at them, to overwhelm them
      with a volley of insults; but she could not utter a word, so choked was
      she with indignation.

No one looked at her, no one thought of her. She felt herself swallowed up
      in the scorn of these virtuous creatures, who had first sacrificed, then
      rejected her as a thing useless and unclean. Then she remembered her big
      basket full of the good things they had so greedily devoured: the two
      chickens coated in jelly, the pies, the pears, the four bottles of claret;
      and her fury broke forth like a cord that is overstrained, and she was on
      the verge of tears. She made terrible efforts at self-control, drew
      herself up, swallowed the sobs which choked her; but the tears rose
      nevertheless, shone at the brink of her eyelids, and soon two heavy drops
      coursed slowly down her cheeks. Others followed more quickly, like water
      filtering from a rock, and fell, one after another, on her rounded bosom.
      She sat upright, with a fixed expression, her face pale and rigid, hoping
      desperately that no one saw her give way.

But the countess noticed that she was weeping, and with a sign drew her
      husband''s attention to the fact. He shrugged his shoulders, as if to say:
      “Well, what of it? It''s not my fault.” Madame Loiseau chuckled
      triumphantly, and murmured:

The two nuns had betaken themselves once more to their prayers, first
      wrapping the remainder of their sausage in paper:

Then Cornudet, who was digesting his eggs, stretched his long legs under
      the opposite seat, threw himself back, folded his arms, smiled like a man
      who had just thought of a good joke, and began to whistle the
      Marseillaise.

The faces of his neighbors clouded; the popular air evidently did not find
      favor with them; they grew nervous and irritable, and seemed ready to howl
      as a dog does at the sound of a barrel-organ. Cornudet saw the discomfort
      he was creating, and whistled the louder; sometimes he even hummed the
      words:

The coach progressed more swiftly, the snow being harder now; and all the
      way to Dieppe, during the long, dreary hours of the journey, first in the
      gathering dusk, then in the thick darkness, raising his voice above the
      rumbling of the vehicle, Cornudet continued with fierce obstinacy his
      vengeful and monotonous whistling, forcing his weary and
      exasperated-hearers to follow the song from end to end, to recall every
      word of every line, as each was repeated over and over again with untiring
      persistency.

And Boule de Suif still wept, and sometimes a sob she could not restrain
      was heard in the darkness between two verses of the song.

Besieged Paris was in the throes of famine. Even the sparrows on the roofs
      and the rats in the sewers were growing scarce. People were eating
      anything they could get.

As Monsieur Morissot, watchmaker by profession and idler for the nonce,
      was strolling along the boulevard one bright January morning, his hands in
      his trousers pockets and stomach empty, he suddenly came face to face with
      an acquaintance—Monsieur Sauvage, a fishing chum.

Before the war broke out Morissot had been in the habit, every Sunday
      morning, of setting forth with a bamboo rod in his hand and a tin box on
      his back. He took the Argenteuil train, got out at Colombes, and walked
      thence to the Ile Marante. The moment he arrived at this place of his
      dreams he began fishing, and fished till nightfall.

Every Sunday he met in this very spot Monsieur Sauvage, a stout, jolly,
      little man, a draper in the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette, and also an ardent
      fisherman. They often spent half the day side by side, rod in hand and
      feet dangling over the water, and a warm friendship had sprung up between
      the two.

Some days they did not speak; at other times they chatted; but they
      understood each other perfectly without the aid of words, having similar
      tastes and feelings.

In the spring, about ten o''clock in the morning, when the early sun caused
      a light mist to float on the water and gently warmed the backs of the two
      enthusiastic anglers, Morissot would occasionally remark to his neighbor:

In the autumn, toward the close of day, when the setting sun shed a
      blood-red glow over the western sky, and the reflection of the crimson
      clouds tinged the whole river with red, brought a glow to the faces of the
      two friends, and gilded the trees, whose leaves were already turning at
      the first chill touch of winter, Monsieur Sauvage would sometimes smile at
      Morissot, and say:

As soon as they recognized each other they shook hands cordially, affected
      at the thought of meeting under such changed circumstances.

They entered a small cafe and took an absinthe together, then resumed
      their walk along the pavement.

They were quite unsteady when they came out, owing to the effect of the
      alcohol on their empty stomachs. It was a fine, mild day, and a gentle
      breeze fanned their faces.

The fresh air completed the effect of the alcohol on Monsieur Sauvage. He
      stopped suddenly, saying:

“Why, to the old place. The French outposts are close to Colombes. I
      know Colonel Dumoulin, and we shall easily get leave to pass.”

An hour later they were walking side by side on the-highroad. Presently
      they reached the villa occupied by the colonel. He smiled at their
      request, and granted it. They resumed their walk, furnished with a
      password.

Soon they left the outposts behind them, made their way through deserted
      Colombes, and found themselves on the outskirts of the small vineyards
      which border the Seine. It was about eleven o''clock.

Before them lay the village of Argenteuil, apparently lifeless. The
      heights of Orgement and Sannois dominated the landscape. The great plain,
      extending as far as Nanterre, was empty, quite empty-a waste of
      dun-colored soil and bare cherry trees.

The Prussians! They had never seen them as yet, but they had felt their
      presence in the neighborhood of Paris for months past—ruining
      France, pillaging, massacring, starving them. And a kind of superstitious
      terror mingled with the hatred they already felt toward this unknown,
      victorious nation.

“We''d offer them some fish,” replied Monsieur Sauvage, with
      that Parisian light-heartedness which nothing can wholly quench.

Still, they hesitated to show themselves in the open country, overawed by
      the utter silence which reigned around them.

And they made their way through one of the vineyards, bent double,
      creeping along beneath the cover afforded by the vines, with eye and ear
      alert.

A strip of bare ground remained to be crossed before they could gain the
      river bank. They ran across this, and, as soon as they were at the water''s
      edge, concealed themselves among the dry reeds.

Morissot placed his ear to the ground, to ascertain, if possible, whether
      footsteps were coming their way. He heard nothing. They seemed to be
      utterly alone.

Before them the deserted Ile Marante hid them from the farther shore. The
      little restaurant was closed, and looked as if it had been deserted for
      years.

Monsieur Sauvage caught the first gudgeon, Monsieur Morissot the second,
      and almost every moment one or other raised his line with a little,
      glittering, silvery fish wriggling at the end; they were having excellent
      sport.

They slipped their catch gently into a close-meshed bag lying at their
      feet; they were filled with joy—the joy of once more indulging in a
      pastime of which they had long been deprived.

The sun poured its rays on their backs; they no longer heard anything or
      thought of anything. They ignored the rest of the world; they were
      fishing.

But suddenly a rumbling sound, which seemed to come from the bowels of the
      earth, shook the ground beneath them: the cannon were resuming their
      thunder.

Morissot turned his head and could see toward the left, beyond the banks
      of the river, the formidable outline of Mont-Valerien, from whose summit
      arose a white puff of smoke.

The next instant a second puff followed the first, and in a few moments a
      fresh detonation made the earth tremble.

Others followed, and minute by minute the mountain gave forth its deadly
      breath and a white puff of smoke, which rose slowly into the peaceful
      heaven and floated above the summit of the cliff.

Morissot, who was anxiously watching his float bobbing up and down, was
      suddenly seized with the angry impatience of a peaceful man toward the
      madmen who were firing thus, and remarked indignantly:

And the two began placidly discussing political problems with the sound
      common sense of peaceful, matter-of-fact citizens—agreeing on one
      point: that they would never be free. And Mont-Valerien thundered
      ceaselessly, demolishing the houses of the French with its cannon balls,
      grinding lives of men to powder, destroying many a dream, many a cherished
      hope, many a prospective happiness; ruthlessly causing endless woe and
      suffering in the hearts of wives, of daughters, of mothers, in other
      lands.

But they suddenly trembled with alarm at the sound of footsteps behind
      them, and, turning round, they perceived close at hand four tall, bearded
      men, dressed after the manner of livery servants and wearing flat caps on
      their heads. They were covering the two anglers with their rifles.

In the space of a few seconds they were seized, bound, thrown into a boat,
      and taken across to the Ile Marante.

A shaggy-looking giant, who was bestriding a chair and smoking a long clay
      pipe, addressed them in excellent French with the words:

Then a soldier deposited at the officer''s feet the bag full of fish, which
      he had taken care to bring away. The Prussian smiled.

“Not bad, I see. But we have something else to talk about. Listen to
      me, and don''t be alarmed:

“You must know that, in my eyes, you are two spies sent to
      reconnoitre me and my movements. Naturally, I capture you and I shoot you.
      You pretended to be fishing, the better to disguise your real errand. You
      have fallen into my hands, and must take the consequences. Such is war.

“But as you came here through the outposts you must have a password
      for your return. Tell me that password and I will let you go.”

The two friends, pale as death, stood silently side by side, a slight
      fluttering of the hands alone betraying their emotion.

“No one will ever know,” continued the officer. “You
      will return peacefully to your homes, and the secret will disappear with
      you. If you refuse, it means death-instant death. Choose!”

“Just think that in five minutes you will be at the bottom of that
      water. In five minutes! You have relations, I presume?”

The two fishermen remained silent. The German turned and gave an order in
      his own language. Then he moved his chair a little way off, that he might
      not be so near the prisoners, and a dozen men stepped forward, rifle in
      hand, and took up a position, twenty paces off.

Then he rose quickly, went over to the two Frenchmen, took Morissot by the
      arm, led him a short distance off, and said in a low voice:

Then by chance Morissot''s eyes fell on the bag full of gudgeon lying in
      the grass a few feet from him.

A ray of sunlight made the still quivering fish glisten like silver. And
      Morissot''s heart sank. Despite his efforts at self-control his eyes filled
      with tears.

Monsieur Sauvage fell forward instantaneously. Morissot, being the taller,
      swayed slightly and fell across his friend with face turned skyward and
      blood oozing from a rent in the breast of his coat.

His men dispersed, and presently returned with ropes and large stones,
      which they attached to the feet of the two friends; then they carried them
      to the river bank.

Two soldiers took Morissot by the head and the feet; two others did the
      same with Sauvage. The bodies, swung lustily by strong hands, were cast to
      a distance, and, describing a curve, fell feet foremost into the stream.

Suddenly he caught sight of the net full of gudgeons, lying forgotten in
      the grass. He picked it up, examined it, smiled, and called:

A white-aproned soldier responded to the summons, and the Prussian,
      tossing him the catch of the two murdered men, said:

“Have these fish fried for me at once, while they are still alive;
      they''ll make a tasty dish.”

It was after Bourbaki''s defeat in the east of France. The army, broken up,
      decimated, and worn out, had been obliged to retreat into Switzerland
      after that terrible campaign, and it was only its short duration that
      saved a hundred and fifty thousand men from certain death. Hunger, the
      terrible cold, forced marches in the snow without boots, over bad mountain
      roads, had caused us ''francs-tireurs'', especially, the greatest suffering,
      for we were without tents, and almost without food, always in the van when
      we were marching toward Belfort, and in the rear when returning by the
      Jura. Of our little band that had numbered twelve hundred men on the first
      of January, there remained only twenty-two pale, thin, ragged wretches,
      when we at length succeeded in reaching Swiss territory.

There we were safe, and could rest. Everybody knows what sympathy was
      shown to the unfortunate French army, and how well it was cared for. We
      all gained fresh life, and those who had been rich and happy before the
      war declared that they had never experienced a greater feeling of comfort
      than they did then. Just think. We actually had something to eat every
      day, and could sleep every night.

Meanwhile, the war continued in the east of France, which had been
      excluded from the armistice. Besancon still kept the enemy in check, and
      the latter had their revenge by ravaging Franche Comte. Sometimes we heard
      that they had approached quite close to the frontier, and we saw Swiss
      troops, who were to form a line of observation between us and them, set
      out on their march.

That pained us in the end, and, as we regained health and strength, the
      longing to fight took possession of us. It was disgraceful and irritating
      to know that within two or three leagues of us the Germans were victorious
      and insolent, to feel that we were protected by our captivity, and to feel
      that on that account we were powerless against them.

One day our captain took five or six of us aside, and spoke to us about
      it, long and furiously. He was a fine fellow, that captain. He had been a
      sublieutenant in the Zouaves, was tall and thin and as hard as steel, and
      during the whole campaign he had cut out their work for the Germans. He
      fretted in inactivity, and could not accustom himself to the idea of being
      a prisoner and of doing nothing.

“Confound it!” he said to us, “does it not pain you to
      know that there is a number of uhlans within two hours of us? Does it not
      almost drive you mad to know that those beggarly wretches are walking
      about as masters in our mountains, when six determined men might kill a
      whole spitful any day? I cannot endure it any longer, and I must go there.”

“How? It is not very difficult! Just as if we had not done a thing
      or two within the last six months, and got out of woods that were guarded
      by very different men from the Swiss. The day that you wish to cross over
      into France, I will undertake to get you there.”

“You are forgetting the treaty,” another soldier said; “we
      shall run the risk of doing the Swiss an injury, if Manteuffel learns that
      they have allowed prisoners to return to France.”

“Come,” said the captain, “those are all bad reasons. I
      mean to go and kill some Prussians; that is all I care about. If you do
      not wish to do as I do, well and good; only say so at once. I can quite
      well go by myself; I do not require anybody''s company.”

Naturally we all protested, and, as it was quite impossible to make the
      captain alter his mind, we felt obliged to promise to go with him. We
      liked him too much to leave him in the lurch, as he never failed us in any
      extremity; and so the expedition was decided on.

The captain had a plan of his own, that he had been cogitating over for
      some time. A man in that part of the country whom he knew was going to
      lend him a cart and six suits of peasants'' clothes. We could hide under
      some straw at the bottom of the wagon, which would be loaded with Gruyere
      cheese, which he was supposed to be going to sell in France. The captain
      told the sentinels that he was taking two friends with him to protect his
      goods, in case any one should try to rob him, which did not seem an
      extraordinary precaution. A Swiss officer seemed to look at the wagon in a
      knowing manner, but that was in order to impress his soldiers. In a word,
      neither officers nor men could make it out.

“Get up,” the captain said to the horses, as he cracked his
      whip, while our three men quietly smoked their pipes. I was half
      suffocated in my box, which only admitted the air through those holes in
      front, and at the same time I was nearly frozen, for it was terribly cold.

The Prussian lines were very badly guarded, as the enemy trusted to the
      watchfulness of the Swiss. The sergeant spoke North German, while our
      captain spoke the bad German of the Four Cantons, and so they could not
      understand each other. The sergeant, however, pretended to be very
      intelligent; and, in order to make us believe that he understood us, they
      allowed us to continue our journey; and, after travelling for seven hours,
      being continually stopped in the same manner, we arrived at a small
      village of the Jura in ruins, at nightfall.

What were we going to do? Our only arms were the captain''s whip, our
      uniforms our peasants'' blouses, and our food the Gruyere cheese. Our sole
      wealth consisted in our ammunition, packages of cartridges which we had
      stowed away inside some of the large cheeses. We had about a thousand of
      them, just two hundred each, but we needed rifles, and they must be
      chassepots. Luckily, however, the captain was a bold man of an inventive
      mind, and this was the plan that he hit upon:

While three of us remained hidden in a cellar in the abandoned village, he
      continued his journey as far as Besancon with the empty wagon and one man.
      The town was invested, but one can always make one''s way into a town among
      the hills by crossing the tableland till within about ten miles of the
      walls, and then following paths and ravines on foot. They left their wagon
      at Omans, among the Germans, and escaped out of it at night on foot; so as
      to gain the heights which border the River Doubs; the next day they
      entered Besancon, where there were plenty of chassepots. There were nearly
      forty thousand of them left in the arsenal, and General Roland, a brave
      marine, laughed at the captain''s daring project, but let him have six
      rifles and wished him “good luck.” There he had also found his
      wife, who had been through all the war with us before the campaign in the
      East, and who had been only prevented by illness from continuing with
      Bourbaki''s army. She had recovered, however, in spite of the cold, which
      was growing more and more intense, and in spite of the numberless
      privations that awaited her, she persisted in accompanying her husband. He
      was obliged to give way to her, and they all three, the captain, his wife,
      and our comrade, started on their expedition.

Going was nothing in comparison to returning. They were obliged to travel
      by night, so as to avoid meeting anybody, as the possession of six rifles
      would have made them liable to suspicion. But, in spite of everything, a
      week after leaving us, the captain and his two men were back with us
      again. The campaign was about to begin.

The first night of his arrival he began it himself, and, under pretext of
      examining the surrounding country, he went along the high road.

I must tell you that the little village which served as our fortress was a
      small collection of poor, badly built houses, which had been deserted long
      before. It lay on a steep slope, which terminated in a wooded plain. The
      country people sell the wood; they send it down the slopes, which are
      called coulees, locally, and which lead down to the plain, and there they
      stack it into piles, which they sell thrice a year to the wood merchants.
      The spot where this market is held in indicated by two small houses by the
      side of the highroad, which serve for public houses. The captain had gone
      down there by way of one of these coulees.

He had been gone about half an hour, and we were on the lookout at the top
      of the ravine, when we heard a shot. The captain had ordered us not to
      stir, and only to come to him when we heard him blow his trumpet. It was
      made of a goat''s horn, and could be heard a league off; but it gave no
      sound, and, in spite of our cruel anxiety, we were obliged to wait in
      silence, with our rifles by our side.

It is nothing to go down these coulees; one just lets one''s self slide
      down; but it is more difficult to get up again; one has to scramble up by
      catching hold of the hanging branches of the trees, and sometimes on all
      fours, by sheer strength. A whole mortal hour passed, and he did not come;
      nothing moved in the brushwood. The captain''s wife began to grow
      impatient. What could he be doing? Why did he not call us? Did the shot
      that we had heard proceed from an enemy, and had he killed or wounded our
      leader, her husband? They did not know what to think, but I myself fancied
      either that he was dead or that his enterprise was successful; and I was
      merely anxious and curious to know what he had done.

Suddenly we heard the sound of his trumpet, and we were much surprised
      that instead of coming from below, as we had expected, it came from the
      village behind us. What did that mean? It was a mystery to us, but the
      same idea struck us all, that he had been killed, and that the Prussians
      were blowing the trumpet to draw us into an ambush. We therefore returned
      to the cottage, keeping a careful lookout with our fingers on the trigger,
      and hiding under the branches; but his wife, in spite of our entreaties,
      rushed on, leaping like a tigress. She thought that she had to avenge her
      husband, and had fixed the bayonet to her rifle, and we lost sight of her
      at the moment that we heard the trumpet again; and, a few moments later,
      we heard her calling out to us:

We hastened on, and saw the captain smoking his pipe at the entrance of
      the village, but strangely enough, he was on horseback.

“Ah! ah!” he said to us, “you see that there is
      something to be done here. Here I am on horseback already; I knocked over
      an uhlan yonder, and took his horse; I suppose they were guarding the
      wood, but it was by drinking and swilling in clover. One of them, the
      sentry at the door, had not time to see me before I gave him a sugarplum
      in his stomach, and then, before the others could come out, I jumped on
      the horse and was off like a shot. Eight or ten of them followed me, I
      think; but I took the crossroads through the woods. I have got scratched
      and torn a bit, but here I am, and now, my good fellows, attention, and
      take care! Those brigands will not rest until they have caught us, and we
      must receive them with rifle bullets. Come along; let us take up our
      posts!”

We set out. One of us took up his position a good way from the village on
      the crossroads; I was posted at the entrance of the main street, where the
      road from the level country enters the village, while the two others, the
      captain and his wife, were in the middle of the village, near the church,
      whose tower served for an observatory and citadel.

We had not been in our places long before we heard a shot, followed by
      another, and then two, then three. The first was evidently a chassepot
      —one recognized it by the sharp report, which sounds like the crack
      of a whip—while the other three came from the lancers'' carbines.

The captain was furious. He had given orders to the outpost to let the
      enemy pass and merely to follow them at a distance if they marched toward
      the village, and to join me when they had gone well between the houses.
      Then they were to appear suddenly, take the patrol between two fires, and
      not allow a single man to escape; for, posted as we were, the six of us
      could have hemmed in ten Prussians, if needful.

“That confounded Piedelot has roused them,” the captain said,
      “and they will not venture to come on blindfolded any longer. And
      then I am quite sure that he has managed to get a shot into himself
      somewhere or other, for we hear nothing of him. It serves him right; why
      did he not obey orders?” And then, after a moment, he grumbled in
      his beard: “After all I am sorry for the poor fellow; he is so
      brave, and shoots so well!”

The captain was right in his conjectures. We waited until evening, without
      seeing the uhlans; they had retreated after the first attack; but
      unfortunately we had not seen Piedelot, either. Was he dead or a prisoner?
      When night came, the captain proposed that we should go out and look for
      him, and so the three of us started. At the crossroads we found a broken
      rifle and some blood, while the ground was trampled down; but we did not
      find either a wounded man or a dead body, although we searched every
      thicket, and at midnight we returned without having discovered anything of
      our unfortunate comrade.

“It is very strange,” the captain growled. “They must
      have killed him and thrown him into the bushes somewhere; they cannot
      possibly have taken him prisoner, as he would have called out for help. I
      cannot understand it at all.” Just as he said that, bright flames
      shot up in the direction of the inn on the high road, which illuminated
      the sky.

“Scoundrels! cowards!” he shouted. “I will bet that they
      have set fire to the two houses on the marketplace, in order to have their
      revenge, and then they will scuttle off without saying a word. They will
      be satisfied with having killed a man and set fire to two houses. All
      right. It shall not pass over like that. We must go for them; they will
      not like to leave their illuminations in order to fight.”

“It would be a great stroke of luck if we could set Piedelot free at
      the same time,” some one said.

The five of us set off, full of rage and hope. In twenty minutes we had
      got to the bottom of the coulee, and had not yet seen any one when we were
      within a hundred yards of the inn. The fire was behind the house, and all
      we saw of it was the reflection above the roof. However, we were walking
      rather slowly, as we were afraid of an ambush, when suddenly we heard
      Piedelot''s well-known voice. It had a strange sound, however; for it was
      at the same time—dull and vibrating, stifled and clear, as if he
      were calling out as loud as he could with a bit of rag stuffed into his
      mouth. He seemed to be hoarse and gasping, and the unlucky fellow kept
      exclaiming: “Help! Help!”

We sent all thoughts of prudence to the devil, and in two bounds we were
      at the back of the inn, where a terrible sight met our eyes.

Piedelot was being burned alive. He was writhing in the midst of a heap of
      fagots, tied to a stake, and the flames were licking him with their
      burning tongues. When he saw us, his tongue seemed to stick in his throat;
      he drooped his head, and seemed as if he were going to die. It was only
      the affair of a moment to upset the burning pile, to scatter the embers,
      and to cut the ropes that fastened him.

Poor fellow! In what a terrible state we found him. The evening before he
      had had his left arm broken, and it seemed as if he had been badly beaten
      since then, for his whole body was covered with wounds, bruises and blood.
      The flames had also begun their work on him, and he had two large burns,
      one on his loins and the other on his right thigh, and his beard and hair
      were scorched. Poor Piedelot!

No one knows the terrible rage we felt at this sight! We would have rushed
      headlong at a hundred thousand Prussians; our thirst for vengeance was
      intense. But the cowards had run away, leaving their crime behind them.
      Where could we find them now? Meanwhile, however, the captain''s wife was
      looking after Piedelot, and dressing his wounds as best she could, while
      the captain himself shook hands with him excitedly, and in a few minutes
      he came to himself.

“Good-morning, captain; good-morning, all of you,” he said.
      “Ah! the scoundrels, the wretches! Why, twenty of them came to
      surprise us.”

“Yes; there was a whole band of them, and that is why I disobeyed
      orders, captain, and fired on them, for they would have killed you all,
      and I preferred to stop them. That frightened them, and they did not
      venture to go farther than the crossroads. They were such cowards. Four of
      them shot at me at twenty yards, as if I had been a target, and then they
      slashed me with their swords. My arm was broken, so that I could only use
      my bayonet with one hand.”

“I took good care not to do that, for you would all have come; and
      you would neither have been able to defend me nor yourselves, being only
      five against twenty.”

“I preferred to die by myself, don''t you see! I did not want to
      bring you here, for it would have been a mere ambush.”

“No, I am suffocating. I know that I cannot live much longer. The
      brutes! They tied me to a tree, and beat me till I was half dead, and then
      they shook my broken arm; but I did not make a sound. I would rather have
      bitten my tongue out than have called out before them. Now I can tell what
      I am suffering and shed tears; it does one good. Thank you, my kind
      friends.”

“Yes, yes; I want you to do that. There is, in particular, a woman
      among them who passes as the wife of the lancer whom the captain killed
      yesterday. She is dressed like a lancer, and she tortured me the most
      yesterday, and suggested burning me; and it was she who set fire to the
      wood. Oh! the wretch, the brute! Ah! how I am suffering! My loins, my
      arms!” and he fell back gasping and exhausted, writhing in his
      terrible agony, while the captain''s wife wiped the perspiration from his
      forehead, and we all shed tears of grief and rage, as if we had been
      children. I will not describe the end to you; he died half an hour later,
      previously telling us in what direction the enemy had gone. When he was
      dead we gave ourselves time to bury him, and then we set out in pursuit of
      them, with our hearts full of fury and hatred.

“We will throw ourselves on the whole Prussian army, if it be
      necessary,” the captain said; “but we will avenge Piedelot. We
      must catch those scoundrels. Let us swear to die, rather than not to find
      them; and if I am killed first, these are my orders: All the prisoners
      that you take are to be shot immediately, and as for the lancer''s wife,
      she is to be tortured before she is put to death.”

“She must not be shot, because she is a woman,” the captain''s
      wife said. “If you survive, I am sure that you would not shoot a
      woman. Torturing her will be quite sufficient; but if you are killed in
      this pursuit, I want one thing, and that is to fight with her; I will kill
      her with my own hands, and the others can do what they like with her if
      she kills me.”

“We will outrage her! We will burn her! We will tear her to pieces!
      Piedelot shall be avenged!

The next morning we unexpectedly fell on an outpost of uhlans four leagues
      away. Surprised by our sudden attack, they were not able to mount their
      horses, nor even to defend themselves; and in a few moments we had five
      prisoner, corresponding to our own number. The captain questioned them,
      and from their answers we felt certain that they were the same whom we had
      encountered the previous day. Then a very curious operation took place.
      One of us was told off to ascertain their sex, and nothing can describe
      our joy when we discovered what we were seeking among them, the female
      executioner who had tortured our friend.

The four others were shot on the spot, with their backs to us and close to
      the muzzles of our rifles; and then we turned our attention to the woman.
      What were we going to do with her? I must acknowledge that we were all of
      us in favor of shooting her. Hatred, and the wish to avenge Piedelot, had
      extinguished all pity in us, and we had forgotten that we were going to
      shoot a woman, but a woman reminded us of it, the captain''s wife; at her
      entreaties, therefore, we determined to keep her a prisoner.

The next day we heard that the armistice had been extended to the eastern
      part of France, and we had to put an end to our little campaign. Two of
      us, who belonged to the neighborhood, returned home, so there were only
      four of us, all told: the captain, his wife, and two men. We belonged to
      Besancon, which was still being besieged in spite of the armistice.

“Let us stop here,” said the captain. “I cannot believe
      that the war is going to end like this. The devil take it! Surely there
      are men still left in France; and now is the time to prove what they are
      made of. The spring is coming on, and the armistice is only a trap laid
      for the Prussians. During the time that it lasts, a new army will be
      raised, and some fine morning we shall fall upon them again. We shall be
      ready, and we have a hostage—let us remain here.”

We fixed our quarters there. It was terribly cold, and we did not go out
      much, and somebody had always to keep the female prisoner in sight.

She was sullen, and never said anything, or else spoke of her husband,
      whom the captain had killed. She looked at him continually with fierce
      eyes, and we felt that she was tortured by a wild longing for revenge.
      That seemed to us to be the most suitable punishment for the terrible
      torments that she had made Piedelot suffer, for impotent vengeance is such
      intense pain!

Alas! we who knew how to avenge our comrade ought to have thought that
      this woman would know how to avenge her husband, and have been on our
      guard. It is true that one of us kept watch every night, and that at first
      we tied her by a long rope to the great oak bench that was fastened to the
      wall. But, by and by, as she had never tried to escape, in spite of her
      hatred for us, we relaxed our extreme prudence, and allowed her to sleep
      somewhere else except on the bench, and without being tied. What had we to
      fear? She was at the end of the room, a man was on guard at the door, and
      between her and the sentinel the captain''s wife and two other men used to
      lie. She was alone and unarmed against four, so there could be no danger.

One night when we were asleep, and the captain was on guard, the lancer''s
      wife was lying more quietly in her corner than usual, and she had even
      smiled for the first time since she had been our prisoner during the
      evening. Suddenly, however, in the middle of the night, we were all
      awakened by a terrible cry. We got up, groping about, and at once stumbled
      over a furious couple who were rolling about and fighting on the ground.
      It was the captain and the lancer''s wife. We threw ourselves on them, and
      separated them in a moment. She was shouting and laughing, and he seemed
      to have the death rattle. All this took place in the dark. Two of us held
      her, and when a light was struck a terrible sight met our eyes. The
      captain was lying on the floor in a pool of blood, with an enormous gash
      in his throat, and his sword bayonet, that had been taken from his rifle,
      was sticking in the red, gaping wound. A few minutes afterward he died,
      without having been able to utter a word.

His wife did not shed a tear. Her eyes were dry, her throat was
      contracted, and she looked at the lancer''s wife steadfastly, and with a
      calm ferocity that inspired fear.

“This woman belongs to me,” she said to us suddenly. “You
      swore to me not a week ago to let me kill her as I chose, if she killed my
      husband; and you must keep your oath. You must fasten her securely to the
      fireplace, upright against the back of it, and then you can go where you
      like, but far from here. I will take my revenge on her myself. Leave the
      captain''s body, and we three, he, she and I, will remain here.”

We obeyed, and went away. She promised to write to us to Geneva, as we
      were returning thither.

Two days later I received the following letter, dated the day after we had
      left, that had been written at an inn on the high road:

“MY FRIEND: I am writing to you, according to my promise. For the
      moment I am at the inn, where I have just handed my prisoner over to a
      Prussian officer.

“I must tell you, my friend, that this poor woman has left two
      children in Germany. She had followed her husband, whom she adored, as she
      did not wish him to be exposed to the risks of war by himself, and as her
      children were with their grandparents. I have learned all this since
      yesterday, and it has turned my ideas of vengeance into more humane
      feelings. At the very moment when I felt pleasure in insulting this woman,
      and in threatening her with the most fearful torments, in recalling
      Piedelot, who had been burned alive, and in threatening her with a similar
      death, she looked at me coldly, and said:

“''What have you got to reproach me with, Frenchwoman? You think that
      you will do right in avenging your husband''s death, is not that so?''

“''Very well, then; in killing him, I did what you are going to do in
      burning me. I avenged my husband, for your husband killed him.''

“And in fact she did not seem to have lost courage. Her face was
      calm, and she looked at me without trembling, while I brought wood and
      dried leaves together, and feverishly threw on to them the powder from
      some cartridges, which was to make her funeral pile the more cruel.

“I hesitated in my thoughts of persecution for a moment. But the
      captain was there, pale and covered with blood, and he seemed to be
      looking at me with his large, glassy eyes, and I applied myself to my work
      again after kissing his pale lips. Suddenly, however, on raising my head,
      I saw that she was crying, and I felt rather surprised.

“She continued to sob, but stopping suddenly, she said to me in
      broken words and in a low voice:

“A shiver rare over me, for I guessed that this poor woman had some.
      She asked me to look in a pocketbook which was in her bosom, and in it I
      saw two photographs of quite young children, a boy and a girl, with those
      kind, gentle, chubby faces that German children have. In it there were
      also two locks of light hair and a letter in a large, childish hand, and
      beginning with German words which meant:

“''I could not restrain my tears, my dear friend, and so I untied
      her, and without venturing to look at the face of my poor dead husband,
      who was not to be avenged, I went with her as far as the inn. She is free;
      I have just left her, and she kissed me with tears. I am going upstairs to
      my husband; come as soon as possible, my dear friend, to look for our two
      bodies.''”

I set off with all speed, and when I arrived there was a Prussian patrol
      at the cottage; and when I asked what it all meant, I was told that there
      was a captain of francs-tireurs and his wife inside, both dead. I gave
      their names; they saw that I knew them, and I begged to be allowed to
      arrange their funeral.

“Somebody has already undertaken it,” was the reply. “Go
      in if you wish to, as you know them. You can settle about their funeral
      with their friend.”

I went in. The captain and his wife were lying side by side on a bed, and
      were covered by a sheet. I raised it, and saw that the woman had inflicted
      a similar wound in her throat to that from which her husband had died.

At the side of the bed there sat, watching and weeping, the woman who had
      been mentioned to me as their best friend. It was the lancer''s wife.

There was not a sound in the forest save the indistinct, fluttering sound
      of the snow falling on the trees. It had been snowing since noon; a little
      fine snow, that covered the branches as with frozen moss, and spread a
      silvery covering over the dead leaves in the ditches, and covered the
      roads with a white, yielding carpet, and made still more intense the
      boundless silence of this ocean of trees.

Before the door of the forester''s dwelling a young woman, her arms bare to
      the elbow, was chopping wood with a hatchet on a block of stone. She was
      tall, slender, strong-a true girl of the woods, daughter and wife of a
      forester.

“We are alone to-night, Berthine; you must come in. It is getting
      dark, and there may be Prussians or wolves about.”

“I''ve just finished, mother,” replied the young woman,
      splitting as she spoke an immense log of wood with strong, deft blows,
      which expanded her chest each time she raised her arms to strike. “Here
      I am; there''s no need to be afraid; it''s quite light still.”

Then she gathered up her sticks and logs, piled them in the chimney
      corner, went back to close the great oaken shutters, and finally came in,
      drawing behind her the heavy bolts of the door.

Her husband had been called upon to serve in the army at the beginning of
      the Prussian invasion, and the two women had remained alone with the old
      father, a keeper named Nicolas Pichon, sometimes called Long-legs, who
      refused obstinately to leave his home and take refuge in the town.

This town was Rethel, an ancient stronghold built on a rock. Its
      inhabitants were patriotic, and had made up their minds to resist the
      invaders, to fortify their native place, and, if need be, to stand a siege
      as in the good old days. Twice already, under Henri IV and under Louis
      XIV, the people of Rethel had distinguished themselves by their heroic
      defence of their town. They would do as much now, by gad! or else be
      slaughtered within their own walls.

They had, therefore, bought cannon and rifles, organized a militia, and
      formed themselves into battalions and companies, and now spent their time
      drilling all day long in the square. All-bakers, grocers, butchers,
      lawyers, carpenters, booksellers, chemists-took their turn at military
      training at regular hours of the day, under the auspices of Monsieur
      Lavigne, a former noncommissioned officer in the dragoons, now a draper,
      having married the daughter and inherited the business of Monsieur
      Ravaudan, Senior.

He had taken the rank of commanding officer in Rethel, and, seeing that
      all the young men had gone off to the war, he had enlisted all the others
      who were in favor of resisting an attack. Fat men now invariably walked
      the streets at a rapid pace, to reduce their weight and improve their
      breathing, and weak men carried weights to strengthen their muscles.

And they awaited the Prussians. But the Prussians did not appear. They
      were not far off, however, for twice already their scouts had penetrated
      as far as the forest dwelling of Nicolas Pichon, called Long-legs.

The old keeper, who could run like a fox, had come and warned the town.
      The guns had been got ready, but the enemy had not shown themselves.

Long-legs'' dwelling served as an outpost in the Aveline forest. Twice a
      week the old man went to the town for provisions and brought the citizens
      news of the outlying district.

On this particular day he had gone to announce the fact that a small
      detachment of German infantry had halted at his house the day before,
      about two o''clock in the afternoon, and had left again almost immediately.
      The noncommissioned officer in charge spoke French.

When the old man set out like this he took with him his dogs—two
      powerful animals with the jaws of lions-as a safeguard against the wolves,
      which were beginning to get fierce, and he left directions with the two
      women to barricade themselves securely within their dwelling as soon as
      night fell.

And Berthine was hanging her pot over the fire to warm the soup when she
      suddenly stood still, listening attentively to a sound that had reached
      her through the chimney.

Berthine took the heavy revolver from its hook, slipped it into the pocket
      of her skirt, and, putting her ear to the door, asked:

“My men and I have lost our way in the forest since morning. Open
      the door or I''ll break it down!”

The forester''s daughter had no choice; she shot back the heavy bolts,
      threw open the ponderous shutter, and perceived in the wan light of the
      snow six men, six Prussian soldiers, the same who had visited the house
      the day before.

“I lost my bearings,” replied the officer; “lost them
      completely. Then I recognized this house. I''ve eaten nothing since
      morning, nor my men either.”

“Never mind,” replied the soldier, who seemed a decent sort of
      fellow. “We won''t do you any harm, but you must give us something to
      eat. We are nearly dead with hunger and fatigue.”

Then entered, covered with snow, their helmets sprinkled with a
      creamy-looking froth, which gave them the appearance of meringues. They
      seemed utterly worn out.

“Sit down,” she said, “and I''ll make you some soup. You
      certainly look tired out, and no mistake.”

She put more water in the pot, added butter and potatoes; then, taking
      down a piece of bacon from a hook in the chimney earner, cut it in two and
      slipped half of it into the pot.

The six men watched her movements with hungry eyes. They had placed their
      rifles and helmets in a corner and waited for supper, as well behaved as
      children on a school bench.

The old mother had resumed her spinning, casting from time to time a
      furtive and uneasy glance at the soldiers. Nothing was to be heard save
      the humming of the wheel, the crackling of the fire, and the singing of
      the water in the pot.

But suddenly a strange noise—a sound like the harsh breathing of
      some wild animal sniffing under the door-startled the occupants of the
      room.

The German officer sprang toward the rifles. Berthine stopped him with a
      gesture, and said, smilingly:

The incredulous man wanted to see with his own eyes, and as soon as the
      door was opened he perceived two large grayish animals disappearing with
      long, swinging trot into the darkness.

The men devoured their meal voraciously, with mouths stretched to their
      ears that they might swallow the more. Their round eyes opened at the same
      time as their jaws, and as the soup coursed down their throats it made a
      noise like the gurgling of water in a rainpipe.

The two women watched in silence the movements of the big red beards. The
      potatoes seemed to be engulfed in these moving fleeces.

But, as they were thirsty, the forester''s daughter went down to the cellar
      to draw them some cider. She was gone some time. The cellar was small,
      with an arched ceiling, and had served, so people said, both as prison and
      as hiding-place during the Revolution. It was approached by means of a
      narrow, winding staircase, closed by a trap-door at the farther end of the
      kitchen.

When Berthine returned she was smiling mysteriously to herself. She gave
      the Germans her jug of cider.

The soldiers had finished eating, and were all six falling asleep as they
      sat round the table. Every now and then a forehead fell with a thud on the
      board, and the man, awakened suddenly, sat upright again.

“Go and lie down, all of you, round the fire. There''s lots of room
      for six. I''m going up to my room with my mother.”

And the two women went upstairs. They could be heard locking the door and
      walking about overhead for a time; then they were silent.

The Prussians lay down on the floor, with their feet to the fire and their
      heads resting on their rolled-up cloaks. Soon all six snored loudly and
      uninterruptedly in six different keys.

They had been sleeping for some time when a shot rang out so loudly that
      it seemed directed against the very walls of the house. The soldiers rose
      hastily. Two-then three-more shots were fired.

The door opened hastily, and Berthine appeared, barefooted and only half
      dressed, with her candle in her hand and a scared look on her face.

“There are the French,” she stammered; “at least two
      hundred of them. If they find you here they''ll burn the house down. For
      God''s sake, hurry down into the cellar, and don''t make a sound, whatever
      you do. If you make any noise we are lost.”

The young woman hurriedly raised the small, square trap-door, and the six
      men disappeared one after another down the narrow, winding staircase,
      feeling their way as they went.

But as soon as the spike of the last helmet was out of sight Berthine
      lowered the heavy oaken lid—thick as a wall, hard as steel,
      furnished with the hinges and bolts of a prison cell—shot the two
      heavy bolts, and began to laugh long and silently, possessed with a mad
      longing to dance above the heads of her prisoners.

They made no sound, inclosed in the cellar as in a strong-box, obtaining
      air only from a small, iron-barred vent-hole.

Berthine lighted her fire again, hung the pot over it, and prepared more
      soup, saying to herself:

Then she sat and waited. The heavy pendulum of the clock swung to and fro
      with a monotonous tick.

Every now and then the young woman cast an impatient glance at the dial-a
      glance which seemed to say:

But soon there was a sound of voices beneath her feet. Low, confused words
      reached her through the masonry which roofed the cellar. The Prussians
      were beginning to suspect the trick she had played them, and presently the
      officer came up the narrow staircase, and knocked at the trap-door.

He struck with the butt-end of his gun at the closed oaken door. But it
      would have resisted a battering-ram.

The forester''s daughter heard him go down the stairs again. Then the
      soldiers came one after another and tried their strength against the
      trapdoor. But, finding their efforts useless, they all returned to the
      cellar and began to talk among themselves.

The young woman heard them for a short time, then she rose, opened the
      door of the house; looked out into the night, and listened.

A sound of distant barking reached her ear. She whistled just as a
      huntsman would, and almost immediately two great dogs emerged from the
      darkness, and bounded to her side. She held them tight, and shouted at the
      top of her voice:

“Don''t go in front of the vent-hole!” shouted his daughter.
      “There are Prussians in the cellar!”

“They are the same as were here yesterday. They lost their way, and
      I''ve given them free lodgings in the cellar.”

She told the story of how she had alarmed them by firing the revolver, and
      had shut them up in the cellar.

“Go and fetch Monsieur Lavigne with his men,” she replied.
      “He''ll take them prisoners. He''ll be delighted.”

The old keeper sat down at the table, and began to eat his soup, having
      first filled two plates and put them on the floor for the dogs.

Long-legs set off a quarter of an hour later, and Berthine, with her head
      between her hands, waited.

The prisoners began to make themselves heard again. They shouted, called,
      and beat furiously with the butts of their muskets against the rigid
      trap-door of the cellar.

Then they fired shots through the vent-hole, hoping, no doubt, to be heard
      by any German detachment which chanced to be passing that way.

The forester''s daughter did not stir, but the noise irritated and unnerved
      her. Blind anger rose in her heart against the prisoners; she would have
      been only too glad to kill them all, and so silence them.

Her father had been gone an hour and a half. He must have reached the town
      by now. She conjured up a vision of him telling the story to Monsieur
      Lavigne, who grew pale with emotion, and rang for his servant to bring him
      his arms and uniform. She fancied she could bear the drum as it sounded
      the call to arms. Frightened faces appeared at the windows. The
      citizen-soldiers emerged from their houses half dressed, out of breath,
      buckling on their belts, and hurrying to the commandant''s house.

Then the troop of soldiers, with Long-legs at its head, set forth through
      the night and the snow toward the forest.

A nervous impatience possessed her. The minutes seemed interminable. Would
      the time never come?

At last the clock marked the moment she had fixed on for their arrival.
      And she opened the door to listen for their approach. She perceived a
      shadowy form creeping toward the house. She was afraid, and cried out. But
      it was her father.

Then he gave a shrill whistle. Soon a dark mass loomed up under the trees;
      the advance guard, composed of ten men.

At last the main body of the troop arrived, in all two hundred men, each
      carrying two hundred cartridges.

Monsieur Lavigne, in a state of intense excitement, posted them in such a
      fashion as to surround the whole house, save for a large space left vacant
      in front of the little hole on a level with the ground, through which the
      cellar derived its supply of air.

Still no response. For the space of twenty minutes Monsieur Lavigne called
      on this silent officer to surrender with bag and baggage, promising him
      that all lives should be spared, and that he and his men should be
      accorded military honors. But he could extort no sign, either of consent
      or of defiance. The situation became a puzzling one.

The citizen-soldiers kicked their heels in the snow, slapping their arms
      across their chest, as cabdrivers do, to warm themselves, and gazing at
      the vent-hole with a growing and childish desire to pass in front of it.

At last one of them took the risk-a man named Potdevin, who was fleet of
      limb. He ran like a deer across the zone of danger. The experiment
      succeeded. The prisoners gave no sign of life.

And another soldier crossed the open space before the dangerous vent-hole.
      Then this hazardous sport developed into a game. Every minute a man ran
      swiftly from one side to the other, like a boy playing baseball, kicking
      up the snow behind him as he ran. They had lighted big fires of dead wood
      at which to warm themselves, and the figures of the runners were illumined
      by the flames as they passed rapidly from the camp on the right to that on
      the left.

Maloison was a fat baker, whose corpulent person served to point many a
      joke among his comrades.

He hesitated. They chaffed him. Then, nerving himself to the effort, he
      set off at a little, waddling gait, which shook his fat paunch and made
      the whole detachment laugh till they cried.

He had accomplished about two-thirds of his journey when a long, crimson
      flame shot forth from the vent-hole. A loud report followed, and the fat
      baker fell face forward to the ground, uttering a frightful scream. No one
      went to his assistance. Then he was seen to drag himself, groaning, on
      all-fours through the snow until he was beyond danger, when he fainted.

After the first surprise and fright were over they laughed at him again.
      But Monsieur Lavigne appeared on the threshold of the forester''s dwelling.
      He had formed his plan of attack. He called in a loud voice “I want
      Planchut, the plumber, and his workmen.”

Next, with infinite precaution, he had a small round hole drilled in the
      trap-door; then, making a conduit with the troughs from the pump to this
      opening, he said, with an air of extreme satisfaction:

A shout of frenzied admiration, mingled with uproarious laughter, burst
      from his followers. And the commandant organized relays of men, who were
      to relieve one another every five minutes. Then he commanded:

And, the pump handle having been set in motion, a stream of water trickled
      throughout the length of the piping, and flowed from step to step down the
      cellar stairs with a gentle, gurgling sound.

An hour passed, then two, then three. The commandant, in a state of
      feverish agitation, walked up and down the kitchen, putting his ear to the
      ground every now and then to discover, if possible, what the enemy were
      doing and whether they would soon capitulate.

The enemy was astir now. They could be heard moving the casks about,
      talking, splashing through the water.

Then, about eight o''clock in the morning, a voice came from the vent-hole
      “I want to speak to the French officer.”

A rifle immediately protruded from the hole, and fell into the snow, then
      another and another, until all were disposed of. And the voice which had
      spoken before said:

Then, having filled the kitchen with armed and waiting soldiers, he slowly
      raised the oaken trapdoor.

Four heads appeared, soaking wet, four fair heads with long, sandy hair,
      and one after another the six Germans emerged—scared, shivering and
      dripping from head to foot.

They were seized and bound. Then, as the French feared a surprise, they
      set off at once in two convoys, one in charge of the prisoners, and the
      other conducting Maloison on a mattress borne on poles.

Monsieur Lavigne was decorated as a reward for having captured a Prussian
      advance guard, and the fat baker received the military medal for wounds
      received at the hands of the enemy.

Every Sunday, as soon as they were free, the little soldiers would go for
      a walk. They turned to the right on leaving the barracks, crossed
      Courbevoie with rapid strides, as though on a forced march; then, as the
      houses grew scarcer, they slowed down and followed the dusty road which
      leads to Bezons.

They were small and thin, lost in their ill-fitting capes, too large and
      too long, whose sleeves covered their hands; their ample red trousers fell
      in folds around their ankles. Under the high, stiff shako one could just
      barely perceive two thin, hollow-cheeked Breton faces, with their calm,
      naive blue eyes. They never spoke during their journey, going straight
      before them, the same idea in each one''s mind taking the place of
      conversation. For at the entrance of the little forest of Champioux they
      had found a spot which reminded them of home, and they did not feel happy
      anywhere else.

At the crossing of the Colombes and Chatou roads, when they arrived under
      the trees, they would take off their heavy, oppressive headgear and wipe
      their foreheads.

They always stopped for a while on the bridge at Bezons, and looked at the
      Seine. They stood there several minutes, bending over the railing,
      watching the white sails, which perhaps reminded them of their home, and
      of the fishing smacks leaving for the open.

As soon as they had crossed the Seine, they would purchase provisions at
      the delicatessen, the baker''s, and the wine merchant''s. A piece of
      bologna, four cents'' worth of bread, and a quart of wine, made up the
      luncheon which they carried away, wrapped up in their handkerchiefs. But
      as soon as they were out of the village their gait would slacken and they
      would begin to talk.

Before them was a plain with a few clumps of trees, which led to the
      woods, a little forest which seemed to remind them of that other forest at
      Kermarivan. The wheat and oat fields bordered on the narrow path, and Jean
      Kerderen said each time to Luc Le Ganidec:

And they went on, side by side, their minds full of dim memories of home.
      They saw the fields, the hedges, the forests, and beaches.

Each time they stopped near a large stone on the edge of the private
      estate, because it reminded them of the dolmen of Locneuven.

As soon as they reached the first clump of trees, Luc Le Ganidec would cut
      off a small stick, and, whittling it slowly, would walk on, thinking of
      the folks at home.

From time to time Luc would mention a name, or allude to some boyish prank
