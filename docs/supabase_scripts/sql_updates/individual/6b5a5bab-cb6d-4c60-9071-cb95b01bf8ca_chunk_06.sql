The doctor, who, meanwhile, had been drinking away steadily, was getting
      visibly drunk, and Madame Caravan herself felt the reaction which follows
      all nervous shocks, and was agitated and excited, and, although she had
      drunk nothing but water, her head felt rather confused.

Presently, Chenet began to relate stories of death that appeared comical
      to him. For in that suburb of Paris, that is full of people from the
      provinces, one finds that indifference towards death which all peasants
      show, were it even their own father or mother; that want of respect, that
      unconscious brutality which is so common in the country, and so rare in
      Paris, and he said:

“Why, I was sent for last week to the Rue du Puteaux, and when I
      went, I found the patient dead and the whole family calmly sitting beside
      the bed finishing a bottle of aniseed cordial, which had been bought the
      night before to satisfy the dying man''s fancy.”

But Madame Caravan was not listening; she was continually thinking of the
      inheritance, and Caravan was incapable of understanding anything further.

Coffee was presently served, and it had been made very strong to give them
      courage. As every cup was well flavored with cognac, it made all their
      faces red, and confused their ideas still more. To make matters still
      worse, Chenet suddenly seized the brandy bottle and poured out “a
      drop for each of them just to wash their mouths out with,” as he
      termed it, and then, without speaking any more, overcome in spite of
      themselves, by that feeling of animal comfort which alcohol affords after
      dinner, they slowly sipped the sweet cognac, which formed a yellowish
      syrup at the bottom of their cups.

The children had fallen asleep, and Rosalie carried them off to bed.
      Caravan, mechanically obeying that wish to forget oneself which possesses
      all unhappy persons, helped himself to brandy again several times, and his
      dull eyes grew bright. At last the doctor rose to go, and seizing his
      friend''s arm, he said:

“Come with me; a little fresh air will do you good. When one is in
      trouble, one must not remain in one spot.”

The other obeyed mechanically, put on his hat, took his stick, and went
      out, and both of them walked arm-in-arm towards the Seine, in the
      starlight night.

The air was warm and sweet, for all the gardens in the neighborhood were
      full of flowers at this season of the year, and their fragrance, which is
      scarcely perceptible during the day, seemed to awaken at the approach of
      night, and mingled with the light breezes which blew upon them in the
      darkness.

The broad avenue with its two rows of gas lamps, that extended as far as
      the Arc de Triomphe, was deserted and silent, but there was the distant
      roar of Paris, which seemed to have a reddish vapor hanging over it. It
      was a kind of continual rumbling, which was at times answered by the
      whistle of a train in the distance, travelling at full speed to the ocean,
      through the provinces.

The fresh air on the faces of the two men rather overcame them at first,
      made the doctor lose his equilibrium a little, and increased Caravan''s
      giddiness, from which he had suffered since dinner. He walked as if he
      were in a dream; his thoughts were paralyzed, although he felt no great
      grief, for he was in a state of mental torpor that prevented him from
      suffering, and he even felt a sense of relief which was increased by the
      mildness of the night.

When they reached the bridge, they turned to the right, and got the fresh
      breeze from the river, which rolled along, calm and melancholy, bordered
      by tall poplar trees, while the stars looked as if they were floating on
      the water and were moving with the current. A slight white mist that
      floated over the opposite banks, filled their lungs with a sensation of
      cold, and Caravan stopped suddenly, for he was struck by that smell from
      the water which brought back old memories to his mind. For, in his mind,
      he suddenly saw his mother again, in Picardy, as he had seen her years
      before, kneeling in front of their door, and washing the heaps of linen at
      her side in the stream that ran through their garden. He almost fancied
      that he could hear the sound of the wooden paddle with which she beat the
      linen in the calm silence of the country, and her voice, as she called out
      to him: “Alfred, bring me some soap.” And he smelled that odor
      of running water, of the mist rising from the wet ground, that marshy
      smell, which he should never forget, and which came back to him on this
      very evening on which his mother had died.

He stopped, seized with a feeling of despair. A sudden flash seemed to
      reveal to him the extent of his calamity, and that breath from the river
      plunged him into an abyss of hopeless grief. His life seemed cut in half,
      his youth disappeared, swallowed up by that death. All the former days
      were over and done with, all the recollections of his youth had been swept
      away; for the future, there would be nobody to talk to him of what had
      happened in days gone by, of the people he had known of old, of his own
      part of the country, and of his past life; that was a part of his
      existence which existed no longer, and the rest might as well end now.

And then he saw “the mother” as she was when young, wearing
      well-worn dresses, which he remembered for such a long time that they
      seemed inseparable from her; he recollected her movements, the different
      tones of her voice, her habits, her predilections, her fits of anger, the
      wrinkles on her face, the movements of her thin fingers, and all her
      well-known attitudes, which she would never have again, and clutching hold
      of the doctor, he began to moan and weep. His thin legs began to tremble,
      his whole stout body was shaken by his sobs, all he could say was:

But his companion, who was still drunk, and who intended to finish the
      evening in certain places of bad repute that he frequented secretly, made
      him sit down on the grass by the riverside, and left him almost
      immediately, under the pretext that he had to see a patient.

Caravan went on crying for some time, and when he had got to the end of
      his tears, when his grief had, so to say, run out, he again felt relief,
      repose and sudden tranquillity.

The tall poplar trees had a silvery sheen on them, and the mist on the
      plain looked like drifting snow; the river, in which the stars were
      reflected, and which had a sheen as of mother-of-pearl, was gently rippled
      by the wind. The air was soft and sweet, and Caravan inhaled it almost
      greedily, and thought that he could perceive a feeling of freshness, of
      calm and of superhuman consolation pervading him.

He actually resisted that feeling of comfort and relief, and kept on
      saying to himself: “My poor mother, my poor mother!” and tried
      to make himself cry, from a kind of conscientious feeling; but he could
      not succeed in doing so any longer, and those sad thoughts, which had made
      him sob so bitterly a shore time before, had almost passed away. In a few
      moments, he rose to go home, and returned slowly, under the influence of
      that serene night, and with a heart soothed in spite of himself.

When he reached the bridge, he saw that the last tramcar was ready to
      start, and behind it were the brightly lighted windows of the Cafe du
      Globe. He felt a longing to tell somebody of his loss, to excite pity, to
      make himself interesting. He put on a woeful face, pushed open the door,
      and went up to the counter, where the landlord still was. He had counted
      on creating a sensation, and had hoped that everybody would get up and
      come to him with outstretched hands, and say: “Why, what is the
      matter with you?” But nobody noticed his disconsolate face, so he
      rested his two elbows on the counter, and, burying his face in his hands,
      he murmured: “Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!”

“Ah!” the other exclaimed, and as a customer at the other end
      of the establishment asked for a glass of Bavarian beer, he went to attend
      to him, leaving Caravan dumfounded at his want of sympathy.

The three domino players were sitting at the same table which they had
      occupied before dinner, totally absorbed in their game, and Caravan went
      up to them, in search of pity, but as none of them appeared to notice him
      he made up his mind to speak.

All three slightly raised their heads at the same instant, but keeping
      their eyes fixed on the pieces which they held in their hands.

“Oh! the devil,” with that false air of sorrow which
      indifferent people assume. Another, who could not find anything to say,
      emitted a sort of sympathetic whistle, shaking his head at the same time,
      and the third turned to the game again, as if he were saying to himself:
      “Is that all!”

Caravan had expected some of these expressions that are said to “come
      from the heart,” and when he saw how his news was received, he left
      the table, indignant at their calmness at their friend''s sorrow, although
      this sorrow had stupefied him so that he scarcely felt it any longer. When
      he got home his wife was waiting for him in her nightgown, and sitting in
      a low chair by the open window, still thinking of the inheritance.

“I beg your pardon, Rosalie is with her, and you can go and take her
      place at three o''clock in the morning, when you have had some sleep.”

He only partially undressed, however, so as to be ready for anything that
      might happen, and after tying a silk handkerchief round his head, he lay
      down to rest, and for some time neither of them spoke. Madame Caravan was
      thinking.

Her nightcap was adorned with a red bow, and was pushed rather to one
      side, as was the way with all the caps she wore, and presently she turned
      towards him and said:

“I call that infamous; here we have been wearing ourselves out for
      ten years in looking after her, and have boarded and lodged her! Your
      sister would not have done so much for her, nor I either, if I had known
      how I was to be rewarded! Yes, it is a disgrace to her memory! I dare say
      that you will tell me that she paid us, but one cannot pay one''s children
      in ready money for what they do; that obligation is recognized after
      death; at any rate, that is how honorable people act. So I have had all my
      worry and trouble for nothing! Oh, that is nice! that is very nice!”

“Of course we must; I had forgotten all about it; I will send her a
      telegram the first thing in the morning.”

“No,” she replied, like a woman who had foreseen everything;
      “no, do not send it before ten or eleven o''clock, so that we may
      have time to turn round before she comes. It does not take more than two
      hours to get here from Charenton, and we can say that you lost your head
      from grief. If we let her know in the course of the day, that will be soon
      enough, and will give us time to look round.”

Caravan put his hand to his forehead, and, in the came timid voice in
      which he always spoke of his chief, the very thought of whom made him
      tremble, he said:

“Why?” she replied. “On occasions like this, it is
      always excusable to forget. Take my advice, and don''t let him know; your
      chief will not be able to say anything to you, and you will put him in a
      nice fix.

“Oh! yes, that I shall, and he will be in a terrible rage, too, when
      he notices my absence. Yes, you are right; it is a capital idea, and when
      I tell him that my mother is dead, he will be obliged to hold his tongue.”

And he rubbed his hands in delight at the joke, when he thought of his
      chief''s face; while upstairs lay the body of the dead old woman, with the
      servant asleep beside it.

But Madame Caravan grew thoughtful, as if she were preoccupied by
      something which she did not care to mention, and at last she said:

“Yes, yes; she said to me (but it was a long time ago, when she
      first came here): ''I shall leave the clock to you, if you look after me
      well.''”

“Well, then, you must go and fetch it out of her room, for if we get
      your sister here, she will prevent us from taking it.”

“I certainly think so; once it is in our possession, she will know
      nothing at all about where it came from; it belongs to us. It is just the
      same with the chest of drawers with the marble top, that is in her room;
      she gave it me one day when she was in a good temper. We will bring it
      down at the same time.”

“Oh! Indeed! Will you never change? You would let your children die
      of hunger, rather than make a move. Does not that chest of drawers belong
      to us, as she gave it to me? And if your sister is not satisfied, let her
      tell me so, me! I don''t care a straw for your sister. Come, get up, and we
      will bring down what your mother gave us, immediately.”

Trembling and vanquished, he got out of bed and began to put on his
      trousers, but she stopped him:

“It is not worth while to dress yourself; your underwear is quite
      enough. I mean to go as I am.”

They both left the room in their night clothes, went upstairs quite
      noiselessly, opened the door and went into the room, where the four
      lighted tapers and the plate with the sprig of box alone seemed to be
      watching the old woman in her rigid repose, for Rosalie, who was lying
      back in the easy chair with her legs stretched out, her hands folded in
      her lap, and her head on one side, was also quite motionless, and was
      snoring with her mouth wide open.

Caravan took the clock, which was one of those grotesque objects that were
      produced so plentifully under the Empire. A girl in gilt bronze was
      holding a cup and ball, and the ball formed the pendulum.

He put the marble slab on his shoulder with considerable effort, and they
      left the room. Caravan had to stoop in the doorway, and trembled as he
      went downstairs, while his wife walked backwards, so as to light him, and
      held the candlestick in one hand, carrying the clock under the other arm.

“We have got over the worst part of the job,” she said;
      “so now let us go and fetch the other things.”

But the bureau drawers were full of the old woman''s wearing apparel, which
      they must manage to hide somewhere, and Madame Caravan soon thought of a
      plan.

“Go and get that wooden packing case in the vestibule; it is hardly
      worth anything, and we may just as well put it here.”

And when he had brought it upstairs they began to fill it. One by one they
      took out all the collars, cuffs, chemises, caps, all the well-worn things
      that had belonged to the poor woman lying there behind them, and arranged
      them methodically in the wooden box in such a manner as to deceive Madame
      Braux, the deceased woman''s other child, who would be coming the next day.

When they had finished, they first of all carried the bureau drawers
      downstairs, and the remaining portion afterwards, each of them holding an
      end, and it was some time before they could make up their minds where it
      would stand best; but at last they decided upon their own room, opposite
      the bed, between the two windows, and as soon as it was in its place
      Madame Caravan filled it with her own things. The clock was placed on the
      chimney-piece in the dining-room, and they looked to see what the effect
      was, and were both delighted with it and agreed that nothing could be
      better. Then they retired, she blew out the candle, and soon everybody in
      the house was asleep.

It was broad daylight when. Caravan opened his eyes again. His mind was
      rather confused when he woke up, and he did not clearly remember what had
      happened for a few minutes; when he did, he felt a weight at his heart,
      and jumped out of bed, almost ready to cry again.

He hastened to the room overhead, where Rosalie was still sleeping in the
      same position as the night before, not having awakened once. He sent her
      to do her work, put fresh tapers in the place of those that had burnt out,
      and then he looked at his mother, revolving in his brain those apparently
      profound thoughts, those religious and philosophical commonplaces which
      trouble people of mediocre intelligence in the presence of death.

But, as his wife was calling him, he went downstairs. She had written out
      a list of what had to be done during the morning, and he was horrified
      when he saw the memorandum:

1. Report the death at the mayor''s office. 2. See the doctor who had
      attended her. 3. Order the coffin. 4. Give notice at the church. 5. Go to
      the undertaker. 6. Order the notices of her death at the printer''s. 7. Go
      to the lawyer. 8. Telegraph the news to all the family.

Besides all this, there were a number of small commissions; so he took his
      hat and went out. As the news had spread abroad, Madame Caravan''s female
      friends and neighbors soon began to come in and begged to be allowed to
      see the body. There had been a scene between husband and wife at the
      hairdresser''s on the ground floor about the matter, while a customer was
      being shaved. The wife, who was knitting steadily, said: “Well,
      there is one less, and as great a miser as one ever meets with. I
      certainly did not care for her; but, nevertheless, I must go and have a
      look at her.”

The husband, while lathering his patient''s chin, said: “That is
      another queer fancy! Nobody but a woman would think of such a thing. It is
      not enough for them to worry you during life, but they cannot even leave
      you at peace when you are dead:” But his wife, without being in the
      least disconcerted, replied: “The feeling is stronger than I am, and
      I must go. It has been on me since the morning. If I were not to see her,
      I should think about it all my life; but when I have had a good look at
      her, I shall be satisfied.”

The knight of the razor shrugged his shoulders and remarked in a low voice
      to the gentleman whose cheek he was scraping: “I just ask you, what
      sort of ideas do you think these confounded females have? I should not
      amuse myself by going to see a corpse!” But his wife had heard him
      and replied very quietly: “But it is so, it is so.” And then,
      putting her knitting on the counter, she went upstairs to the first floor,
      where she met two other neighbors, who had just come, and who were
      discussing the event with Madame Caravan, who was giving them the details,
      and they all went together to the death chamber. The four women went in
      softly, and, one after the other, sprinkled the bed clothes with the salt
      water, knelt down, made the sign of the cross while they mumbled a prayer.
      Then they rose from their knees and looked for some time at the corpse
      with round, wide-open eyes and mouths partly open, while the
      daughter-in-law of the dead woman, with her handkerchief to her face,
      pretended to be sobbing piteously.

When she turned about to walk away whom should she perceive standing close
      to the door but Marie-Louise and Philippe-Auguste, who were curiously
      taking stock of all that was going on. Then, forgetting her pretended
      grief, she threw herself upon them with uplifted hands, crying out in a
      furious voice, “Will you get out of this, you horrid brats!”

Ten minutes later, going upstairs again with another contingent of
      neighbors, she prayed, wept profusely, performed all her duties, and found
      once more her two children, who had followed her upstairs. She again boxed
      their ears soundly, but the next time she paid no heed to them, and at
      each fresh arrival of visitors the two urchins always followed in the
      wake, kneeling down in a corner and imitating slavishly everything they
      saw their mother do.

When the afternoon came the crowds of inquisitive people began to
      diminish, and soon there were no more visitors. Madame Caravan, returning
      to her own apartments, began to make the necessary preparations for the
      funeral ceremony, and the deceased was left alone.

The window of the room was open. A torrid heat entered, along with clouds
      of dust; the flames of the four candles were flickering beside the
      immobile corpse, and upon the cloth which covered the face, the closed
      eyes, the two stretched-out hands, small flies alighted, came, went and
      careered up and down incessantly, being the only companions of the old
      woman for the time being.

Marie-Louise and Philippe-Auguste, however, had now left the house and
      were running up and down the street. They were soon surrounded by their
      playmates, by little girls especially, who were older and who were much
      more interested in all the mysteries of life, asking questions as if they
      were grown people.

“Then your grandmother is dead?” “Yes, she died
      yesterday evening.” “What does a dead person look like?”

Then Marie began to explain, telling all about the candles, the sprig of
      box and the face of the corpse. It was not long before great curiosity was
      aroused in the minds of all the children, and they asked to be allowed to
      go upstairs to look at the departed.

Marie-Louise at once organized a first expedition, consisting of five
      girls and two boys—the biggest and the most courageous. She made
      them take off their shoes so that they might not be discovered. The troupe
      filed into the house and mounted the stairs as stealthily as an army of
      mice.

Once in the chamber, the little girl, imitating her mother, regulated the
      ceremony. She solemnly walked in advance of her comrades, went down on her
      knees, made the sign of the cross, moved her lips as in prayer, rose,
      sprinkled the bed, and while the children, all crowded together, were
      approaching—frightened and curious and eager to look at the face and
      hands of the deceased—she began suddenly to simulate sobbing and to
      bury her eyes in her little handkerchief. Then, becoming instantly
      consoled, on thinking of the other children who were downstairs waiting at
      the door, she ran downstairs followed by the rest, returning in a minute
      with another group, then a third; for all the little ragamuffins of the
      countryside, even to the little beggars in rags, had congregated in order
      to participate in this new pleasure; and each time she repeated her
      mother''s grimaces with absolute perfection.

At length, however, she became tired. Some game or other drew the children
      away from the house, and the old grandmother was left alone, forgotten
      suddenly by everybody.

The room was growing dark, and upon the dry and rigid features of the
      corpse the fitful flames of the candles cast patches of light.

Towards 8 o''clock Caravan ascended to the chamber of death, closed the
      windows and renewed the candles. He was now quite composed on entering the
      room, accustomed already to regard the corpse as though it had been there
      for months. He even went the length of declaring that, as yet, there were
      no signs of decomposition, making this remark just at the moment when he
      and his wife were about to sit down at table. “Pshaw!” she
      responded, “she is now stark and stiff; she will keep for a year.”

The soup was eaten in silence. The children, who had been left to
      themselves all day, now worn out by fatigue, were sleeping soundly on
      their chairs, and nobody ventured to break the silence.

Suddenly the flame of the lamp went down. Madame Caravan immediately
      turned up the wick, a hollow sound ensued, and the light went out. They
      had forgotten to buy oil. To send for it now to the grocer''s would keep
      back the dinner, and they began to look for candles, but none were to be
      found except the tapers which had been placed upon the table upstairs in
      the death chamber.

Madame Caravan, always prompt in her decisions, quickly despatched
      Marie-Louise to fetch two, and her return was awaited in total darkness.

The footsteps of the girl who had ascended the stairs were distinctly
      heard. There was silence for a few seconds and then the child descended
      precipitately. She threw open the door and in a choking voice murmured:
      “Oh! papa, grandmamma is dressing herself!”

Caravan bounded to his feet with such precipitance that his chair fell
      over against the wall. He stammered out: “You say? . . . . What are
      you saying?”

But Marie-Louise, gasping with emotion, repeated: “Grand—grand
      —grandmamma is putting on her clothes, she is coming downstairs.”

Caravan rushed boldly up the staircase, followed by his wife, dumfounded;
      but he came to a standstill before the door of the second floor, overcome
      with terror, not daring to enter. What was he going to see? Madame
      Caravan, more courageous, turned the handle of the door and stepped
      forward into the room.

The old woman was standing up. In awakening from her lethargic sleep,
      before even regaining full consciousness, in turning upon her side and
      raising herself on her elbow, she had extinguished three of the candles
      which burned near the bed. Then, gaining strength, she got off the bed and
      began to look for her clothes. The absence of her chest of drawers had at
      first worried her, but, after a little, she had succeeded in finding her
      things at the bottom of the wooden box, and was now quietly dressing. She
      emptied the plateful of water, replaced the sprig of box behind the
      looking-glass, and arranged the chairs in their places, and was ready to
      go downstairs when there appeared before her her son and daughter-in-law.

Caravan rushed forward, seized her by the hands, embraced her with tears
      in his eyes, while his wife, who was behind him, repeated in a
      hypocritical tone of voice: “Oh, what a blessing! oh, what a
      blessing!”

But the old woman, without being at all moved, without even appearing to
      understand, rigid as a statue, and with glazed eyes, simply asked: “Will
      dinner soon be ready?”

And with an alacrity unusual in him, he took her arm, while Madame
      Caravan, the younger, seized the candle and lighted them downstairs,
      walking backwards in front of them, step by step, just as she had done the
      previous night for her husband, who was carrying the marble.

On reaching the first floor, she almost ran against people who were
      ascending the stairs. It was the Charenton family, Madame Braux, followed
      by her husband.

The wife, tall and stout, with a prominent stomach, opened wide her
      terrified eyes and was ready to make her escape. The husband, a socialist
      shoemaker, a little hairy man, the perfect image of a monkey, murmured
      quite unconcerned: “Well, what next? Is she resurrected?”

As soon as Madame Caravan recognized them, she made frantic gestures to
      them; then, speaking aloud, she said: “Why, here you are! What a
      pleasant surprise!”

But Madame Braux, dumfounded, understood nothing. She responded in a low
      voice: “It was your telegram that brought us; we thought that all
      was over.”

Her husband, who was behind her, pinched her to make her keep silent. He
      added with a sly laugh, which his thick beard concealed: “It was
      very kind of you to invite us here. We set out post haste,” which
      remark showed the hostility which had for a long time reigned between the
      households. Then, just as the old woman reached the last steps, he pushed
      forward quickly and rubbed his hairy face against her cheeks, shouting in
      her ear, on account of her deafness: “How well you look, mother;
      sturdy as usual, hey!”

Madame Braux, in her stupefaction at seeing the old woman alive, whom they
      all believed to be dead, dared not even embrace her; and her enormous bulk
      blocked up the passageway and hindered the others from advancing. The old
      woman, uneasy and suspicious, but without speaking, looked at everyone
      around her; and her little gray eyes, piercing and hard, fixed themselves
      now on one and now on the other, and they were so full of meaning that the
      children became frightened.

Caravan, to explain matters, said: “She has been somewhat ill, but
      she is better now; quite well, indeed, are you not, mother?”

Then the good woman, continuing to walk, replied in a husky voice, as
      though it came from a distance: “It was syncope. I heard you all the
      while.”

An embarrassing silence followed. They entered the dining-room, and in a
      few minutes all sat down to an improvised dinner.

Only M. Braux had retained his self-possession. His gorilla features
      grinned wickedly, while he let fall some words of double meaning which
      painfully disconcerted everyone.

But the door bell kept ringing every second, and Rosalie, distracted, came
      to call Caravan, who rushed out, throwing down his napkin. His
      brother-in-law even asked him whether it was not one of his reception
      days, to which he stammered out in answer: “No, only a few packages;
      nothing more.”

A parcel was brought in, which he began to open carelessly, and the
      mourning announcements with black borders appeared unexpectedly. Reddening
      up to the very eyes, he closed the package hurriedly and pushed it under
      his waistcoat.

His mother had not seen it! She was looking intently at her clock which
      stood on the mantelpiece, and the embarrassment increased in midst of a
      dead silence. Turning her wrinkled face towards her daughter, the old
      woman, in whose eyes gleamed malice, said: “On Monday you must take
      me away from here, so that I can see your little girl. I want so much to
      see her.” Madame Braux, her features all beaming, exclaimed: “Yes,
      mother, that I will,” while Madame Caravan, the younger, who had
      turned pale, was ready to faint with annoyance. The two men, however,
      gradually drifted into conversation and soon became embroiled in a
      political discussion. Braux maintained the most revolutionary and
      communistic doctrines, his eyes glowing, and gesticulating and throwing
      about his arms. “Property, sir,” he said, “is a robbery
      perpetrated on the working classes; the land is the common property of
      every man; hereditary rights are an infamy and a disgrace.” But here
      he suddenly stopped, looking as if he had just said something foolish,
      then added in softer tones: “But this is not the proper moment to
      discuss such things.”

The door was opened and Dr. Chenet appeared. For a moment he seemed
      bewildered, but regaining his usual smirking expression of countenance, he
      jauntily approached the old woman and said: “Aha! mamma; you are
      better to-day. Oh! I never had any doubt but you would come round again;
      in fact, I said to myself as I was mounting the staircase, ''I have an idea
      that I shall find the old lady on her feet once more'';” and as he
      patted her gently on the back: “Ah! she is as solid as the
      Pont-Neuf, she will bury us all; see if she does not.”

He sat down, accepted the coffee that was offered him, and soon began to
      join in the conversation of the two men, backing up Braux, for he himself
      had been mixed up in the Commune.

The old woman, now feeling herself fatigued, wished to retire. Caravan
      rushed forward. She looked him steadily in the eye and said: “You,
      you must carry my clock and chest of drawers upstairs again without a
      moment''s delay.” “Yes, mamma,” he replied, gasping;
      “yes, I will do so.” The old woman then took the arm of her
      daughter and withdrew from the room. The two Caravans remained astounded,
      silent, plunged in the deepest despair, while Braux rubbed his hands and
      sipped his coffee gleefully.

Suddenly Madame Caravan, consumed with rage, rushed at him, exclaiming:
      “You are a thief, a footpad, a cur! I would spit in your face! I—I
      —would——” She could find nothing further to say,
      suffocating as she was with rage, while he went on sipping his coffee with
      a smile.

His wife returning just then, Madame Caravan attacked her sister-in-law,
      and the two women—the one with her enormous bulk, the other
      epileptic and spare, with changed voices and trembling hands flew at one
      another with words of abuse.

Chenet and Braux now interposed, and the latter, taking his better half by
      the shoulders, pushed her out of the door before him, shouting: “Go
      on, you slut; you talk too much”; and the two were heard in the
      street quarrelling until they disappeared from sight.

M. Chenet also took his departure, leaving the Caravans alone, face to
      face. The husband fell back on his chair, and with the cold sweat standing
      out in beads on his temples, murmured: “What shall I say to my chief
      to-morrow?”

He was slowly dying, as consumptives die. I saw him each day, about two
      o''clock, sitting beneath the hotel windows on a bench in the promenade,
      looking out on the calm sea. He remained for some time without moving, in
      the heat of the sun, gazing mournfully at the Mediterranean. Every now and
      then, he cast a glance at the lofty mountains with beclouded summits that
      shut in Mentone; then, with a very slow movement, he would cross his long
      legs, so thin that they seemed like two bones, around which fluttered the
      cloth of his trousers, and he would open a book, always the same book. And
      then he did not stir any more, but read on, read on with his eye and his
      mind; all his wasting body seemed to read, all his soul plunged, lost,
      disappeared, in this book, up to the hour when the cool air made him cough
      a little. Then, he got up and reentered the hotel.

He was a tall German, with fair beard, who breakfasted and dined in his
      own room, and spoke to nobody.

A vague, curiosity attracted me to him. One day, I sat down by his side,
      having taken up a book, too, to keep up appearances, a volume of Musset''s
      poems.

“I am sorry for that. Since chance has thrown us side by side, I
      could have lent you, I could have shown you, an inestimable thing—this
      book which I hold in my hand.”

“It is a copy of my master, Schopenhauer, annotated with his own
      hand. All the margins, as you may see, are covered with his handwriting.”

I took the book from him reverently, and I gazed at these forms
      incomprehensible to me, but which revealed the immortal thoughts of the
      greatest shatterer of dreams who had ever dwelt on earth.

And involuntarily I compared the childish sarcasm, the religious sarcasm
      of Voltaire with the irresistible irony of the German philosopher whose
      influence is henceforth ineffaceable.

Let us protest and let us be angry, let us be indignant, or let us be
      enthusiastic, Schopenhauer has marked humanity with the seal of his
      disdain and of his disenchantment.

A disabused pleasure-seeker, he overthrew beliefs, hopes, poetic ideals
      and chimeras, destroyed the aspirations, ravaged the confidence of souls,
      killed love, dragged down the chivalrous worship of women, crushed the
      illusions of hearts, and accomplished the most gigantic task ever
      attempted by scepticism. He spared nothing with his mocking spirit, and
      exhausted everything. And even to-day those who execrate him seem to carry
      in their own souls particles of his thought.

And he spoke to me about the philosopher and told me about the almost
      supernatural impression which this strange being made on all who came near
      him.

He gave me an account of the interview of the old iconoclast with a French
      politician, a doctrinaire Republican, who wanted to get a glimpse of this
      man, and found him in a noisy tavern, seated in the midst of his
      disciples, dry, wrinkled, laughing with an unforgettable laugh, attacking
      and tearing to pieces ideas and beliefs with a single word, as a dog tears
      with one bite of his teeth the tissues with which he plays.

He repeated for me the comment of this Frenchman as he went away,
      astonished and terrified: “I thought I had spent an hour with the
      devil.”

“He had, indeed, monsieur, a frightful smile, which terrified us
      even after his death. I can tell you an anecdote about it that is not
      generally known, if it would interest you.”

“Schopenhauer had just died, and it was arranged that we should
      watch, in turn, two by two, till morning.

“He was lying in a large apartment, very simple, vast and gloomy.
      Two wax candles were burning on the stand by the bedside.

“It was midnight when I went on watch, together with one of our
      comrades. The two friends whom we replaced had left the apartment, and we
      came and sat down at the foot of the bed.

“The face was not changed. It was laughing. That pucker which we
      knew so well lingered still around the corners of the lips, and it seemed
      to us that he was about to open his eyes, to move and to speak. His
      thought, or rather his thoughts, enveloped us. We felt ourselves more than
      ever in the atmosphere of his genius, absorbed, possessed by him. His
      domination seemed to be even more sovereign now that he was dead. A
      feeling of mystery was blended with the power of this incomparable spirit.

“The bodies of these men disappear, but they themselves remain; and
      in the night which follows the cessation of their heart''s pulsation I
      assure you, monsieur, they are terrifying.

“And in hushed tones we talked about him, recalling to mind certain
      sayings, certain formulas of his, those startling maxims which are like
      jets of flame flung, in a few words, into the darkness of the Unknown
      Life.

“''It seems to me that he is going to speak,'' said my comrade. And we
      stared with uneasiness bordering on fear at the motionless face, with its
      eternal laugh. Gradually, we began to feel ill at ease, oppressed, on the
      point of fainting. I faltered:

“Then, my comrade suggested that we should go into the adjoining
      room, and leave the door open; and I assented to his proposal.

“I took one of the wax candles which burned on the stand, and I left
      the second behind. Then we went and sat down at the other end of the
      adjoining apartment, in such a position that we could see the bed and the
      corpse, clearly revealed by the light.

“But he still held possession of us. One would have said that his
      immaterial essence, liberated, free, all-powerful and dominating, was
      flitting around us. And sometimes, too, the dreadful odor of the
      decomposed body came toward us and penetrated us, sickening and
      indefinable.

“Suddenly a shiver passed through our bones: a sound, a slight
      sound, came from the death-chamber. Immediately we fixed our glances on
      him, and we saw, yes, monsieur, we saw distinctly, both of us, something
      white pass across the bed, fall on the carpet, and vanish under an
      armchair.

“We were on our feet before we had time to think of anything,
      distracted by stupefying terror, ready to run away. Then we stared at each
      other. We were horribly pale. Our hearts throbbed fiercely enough to have
      raised the clothing on our chests. I was the first to speak:

“I took our wax candle and entered first, glancing into all the dark
      corners in the large apartment. Nothing was moving now, and I approached
      the bed. But I stood transfixed with stupor and fright:

“Schopenhauer was no longer laughing! He was grinning in a horrible
      fashion, with his lips pressed together and deep hollows in his cheeks. I
      stammered out:

“But the terrible odor ascended to my nose and stifled me. And I no
      longer moved, but kept staring fixedly at him, terrified as if in the
      presence of an apparition.

“Then my companion, having seized the other wax candle, bent
      forward. Next, he touched my arm without uttering a word. I followed his
      glance, and saw on the ground, under the armchair by the side of the bed,
      standing out white on the dark carpet, and open as if to bite,
      Schopenhauer''s set of artificial teeth.

And as the sun was sinking toward the glittering sea, the consumptive
      German rose from his seat, gave me a parting bow, and retired into the
      hotel.

There were seven of us on a drag, four women and three men; one of the
      latter sat on the box seat beside the coachman. We were ascending, at a
      snail''s pace, the winding road up the steep cliff along the coast.

Setting out from Etretat at break of day in order to visit the ruins of
      Tancarville, we were still half asleep, benumbed by the fresh air of the
      morning. The women especially, who were little accustomed to these early
      excursions, half opened and closed their eyes every moment, nodding their
      heads or yawning, quite insensible to the beauties of the dawn.

It was autumn. On both sides of the road stretched the bare fields,
      yellowed by the stubble of wheat and oats which covered the soil like a
      beard that had been badly shaved. The moist earth seemed to steam. Larks
      were singing high up in the air, while other birds piped in the bushes.

The sun rose at length in front of us, bright red on the plane of the
      horizon, and in proportion as it ascended, growing clearer from minute to
      minute, the country seemed to awake, to smile, to shake itself like a
      young girl leaving her bed in her white robe of vapor. The Comte
      d''Etraille, who was seated on the box, cried:

“Look! look! a hare!” and he extended his arm toward the left,
      pointing to a patch of clover. The animal scurried along, almost hidden by
      the clover, only its large ears showing. Then it swerved across a furrow,
      stopped, started off again at full speed, changed its course, stopped
      anew, uneasy, spying out every danger, uncertain what route to take, when
      suddenly it began to run with great bounds, disappearing finally in a
      large patch of beet-root. All the men had waked up to watch the course of
      the animal.

“We are not at all gallant this morning,” and; regarding his
      neighbor, the little Baroness de Serennes, who struggled against sleep, he
      said to her in a low tone: “You are thinking of your husband,
      baroness. Reassure yourself; he will not return before Saturday, so you
      have still four days.”

“How stupid you are!” Then, shaking off her torpor, she added:
      “Now, let somebody say something to make us laugh. You, Monsieur
      Chenal, who have the reputation of having had more love affairs than the
      Duc de Richelieu, tell us a love story in which you have played a part;
      anything you like.”

Leon Chenal, an old painter, who had once been very handsome, very strong,
      very proud of his physique and very popular with women, took his long
      white beard in his hand and smiled. Then, after a few moments'' reflection,
      he suddenly became serious.

“Ladies, it will not be an amusing tale, for I am going to relate to
      you the saddest love affair of my life, and I sincerely hope that none of
      my friends may ever pass through a similar experience.

“I was twenty-five years of age and was pillaging along the coast of
      Normandy. I call ''pillaging'' wandering about, with a knapsack on one''s
      back, from inn to inn, under the pretext of making studies and sketching
      landscapes. I knew nothing more enjoyable than that happy-go-lucky
      wandering life, in which one is perfectly free, without shackles of any
      kind, without care, without preoccupation, without thinking even of the
      morrow. One goes in any direction one pleases, without any guide save his
      fancy, without any counsellor save his eyes. One stops because a running
      brook attracts one, because the smell of potatoes frying tickles one''s
      olfactories on passing an inn. Sometimes it is the perfume of clematis
      which decides one in his choice or the roguish glance of the servant at an
      inn. Do not despise me for my affection for these rustics. These girls
      have a soul as well as senses, not to mention firm cheeks and fresh lips;
      while their hearty and willing kisses have the flavor of wild fruit. Love
      is always love, come whence it may. A heart that beats at your approach,
      an eye that weeps when you go away are things so rare, so sweet, so
      precious that they must never be despised.

“I have had rendezvous in ditches full of primroses, behind the cow
      stable and in barns among the straw, still warm from the heat of the day.
      I have recollections of coarse gray cloth covering supple peasant skin and
      regrets for simple, frank kisses, more delicate in their unaffected
      sincerity than the subtle favors of charming and distinguished women.

“But what one loves most amid all these varied adventures is the
      country, the woods, the rising of the sun, the twilight, the moonlight.
      These are, for the painter, honeymoon trips with Nature. One is alone with
      her in that long and quiet association. You go to sleep in the fields,
      amid marguerites and poppies, and when you open your eyes in the full
      glare of the sunlight you descry in the distance the little village with
      its pointed clock tower which sounds the hour of noon.

“You sit down by the side of a spring which gushes out at the foot
      of an oak, amid a growth of tall, slender weeds, glistening with life. You
      go down on your knees, bend forward and drink that cold, pellucid water
      which wets your mustache and nose; you drink it with a physical pleasure,
      as though you kissed the spring, lip to lip. Sometimes, when you find a
      deep hole along the course of these tiny brooks, you plunge in quite
      naked, and you feel on your skin, from head to foot, as it were, an icy
      and delicious caress, the light and gentle quivering of the stream.

“You are gay on the hills, melancholy on the edge of ponds, inspired
      when the sun is setting in an ocean of blood-red clouds and casts red
      reflections or the river. And at night, under the moon, which passes
      across the vault of heaven, you think of a thousand strange things which
      would never have occurred to your mind under the brilliant light of day.

“So, in wandering through the same country where we, are this year,
      I came to the little village of Benouville, on the cliff between Yport and
      Etretat. I came from Fecamp, following the coast, a high coast as straight
      as a wall, with its projecting chalk cliffs descending perpendicularly
      into the sea. I had walked since early morning on the short grass, smooth
      and yielding as a carpet, that grows on the edge of the cliff. And,
      singing lustily, I walked with long strides, looking sometimes at the slow
      circling flight of a gull with its white curved wings outlined on the blue
      sky, sometimes at the brown sails of a fishing bark on the green sea. In
      short, I had passed a happy day, a day of liberty and of freedom from
      care.

“A little farmhouse where travellers were lodged was pointed out to
      me, a kind of inn, kept by a peasant woman, which stood in the centre of a
      Norman courtyard surrounded by a double row of beeches.

“Leaving the coast, I reached the hamlet, which was hemmed in by
      great trees, and I presented myself at the house of Mother Lecacheur.

“She was an old, wrinkled and stern peasant woman, who seemed always
      to receive customers under protest, with a kind of defiance.

“It was the month of May. The spreading apple trees covered the
      court with a shower of blossoms which rained unceasingly both upon people
      and upon the grass.

“In five minutes we had come to an agreement, and I deposited my bag
      upon the earthen floor of a rustic room, furnished with a bed, two chairs,
      a table and a washbowl. The room looked into the large, smoky kitchen,
      where the lodgers took their meals with the people of the farm and the
      landlady, who was a widow.

“I washed my hands, after which I went out. The old woman was making
      a chicken fricassee for dinner in the large fireplace in which hung the
      iron pot, black with smoke.

“''I have a lady, an English lady, who has reached years of maturity.
      She occupies the other room.''

“I obtained, by means of an extra five sous a day, the privilege of
      dining alone out in the yard when the weather was fine.

“My place was set outside the door, and I was beginning to gnaw the
      lean limbs of the Normandy chicken, to drink the clear cider and to munch
      the hunk of white bread, which was four days old but excellent.

“Suddenly the wooden gate which gave on the highway was opened, and
      a strange lady directed her steps toward the house. She was very thin,
      very tall, so tightly enveloped in a red Scotch plaid shawl that one might
      have supposed she had no arms, if one had not seen a long hand appear just
      above the hips, holding a white tourist umbrella. Her face was like that
      of a mummy, surrounded with curls of gray hair, which tossed about at
      every step she took and made me think, I know not why, of a pickled
      herring in curl papers. Lowering her eyes, she passed quickly in front of
      me and entered the house.

“That singular apparition cheered me. She undoubtedly was my
      neighbor, the English lady of mature age of whom our hostess had spoken.

“I did not see her again that day. The next day, when I had settled
      myself to commence painting at the end of that beautiful valley which you
      know and which extends as far as Etretat, I perceived, on lifting my eyes
      suddenly, something singular standing on the crest of the cliff, one might
      have said a pole decked out with flags. It was she. On seeing me, she
      suddenly disappeared. I reentered the house at midday for lunch and took
      my seat at the general table, so as to make the acquaintance of this odd
      character. But she did not respond to my polite advances, was insensible
      even to my little attentions. I poured out water for her persistently, I
      passed her the dishes with great eagerness. A slight, almost
      imperceptible, movement of the head and an English word, murmured so low
      that I did not understand it, were her only acknowledgments.

“She was called Miss Harriet. Seeking out a secluded village in
      which to pass the summer, she had been attracted to Benouville some six
      months before and did not seem disposed to leave it. She never spoke at
      table, ate rapidly, reading all the while a small book of the Protestant
      propaganda. She gave a copy of it to everybody. The cure himself had
      received no less than four copies, conveyed by an urchin to whom she had
      paid two sous commission. She said sometimes to our hostess abruptly,
      without preparing her in the least for the declaration:

“''I love the Saviour more than all. I admire him in all creation; I
      adore him in all nature; I carry him always in my heart.''

“And she would immediately present the old woman with one of her
      tracts which were destined to convert the universe.

“In, the village she was not liked. In fact, the schoolmaster having
      pronounced her an atheist, a kind of stigma attached to her. The cure, who
      had been consulted by Madame Lecacheur, responded:

“''She is a heretic, but God does not wish the death of the sinner,
      and I believe her to be a person of pure morals.''

“These words, ''atheist,'' ''heretic,'' words which no one can precisely
      define, threw doubts into some minds. It was asserted, however, that this
      English woman was rich and that she had passed her life in travelling
      through every country in the world because her family had cast her off.
      Why had her family cast her off? Because of her impiety, of course!

“She was, in fact, one of those people of exalted principles; one of
      those opinionated puritans, of which England produces so many; one of
      those good and insupportable old maids who haunt the tables d''hote of
      every hotel in Europe, who spoil Italy, poison Switzerland, render the
      charming cities of the Mediterranean uninhabitable, carry everywhere their
      fantastic manias their manners of petrified vestals, their indescribable
      toilets and a certain odor of india-rubber which makes one believe that at
      night they are slipped into a rubber casing.

“Whenever I caught sight of one of these individuals in a hotel I
      fled like the birds who see a scarecrow in a field.

“Madame Lecacheur, hostile by instinct to everything that was not
      rustic, felt in her narrow soul a kind of hatred for the ecstatic
      declarations of the old maid. She had found a phrase by which to describe
      her, a term of contempt that rose to her lips, called forth by I know not
      what confused and mysterious mental ratiocination. She said: ''That woman
      is a demoniac.'' This epithet, applied to that austere and sentimental
      creature, seemed to me irresistibly droll. I myself never called her
      anything now but ''the demoniac,'' experiencing a singular pleasure in
      pronouncing aloud this word on perceiving her.

“''What do you think, sir? She picked up a toad which had had its paw
      crushed and carried it to her room and has put it in her washbasin and
      bandaged it as if it were a man. If that is not profanation I should like
      to know what is!''

“On another occasion, when walking along the shore she bought a
      large fish which had just been caught, simply to throw it back into the
      sea again. The sailor from whom she had bought it, although she paid him
      handsomely, now began to swear, more exasperated, indeed, than if she had
      put her hand into his pocket and taken his money. For more than a month he
      could not speak of the circumstance without becoming furious and
      denouncing it as an outrage. Oh, yes! She was indeed a demoniac, this Miss
      Harriet, and Mother Lecacheur must have had an inspiration in thus
      christening her.

“The stable boy, who was called Sapeur, because he had served in
      Africa in his youth, entertained other opinions. He said with a roguish
      air: ''She is an old hag who has seen life.''

“The little kind-hearted Celeste did not wait upon her willingly,
      but I was never able to understand why. Probably her only reason was that
      she was a stranger, of another race; of a different tongue and of another
      religion. She was, in fact, a demoniac!

“She passed her time wandering about the country, adoring and
      seeking God in nature. I found her one evening on her knees in a cluster
      of bushes. Having discovered something red through the leaves, I brushed
      aside the branches, and Miss Harriet at once rose to her feet, confused at
      having been found thus, fixing on me terrified eyes like those of an owl
      surprised in open day.

“Sometimes, when I was working among the rocks, I would suddenly
      descry her on the edge of the cliff like a lighthouse signal. She would be
      gazing in rapture at the vast sea glittering in the sunlight and the
      boundless sky with its golden tints. Sometimes I would distinguish her at
      the end of the valley, walking quickly with her elastic English step, and
      I would go toward her, attracted by I know not what, simply to see her
      illuminated visage, her dried-up, ineffable features, which seemed to glow
      with inward and profound happiness.

“I would often encounter her also in the corner of a field, sitting
      on the grass under the shadow of an apple tree, with her little religious
      booklet lying open on her knee while she gazed out at the distance.

“I could not tear myself away from that quiet country neighborhood,
      to which I was attached by a thousand links of love for its wide and
      peaceful landscape. I was happy in this sequestered farm, far removed from
      everything, but in touch with the earth, the good, beautiful, green earth.
      And—must I avow it?—there was, besides, a little curiosity
      which retained me at the residence of Mother Lecacheur. I wished to become
      acquainted a little with this strange Miss Harriet and to know what
      transpires in the solitary souls of those wandering old English women.

“We became acquainted in a rather singular manner. I had just
      finished a study which appeared to me to be worth something, and so it
      was, as it sold for ten thousand francs fifteen years later. It was as
      simple, however, as two and two make four and was not according to
      academic rules. The whole right side of my canvas represented a rock, an
      enormous rock, covered with sea-wrack, brown, yellow and red, across which
      the sun poured like a stream of oil. The light fell upon the rock as
      though it were aflame without the sun, which was at my back, being
      visible. That was all. A first bewildering study of blazing, gorgeous
      light.

“On the left was the sea, not the blue sea, the slate-colored sea,
      but a sea of jade, greenish, milky and solid beneath the deep-colored sky.

“I was so pleased with my work that I danced from sheer delight as I
      carried it back to the inn. I would have liked the whole world to see it
      at once. I can remember that I showed it to a cow that was browsing by the
      wayside, exclaiming as I did so: ''Look at that, my old beauty; you will
      not often see its like again.''

“When I had reached the house I immediately called out to Mother
      Lecacheur, shouting with all my might:

“The rustic approached and looked at my work with her stupid eyes
      which distinguished nothing and could not even tell whether the picture
      represented an ox or a house.

“Miss Harriet just then came home, and she passed behind me just as
      I was holding out my canvas at arm''s length, exhibiting it to our
      landlady. The demoniac could not help but see it, for I took care to
      exhibit the thing in such a way that it could not escape her notice. She
      stopped abruptly and stood motionless, astonished. It was her rock which
      was depicted, the one which she climbed to dream away her time
      undisturbed.

“She uttered a British ''Aoh,'' which was at once so accentuated and
      so flattering that I turned round to her, smiling, and said:

“I colored and was more touched by that compliment than if it had
      come from a queen. I was captured, conquered, vanquished. I could have
      embraced her, upon my honor.

“I passed her some bread, some water, some wine. She now accepted
      these with a little smile of a mummy. I then began to talk about the
      scenery.

“After the meal we rose from the table together and walked leisurely
      across the courtyard; then, attracted doubtless by the fiery glow which
      the setting sun cast over the surface of the sea, I opened the gate which
      led to the cliff, and we walked along side by side, as contented as two
      persons might be who have just learned to understand and penetrate each
      other''s motives and feelings.

“It was one of those warm, soft evenings which impart a sense of
      ease to flesh and spirit alike. All is enjoyment, everything charms. The
      balmy air, laden with the perfume of grasses and the smell of seaweed,
      soothes the olfactory sense with its wild fragrance, soothes the palate
      with its sea savor, soothes the mind with its pervading sweetness.

“We were now walking along the edge of the cliff, high above the
      boundless sea which rolled its little waves below us at a distance of a
      hundred metres. And we drank in with open mouth and expanded chest that
      fresh breeze, briny from kissing the waves, that came from the ocean and
      passed across our faces.

“Wrapped in her plaid shawl, with a look of inspiration as she faced
      the breeze, the English woman gazed fixedly at the great sun ball as it
      descended toward the horizon. Far off in the distance a three-master in
      full sail was outlined on the blood-red sky and a steamship, somewhat
      nearer, passed along, leaving behind it a trail of smoke on the horizon.
      The red sun globe sank slowly lower and lower and presently touched the
      water just behind the motionless vessel, which, in its dazzling
      effulgence, looked as though framed in a flame of fire. We saw it plunge,
      grow smaller and disappear, swallowed up by the ocean.

“Miss Harriet gazed in rapture at the last gleams of the dying day.
      She seemed longing to embrace the sky, the sea, the whole landscape.

“She murmured: ''Aoh! I love—I love'' I saw a tear in her eye.
      She continued: ''I wish I were a little bird, so that I could mount up into
      the firmament.''

“She remained standing as I had often before seen her, perched on
      the cliff, her face as red as her shawl. I should have liked to have
      sketched her in my album. It would have been a caricature of ecstasy.

“I then spoke to her of painting as I would have done to a fellow
      artist, using the technical terms common among the devotees of the
      profession. She listened attentively, eagerly seeking to divine the
      meaning of the terms, so as to understand my thoughts. From time to time
      she would exclaim:

“The next day, on seeing me, she approached me, cordially holding
      out her hand; and we at once became firm friends.

“She was a good creature who had a kind of soul on springs, which
      became enthusiastic at a bound. She lacked equilibrium like all women who
      are spinsters at the age of fifty. She seemed to be preserved in a pickle
      of innocence, but her heart still retained something very youthful and
      inflammable. She loved both nature and animals with a fervor, a love like
      old wine fermented through age, with a sensuous love that she had never
      bestowed on men.

“One thing is certain, that the sight of a bitch nursing her
      puppies, a mare roaming in a meadow with a foal at its side, a bird''s nest
      full of young ones, screaming, with their open mouths and their enormous
      heads, affected her perceptibly.

“Poor, solitary, sad, wandering beings! I love you ever since I
      became acquainted with Miss Harriet.

“I soon discovered that she had something she would like to tell me,
      but dare not, and I was amused at her timidity. When I started out in the
      morning with my knapsack on my back, she would accompany me in silence as
      far as the end of the village, evidently struggling to find words with
      which to begin a conversation. Then she would leave me abruptly and walk
      away quickly with her springy step.

“She remained standing behind me, following all my gestures with
      concentrated attention. Then, suddenly, fearing perhaps that she was
      disturbing me, she said: ''Thank you,'' and walked away.

“But she soon became more friendly, and accompanied me every day,
      her countenance exhibiting visible pleasure. She carried her camp stool
      under her arm, not permitting me to carry it. She would remain there for
      hours, silent and motionless, following with her eyes the point of my
      brush, in its every movement. When I obtained unexpectedly just the effect
      I wanted by a dash of color put on with the palette knife, she
      involuntarily uttered a little ''Ah!'' of astonishment, of joy, of
      admiration. She had the most tender respect for my canvases, an almost
      religious respect for that human reproduction of a part of nature''s work
      divine. My studies appeared to her a kind of religious pictures, and
      sometimes she spoke to me of God, with the idea of converting me.

“Oh, he was a queer, good-natured being, this God of hers! He was a
      sort of village philosopher without any great resources and without great
      power, for she always figured him to herself as inconsolable over
      injustices committed under his eyes, as though he were powerless to
      prevent them.

“She was, however, on excellent terms with him, affecting even to be
      the confidante of his secrets and of his troubles. She would say:

“''God wills'' or ''God does not will,'' just like a sergeant announcing
      to a recruit: ''The colonel has commanded.''

“At the bottom of her heart she deplored my ignorance of the
      intentions of the Eternal, which she endeavored to impart to me.

“Almost every day I found in my pockets, in my hat when I lifted it
      from the ground, in my paintbox, in my polished shoes, standing in front
      of my door in the morning, those little pious tracts which she no doubt,
      received directly from Paradise.

“I treated her as one would an old friend, with unaffected
      cordiality. But I soon perceived that she had changed somewhat in her
      manner, though, for a while, I paid little attention to it.

“When I was painting, whether in my valley or in some country lane,
      I would see her suddenly appear with her rapid, springy walk. She would
      then sit down abruptly, out of breath, as though she had been running or
      were overcome by some profound emotion. Her face would be red, that
      English red which is denied to the people of all other countries; then,
      without any reason, she would turn ashy pale and seem about to faint away.
      Gradually, however, her natural color would return and she would begin to
      speak.

“Then, without warning, she would break off in the middle of a
      sentence, spring up from her seat and walk away so rapidly and so
      strangely that I was at my wits'' ends to discover whether I had done or
      said anything to displease or wound her.

“I finally came to the conclusion that those were her normal
      manners, somewhat modified no doubt in my honor during the first days of
      our acquaintance.

“When she returned to the farm, after walking for hours on the windy
      coast, her long curls often hung straight down, as if their springs had
      been broken. This had hitherto seldom given her any concern, and she would
      come to dinner without embarrassment all dishevelled by her sister, the
      breeze.

“But now she would go to her room and arrange the untidy locks, and
      when I would say, with familiar gallantry, which, however, always offended
      her:

“''You are as beautiful as a star to-day, Miss Harriet,'' a blush
      would immediately rise to her cheeks, the blush of a young girl, of a girl
      of fifteen.

“Then she would suddenly become quite reserved and cease coming to
      watch me paint. I thought, ''This is only a fit of temper; it will blow
      over.'' But it did not always blow over, and when I spoke to her she would
      answer me either with affected indifference or with sullen annoyance.

“She became by turns rude, impatient and nervous. I never saw her
      now except at meals, and we spoke but little. I concluded at length that I
      must have offended her in some way, and, accordingly, I said to her one
      evening:

“''Miss Harriet, why is it that you do not act toward me as formerly?
      What have I done to displease you? You are causing me much pain!''

“''I am just the same with you as formerly. It is not true, not
      true,'' and she ran upstairs and shut herself up in her room.

“Occasionally she would look at me in a peculiar manner. I have
      often said to myself since then that those who are condemned to death must
      look thus when they are informed that their last day has come. In her eye
      there lurked a species of insanity, an insanity at once mystical and
      violent; and even more, a fever, an aggravated longing, impatient and
      impotent, for the unattained and unattainable.

“Nay, it seemed to me there was also going on within her a struggle
      in which her heart wrestled with an unknown force that she sought to
      master, and even, perhaps, something else. But what do I know? What do I
      know?

“For some time I had commenced to work, as soon as daylight
      appeared, on a picture the subject of which was as follows:

“A deep ravine, enclosed, surmounted by two thickets of trees and
      vines, extended into the distance and was lost, submerged in that milky
      vapor, in that cloud like cotton down that sometimes floats over valleys
      at daybreak. And at the extreme end of that heavy, transparent fog one
      saw, or, rather, surmised, that a couple of human beings were approaching,
      a human couple, a youth and a maiden, their arms interlaced, embracing
      each other, their heads inclined toward each other, their lips meeting.

“A first ray of the sun, glistening through the branches, pierced
      that fog of the dawn, illuminated it with a rosy reflection just behind
      the rustic lovers, framing their vague shadows in a silvery background. It
      was well done; yes, indeed, well done.

“I was working on the declivity which led to the Valley of Etretat.
      On this particular morning I had, by chance, the sort of floating vapor
      which I needed. Suddenly something rose up in front of me like a phantom;
      it was Miss Harriet. On seeing me she was about to flee. But I called
      after her, saying: ''Come here, come here, mademoiselle. I have a nice
      little picture for you.''

“She came forward, though with seeming reluctance. I handed her my
      sketch. She said nothing, but stood for a long time, motionless, looking
      at it, and suddenly she burst into tears. She wept spasmodically, like men
      who have striven hard to restrain their tears, but who can do so no longer
      and abandon themselves to grief, though still resisting. I sprang to my
      feet, moved at the sight of a sorrow I did not comprehend, and I took her
      by the hand with an impulse of brusque affection, a true French impulse
      which acts before it reflects.

“She let her hands rest in mine for a few seconds, and I felt them
      quiver as if all her nerves were being wrenched. Then she withdrew her
      hands abruptly, or, rather, snatched them away.

“I recognized that tremor, for I had felt it, and I could not be
      deceived. Ah! the love tremor of a woman, whether she be fifteen or fifty
      years of age, whether she be of the people or of society, goes so straight
      to my heart that I never have any hesitation in understanding it!

“Her whole frail being had trembled, vibrated, been overcome. I knew
      it. She walked away before I had time to say a word, leaving me as
      surprised as if I had witnessed a miracle and as troubled as if I had
      committed a crime.

“I did not go in to breakfast. I went to take a turn on the edge of
      the cliff, feeling that I would just as lief weep as laugh, looking on the
      adventure as both comic and deplorable and my position as ridiculous,
      believing her unhappy enough to go insane.

“I asked myself what I ought to do. It seemed best for me to leave
      the place, and I immediately resolved to do so.

“Somewhat sad and perplexed, I wandered about until dinner time and
      entered the farmhouse just when the soup had been served up.

“I sat down at the table as usual. Miss Harriet was there, eating
      away solemnly, without speaking to any one, without even lifting her eyes.
      Her manner and expression were, however, the same as usual.

“I waited patiently till the meal had been finished, when, turning
      toward the landlady, I said: ''Well, Madame Lecacheur, it will not be long
      now before I shall have to take my leave of you.''

“The good woman, at once surprised and troubled, replied in her
      drawling voice: ''My dear sir, what is it you say? You are going to leave
      us after I have become so accustomed to you?''

“I glanced at Miss Harriet out of the corner of my eye. Her
      countenance did not change in the least. But Celeste, the little servant,
      looked up at me. She was a fat girl, of about eighteen years of age, rosy,
      fresh, as strong as a horse, and possessing the rare attribute of
      cleanliness. I had kissed her at odd times in out-of-the-way corners,
      after the manner of travellers—nothing more.

“The dinner being at length over, I went to smoke my pipe under the
      apple trees, walking up and down from one end of the enclosure to the
      other. All the reflections which I had made during the day, the strange
      discovery of the morning, that passionate and grotesque attachment for me,
      the recollections which that revelation had suddenly called up,
      recollections at once charming and perplexing, perhaps also that look
      which the servant had cast on me at the announcement of my departure—all
      these things, mixed up and combined, put me now in a reckless humor, gave
      me a tickling sensation of kisses on the lips and in my veins a something
      which urged me on to commit some folly.

“Night was coming on, casting its dark shadows under the trees, when
      I descried Celeste, who had gone to fasten up the poultry yard at the
      other end of the enclosure. I darted toward her, running so noiselessly
      that she heard nothing, and as she got up from closing the small trapdoor
      by which the chickens got in and out, I clasped her in my arms and rained
      on her coarse, fat face a shower of kisses. She struggled, laughing all
      the time, as she was accustomed to do in such circumstances. Why did I
      suddenly loose my grip of her? Why did I at once experience a shock? What
      was it that I heard behind me?

“It was Miss Harriet, who had come upon us, who had seen us and who
      stood in front of us motionless as a spectre. Then she disappeared in the
      darkness.

“I was ashamed, embarrassed, more desperate at having been thus
      surprised by her than if she had caught me committing some criminal act.

“I slept badly that night. I was completely unnerved and haunted by
      sad thoughts. I seemed to hear loud weeping, but in this I was no doubt
      deceived. Moreover, I thought several times that I heard some one walking
      up and down in the house and opening the hall door.

“Toward morning I was overcome by fatigue and fell asleep. I got up
      late and did not go downstairs until the late breakfast, being still in a
      bewildered state, not knowing what kind of expression to put on.

“No one had seen Miss Harriet. We waited for her at table, but she
      did not appear. At length Mother Lecacheur went to her room. The English
      woman had gone out. She must have set out at break of day, as she was wont
      to do, in order to see the sun rise.

“The weather was hot, very hot, one of those broiling, heavy days
      when not a leaf stirs. The table had been placed out of doors, under an
      apple tree, and from time to time Sapeur had gone to the cellar to draw a
      jug of cider, everybody was so thirsty. Celeste brought the dishes from
      the kitchen, a ragout of mutton with potatoes, a cold rabbit and a salad.
      Afterward she placed before us a dish of strawberries, the first of the
      season.

“As I wished to wash and freshen these, I begged the servant to go
      and draw me a pitcher of cold water.

“In about five minutes she returned, declaring that the well was
      dry. She had lowered the pitcher to the full extent of the cord and had
      touched the bottom, but on drawing the pitcher up again it was empty.
      Mother Lecacheur, anxious to examine the thing for herself, went and
      looked down the hole. She returned, announcing that one could see clearly
      something in the well, something altogether unusual. But this no doubt was
      bundles of straw, which a neighbor had thrown in out of spite.

“I wished to look down the well also, hoping I might be able to
      clear up the mystery, and I perched myself close to the brink. I perceived
      indistinctly a white object. What could it be? I then conceived the idea
      of lowering a lantern at the end of a cord. When I did so the yellow flame
      danced on the layers of stone and gradually became clearer. All four of us
      were leaning over the opening, Sapeur and Celeste having now joined us.
      The lantern rested on a black-and-white indistinct mass, singular,
      incomprehensible. Sapeur exclaimed:

“''It is a horse. I see the hoofs. It must have got out of the meadow
      during the night and fallen in headlong.''

“But suddenly a cold shiver froze me to the marrow. I first
      recognized a foot, then a leg sticking up; the whole body and the other
      leg were completely under water.

“I stammered out in a loud voice, trembling so violently that the
      lantern danced hither and thither over the slipper:

“But it was necessary to recover the corpse of the dead woman. I
      attached the young man securely by the waist to the end of the pulley rope
      and lowered him very slowly, watching him disappear in the darkness. In
      one hand he held the lantern and a rope in the other. Soon I recognized
      his voice, which seemed to come from the centre of the earth, saying:

“I then saw him fish something out of the water. It was the other
      leg. He then bound the two feet together and shouted anew:

“I began to wind up, but I felt my arms crack, my muscles twitch,
      and I was in terror lest I should let the man fall to the bottom. When his
      head appeared at the brink I asked:

“We both got on the stone slab at the edge of the well and from
      opposite sides we began to haul up the body.

“Mother Lecacheur and Celeste watched us from a distance, concealed
      from view behind the wall of the house. When they saw issuing from the
      hole the black slippers and white stockings of the drowned person they
      disappeared.

“Sapeur seized the ankles, and we drew up the body of the poor
      woman. The head was shocking to look at, being bruised and lacerated, and
      the long gray hair, out of curl forevermore, hanging down tangled and
      disordered.

“We carried her into the room, and as the women did not put in an
      appearance I, with the assistance of the stable lad, dressed the corpse
      for burial.

“I washed her disfigured face. Under the touch of my finger an eye
      was slightly opened and regarded me with that ' WHERE id = '6b5a5bab-cb6d-4c60-9071-cb95b01bf8ca';
