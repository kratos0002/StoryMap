“I am sorry the chair could not betake itself to some more suitable place
      of refuge,” said Laurence.

“It was old now, and must have longed for quiet. Besides, after it had
      held Washington in its arms, it ought not to have been compelled to
      receive all the world. It should have been put into the pulpit of the Old
      South Church, or some other consecrated place.”

“Perhaps so,” answered Grandfather. “But the chair, in the course of its
      varied existence, had grown so accustomed to general intercourse with
      society, that I doubt whether it would have contented itself in the pulpit
      of the Old South. There it would have stood solitary, or with no livelier
      companion than the silent organ, in the opposite gallery, six days out of
      seven. I incline to think that it had seldom been situated more to its
      mind than on the sanded floor of the snug little barber’s shop.”

Then Grandfather amused his children and himself with fancying all the
      different sorts of people who had occupied our chair while they awaited
      the leisure Of the barber.

There was the old clergyman, such as Dr. Chauncey, wearing a white wig,
      which the barber took from his head and placed upon a wig-block. Half an
      hour, perhaps, was spent in combing and powdering this reverend appendage
      to a clerical skull. There, too, were officers of the Continental army,
      who required their hair to be pomatumed and plastered, so as to give them
      a bold and martial aspect. There, once in a while, was seen the thin,
      care-worn, melancholy visage of an old tory, with a Wig that, in times
      long past, had perhaps figured at a Province House ball. And there, not
      unfrequently, sat the rough captain of a privateer, just returned from a
      successful cruise, in which he had captured half a dozen richly laden
      vessels belonging to King George’s subjects. And sometimes a rosy little
      school-boy climbed into our chair, and sat staring, with wide-open eyes,
      at the alligator, the rattlesnake, and the other curiosities of the
      barber’s shop. His mother had sent him, with sixpence in his hand, to get
      his glossy curls cropped off. The incidents of the Revolution plentifully
      supplied the barber’s customers with topics of conversation. They talked
      sorrowfully of the death of General Montgomery and the failure of our
      troops to take Quebec; for the New-Englanders were now as anxious to get
      Canada from the English as they had formerly been to conquer it from the
      French.

“But very soon,” said Grandfather, “came news from Philadelphia, the most
      important that America had ever heard of. On the 4th of July, 1776,
      Congress had signed the Declaration of Independence. The thirteen colonies
      were now free and independent States. Dark as our prospects were, the
      inhabitants welcomed these glorious tidings, and resolved to perish rather
      than again bear the yoke of England.”

“It was a great day,—a glorious deed!” said Laurence, coloring high
      with enthusiasm. “And, Grandfather, I love to think that the sages in
      Congress showed themselves as bold and true as the soldiers in the field;
      for it must have required more courage to sign the Declaration of
      Independence than to fight the enemy in battle.”

Grandfather acquiesced in Laurence’s view of the matter. He then touched
      briefly and hastily upon the prominent events of the Revolution. The
      thunderstorm of war had now rolled southward, and did not again burst upon
      Massachusetts, where its first fury had been felt. But she contributed her
      full share. So the success of the contest. Wherever a battle was fought,—whether
      at Long Island, White Plains, Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, or
      Germantown,—some of her brave sons were found slain upon the field.

In October, 1777, General Burgoyne surrendered his army, at Saratoga, to
      the American general, Gates. The captured troops were sent to
      Massachusetts. Not long afterwards Dr. Franklin and other American
      commissioners made a treaty at Paris, by which France bound herself to
      assist our countrymen. The gallant Lafayette was already fighting for our
      freedom by the side of Washington. In 1778 a French fleet, commanded by
      Count d’Estaing, spent a considerable time in Boston harbor. It marks the
      vicissitudes of human affairs, that the French, our ancient enemies,
      should come hither as comrades and brethren, and that kindred England
      should be our foe.

“While the war was raging in the Middle and Southern States,” proceeded
      Grandfather, “Massachusetts had leisure to settle a new constitution of
      government instead of the royal charter. This was done in 1780. In the
      same year John Hancock, who had been president of Congress, was chosen
      governor of the State. He was the first whom the people had elected since
      the days of old Simon Bradstreet.”

“But, Grandfather, who had been governor since the British were driven
      away?” inquired Laurence. “General Gage and Sir William Howe were the last
      whom you have told us of.”

“There had been no governor for the last four years,” replied Grandfather.
      “Massachusetts had been ruled by the Legislature, to whom the people paid
      obedience of their own accord. It is one of the most remarkable
      circumstances in our history, that, when the charter government was
      overthrown by the war, no anarchy nor the slightest confusion ensued, This
      was a great honor to the people. But now Hancock was proclaimed governor
      by sound of trumpet; and there was again a settled government.”

Grandfather again adverted to the progress of the war. In 1781 General
      Greene drove the British from the Southern States. In October of the same
      year General Washington compelled Lord Cornwallis to surrender his army,
      at Yorktown, in Virginia. This was the last great event of the
      Revolutionary contest. King George and his ministers perceived that all
      the might of England could not compel America to renew her allegiance to
      the crown. After a great deal of discussion, a treaty of peace was signed
      in September, 1783.

“Now, at last,” said Grandfather, “after weary years of war, the regiments
      of Massachusetts returned in peace to their families. Now the stately and
      dignified leaders, such as General Lincoln and General Knox, with their
      powdered hair and their uniforms of blue and buff, were seen moving about
      the streets.”

“And little boys ran after them, I suppose,” remarked Charley; “and the
      grown people bowed respectfully.”

“They deserved respect; for they were good men as well as brave,” answered
      Grandfather. “Now, too, the inferior officers and privates came home to
      seek some peaceful occupation. Their friends remembered them as slender
      and smooth-checked young men; but they returned with the erect and rigid
      mien of disciplined soldiers. Some hobbled on crutches and wooden legs;
      others had received wounds, which were still rankling in their breasts.
      Many, alas! had fallen in battle, and perhaps were left unburied on the
      bloody field.”

“One would have thought so,” said Grandfather. “Yet only two or three
      years elapsed before the folly of some misguided men caused another
      mustering of soldiers. This affair was called Shays’s war, because a
      Captain Shays was the chief leader of the insurgents.”

Grandfather comforted his dear little girl by assuring her that there was
      no great mischief done. Shays’s war happened in the latter part of 1786
      and the beginning of the following year. Its principal cause was the
      badness of times. The State of Massachusetts, in its public capacity, was
      very much in debt. So likewise were many of the people. An insurrection
      took place, the object of which seems to have been to interrupt the course
      of law and get rid of debts and taxes.

James Bowdoin, a good and able man, was now governor of Massachusetts. He
      sent General Lincoln, at the head of four thousand men, to put down the
      insurrection. This general, who had fought through several hard campaigns
      in the Revolution, managed matters like an old soldier, and totally
      defeated the rebels at the expense of very little blood.

“There is but one more public event to be recorded in the history of our
      chair,” proceeded Grandfather. “In the year 1794 Samuel Adams was elected
      governor of Massachusetts. I have told you what a distinguished patriot he
      was, and how much he resembled the stern old Puritans. Could the ancient
      freemen of Massachusetts who lived in the days of the first charter have
      arisen from their graves, they would probably have voted for Samuel Adams
      to be governor.”

“He did,” replied Grandfather. “He had long been in the habit of visiting
      the barber’s shop, where our venerable chair, philosophically forgetful of
      its former dignities, had now spent nearly eighteen not uncomfortable
      years. Such a remarkable piece of furniture, so evidently a relic of
      long-departed times, could not escape the notice of Samuel Adams. He made
      minute researches into its history, and ascertained what a succession of
      excellent and famous people had occupied it.”

“How did he find it out?” asked Charley; “for I suppose the chair could
      not tell its own history.”

“There used to be a vast collection of ancient letters and other documents
      in the tower of the Old South Church,” answered Grandfather. “Perhaps the
      history of our chair was contained among these. At all events, Samuel
      Adams appears to have been well acquainted with it. When he became
      governor, he felt that he could have no more honorable seat than that
      which had been the ancient chair of state. He therefore purchased it for a
      trifle, and filled it worthily for three years as governor of
      Massachusetts.” “And what next?” asked Charley.

“That is all,” said Grandfather, heaving a sigh; for he could not help
      being a little sad at the thought that his stories must close here.
      “Samuel Adams died in 1803, at the age of above threescore and ten. He was
      a great patriot, but a poor man. At his death he left scarcely property
      enough to pay the expenses of his funeral. This precious chair, among his
      other effects, was sold at auction; and your Grandfather, who was then in
      the strength of his years, became the purchaser.”

Laurence, with a mind full of thoughts that struggled for expression, but
      could find none, looked steadfastly at the chair.

“Oh, how I wish that the chair could speak!” cried he. “After its long
      intercourse with mankind,—after looking upon the world for ages,—what
      lessons of golden wisdom it might utter! It might teach a private person
      how to lead a good and happy life, or a statesman how to make his country
      prosperous.”

GRANDFATHER was struck by Laurence’s idea that the historic chair should
      utter a voice, and thus pour forth the collected wisdom of two centuries.
      The old gentleman had once possessed no inconsiderable share of fancy; and
      even now its fading sunshine occasionally glimmered among his more sombre
      reflections.

As the history of his chair had exhausted all his facts, Grandfather
      determined to have recourse to fable. So, after warning the children that
      they must not mistake this story for a true one, he related what we shall
      call Grandfather’s Dream.

Laurence and Clara, where were you last night? Where were you, Charley,
      and dear little Alice? You had all gone to rest, and left old Grandfather
      to meditate alone in his great chair. The lamp had grown so dim that its
      light hardly illuminated the alabaster shade. The wood-fire had crumbled
      into heavy embers, among which the little flames danced, and quivered, and
      sported about like fairies.

And here sat Grandfather all by himself. He knew that it was bedtime; yet
      he could not help longing to hear your merry voices, or to hold a
      comfortable chat with some old friend; because then his pillow would be
      visited by pleasant dreams. But, as neither children nor friends were at
      hand, Grandfather leaned back in the great chair and closed his eyes, for
      the sake of meditating more profoundly.

And, when Grandfather’s meditations had grown very profound indeed, he
      fancied that he heard a sound over his head, as if somebody were preparing
      to speak.

As Grandfather did not know that any person was in the room, he started up
      in great surprise, and peeped hither and thither, behind the chair, and
      into the recess by the fireside, and at the dark nook yonder near the
      bookcase. Nobody could be seen.

But, just as he was going to resume his seat, Grandfather happened to look
      at the great chair. The rays of firelight were flickering upon it in such
      a manner that it really seemed as if its oaken frame were all alive. What!
      did it not move its elbow? There, too! It certainly lifted one of its
      ponderous fore legs, as if it had a notion of drawing itself a little
      nearer to the fire. Meanwhile the lion’s head nodded at Grandfather with
      as polite and sociable a look as a lion’s visage, carved in oak, could
      possibly be expected to assume. Well, this is strange!

“Good evening, my old friend,” said the dry and husky voice, now a little
      clearer than before. “We have been intimately acquainted so long that I
      think it high time we have a chat together.”

Grandfather was looking straight at the lion’s head, and could not be
      mistaken in supposing that it moved its lips. So here the mystery was all
      explained.

“I was not aware,” said Grandfather, with a civil salutation to his oaken
      companion, “that you possessed the faculty of speech. Otherwise I should
      often have been glad to converse with such a solid, useful, and
      substantial if not brilliant member of society.”

“Oh!” replied the ancient chair, in a quiet and easy tone, for it had now
      cleared its throat of the dust of ages, “I am naturally a silent and
      incommunicative sort of character. Once or twice in the course of a
      century I unclose my lips. When the gentle Lady Arbella departed this life
      I uttered a groan. When the honest mint-master weighed his plump daughter
      against the pine-tree shillings I chuckled audibly at the joke. When old
      Simon Bradstreet took the place of the tyrant Andros I joined in the
      general huzza, and capered on my wooden legs for joy. To be sure, the
      by-standers were so fully occupied with their own feelings that my
      sympathy was quite unnoticed.”

“Not often,” answered the chair. “I once talked with Sir William Phips,
      and communicated my ideas about the witchcraft delusion. Cotton Mather had
      several conversations with me, and derived great benefit from my
      historical reminiscences. In the days of the Stamp Act I whispered in the
      ear of Hutchinson, bidding him to remember what stock his countrymen were
      descended of, and to think whether the spirit of their forefathers had
      utterly departed from them. The last man whom I favored with a colloquy
      was that stout old republican, Samuel Adams.”

“And how happens it,” inquired Grandfather, “that there is no record nor
      tradition of your conversational abilities? It is an uncommon thing to
      meet with a chair that can talk.”

“Why, to tell you the truth,” said the chair, giving itself a hitch nearer
      to the hearth, “I am not apt to choose the most suitable moments for
      unclosing my lips. Sometimes I have inconsiderately begun to speak, when
      my occupant, lolling back in my arms, was inclined to take an after-dinner
      nap. Or perhaps the impulse to talk may be felt at midnight, when the lamp
      burns dim and the fire crumbles into decay, and the studious or thoughtful
      man finds that his brain is in a mist. Oftenest I have unwisely uttered my
      wisdom in the ears of sick persons, when the inquietude of fever made them
      toss about upon my cushion. And so it happens, that though my words make a
      pretty strong impression at the moment, yet my auditors invariably
      remember them only as a dream. I should not wonder if you, my excellent
      friend, were to do the same to-morrow morning.”

“Nor I either,” thought Grandfather to himself. However, he thanked this
      respectable old chair for beginning the conversation, and begged to know
      whether it had anything particular to communicate.

“I have been listening attentively to your narrative of my adventures,”
       replied the chair; “and it must be owned that your correctness entitles
      you to be held up as a pattern to biographers. Nevertheless, there are a
      few omissions which I should be glad to see supplied. For instance, you
      make no mention of the good knight Sir Richard Saltonstall, nor of the
      famous Hugh Peters, nor of those old regicide judges, Whalley, Goffe, and
      Dixwell. Yet I have borne the weight of all those distinguished characters
      at one time or another.”

Grandfather promised amendment if ever he should have an opportunity to
      repeat his narrative. The good old chair, which still seemed to retain a
      due regard for outward appearance, then reminded him how long a time had
      passed since it had been provided with a new cushion. It likewise
      expressed the opinion that the oaken figures on its back would show to
      much better advantage by the aid of a little varnish.

“And I have had a complaint in this joint,” continued the chair,
      endeavoring to lift one of its legs, “ever since Charley trundled his
      wheelbarrow against me.”

“And now, venerable chair, I have a favor to solicit. During an existence
      of more than two centuries you have had a familiar intercourse with men
      who were esteemed the wisest of their day. Doubtless, with your capacious
      understanding, you have treasured up many an invaluable lesson of wisdom.
      You certainly have had time enough to guess the riddle of life. Tell us,
      poor mortals, then, how we may be happy.”

The lion’s head fixed its eyes thoughtfully upon the fire, and the whole
      chair assumed an aspect of deep meditation. Finally it beckoned to
      Grandfather with its elbow, and made a step sideways towards him, as if it
      had a very important secret to communicate.

“As long as I have stood in the midst of human affairs,” said the chair,
      with a very oracular enunciation, “I have constantly observed that
      Justice, Truth, and Love are the chief ingredients of every happy life.”

“Justice, Truth, and Love!” exclaimed Grandfather. “We need not exist two
      centuries to find out that these qualities are essential to our happiness.
      This is no secret. Every human being is born with the instinctive
      knowledge of it.”

“Ah!” cried the chair, drawing back in surprise. “From what I have
      observed of the dealings of man with man, and nation with nation, I never
      should have suspected that they knew this all-important secret. And, with
      this eternal lesson written in your soul, do you ask me to sift new wisdom
      for you out of my petty existence of two or three centuries?”

“Not a word more,” interrupted the chair; “here I close my lips for the
      next hundred years. At the end of that period, if I shall have discovered
      any new precepts of happiness better than what Heaven has already taught
      you, they shall assuredly be given to the world.”

In the energy of its utterance the oaken chair seemed to stamp its foot,
      and trod (we hope unintentionally) upon Grandfather’s toe. The old
      gentleman started, and found that he had been asleep in the great chair,
      and that his heavy walking-stick had fallen down across his foot.

“Grandfather,” cried little Alice, clapping her hand, “you must dream a
      new dream every night about our chair!”

Laurence, and Clara, and Charley said the same. But the good old gentleman
      shook his head, and declared that here ended the history, real or
      fabulous, of GRANDFATHER’S CHAIR.

MY DEAR SIR, I came from my house at Milton, the 26 in the morning. After
      dinner it was whispered in town there would be a mob at night, and that
      Paxton, Hallowell, the custom-house, and admiralty officers’ houses would
      be attacked; but my friends assured me that the rabble were satisfied with
      the insult I had received and that I was become rather popular. In the
      evening, whilst I was at supper and my children round me, somebody ran in
      and said the mob were coming. I directed my children to fly to a secure
      place, and shut up my house as I had done before, intending not to quit
      it; but my eldest daughter repented her leaving me, hastened back, and
      protested she would not quit the house unless I did. I could n’t stand
      against this, and withdrew with her to a neighboring house, where I had
      been but a few minutes before the hellish crew fell upon my house with the
      rage of devils, and in a moment with axes split down the doors and
      entered. My son being in the great entry heard them cry: “Damn him, he is
      upstairs, we’ll have him.” Some ran immediately as high as the top of the
      house, others filled the rooms below and cellars, and others remained
      without the house to be employed there.

Messages soon came one after another to the house where I was, to inform
      me the mob were coming in pursuit of me, and I was obliged to retire
      through yards and gardens to a house more remote, where I remained until 4
      o’clock, by which time one of the best finished houses in the Province had
      nothing remaining but the bare walls and floors. Not contented with
      tearing off all the wainscot and hangings, and splitting the doors to
      pieces, they beat down the partition walls; and although that alone cost
      them near two hours, they cut down the cupola or lanthorn, and they began
      to take the slate and boards from the roof, and were prevented only by the
      approaching daylight from a total demolition of the building. The
      garden-house was laid flat, and all my trees, etc., broke down to the
      ground.

Such ruin was never seen in America. Besides my plate and family pictures,
      household furniture of every kind, my own, my children’s, and servants’ 
      apparel, they carried off about Â£900 sterling in money, and emptied the
      house of everything whatsoever, except a part of the kitchen furniture,
      not leaving a single book or paper in it, and have scattered or destroyed
      all the manuscripts and other papers I had been collecting for thirty
      years together, besides a great number of public papers in my custody. The
      evening being warm, I had undressed me and put on a thin camlet surtout
      over my waistcoat. The next morning, the weather being changed, I had not
      clothes enough in my possession to defend me from the cold, and was
      obliged to borrow from my friends. Many articles of clothing and a good
      part of my plate have since been picked up in different quarters of the
      town, lint the furniture in general was cut to pieces before it was thrown
      out of the house, and most of the beds cut open, and the feathers thrown
      out of the windows. The next evening, I intended with my children to
      Milton, but meeting two or three small parties of the ruffians, who I
      suppose had concealed themselves in the country, and my coachman hearing
      one of them say, “There he is!” my daughters were terrified and said they
      should never be safe, and I was forced to shelter them that night at the
      Castle.

The encouragers of the first mob never intended matters should go this
      length, and the people in general expressed the utter detestation of this
      unparalleled outrage, and I wish they could be convinced what infinite
      hazard there is of the most terrible consequences from such demons, when
      they are let loose in a government where there is not constant authority
      at hand sufficient to suppress them. I am told the government here will
      make me a compensation for my own and my family’s loss, which I think
      cannot be much less than Â£3,000 sterling. I am not sure that they will. If
      they should not, it will be too heavy for me, and I must humbly apply to
      his majesty in whose service I am a sufferer; but this, and a much greater
      sum would be an insufficient compensation for the constant distress and
      anxiety of mind I have felt for some time past, and must feel for months
      to come. You cannot conceive the wretched state we are in. Such is the
      resentment of the people against the Stamp-Duty, that there can be no
      dependence upon the General Court to take any steps to enforce, or rather
      advise, to the payment of it. On the other hand, such will be the effects
      of not submitting to it, that all trade must cease, all courts fall, and
      all authority be at an end. Must not the ministry be excessively
      embarrassed? On the one hand, it will be said, if concessions are made,
      the Parliament endanger the loss of their authority over the Colony: on
      the other hand, if external forces should be used, there seems to be
      danger of a total lasting alienation of affection. Is there no
      alternative? May the infinitely wise God direct you.' WHERE id = 'cc6b25c3-51f9-4ae7-87ed-800191fdcd0d';
