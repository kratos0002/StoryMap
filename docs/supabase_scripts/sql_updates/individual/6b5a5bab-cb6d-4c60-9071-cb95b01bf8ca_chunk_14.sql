      resolved to renounce forever all that makes the rest of us love life—all
      that consoles and sustains us? What is it that drove you, impelled you, to
      separate yourself from the great natural path of marriage and the family?
      You are neither an enthusiast nor a fanatic, neither a gloomy person nor a
      sad person. Was it some incident, some sorrow, that led you to take life
      vows?”

The Abbe Mauduit rose and approached the fire, then, holding toward the
      flame his big shoes, such as country priests generally wear, he seemed
      still hesitating as to what reply he should make.

He was a tall old man with white hair, and for the last twenty years had
      been pastor of the parish of Saint-Antoine-du-Rocher. The peasants said of
      him: “There''s a good man for you!” And indeed he was a good
      man, benevolent, friendly to all, gentle, and, to crown all, generous.
      Like Saint Martin, he would have cut his cloak in two. He laughed readily,
      and wept also, on slight provocation, just like a woman—which
      prejudiced him more or less in the hard minds of the country folk.

The old Comtesse de Saville, living in retirement in her chateau of
      Rocher, in order to bring up her grandchildren, after the successive
      deaths of her son and her daughter-in-law, was very much attached to her
      cure, and used to say of him: “What a heart he has!”

He came every Thursday to spend the evening with the comtesse, and they
      were close friends, with the frank and honest friendship of old people.

He repeated: “I was not made for ordinary life. I saw it fortunately
      in time, and I have had many proofs since that I made no mistake on the
      point:

“My parents, who were mercers in Verdiers, and were quite well to
      do, had great ambitions for me. They sent me to a boarding school while I
      was very young. No one knows what a boy may suffer at school through the
      mere fact of separation, of isolation. This monotonous life without
      affection is good for some, and detestable for others. Young people are
      often more sensitive than one supposes, and by shutting them up thus too
      soon, far from those they love, we may develop to an exaggerated extent a
      sensitiveness which is overwrought and may become sickly and dangerous.

“I scarcely ever played; I had no companions; I passed my hours in
      homesickness; I spent the whole night weeping in my bed. I sought to bring
      before my mind recollections of home, trifling memories of little things,
      little events. I thought incessantly of all I had left behind there. I
      became almost imperceptibly an over-sensitive youth to whom the slightest
      annoyances were terrible griefs.

“In this way I remained taciturn, self-absorbed, without expansion,
      without confidants. This mental excitement was going on secretly and
      surely. The nerves of children are quickly affected, and one should see to
      it that they live a tranquil life until they are almost fully developed.
      But who ever reflects that, for certain boys, an unjust imposition may be
      as great a pang as the death of a friend in later years? Who can explain
      why certain young temperaments are liable to terrible emotions for the
      slightest cause, and may eventually become morbid and incurable?

“This was my case. This faculty of regret developed in me to such an
      extent that my existence became a martyrdom.

“I did not speak about it; I said nothing about it; but gradually I
      became so sensitive that my soul resembled an open wound. Everything that
      affected me gave me painful twitchings, frightful shocks, and consequently
      impaired my health. Happy are the men whom nature has buttressed with
      indifference and armed with stoicism.

“I reached my sixteenth year. An excessive timidity had arisen from
      this abnormal sensitiveness. Feeling myself unprotected from all the
      attacks of chance or fate, I feared every contact, every approach, every
      current. I lived as though I were threatened by an unknown and always
      expected misfortune. I did not venture either to speak or do anything in
      public. I had, indeed, the feeling that life, is a battle, a dreadful
      conflict in which one receives terrible blows, grievous, mortal wounds. In
      place of cherishing, like all men, a cheerful anticipation of the morrow,
      I had only a confused fear of it, and felt in my own mind a desire to
      conceal myself to avoid that combat in which I would be vanquished and
      slain.

“As soon as my studies were finished, they gave me six months'' time
      to choose a career. A very simple occurrence showed me clearly, all of a
      sudden, the diseased condition of my mind, made me understand the danger,
      and determined me to flee from it.

“Verdiers is a little town surrounded with plains and woods. In the
      central street stands my parents'' house. I now passed my days far from
      this dwelling which I had so much regretted, so much desired. Dreams had
      reawakened in me, and I walked alone in the fields in order to let them
      escape and fly away. My father and mother, quite occupied with business,
      and anxious about my future, talked to me only about their profits or
      about my possible plans. They were fond of me after the manner of
      hardheaded, practical people; they had more reason than heart in their
      affection for me. I lived imprisoned in my thoughts, and vibrating with my
      eternal sensitiveness.

“Now, one evening, after a long walk, as I was making my way home
      with great strides so as not to be late, I saw a dog trotting toward me.
      He was a species of red spaniel, very lean, with long curly ears.

“When he was ten paces away from me he stopped. I did the same. Then
      he began wagging his tail, and came over to me with short steps and
      nervous movements of his whole body, bending down on his paws as if
      appealing to me, and softly shaking his head. I spoke to him. He then
      began to crawl along in such a sad, humble, suppliant manner that I felt
      the tears coming into my eyes. I approached him; he ran away, then he came
      back again; and I bent down on one knee trying to coax him to approach me,
      with soft words. At last, he was within reach of my hands, and I gently
      and very carefully stroked him.

“He gained courage, gradually rose and, placing his paws on my
      shoulders, began to lick my face. He followed me to the house.

“This was really the first being I had passionately loved, because
      he returned my affection. My attachment to this animal was certainly
      exaggerated and ridiculous. It seemed to me in a confused sort of way that
      we were two brothers, lost on this earth, and therefore isolated and
      without defense, one as well as the other. He never again quitted my side.
      He slept at the foot of my bed, ate at the table in spite of the
      objections of my parents, and followed me in my solitary walks.

“I often stopped at the side of a ditch, and sat down in the grass.
      Sam immediately rushed up, lay down at my feet, and lifted up my hand with
      his muzzle that I might caress him.

“One day toward the end of June, as we were on the road from
      Saint-Pierre de Chavrol, I saw the diligence from Pavereau coming along.
      Its four horses were going at a gallop, with its yellow body, and its
      imperial with the black leather hood. The coachman cracked his whip; a
      cloud of dust rose up under the wheels of the heavy vehicle, then floated
      behind, just as a cloud would do.

“Suddenly, as the vehicle came close to me, Sam, perhaps frightened
      by the noise and wishing to join me, jumped in front of it. A horse''s hoof
      knocked him down. I saw him roll over, turn round, fall back again beneath
      the horses'' feet, then the coach gave two jolts, and behind it I saw
      something quivering in the dust on the road. He was nearly cut in two; all
      his intestines were hanging out and blood was spurting from the wound. He
      tried to get up, to walk, but he could only move his two front paws, and
      scratch the ground with them, as if to make a hole. The two others were
      already dead. And he howled dreadfully, mad with pain.

“He died in a few minutes. I cannot describe how much I felt and
      suffered. I was confined to my room for a month.

“One night, my father, enraged at seeing me so affected by such a
      trifling occurrence, exclaimed:

“His words haunted me and I began to see my condition clearly. I
      understood why all the small miseries of each day assumed in my eyes the
      importance of a catastrophe; I saw that I was organized in such a way that
      I suffered dreadfully from everything, that every painful impression was
      multiplied by my diseased sensibility, and an atrocious fear of life took
      possession of me. I was without passions, without ambitions; I resolved to
      sacrifice possible joys in order to avoid sure sorrows. Existence is
      short, but I made up my mind to spend it in the service of others, in
      relieving their troubles and enjoying their happiness. Having no direct
      experience of either one or the other, I should only experience a milder
      form of emotion.

“And if you only knew how, in spite of this, misery tortures me,
      ravages me! But what would formerly have been an intolerable affliction
      has become commiseration, pity.

“These sorrows which cross my path at every moment, I could not
      endure if they affected me directly. I could not have seen one of my
      children die without dying myself. And I have, in spite of everything,
      preserved such a mysterious, overwhelming fear of events that the sight of
      the postman entering my house makes a shiver pass every day through my
      veins, and yet I have nothing to be afraid of now.”

The Abbe Mauduit ceased speaking. He stared into the fire in the huge
      grate, as if he saw there mysterious things, all the unknown of the
      existence he might have passed had he been more fearless in the face of
      suffering.

As the servants were asleep in the kitchen, she accompanied him herself to
      the door, which looked out on the garden, and she saw his tall shadow, lit
      up by the reflection of the lamp, disappearing through the gloom of night.

Then she came back and sat down before the fire, and pondered over many
      things we never think of when we are young.

She had been brought up in one of those families who live entirely to
      themselves, apart from all the rest of the world. Such families know
      nothing of political events, although they are discussed at table; for
      changes in the Government take place at such a distance from them that
      they are spoken of as one speaks of a historical event, such as the death
      of Louis XVI or the landing of Napoleon.

Customs are modified in course of time, fashions succeed one another, but
      such variations are taken no account of in the placid family circle where
      traditional usages prevail year after year. And if some scandalous episode
      or other occurs in the neighborhood, the disreputable story dies a natural
      death when it reaches the threshold of the house. The father and mother
      may, perhaps, exchange a few words on the subject when alone together some
      evening, but they speak in hushed tones—for even walls have ears.
      The father says, with bated breath:

The children suspected nothing, and arrive in their turn at years of
      discretion with eyes and mind blindfolded, ignorant of the real side of
      life, not knowing that people do not think as they speak, and do not speak
      as they act; or aware that they should live at war, or at all events, in a
      state of armed peace, with the rest of mankind; not suspecting the fact
      that the simple are always deceived, the sincere made sport of, the good
      maltreated.

Some go on till the day of their death in this blind probity and loyalty
      and honor, so pure-minded that nothing can open their eyes.

Others, undeceived, but without fully understanding, make mistakes, are
      dismayed, and become desperate, believing themselves the playthings of a
      cruel fate, the wretched victims of adverse circumstances, and
      exceptionally wicked men.

The Savignols married their daughter Bertha at the age of eighteen. She
      wedded a young Parisian, George Baron by name, who had dealings on the
      Stock Exchange. He was handsome, well-mannered, and apparently all that
      could be desired. But in the depths of his heart he somewhat despised his
      old-fashioned parents-in-law, whom he spoke of among his intimates as
      “my dear old fossils.”

She became one of those provincial Parisians whose name is legion. She
      remained in complete ignorance of the great city, of its social side, its
      pleasures and its customs—just as she remained ignorant also of
      life, its perfidy and its mysteries.

Devoted to her house, she knew scarcely anything beyond her own street;
      and when she ventured into another part of Paris it seemed to her that she
      had accomplished a long and arduous journey into some unknown, unexplored
      city. She would then say to her husband in the evening:

Two or three times a year her husband took her to the theatre. These were
      events the remembrance of which never grew dim; they provided subjects of
      conversation for long afterward.

Her friends were limited to two families related to her own. She spoke of
      them as “the Martinets” and “the Michelins.”

Her husband lived as he pleased, coming home when it suited him —sometimes
      not until dawn—alleging business, but not putting himself out
      overmuch to account for his movements, well aware that no suspicion would
      ever enter his wife''s guileless soul.

She was thunderstruck—too simple-minded to understand the infamy of
      unsigned information and to despise the letter, the writer of which
      declared himself inspired by interest in her happiness, hatred of evil,
      and love of truth.

This missive told her that her husband had had for two years past, a
      sweetheart, a young widow named Madame Rosset, with whom he spent all his
      evenings.

Bertha knew neither how to dissemble her grief nor how to spy on her
      husband. When he came in for lunch she threw the letter down before him,
      burst into tears, and fled to her room.

He had time to take in the situation and to prepare his reply. He knocked
      at his wife''s door. She opened it at once, but dared not look at him. He
      smiled, sat down, drew her to his knee, and in a tone of light raillery
      began:

“My dear child, as a matter of fact, I have a friend named Madame
      Rosset, whom I have known for the last ten years, and of whom I have a
      very high opinion. I may add that I know scores of other people whose
      names I have never mentioned to you, seeing that you do not care for
      society, or fresh acquaintances, or functions of any sort. But, to make
      short work of such vile accusations as this, I want you to put on your
      things after lunch, and we''ll go together and call on this lady, who will
      very soon become a friend of yours, too, I am quite sure.”

She embraced her husband warmly, and, moved by that feminine spirit of
      curiosity which will not be lulled once it is aroused, consented to go and
      see this unknown widow, of whom she was, in spite of everything, just the
      least bit jealous. She felt instinctively that to know a danger is to be
      already armed against it.

She entered a small, tastefully furnished flat on the fourth floor of an
      attractive house. After waiting five minutes in a drawing-room rendered
      somewhat dark by its many curtains and hangings, a door opened, and a very
      dark, short, rather plump young woman appeared, surprised and smiling.

The young widow uttered a half-suppressed cry of astonishment and joy, and
      ran forward with hands outstretched. She had not hoped, she said, to have
      this pleasure, knowing that Madame Baron never saw any one, but she was
      delighted to make her acquaintance. She was so fond of George (she said
      “George” in a familiar, sisterly sort of way) that, she had
      been most anxious to know his young wife and to make friends with her,
      too.

By the end of a month the two new friends were inseparable. They saw each
      other every day, sometimes twice a day, and dined together every evening,
      sometimes at one house, sometimes at the other. George no longer deserted
      his home, no longer talked of pressing business. He adored his own
      fireside, he said.

When, after a time, a flat in the house where Madame Rosset lived became
      vacant Madame Baron hastened to take it, in order to be near her friend
      and spend even more time with her than hitherto.

And for two whole years their friendship was without a cloud, a friendship
      of heart and mind—absolute, tender, devoted. Bertha could hardly
      speak without bringing in Julie''s name. To her Madame Rosset represented
      perfection.

But Madame Rosset fell ill. Bertha hardly left her side. She spent her
      nights with her, distracted with grief; even her husband seemed
      inconsolable.

One morning the doctor, after leaving the invalid''s bedside, took George
      and his wife aside, and told them that he considered Julie''s condition
      very grave.

As soon as he had gone the grief-stricken husband and wife sat down
      opposite each other and gave way to tears. That night they both sat up
      with the patient. Bertha tenderly kissed her friend from time to time,
      while George stood at the foot of the bed, his eyes gazing steadfastly on
      the invalid''s face.

But toward evening she declared she felt better, and insisted that her
      friends should go back to their own apartment to dinner.

They were sitting sadly in the dining-room, scarcely even attempting to
      eat, when the maid gave George a note. He opened it, turned pale as death,
      and, rising from the table, said to his wife in a constrained voice:

“Wait for me. I must leave you a moment. I shall be back in ten
      minutes. Don''t go away on any account.”

Bertha waited for him, a prey to fresh anxiety. But, docile in everything,
      she would not go back to her friend till he returned.

At length, as he did not reappear, it occurred to her to visit his room
      and see if he had taken his gloves. This would show whether or not he had
      had a call to make.

She saw them at the first glance. Beside them lay a crumpled paper,
      evidently thrown down in haste.

And a burning temptation, the first that had ever assailed her urged her
      to read it and discover the cause of her husband''s abrupt departure. Her
      rebellious conscience protested but a devouring and fearful curiosity
      prevailed. She seized the paper, smoothed it out, recognized the
      tremulous, penciled writing as Julie''s, and read:

At first she did not understand, the idea of Julie''s death being her
      uppermost thought. But all at once the true meaning of what she read burst
      in a flash upon her; this penciled note threw a lurid light upon her whole
      existence, revealed the whole infamous truth, all the treachery and
      perfidy of which she had been the victim. She understood the long years of
      deceit, the way in which she had been made their puppet. She saw them
      again, sitting side by side in the evening, reading by lamplight out of
      the same book, glancing at each other at the end of each page.

And her poor, indignant, suffering, bleeding heart was cast into the
      depths of a despair which knew no bounds.

He mourned her openly, shamelessly, indifferent to the sorrow of the wife
      who no longer spoke to him, no longer looked at him; who passed her life
      in solitude, hedged round with disgust, with indignant anger, and praying
      night and day to God.

They still lived in the same house, however, and sat opposite each other
      at table, in silence and despair.

For a whole year they remained as complete strangers to each other as if
      they had never met. Bertha nearly lost her reason.

At last one morning she went out very early, and returned about eight
      o''clock bearing in her hands an enormous bouquet of white roses. And she
      sent word to her husband that she wanted to speak to him. He came-anxious
      and uneasy.

“We are going out together,” she said. “Please carry
      these flowers; they are too heavy for me.”

A carriage took them to the gate of the cemetery, where they alighted.
      Then, her eyes filling with tears, she said to George:

He trembled, and could not understand her motive; but he led the way,
      still carrying the flowers. At last he stopped before a white marble slab,
      to which he pointed without a word.

She took the bouquet from him, and, kneeling down, placed it on the grave.
      Then she offered up a silent, heartfelt prayer.

With the first day of spring, when the awakening earth puts on its garment
      of green, and the warm, fragrant air fans our faces and fills our lungs
      and appears even to penetrate to our hearts, we experience a vague,
      undefined longing for freedom, for happiness, a desire to run, to wander
      aimlessly, to breathe in the spring. The previous winter having been
      unusually severe, this spring feeling was like a form of intoxication in
      May, as if there were an overabundant supply of sap.

One morning on waking I saw from my window the blue sky glowing in the sun
      above the neighboring houses. The canaries hanging in the windows were
      singing loudly, and so were the servants on every floor; a cheerful noise
      rose up from the streets, and I went out, my spirits as bright as the day,
      to go—I did not exactly know where. Everybody I met seemed to be
      smiling; an air of happiness appeared to pervade everything in the warm
      light of returning spring. One might almost have said that a breeze of
      love was blowing through the city, and the sight of the young women whom I
      saw in the streets in their morning toilets, in the depths of whose eyes
      there lurked a hidden tenderness, and who walked with languid grace,
      filled my heart with agitation.

Without knowing how or why, I found myself on the banks of the Seine.
      Steamboats were starting for Suresnes, and suddenly I was seized by an
      unconquerable desire to take a walk through the woods. The deck of the
      Mouche was covered with passengers, for the sun in early spring draws one
      out of the house, in spite of themselves, and everybody moves about, goes
      and comes and talks to his neighbor.

I had a girl neighbor; a little work-girl, no doubt, who possessed the
      true Parisian charm: a little head, with light curly hair, which looked
      like a shimmer of light as it danced in the wind, came down to her ears,
      and descended to the nape of her neck, where it became such fine,
      light-colored clown that one could scarcely see it, but felt an
      irresistible desire to shower kisses on it.

Under my persistent gaze, she turned her head toward me, and then
      immediately looked down, while a slight crease at the side of her mouth,
      that was ready to break out into a smile, also showed a fine, silky, pale
      down which the sun was gilding a little.

The calm river grew wider; the atmosphere was warm and perfectly still,
      but a murmur of life seemed to fill all space.

My neighbor raised her eyes again, and this time, as I was still looking
      at her, she smiled decidedly. She was charming, and in her passing glance
      I saw a thousand things, which I had hitherto been ignorant of, for I
      perceived unknown depths, all the charm of tenderness, all the poetry
      which we dream of, all the happiness which we are continually in search
      of. I felt an insane longing to open my arms and to carry her off
      somewhere, so as to whisper the sweet music of words of love into her
      ears.

I was just about to address her when somebody touched me on the shoulder,
      and as I turned round in some surprise, I saw an ordinary-looking man, who
      was neither young nor old, and who gazed at me sadly.

“Monsieur, when winter comes, with its cold, wet and snowy weather,
      your doctor says to you constantly: ''Keep your feet warm, guard against
      chills, colds, bronchitis, rheumatism and pleurisy.''

“Then you are very careful, you wear flannel, a heavy greatcoat and
      thick shoes, but all this does not prevent you from passing two months in
      bed. But when spring returns, with its leaves and flowers, its warm, soft
      breezes and its smell of the fields, all of which causes you vague
      disquiet and causeless emotion, nobody says to you:

“''Monsieur, beware of love! It is lying in ambush everywhere; it is
      watching for you at every corner; all its snares are laid, all its weapons
      are sharpened, all its guiles are prepared! Beware of love! Beware of
      love! It is more dangerous than brandy, bronchitis or pleurisy! It never
      forgives and makes everybody commit irreparable follies.''

“Yes, monsieur, I say that the French Government ought to put large
      public notices on the walls, with these words: ''Return of spring. French
      citizens, beware of love!'' just as they put: ''Beware of paint:

“However, as the government will not do this, I must supply its
      place, and I say to you: ''Beware of love!'' for it is just going to seize
      you, and it is my duty to inform you of it, just as in Russia they inform
      any one that his nose is frozen.”

“Really, monsieur, you appear to me to be interfering in a matter
      which is no concern of yours.”

“Ah! monsieur, monsieur! If I see that a man is in danger of being
      drowned at a dangerous spot, ought I to let him perish? So just listen to
      my story and you will see why I ventured to speak to you like this.

“It was about this time last year that it occurred. But, first of
      all, I must tell you that I am a clerk in the Admiralty, where our chiefs,
      the commissioners, take their gold lace as quill-driving officials
      seriously, and treat us like forecastle men on board a ship. Well, from my
      office I could see a small bit of blue sky and the swallows, and I felt
      inclined to dance among my portfolios.

“My yearning for freedom grew so intense that, in spite of my
      repugnance, I went to see my chief, a short, bad-tempered man, who was
      always in a rage. When I told him that I was not well, he looked at me and
      said: ''I do not believe it, monsieur, but be off with you! Do you think
      that any office can go on with clerks like you?'' I started at once and
      went down the Seine. It was a day like this, and I took the Mouche, to go
      as far as Saint Cloud. Ah! what a good thing it would have been if my
      chief had refused me permission to leave the office that day!

“I seemed to myself to expand in the sun. I loved everything—the
      steamer, the river, the trees, the houses and my fellow-passengers. I felt
      inclined to kiss something, no matter what; it was love, laying its snare.
      Presently, at the Trocadero, a girl, with a small parcel in her hand, came
      on board and sat down opposite me. She was decidedly pretty, but it is
      surprising, monsieur, how much prettier women seem to us when the day is
      fine at the beginning of the spring. Then they have an intoxicating charm,
      something quite peculiar about them. It is just like drinking wine after
      cheese.

“I looked at her and she also looked at me, but only occasionally,
      as that girl did at you, just now; but at last, by dint of looking at each
      other constantly, it seemed to me that we knew each other well enough to
      enter into conversation, and I spoke to her and she replied. She was
      decidedly pretty and nice and she intoxicated me, monsieur!

“She got out at Saint-Cloud, and I followed her. She went and
      delivered her parcel, and when she returned the boat had just started. I
      walked by her side, and the warmth of the ''air made us both sigh. ''It
      would be very nice in the woods,'' I said. ''Indeed, it would!'' she replied.
      ''Shall we go there for a walk, mademoiselie?''

“She gave me a quick upward look, as if to see exactly what I was
      like, and then, after a little hesitation, she accepted my proposal, and
      soon we were there, walking side by side. Under the foliage, which was
      still rather scanty, the tall, thick, bright green grass was inundated by
      the sun, and the air was full of insects that were also making love to one
      another, and birds were singing in all directions. My companion began to
      jump and to run, intoxicated by the air and the smell of the country, and
      I ran and jumped, following her example. How silly we are at times,
      monsieur!

“Then she sang unrestrainedly a thousand things, opera airs and the
      song of Musette! The song of Musette! How poetical it seemed to me, then!
      I almost cried over it. Ah! Those silly songs make us lose our heads; and,
      believe me, never marry a woman who sings in the country, especially if
      she sings the song of Musette!

“She soon grew tired, and sat down on a grassy slope, and I sat at
      her feet and took her hands, her little hands, that were so marked with
      the needle, and that filled me with emotion. I said to myself:

“''These are the sacred marks of toil.'' Oh! monsieur, do you know
      what those sacred marks of toil mean? They mean all the gossip of the
      workroom, the whispered scandal, the mind soiled by all the filth that is
      talked; they mean lost chastity, foolish chatter, all the wretchedness of
      their everyday life, all the narrowness of ideas which belongs to women of
      the lower orders, combined to their fullest extent in the girl whose
      fingers bear the sacred marks of toil.

“Then we looked into each other''s eyes for a long while. Oh! what
      power a woman''s eye has! How it agitates us, how it invades our very
      being, takes possession of us, and dominates us! How profound it seems,
      how full of infinite promises! People call that looking into each other''s
      souls! Oh! monsieur, what humbug! If we could see into each other''s souls,
      we should be more careful of what we did. However, I was captivated and
      was crazy about her and tried to take her into my arms, but she said:
      ''Paws off!''. Then I knelt down and opened my heart to her and poured out
      all the affection that was suffocating me. She seemed surprised at my
      change of manner and gave me a sidelong glance, as if to say, ''Ah! so that
      is the way women make a fool of you, old fellow! Very well, we will see.''

“No doubt I could have had her, and I saw my own stupidity later,
      but what I wanted was not a woman''s person, it was love, it was the ideal.
      I was sentimental, when I ought to have been using my time to a better
      purpose.

“As soon as she had had enough of my declarations of affection, she
      got up, and we returned to Saint-Cloud, and I did not leave her until we
      got to Paris; but she had looked so sad as we were returning, that at last
      I asked her what was the matter. ''I am thinking,'' she replied, ''that this
      has been one of those days of which we have but few in life.'' My heart
      beat so that it felt as if it would break my ribs.

“I saw her on the following Sunday, and the next Sunday, and every
      Sunday. I took her to Bougival, Saint-Germain, Maisons-Lafitte, Poissy; to
      every suburban resort of lovers.

“The little jade, in turn, pretended to love me, until, at last, I
      altogether lost my head, and three months later I married her.

“What can you expect, monsieur, when a man is a clerk, living alone,
      without any relations, or any one to advise him? One says to one''s self:
      ''How sweet life would be with a wife!''

“And so one gets married and she calls you names from morning till
      night, understands nothing, knows nothing, chatters continually, sings the
      song of Musette at the, top of her voice (oh! that song of Musette, how
      tired one gets of it!); quarrels with the charcoal dealer, tells the
      janitor all her domestic details, confides all the secrets of her bedroom
      to the neighbor''s servant, discusses her husband with the tradespeople and
      has her head so stuffed with stupid stories, with idiotic superstitions,
      with extraordinary ideas and monstrous prejudices, that I—for what I
      have said applies more particularly to myself—shed tears of
      discouragement every time I talk to her.”

He stopped, as he was rather out of breath and very much moved, and I
      looked at him, for I felt pity for this poor, artless devil, and I was
      just going to give him some sort of answer, when the boat stopped. We were
      at Saint-Cloud.

The little woman who had so taken my fancy rose from her seat in order to
      land. She passed close to me, and gave me a sidelong glance and a furtive
      smile, one of those smiles that drive you wild. Then she jumped on the
      landing-stage. I sprang forward to follow her, but my neighbor laid hold
      of my arm. I shook myself loose, however, whereupon he seized the skirt of
      my coat and pulled me back, exclaiming: “You shall not go! you shall
      not go!” in such a loud voice that everybody turned round and
      laughed, and I remained standing motionless and furious, but without
      venturing to face scandal and ridicule, and the steamboat started.

The little woman on the landing-stage looked at me as I went off with an
      air of disappointment, while my persecutor rubbed his hands and whispered
      to me:

Mattre Saval, notary at Vernon, was passionately fond of music. Although
      still young he was already bald; he was always carefully shaven, was
      somewhat corpulent as was suitable, and wore a gold pince-nez instead of
      spectacles. He was active, gallant and cheerful and was considered quite
      an artist in Vernon. He played the piano and the violin, and gave musicals
      where the new operas were interpreted.

He had even what is called a bit of a voice; nothing but a bit, very
      little bit of a voice; but he managed it with so much taste that cries of
      “Bravo!” “Exquisite!” “Surprising!”
      “Adorable!” issued from every throat as soon as he had
      murmured the last note.

He subscribed to a music publishing house in Paris, and they sent him the
      latest music, and from time to time he sent invitations after this fashion
      to the elite of the town:

“You are invited to be present on Monday evening at the house of M.
      Saval, notary, Vernon, at the first rendering of ''Sais.''”

A few officers, gifted with good voices, formed the chorus. Two or three
      lady amateurs also sang. The notary filled the part of leader of the
      orchestra with so much correctness that the bandmaster of the 190th
      regiment of the line said of him, one day, at the Cafe de l''Europe.

When his name was mentioned in a drawing-room, there was always somebody
      found to declare: “He is not an amateur; he is an artist, a genuine
      artist.”

Every time that a new work was interpreted at a big Parisian theatre M.
      Saval paid a visit to the capital.

Now, last year, according to his custom, he went to hear Henri VIII. He
      then took the express which arrives in Paris at 4:30 P.M., intending to
      return by the 12:35 A.M. train, so as not to have to sleep at a hotel. He
      had put on evening dress, a black coat and white tie, which he concealed
      under his overcoat with the collar turned up.

As soon as he set foot on the Rue d''Amsterdam, he felt himself in quite
      jovial mood. He said to himself:

“Decidedly, the air of Paris does not resemble any other air. It has
      in it something indescribably stimulating, exciting, intoxicating, which
      fills you with a strange longing to dance about and to do many other
      things. As soon as I arrive here, it seems to me, all of a sudden, that I
      have taken a bottle of champagne. What a life one can lead in this city in
      the midst of artists! Happy are the elect, the great men who make
      themselves a reputation in such a city! What an existence is theirs!”

And he made plans; he would have liked to know some of these celebrated
      men, to talk about them in Vernon, and to spend an evening with them from
      time to time in Paris.

But suddenly an idea struck him. He had heard allusions to little cafes in
      the outer boulevards at which well-known painters, men of letters, and
      even musicians gathered, and he proceeded to go up to Montmartre at a slow
      pace.

He had two hours before him. He wanted to look about him. He passed in
      front of taverns frequented by belated bohemians, gazing at the different
      faces, seeking to discover the artists. Finally, he came to the sign of
      “The Dead Rat,” and, allured by the name, he entered.

Five or six women, with their elbows resting on the marble tables, were
      talking in low tones about their love affairs, the quarrels of Lucie and
      Hortense, and the scoundrelism of Octave. They were no longer young, were
      too fat or too thin, tired out, used up. You could see that they were
      almost bald; and they drank beer like men.

M. Saval sat down at some distance from them and waited, for the hour for
      taking absinthe was at hand.

A tall young man soon came in and took a seat beside him. The landlady
      called him M. “Romantin.” The notary quivered. Was this the
      Romantin who had taken a medal at the last Salon?

“You will bring up my dinner at once, and then carry to my new
      studio, 15 Boulevard de Clichy, thirty bottles of beer, and the ham I
      ordered this morning. We are going to have a housewarming.”

M. Saval immediately ordered dinner. Then, he took off his overcoat, so
      that his dress suit and his white tie could be seen. His neighbor did not
      seem to notice him. He had taken up a newspaper, and was reading it. M.
      Saval glanced sideways at him, burning with the desire to speak to him.

Two young men entered, in red vests and with peaked beards, in the fashion
      of Henry III. They sat down opposite Romantin.

“I believe you, old chap, and everyone will be there. I have Bonnat,
      Guillemet, Gervex, Beraud, Hebert, Duez, Clairin, and Jean-Paul Laurens.
      It will be a stunning affair! And women, too! Wait till you see! Every
      actress without exception—of course I mean, you know, all those who
      have nothing to do this evening.”

“I beg your pardon for intruding on you, monsieur, but I heard your
      name mentioned, and I would be very glad to know if you really are M.
      Romantin, whose work in the last Salon I have so much admired?”

The notary then paid the artist a very well-turned compliment, showing
      that he was a man of culture.

Then they chattered. Romantin returned to the subject of his
      house-warming, going into details as to the magnificence of the
      forthcoming entertainment.

“It would be an extraordinary piece of good fortune for a stranger
      to meet at one time so many celebrities assembled in the studio of an
      artist of your rank.”

Both of them had finished their meal. The notary insisted on paying the
      two bills, wishing to repay his neighbor''s civilities. He also paid for
      the drinks of the young fellows in red velvet; then he left the
      establishment with the painter.

They stopped in front of a very long, low house, the first story having
      the appearance of an interminable conservatory. Six studios stood in a row
      with their fronts facing the boulevards.

Romantin was the first to enter, and, ascending the stairs, he opened a
      door, and lighted a match and then a candle.

They found themselves in an immense apartment, the furniture of which
      consisted of three chairs, two easels, and a few sketches standing on the
      ground along the walls. M. Saval remained standing at the door somewhat
      astonished.

“I know someone who might easily give a helping hand. Women are
      incomparable for hanging drapery. But I sent her to the country for to-day
      in order to get her off my hands this evening. It is not that she bores
      me, but she is too much lacking in the ways of good society. It would be
      embarrassing to my guests.”

“She is a good girl, but not easy to deal with. If she knew that I
      was holding a reception, she would tear out my eyes.”

He went to the back of the easel, on which there was a canvas representing
      a cat, and seized a very worn-out broom.

M. Saval took the broom, inspected it, and then began to sweep the floor
      very awkwardly, raising a whirlwind of dust.

Romantin, disgusted, stopped him: “Deuce take it! you don''t know how
      to sweep the floor! Look at me!”

And he began to roll before him a heap of grayish sweepings, as if he had
      done nothing else all his life. Then, he gave bark the broom to the
      notary, who imitated him.

The artist said: “Well! you''ll go out and buy for me five francs''
      worth of wax-candles while I go and see the cooper.”

And he pushed the notary in his evening coat into the street. At the end
      of five minutes, they had returned, one of them with the wax-candles and
      the other with the hoop of a cask. Then Romantin plunged his hand into a
      cupboard, and drew forth twenty empty bottles, which he fixed in the form
      of a crown around the hoop.

He then went downstairs to borrow a ladder from the janitress, after
      having explained that he had made interest with the old woman by painting
      the portrait of her cat, exhibited on the easel.

“Well, you just climb up there, and fasten this chandelier for me to
      the ring of the ceiling. Then, you put a wax-candle in each bottle, and
      light it. I tell you I have a genius for lighting up. But off with your
      coat, damn it! You are just like a Jeames.”

The door was opened brusquely. A woman appeared, her eyes flashing, and
      remained standing on the threshold.

She waited some seconds, crossing her arms over her breast, and then in a
      shrill, vibrating, exasperated voice said:

“Ha! you scoundrel! You did a nice thing in parking me off to the
      country. You''ll soon see the way I''ll settle your jollification. Yes, I''m
      going to receive your friends.”

But she was now fairly under way; and on she went, emptying the vials of
      her wrath with strong words and reproaches. They flowed out of her mouth
      like, a stream sweeping a heap of filth along with it. The words pouring
      forth seemed struggling for exit. She stuttered, stammered, yelled,
      suddenly recovering her voice to cast forth an insult or a curse.

He seized her hands without her having noticed it. She did not seem to see
      anything, so taken up was she in scolding and relieving her feelings. And
      suddenly she began to weep. The tears flowed from her eyes, but this did
      not stop her complaints. But her words were uttered in a screaming
      falsetto voice with tears in it and interrupted by sobs. She commenced
      afresh twice or three times, till she stopped as if something were choking
      her, and at last she ceased with a regular flood of tears.

“Mathilde, my little Mathilde, listen. You must be reasonable. You
      know, if I give a supper-party to my friends, it is to thank these
      gentlemen for the medal I got at the Salon. I cannot receive women. You
      ought to understand that. It is not the same with artists as with other
      people.”

“It was in order not to annoy you, not to give you pain. Listen, I''m
      going to see you home. You will be very sensible, very nice; you will
      remain quietly waiting for me in bed, and I''ll come back as soon as it''s
      over.”

“My dear friend, I am coming back in five minutes. If anyone arrives
      in my absence, do the honors for me, will you not?”

And he carried off Mathilde, who kept drying her eyes with her
      handkerchief as she went along.

Left to himself, M. Saval succeeded in putting everything around him in
      order. Then he lighted the wax-candles, and waited.

He waited for a quarter of an hour, half an hour, an hour. Romantin did
      not return. Then, suddenly there was a dreadful noise on the stairs, a
      song shouted out in chorus by twenty mouths and a regular march like that
      of a Prussian regiment. The whole house was shaken by the steady tramp of
      feet. The door flew open, and a motley throng appeared—men and women
      in file, two and two holding each other by the arm and stamping their
      heels on the ground to mark time, advanced into the studio like a snake
      uncoiling itself. They howled:

M. Saval, thunderstruck, remained standing in evening dress under the
      chandelier. The procession of revellers caught sight of him, and uttered a
      shout:

And they began whirling round him, surrounding him with a circle of
      vociferations. Then they took each other by the hand and went dancing
      about madly.

“Let the poor waiter alone! You''ll end by making him get angry. He''s
      paid to wait on us, and not to be laughed at by us.”

Then, M. Saval noticed that each guest had brought his own provisions. One
      held a bottle of wine, and the other a pie. This one had a loaf of bread,
      and one a ham.

“Here, go and arrange the sideboard in the corner over there. Put
      the bottles at the left and the provisions at the right.”

There was a moment''s silence and then a wild outburst of laughter. One
      suspicious gentleman asked:

He explained, telling about his project of going to the opera, his
      departure from Vernon, his arrival in Paris, and the way in which he had
      spent the evening.

They sat around him to listen to him; they greeted him with words of
      applause, and called him Scheherazade.

Romantin did not return. Other guests arrived. M. Saval was presented to
      them so that he might begin his story over again. He declined; they forced
      him to relate it. They seated and tied him on one of three chairs between
      two women who kept constantly filling his glass. He drank; he laughed; he
      talked; he sang, too. He tried to waltz with his chair, and fell on the
      ground.

From that moment, he forgot everything. It seemed to him, however, that
      they undressed him, put him to bed, and that he was nauseated.

When he awoke, it was broad daylight, and he lay stretched with his feet
      against a cupboard, in a strange bed.

“Where are you, you dirty scamp? You are drunk. Take your rotten
      carcass out of here as quick as you can—and lose no time about it!”

He wanted to get up. He found that he was in no condition to do so. His
      clothes had disappeared. He blurted out:

“Will you take your dirty carcass out of this, so that he at any
      rate may not catch you here?”

He had to wait, to explain his situation, give notice to his friends, and
      borrow some money to buy clothes. He did not leave Paris till evening. And
      when people talk about music to him in his beautiful drawing-room in
      Vernon, he declares with an air of authority that painting is a very
      inferior art.

The household lived frugally on the meager income derived from the
      husband''s insignificant appointments. Two children had been born of the
      marriage, and the earlier condition of the strictest economy had become
      one of quiet, concealed, shamefaced misery, the poverty of a noble family—which
      in spite of misfortune never forgets its rank.

Hector de Gribelin had been educated in the provinces, under the paternal
      roof, by an aged priest. His people were not rich, but they managed to
      live and to keep up appearances.

At twenty years of age they tried to find him a position, and he entered
      the Ministry of Marine as a clerk at sixty pounds a year. He foundered on
      the rock of life like all those who have not been early prepared for its
      rude struggles, who look at life through a mist, who do not know how to
      protect themselves, whose special aptitudes and faculties have not been
      developed from childhood, whose early training has not developed the rough
      energy needed for the battle of life or furnished them with tool or
      weapon.

He had, however, renewed the acquaintance of a few friends of his family
      —elderly people, far behind the times, and poor like himself, who
      lived in aristocratic streets, the gloomy thoroughfares of the Faubourg
      Saint-Germain; and he had created a social circle for himself.

Strangers to modern life, humble yet proud, these needy aristocrats lived
      in the upper stories of sleepy, old-world houses. From top to bottom of
      their dwellings the tenants were titled, but money seemed just as scarce
      on the ground floor as in the attics.

Their eternal prejudices, absorption in their rank, anxiety lest they
      should lose caste, filled the minds and thoughts of these families once so
      brilliant, now ruined by the idleness of the men of the family. Hector de
      Gribelin met in this circle a young girl as well born and as poor as
      himself and married her.

For four years more the husband and wife, harassed by poverty, knew no
      other distraction than the Sunday walk in the Champs-Elysees and a few
      evenings at the theatre (amounting in all to one or two in the course of
      the winter) which they owed to free passes presented by some comrade or
      other.

But in the spring of the following year some overtime work was entrusted
      to Hector de Gribelin by his chief, for which he received the large sum of
      three hundred francs.

“My dear Henrietta, we must indulge in some sort of festivity—say
      an outing for the children.”

And after a long discussion it was decided that they should go and lunch
      one day in the country.

“Well,” cried Hector, “once will not break us, so we''ll
      hire a wagonette for you, the children and the maid. And I''ll have a
      saddle horse; the exercise will do me good.”

Every evening, on his return from the office, Hector caught up his elder
      son, put him astride his leg, and, making him bounce up and down as hard
      as he could, said:

And the youngster amused himself all day long by bestriding chairs,
      dragging them round the room and shouting:

The servant herself gazed at her master with awestruck eyes as she thought
      of him riding alongside the carriage, and at meal-times she listened with
      all her ears while he spoke of riding and recounted the exploits of his
      youth, when he lived at home with his father. Oh, he had learned in a good
      school, and once he felt his steed between his legs he feared nothing—nothing
      whatever!

“If only they would give me a restive animal I should be all the
      better pleased. You''ll see how well I can ride; and if you like we''ll come
      back by the Champs-Elysees just as all the people are returning from the
      Bois. As we shall make a good appearance, I shouldn''t at all object to
      meeting some one from the ministry. That is all that is necessary to
      insure the respect of one''s chiefs.”

On the day appointed the carriage and the riding horse arrived at the same
      moment before the door. Hector went down immediately to examine his mount.
      He had had straps sewn to his trousers and flourished in his hand a whip
      he had bought the evening before.

He raised the horse''s legs and felt them one after another, passed his
      hand over the animal''s neck, flank and hocks, opened his mouth, examined
      his teeth, declared his age; and then, the whole household having
      collected round him, he delivered a discourse on the horse in general and
      the specimen before him in particular, pronouncing the latter excellent in
      every respect.

When the rest of the party had taken their seats in the carriage he
      examined the saddle-girth; then, putting his foot in the stirrup, he
      sprang to the saddle. The animal began to curvet and nearly threw his
      rider.

All looks were centered on him. He trotted in the English style, rising
      unnecessarily high in the saddle; looking at times as if he were mounting
      into space. Sometimes he seemed on the point of falling forward on the
      horse''s mane; his eyes were fixed, his face drawn, his cheeks pale.

His wife, holding one of the children on her knees, and the servant, who
      was carrying the other, continually cried out:

And the two boys, intoxicated by the motion of the carriage, by their
      delight and by the keen air, uttered shrill cries. The horse, frightened
      by the noise they made, started off at a gallop, and while Hector was
      trying to control his steed his hat fell off, and the driver had to get
      down and pick it up. When the equestrian had recovered it he called to his
      wife from a distance:

They lunched on the grass in the Vesinet woods, having brought provisions
      with them in the carriage.

Although the driver was looking after the three horses, Hector rose every
      minute to see if his own lacked anything; he patted him on the neck and
      fed him with bread, cakes and sugar.

“He''s an unequal trotter,” he declared. “He certainly
      shook me up a little at first, but, as you saw, I soon got used to it. He
      knows his master now and won''t give any more trouble.”

That spacious thoroughfare literally swarmed with vehicles of every kind,
      and on the sidewalks the pedestrians were so numerous that they looked
      like two indeterminate black ribbons unfurling their length from the Arc
      de Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde. A flood of sunlight played on
      this gay scene, making the varnish of the carriages, the steel of the
      harness and the handles of the carriage doors shine with dazzling
      brilliancy.

An intoxication of life and motion seemed to have invaded this assemblage
      of human beings, carriages and horses. In the distance the outlines of the
      Obelisk could be discerned in a cloud of golden vapor.

As soon as Hector''s horse had passed the Arc de Triomphe he became
      suddenly imbued with fresh energy, and, realizing that his stable was not
      far off, began to trot rapidly through the maze of wheels, despite all his
      rider''s efforts to restrain him.

The carriage was now far behind. When the horse arrived opposite the
      Palais de l''Industrie he saw a clear field before him, and, turning to the
      right, set off at a gallop.

An old woman wearing an apron was crossing the road in leisurely fashion.
      She happened to be just in Hector''s way as he arrived on the scene riding
      at full speed. Powerless to control his mount, he shouted at the top of
      his voice:

She must have been deaf, for she continued peacefully on her way until the
      awful moment when, struck by the horse''s chest as by a locomotive under
      full steam, she rolled ten paces off, turning three somersaults on the
      way.

A terrible jolt hurled him, as if shot from a gun, over his horse''s ears
      and cast him into the arms of a policeman who was running up to stop him.

In the space of a second a furious, gesticulating, vociferating group had
      gathered round him. An old gentleman with a white mustache, wearing a
      large round decoration, seemed particularly exasperated. He repeated:

“Confound it! When a man is as awkward as all that he should remain
      at home and not come killing people in the streets, if he doesn''t know how
      to handle a horse.”

Four men arrived on the scene, carrying the old woman. She appeared to be
      dead. Her skin was like parchment, her cap on one side and she was covered
      with dust.

“Take her to a druggist''s,” ordered the old gentleman, “and
      let us go to the commissary of police.”

Hector started on his way with a policeman on either side of him, a third
      was leading his horse. A crowd followed them—and suddenly the
      wagonette appeared in sight. His wife alighted in consternation, the
      servant lost her head, the children whimpered. He explained that he would
      soon be at home, that he had knocked a woman down and that there was not
      much the matter. And his family, distracted with anxiety, went on their
      way.

When they arrived before the commissary the explanation took place in few
      words. He gave his name—Hector de Gribelin, employed at the Ministry
      of Marine; and then they awaited news of the injured woman. A policeman
      who had been sent to obtain information returned, saying that she had
      recovered consciousness, but was complaining of frightful internal pain.
      She was a charwoman, sixty-five years of age, named Madame Simon.

When he heard that she was not dead Hector regained hope and promised to
      defray her doctor''s bill. Then he hastened to the druggist''s. The door way
      was thronged; the injured woman, huddled in an armchair, was groaning. Her
      arms hung at her sides, her face was drawn. Two doctors were still engaged
      in examining her. No bones were broken, but they feared some internal
      lesion.

“This woman ought to be sent to a home. I know one where they would
      take her at six francs a day. Would you like me to send her there?”

“It''s all right. This Madame Simon is better already and will be
      quite well in two or three days. I have sent her to a home. It''s all
      right.”

When he left his office the next day he went to inquire for Madame Simon.
      He found her eating rich soup with an air of great satisfaction.

Hector waited three days, then he returned. The old woman, fresh-faced and
      clear-eyed, began to whine when she saw him:

A shudder passed through Hector''s frame. He asked for the doctor, who
      merely shrugged his shoulders and said:

“What can I do? I can''t tell what''s wrong with her. She shrieks when
      they try to raise her. They can''t even move her chair from one place to
      another without her uttering the most distressing cries. I am bound to
      believe what she tells me; I can''t look into her inside. So long as I have
      no chance of seeing her walk I am not justified in supposing her to be
      telling lies about herself.”

A week passed, then a fortnight, then a month. Madame Simon did not leave
      her armchair. She ate from morning to night, grew fat, chatted gaily with
      the other patients and seemed to enjoy her immobility as if it were the
      rest to which she was entitled after fifty years of going up and down
      stairs, of turning mattresses, of carrying coal from one story to another,
      of sweeping and dusting.

Hector, at his wits'' end, came to see her every day. Every day he found
      her calm and serene, declaring:

They dismissed the servant, whose wages they could no longer afford. They
      economized more rigidly than ever. The whole of the extra pay had been
      swallowed up.

Then Hector summoned four noted doctors, who met in consultation over the
      old woman. She let them examine her, feel her, sound her, watching them
      the while with a cunning eye.

Then they took hold of her, raised her and dragged her a short distance,
      but she slipped from their grasp and fell to the floor, groaning and
      giving vent to such heartrending cries that they carried her back to her
      seat with infinite care and precaution.

About half-past five one afternoon at the end of June when the sun was
      shining warm and bright into the large courtyard, a very elegant victoria
      with two beautiful black horses drew up in front of the mansion.

The Comtesse de Mascaret came down the steps just as her husband, who was
      coming home, appeared in the carriage entrance. He stopped for a few
      moments to look at his wife and turned rather pale. The countess was very
      beautiful, graceful and distinguished looking, with her long oval face,
      her complexion like yellow ivory, her large gray eyes and her black hair;
      and she got into her carriage without looking at him, without even seeming
      to have noticed him, with such a particularly high-bred air, that the
      furious jealousy by which he had been devoured for so long again gnawed at
      his heart. He went up to her and said: “You are going for a drive?”

Without being surprised at the tone in which she answered him, he got in
      and sat down by his wife''s side and said: “Bois de Boulogne.”
      The footman jumped up beside the coachman, and the horses as usual pranced
      and tossed their heads until they were in the street. Husband and wife sat
      side by side without speaking. He was thinking how to begin a
      conversation, but she maintained such an obstinately hard look that he did
      not venture to make the attempt. At last, however, he cunningly,
      accidentally as it were, touched the countess'' gloved hand with his own,
      but she drew her arm away with a movement which was so expressive of
      disgust that he remained thoughtful, in spite of his usual authoritative
      and despotic character, and he said: “Gabrielle!”

She did not reply, but remained lying back in the carriage, looking like
      an irritated queen. By that time they were driving up the Champs Elysees,
      toward the Arc de Triomphe. That immense monument, at the end of the long
      avenue, raised its colossal arch against the red sky and the sun seemed to
      be descending on it, showering fiery dust on it from the sky.

The stream of carriages, with dashes of sunlight reflected in the silver
      trappings of the harness and the glass of the lamps, flowed on in a double
      current toward the town and toward the Bois, and the Comte de Mascaret
      continued: “My dear Gabrielle!”

Unable to control herself any longer, she replied in an exasperated voice:
      “Oh! do leave me in peace, pray! I am not even allowed to have my
      carriage to myself now.” He pretended not to hear her and continued:
      “You never have looked so pretty as you do to-day.”

Her patience had come to an end, and she replied with irrepressible anger:
      “You are wrong to notice it, for I swear to you that I will never
      have anything to do with you in that way again.”

The count was decidedly stupefied and upset, and, his violent nature
      gaining the upper hand, he exclaimed: “What do you mean by that?”
      in a tone that betrayed rather the brutal master than the lover. She
      replied in a low voice, so that the servants might not hear amid the
      deafening noise of the wheels: “Ah! What do I mean by that? What do
      I mean by that? Now I recognize you again! Do you want me to tell
      everything?”

“Everything that has weighed on my heart since I have been the
      victim of your terrible selfishness?”

He had grown red with surprise and anger and he growled between his closed
      teeth: “Yes, tell me everything.”

He was a tall, broad-shouldered man, with a big red beard, a handsome man,
      a nobleman, a man of the world, who passed as a perfect husband and an
      excellent father, and now, for the first time since they had started, she
      turned toward him and looked him full in the face: “Ah! You will
      hear some disagreeable things, but you must know that I am prepared for
      everything, that I fear nothing, and you less than any one to-day.”

He also was looking into her eyes and was already shaking with rage as he
      said in a low voice: “You are mad.”

“No, but I will no longer be the victim of the hateful penalty of
      maternity, which you have inflicted on me for eleven years! I wish to take
      my place in society as I have the right to do, as all women have the right
      to do.”

“Oh! yes; you understand me well enough. It is now three months
      since I had my last child, and as I am still very beautiful, and as, in
      spite of all your efforts you cannot spoil my figure, as you just now
      perceived, when you saw me on the doorstep, you think it is time that I
      should think of having another child.”

“No, I am not, I am thirty, and I have had seven children, and we
      have been married eleven years, and you hope that this will go on for ten
      years longer, after which you will leave off being jealous.”

He seized her arm and squeezed it, saying: “I will not allow you to
      talk to me like that much longer.”

“And I shall talk to you till the end, until I have finished all I
      have to say to you, and if you try to prevent me, I shall raise my voice
      so that the two servants, who are on the box, may hear. I only allowed you
      to come with me for that object, for I have these witnesses who will
      oblige you to listen to me and to contain yourself, so now pay attention
      to what I say. I have always felt an antipathy to you, and I have always
      let you see it, for I have never lied, monsieur. You married me in spite
      of myself; you forced my parents, who were in embarrassed circumstances,
      to give me to you, because you were rich, and they obliged me to marry you
      in spite of my tears.

“So you bought me, and as soon as I was in your power, as soon as I
      had become your companion, ready to attach myself to you, to forget your
      coercive and threatening proceedings, in order that I might only remember
      that I ought to be a devoted wife and to love you as much as it might be
      possible for me to love you, you became jealous, you, as no man has ever
      been before, with the base, ignoble jealousy of a spy, which was as
      degrading to you as it was to me. I had not been married eight months when
      you suspected me of every perfidiousness, and you even told me so. What a
      disgrace! And as you could not prevent me from being beautiful and from
      pleasing people, from being called in drawing-rooms and also in the
      newspapers one of the most beautiful women in Paris, you tried everything
      you could think of to keep admirers from me, and you hit upon the
      abominable idea of making me spend my life in a constant state of
      motherhood, until the time should come when I should disgust every man.
      Oh, do not deny it. I did not understand it for some time, but then I
      guessed it. You even boasted about it to your sister, who told me of it,
      for she is fond of me and was disgusted at your boorish coarseness.

“Ah! Remember how you have behaved in the past! How for eleven years
      you have compelled me to give up all society and simply be a mother to
      your children. And then you would grow disgusted with me and I was sent
      into the country, the family chateau, among fields and meadows. And when I
      reappeared, fresh, pretty and unspoiled, still seductive and constantly
      surrounded by admirers, hoping that at last I should live a little more
      like a rich young society woman, you were seized with jealousy again, and
      you began once more to persecute me with that infamous and hateful desire
      from which you are suffering at this moment by my side. And it is not the
      desire of possessing me—for I should never have refused myself to
      you, but it is the wish to make me unsightly.

“And then that abominable and mysterious thing occurred which I was
      a long time in understanding (but I grew sharp by dint of watching your
      thoughts and actions): You attached yourself to your children with all the
      security which they gave you while I bore them. You felt affection for
      them, with all your aversion to me, and in spite of your ignoble fears,
      which were momentarily allayed by your pleasure in seeing me lose my
      symmetry.

“Oh! how often have I noticed that joy in you! I have seen it in
      your eyes and guessed it. You loved your children as victories, and not
      because they were of your own blood. They were victories over me, over my
      youth, over my beauty, over my charms, over the compliments which were
      paid me and over those that were whispered around me without being paid to
      me personally. And you are proud of them, you make a parade of them, you
      take them out for drives in your break in the Bois de Boulogne and you
      give them donkey rides at Montmorency. You take them to theatrical
      matinees so that you may be seen in the midst of them, so that the people
      may say: ''What a kind father'' and that it may be repeated——”

He had seized her wrist with savage brutality, and he squeezed it so
      violently that she was quiet and nearly cried out with the pain and he
      said to her in a whisper:

“I love my children, do you hear? What you have just told me is
      disgraceful in a mother. But you belong to me; I am master—your
      master—I can exact from you what I like and when I like—and I
      have the law-on my side.”

He was trying to crush her fingers in the strong grip of his large,
      muscular hand, and she, livid with pain, tried in vain to free them from
      that vise which was crushing them. The agony made her breathe hard and the
      tears came into her eyes. “You see that I am the master and the
      stronger,” he said. When he somewhat loosened his grip, she asked
      him: “Do you think that I am a religious woman?”

“Do you think that I could lie if I swore to the truth of anything
      to you before an altar on which Christ''s body is?”

She raised her voice and said: “Philippe!” And the coachman,
      bending down a little, without taking his eyes from his horses, seemed to
      turn his ear alone toward his mistress, who continued: “Drive to St.
      Philippe-du-Roule.” And the victoria, which had reached the entrance
      of the Bois de Boulogne returned to Paris.

Husband and wife did not exchange a word further during the drive, and
      when the carriage stopped before the church Madame de Mascaret jumped out
      and entered it, followed by the count, a few yards distant. She went,
      without stopping, as far as the choir-screen, and falling on her knees at
      a chair, she buried her face in her hands. She prayed for a long time, and
      he, standing behind her could see that she was crying. She wept
      noiselessly, as women weep when they are in great, poignant grief. There
      was a kind of undulation in her body, which ended in a little sob, which
      was hidden and stifled by her fingers.

But the Comte de Mascaret thought that the situation was lasting too long,
      and he touched her on the shoulder. That contact recalled her to herself,
      as if she had been burned, and getting up, she looked straight into his
      eyes. “This is what I have to say to you. I am afraid of nothing,
      whatever you may do to me. You may kill me if you like. One of your
      children is not yours, and one only; that I swear to you before God, who
      hears me here. That was the only revenge that was possible for me in
      return for all your abominable masculine tyrannies, in return for the
      penal servitude of childbearing to which you have condemned me. Who was my
      lover? That you never will know! You may suspect every one, but you never
      will find out. I gave myself to him, without love and without pleasure,
      only for the sake of betraying you, and he also made me a mother. Which is
      the child? That also you never will know. I have seven; try to find out! I
      intended to tell you this later, for one has not avenged oneself on a man
      by deceiving him, unless he knows it. You have driven me to confess it
      today. I have now finished.”

She hurried through the church toward the open door, expecting to hear
      behind her the quick step: of her husband whom she had defied and to be
      knocked to the ground by a blow of his fist, but she heard nothing and
      reached her carriage. She jumped into it at a bound, overwhelmed with
      anguish and breathless with fear. So she called out to the coachman:
      “Home!” and the horses set off at a quick trot.

The Comtesse de Mascaret was waiting in her room for dinner time as a
      criminal sentenced to death awaits the hour of his execution. What was her
      husband going to do? Had he come home? Despotic, passionate, ready for any
      violence as he was, what was he meditating, what had he made up his mind
      to do? There was no sound in the house, and every moment she looked at the
      clock. Her lady''s maid had come and dressed her for the evening and had
      then left the room again. Eight o''clock struck and almost at the same
      moment there were two knocks at the door, and the butler came in and
      announced dinner.

For a little moment she felt inclined to arm herself with a small revolver
      which she had bought some time before, foreseeing the tragedy which was
      being rehearsed in her heart. But she remembered that all the children
      would be there, and she took nothing except a bottle of smelling salts. He
      rose somewhat ceremoniously from his chair. They exchanged a slight bow
      and sat down. The three boys with their tutor, Abbe Martin, were on her
      right and the three girls, with Miss Smith, their English governess, were
      on her left. The youngest child, who was only three months old, remained
      upstairs with his nurse.

The abbe said grace as usual when there was no company, for the children
      did not come down to dinner when guests were present. Then they began
      dinner. The countess, suffering from emotion, which she had not calculated
      upon, remained with her eyes cast down, while the count scrutinized now
      the three boys and now the three girls with an uncertain, unhappy
      expression, which travelled from one to the other. Suddenly pushing his
      wineglass from him, it broke, and the wine was spilt on the tablecloth,
      and at the slight noise caused by this little accident the countess
      started up from her chair; and for the first time they looked at each
      other. Then, in spite of themselves, in spite of the irritation of their
      nerves caused by every glance, they continued to exchange looks, rapid as
      pistol shots.

The abbe, who felt that there was some cause for embarrassment which he
      could not divine, attempted to begin a conversation and tried various
      subjects, but his useless efforts gave rise to no ideas and did not bring
      out a word. The countess, with feminine tact and obeying her instincts of
      a woman of the world, attempted to answer him two or three times, but in
      vain. She could not find words, in the perplexity of her mind, and her own
      voice almost frightened her in the silence of the large room, where
      nothing was heard except the slight sound of plates and knives and forks.

Suddenly her husband said to her, bending forward: “Here, amid your
      children, will you swear to me that what you told me just now is true?”

The hatred which was fermenting in her veins suddenly roused her, and
      replying to that question with the same firmness with which she had
      replied to his looks, she raised both her hands, the right pointing toward
      the boys and the left toward the girls, and said in a firm, resolute voice
      and without any hesitation: “On the head of my children, I swear
      that I have told you the truth.”

He got up and throwing his table napkin on the table with a movement of
      exasperation, he turned round and flung his chair against the wall, and
      then went out without another word, while she, uttering a deep sigh, as if
      after a first victory, went on in a calm voice: “You must not pay
      any attention to what your father has just said, my darlings; he was very
      much upset a short time ago, but he will be all right again in a few days.”

Then she talked with the abbe and Miss Smith and had tender, pretty words
      for all her children, those sweet, tender mother''s ways which unfold
      little hearts.

When dinner was over she went into the drawing-room, all her children
      following her. She made the elder ones chatter, and when their bedtime
      came she kissed them for a long time and then went alone into her room.

She waited, for she had no doubt that the count would come, and she made
      up her mind then, as her children were not with her, to protect herself as
      a woman of the world as she would protect her life, and in the pocket of
      her dress she put the little loaded revolver which she had bought a few
      days previously. The hours went by, the hours struck, and every sound was
      hushed in the house. Only the cabs, continued to rumble through the
      streets, but their noise was only heard vaguely through the shuttered and
      curtained windows.

She waited, full of nervous energy, without any fear of him now, ready for
      anything, and almost triumphant, for she had found means of torturing him
      continually during every moment of his life.

But the first gleam of dawn came in through the fringe at the bottom of
      her curtain without his having come into her room, and then she awoke to
      the fact, with much amazement, that he was not coming. Having locked and
      bolted her door, for greater security, she went to bed at last and
      remained there, with her eyes open, thinking and barely understanding it
      all, without being able to guess what he was going to do.

When her maid brought her tea she at the same time handed her a letter
      from her husband. He told her that he was going to undertake a longish
      journey and in a postscript added that his lawyer would provide her with
      any sums of money she might require for all her expenses.

It was at the opera, between two acts of “Robert the Devil.”
      In the stalls the men were standing up, with their hats on, their
      waistcoats cut very low so as to show a large amount of white shirt front,
      in which gold and jewelled studs glistened, and were looking at the boxes
      full of ladies in low dresses covered with diamonds and pearls, who were
      expanding like flowers in that illuminated hothouse, where the beauty of
      their faces and the whiteness of their shoulders seemed to bloom in order
      to be gazed at, amid the sound of the music and of human voices.

Two friends, with their backs to the orchestra, were scanning those rows
      of elegance, that exhibition of real or false charms, of jewels, of luxury
      and of pretension which displayed itself in all parts of the Grand
      Theatre, and one ' WHERE id = '6b5a5bab-cb6d-4c60-9071-cb95b01bf8ca';
