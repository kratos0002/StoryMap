diners who might be present.  On the back of each sketch was
marked in plain figures the announcement “Price ten
shillings.”

If his work was not obviously stamped with the hall-mark of
genius, at any rate it was remarkable for its choice of an
unusual and unvarying theme.  His pictures always
represented some well-known street or public place in London,
fallen into decay and denuded of its human population, in the
place of which there roamed a wild fauna, which, from its wealth
of exotic species, must have originally escaped from Zoological
Gardens and travelling beast shows.  “Giraffes
drinking at the fountain pools, Trafalgar Square,” was one
of the most notable and characteristic of his studies, while even
more sensational was the gruesome picture of “Vultures
attacking dying camel in Upper Berkeley Street.” 
There were also photographs of the large canvas on which he had
been engaged for some months, and which he was now endeavouring
to sell to some enterprising dealer or adventurous amateur. 
The subject was “Hyænas asleep in Euston
Station,” a composition that left nothing to be desired in
the way of suggesting unfathomed depths of desolation.

“Of course it may be immensely clever, it may be
something epoch-making in the realm of art,” said Sylvia
Strubble to her own particular circle of listeners, “but,
on the other hand, it may be merely mad.  One mustn’t
pay too much attention to the commercial aspect of the case, of
course, but still, if some dealer would make a bid for that
hyæna picture, or even for some of the sketches, we should
know better how to place the man and his work.”

“We may all be cursing ourselves one of these
days,” said Mrs. Nougat-Jones, “for not having bought
up his entire portfolio of sketches.  At the same time, when
there is so much real talent going about, one does not feel like
planking down ten shillings for what looks like a bit of
whimsical oddity.  Now that picture that he showed us last
week, ‘Sand-grouse roosting on the Albert Memorial,’
was very impressive, and of course I could see there was good
workmanship in it and breadth of treatment; but it didn’t
in the least convey the Albert Memorial to me, and Sir James
Beanquest tells me that sand-grouse don’t roost, they sleep
on the ground.”

Whatever talent or genius the Pomeranian artist might possess,
it certainly failed to receive commercial sanction.  The
portfolio remained bulky with unsold sketches, and the
“Euston Siesta,” as the wits of the Nuremberg
nicknamed the large canvas, was still in the market.  The
outward and visible signs of financial embarrassment began to be
noticeable; the half-bottle of cheap claret at dinner-time gave
way to a small glass of lager, and this in turn was displaced by
water.  The one-and-sixpenny set dinner receded from an
everyday event to a Sunday extravagance; on ordinary days the
artist contented himself with a sevenpenny omelette and some
bread and cheese, and there were evenings when he did not put in
an appearance at all.  On the rare occasions when he spoke
of his own affairs it was observed that he began to talk more
about Pomerania and less about the great world of art.

“It is a busy time there now with us,” he said
wistfully; “the schwines are driven out into the fields
after harvest, and must be looked after.  I could be helping
to look after if I was there.  Here it is difficult to live;
art is not appreciate.”

“Ah, it cost money!  There is the ship passage to
Stolpmünde, and there is money that I owe at my
lodgings.  Even here I owe a few schillings.  If I
could sell some of my sketches—”

“Perhaps,” suggested Mrs. Nougat-Jones, “if
you were to offer them for a little less, some of us would be
glad to buy a few.  Ten shillings is always a consideration,
you know, to people who are not over well off.  Perhaps if
you were to ask six or seven shillings—”

Once a peasant, always a peasant.  The mere suggestion of
a bargain to be struck brought a twinkle of awakened alertness
into the artist’s eyes, and hardened the lines of his
mouth.

“Nine schilling nine pence each,” he snapped, and
seemed disappointed that Mrs. Nougat-Jones did not pursue the
subject further.  He had evidently expected her to offer
seven and fourpence.

The weeks sped by, and Knopfschrank came more rarely to the
restaurant in Owl Street, while his meals on those occasions
became more and more meagre.  And then came a triumphal day,
when he appeared early in the evening in a high state of elation,
and ordered an elaborate meal that scarcely stopped short of
being a banquet.  The ordinary resources of the kitchen were
supplemented by an imported dish of smoked goosebreast, a
Pomeranian delicacy that was luckily procurable at a firm of
delikatessen merchants in Coventry Street, while a
long-necked bottle of Rhine wine gave a finishing touch of
festivity and good cheer to the crowded table.

“He has evidently sold his masterpiece,” whispered
Sylvia Strubble to Mrs. Nougat-Jones, who had come in late.

“Don’t know; he hasn’t said anything yet,
but it must be some American.  Do you see, he has got a
little American flag on the dessert dish, and he has put pennies
in the music box three times, once to play the
‘Star-spangled Banner,’ then a Sousa march, and then
the ‘Star-spangled Banner’ again.  It must be an
American millionaire, and he’s evidently got a very big
price for it; he’s just beaming and chuckling with
satisfaction.”

“Hush! no, don’t.  Let’s buy some of
his sketches, quick, before we are supposed to know that
he’s famous; otherwise he’ll be doubling the
prices.  I am so glad he’s had a success at
last.  I always believed in him, you know.”

For the sum of ten shillings each Miss Strubble acquired the
drawings of the camel dying in Upper Berkeley Street and of the
giraffes quenching their thirst in Trafalgar Square; at the same
price Mrs. Nougat-Jones secured the study of roosting
sand-grouse.  A more ambitious picture, “Wolves and
wapiti fighting on the steps of the Athenæum Club,”
found a purchaser at fifteen shillings.

“And now what are your plans?” asked a young man
who contributed occasional paragraphs to an artistic weekly.

“Ah, there is nossing in it.  One starves. 
Till to-day I have sold not one of my sketches.  To-night
you have bought a few, because I am going away from you, but at
other times, not one.”

“Ah, the rich American,” chuckled the
artist.  “God be thanked.  He dash his car right
into our herd of schwines as they were being driven out to the
fields.  Many of our best schwines he killed, but he paid
all damages.  He paid perhaps more than they were worth,
many times more than they would have fetched in the market after
a month of fattening, but he was in a hurry to get on to
Dantzig.  When one is in a hurry one must pay what one is
asked.  God be thanked for rich Americans, who are always in
a hurry to get somewhere else.  My father and mother, they
have now so plenty of money; they send me some to pay my debts
and come home.  I start on Monday for Stolpmünde and I
do not come back.  Never.”

In time he will be forgotten, but at present Knopfschrank is
almost as sore a subject as Sledonti with some of the frequenters
of the Nuremberg Restaurant, Owl Street, Soho.' WHERE id = 'd00a72c9-4c8f-44a9-9e4f-e77bd3c50827';
