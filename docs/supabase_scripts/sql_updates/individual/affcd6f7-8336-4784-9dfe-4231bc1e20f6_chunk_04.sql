“He trusted in the might of the King of England,” replied Grandfather,
      “and thought himself safe under the shelter of the throne. If no dispute
      had arisen between the king and the people, Hutchinson would have had the
      character of a wise, good, and patriotic magistrate. But, from the time
      that he took part against the rights of his country, the people’s love and
      respect were turned to scorn and hatred, and he never had another hour of
      peace.”

In order to show what a fierce and dangerous spirit was now aroused among
      the inhabitants, Grandfather related a passage from history which we shall
      call The Hutchinson Mob.

On the evening of the 26th of August, 1765, a bonfire was kindled in King
      Street. It flamed high upward, and threw a ruddy light over the front of
      the Town House, on which was displayed a carved representation of the
      royal arms. The gilded vane of the cupola glittered in the blaze. The
      kindling of this bonfire was the well-known signal for the populace of
      Boston to assemble in the street.

Before the tar-barrels, of which the bonfire was made, were half burned
      out, a great crowd had come together. They were chiefly laborers and
      seafaring men, together with many young apprentices, and all those idle
      people about town who are ready for any kind of mischief. Doubtless some
      school-boys were among them.

While these rough figures stood round the blazing bonfire, you might hear
      them speaking bitter words against the high officers of the province.
      Governor Bernard, Hutchinson, Oliver, Storey, Hallowell, and other men
      whom King George delighted to honor, were reviled as traitors to the
      country. Now and then, perhaps, an officer of the crown passed along the
      street, wearing the gold-laced hat, white wig, and embroidered waistcoat
      which were the fashion of the day. But when the people beheld him they set
      up a wild and angry howl; and their faces had an evil aspect, which was
      made more terrible by the flickering blaze of the bonfire.

“I should like to throw the traitor right into that blaze!” perhaps one
      fierce rioter would say.

“Yes; and all his brethren too!” another might reply; “and the governor
      and old Tommy Hutchinson into the hottest of it!”

“And the Earl of Bute along with them!” muttered a third; “and burn the
      whole pack of them under King George’s nose! No matter if it singed him!”

Some such expressions as these, either shouted aloud or muttered under the
      breath, were doubtless heard in King Street. The mob, meanwhile, were
      growing fiercer and fiercer, and seemed ready even to set the town on fire
      for the sake of burning the king’s friends out of house and home. And yet,
      angry as they were, they sometimes broke into a loud roar of laughter, as
      if mischief and destruction were their sport.

But we must now leave the rioters for a time, and take a peep into the
      lieutenant-governor’s splendid mansion. It was a large brick house,
      decorated with Ionic pilasters, and stood in Garden Court Street, near the
      North Square.

While the angry mob in King Street were shouting his name,
      Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson sat quietly in Grandfather’s chair,
      unsuspicious of the evil that was about to fall upon his head. His beloved
      family were in the room with him. He had thrown off his embroidered coat
      and powdered wig, and had on a loose-flowing gown and purple-velvet cap.
      He had likewise laid aside the cares of state and all the thoughts that
      had wearied and perplexed him throughout the day.

Perhaps, in the enjoyment of his home, he had forgotten all about the
      Stamp Act, and scarcely remembered that there was a king, across the
      ocean, who had resolved to make tributaries of the New-Englanders.
      Possibly, too, he had forgotten his own ambition, and would not have
      exchanged his situation, at that moment, to be governor, or even a lord.

The wax candles were now lighted, and showed a handsome room, well
      provided with rich furniture. On the walls hung the pictures of
      Hutchinson’s ancestors, who had been eminent men in their day, and were
      honorably remembered in the history of the country. Every object served to
      mark the residence of a rich, aristocratic gentleman, who held himself
      high above the common people, and could have nothing to fear from them. In
      a corner of the room, thrown carelessly upon a chair, were the scarlet
      robes of the chief justice. This high office, as well as those of
      lieutenant-governor, councillor, and judge of probate, was filled by
      Hutchinson.

Who or what could disturb the domestic quiet of such a great and powerful
      personage as now sat in Grandfather’s chair?

The lieutenant-governor’s favorite daughter sat by his side. She leaned on
      the arm of our great chair, and looked up affectionately into her father’s
      face, rejoicing to perceive that a quiet smile was on his lips. But
      suddenly a shade came across her countenance. She seemed to listen
      attentively, as if to catch a distant sound.

The lieutenant-governor listened. But his ears were duller than those of
      his daughter; he could hear nothing more terrible than the sound of a
      summer breeze, sighing among the tops of the elm-trees.

“No, foolish child!” he replied, playfully patting her cheek. “There is no
      tumult. Our Boston mobs are satisfied with what mischief they have already
      done. The king’s friends need not tremble.”

So Hutchinson resumed his pleasant and peaceful meditations, and again
      forgot that there were any troubles in the world. But his family were
      alarmed, and could not help straining their ears to catch the slightest
      sound. More and more distinctly they heard shouts, and then the trampling
      of many feet. While they were listening, one of the neighbors rushed
      breathless into the room.

“A mob! a terrible mob’!” cried he. “They have broken into Mr. Storey’s
      house, and into Mr. Hallo-well’s, and have made themselves drunk with the
      liquors in his cellar; and now they are coming hither, as wild as so many
      tigers. Flee, lieutenant-governor, for your life! for your life!”

But Hutchinson would not hearken to them. He was an old lawyer; and he
      could not realize that the people would do anything so utterly lawless as
      to assault him in his peaceful home. He was one of King George’s chief
      officers and it would be an insult and outrage upon the king himself if
      the lieutenant-governor should suffer any wrong.

“Have no fears on my account,” said he, “I am perfectly safe. The king’s
      name shall be my protection.”

Yet he bade his family retire into one of the neighboring houses. His
      daughter would have remained; but he forced her away.

The huzzas and riotous uproar of the mob were now heard, close at hand.
      The sound was terrible, and struck Hutchinson with the same sort of dread
      as if an enraged wild beast had broken loose and were roaring for its
      prey. He crept softly to the window. There he beheld an immense concourse
      of people, filling all the street and rolling onward to his house. It was
      like a tempestuous flood, that had swelled beyond its bounds and would
      sweep everything before it. Hutchinson trembled; he felt, at that moment,
      that the wrath of the people was a thousand-fold more terrible than the
      wrath of a king.

That was a moment when a loyalist and an aristocrat like Hutchinson might
      have learned how powerless are kings, nobles, and great men, when the low
      and humble range themselves against them. King George could do nothing for
      his servant now. Had King George been there he could have done nothing for
      himself. If Hutchinson had understood this lesson, and remembered it, he
      need not, in after years, have been an exile from his native country, nor
      finally have laid his bones in a distant land.

There was now a rush against the doors of the house. The people sent up a
      hoarse cry. At this instant the lieutenant-governor’s daughter, whom he
      had supposed to be in a place of safety, ran into the room and threw her
      arms around him. She had returned by a private entrance.

“Father, are you mad?” cried she. “Will the king’s name protect you now?
      Come with me, or they will have your life.”

“True,” muttered Hutchinson to himself; “what care these roarers for the
      name of king? I must flee, or they will trample me down on the floor of my
      own dwelling.”

Hurrying away, he and his daughter made their escape by the private
      passage at the moment when the rioters broke into the house. The foremost
      of them rushed up the staircase, and entered the room which Hutchinson had
      just quitted. There they beheld our good old chair facing them with quiet
      dignity, while the lion’s head seemed to move its jaws in the unsteady
      light of their torches. Perhaps the stately aspect of our venerable
      friend, which had stood firm through a century and a half of trouble,
      arrested them for an instant. But they were thrust forward by those
      behind, and the chair lay overthrown.

Then began the work of destruction. The carved and polished mahogany
      tables were shattered with heavy clubs and hewn to splinters with axes.
      The marble hearths and mantel-pieces were broken. The volumes of
      Hutchinson’s library, so precious to a studious man, were torn out of
      their covers, and the leaves sent flying out of the windows. Manuscripts,
      containing secrets of our country’s history, which are now lost forever,
      were scattered to the winds.

The old ancestral portraits, whose fixed countenances looked down on the
      wild scene, were rent from the walls. The mob triumphed in their downfall
      and destruction, as if these pictures of Hutchinson’s forefathers had
      committed the same offences as their descendant. A tall looking-glass,
      which had hitherto presented a reflection of the enraged and drunken
      multitude, was now smashed into a thousand fragments. We gladly dismiss
      the scene from the mirror of our fancy.

Before morning dawned the walls of the house were all that remained. The
      interior was a dismal scene of ruin. A shower pattered in at the broken
      windows; and when Hutchinson and his family returned, they stood shivering
      in the same room where the last evening had seen them so peaceful and
      happy.

“Grandfather,” said Laurence, indignantly, “if the people acted in this
      manner, they were not worthy of even so much liberty as the King of
      England was willing to allow them.”

“It was a most unjustifiable act, like many other popular movements at
      that time,” replied Grandfather. “But we must not decide against the
      justice of the people’s cause merely because an excited mob was guilty of
      outrageous violence. Besides, all these things were done in the first fury
      of resentment. Afterwards the people grew more calm, and were more
      influenced by the counsel of those wise and good men who conducted them
      safely and gloriously through the Revolution.”

Little Alice, with tears in her blue eyes, said that she hoped the
      neighbors had not let Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson and his family be
      homeless in the street, but had taken them into their houses and been kind
      to them. Cousin Clara, recollecting the perilous situation of our beloved
      chair, inquired what had become of it.

“Nothing was heard of our chair for some time afterwards,” answered
      Grandfather. “One day in September, the same Andrew Oliver, of whom I
      before told you, was summoned to appear at high noon under Liberty Tree.
      This was the strangest summons that had ever been heard of; for it was
      issued in the name of the whole people, who thus took upon themselves the
      authority of a sovereign power. Mr. Oliver dared not disobey. Accordingly,
      at the appointed hour he went, much against his will, to Liberty Tree.”

Here Charley interposed a remark that poor Mr. Oliver found but little
      liberty under Liberty Tree. Grandfather assented.

“It was a stormy day,” continued he. “The equinoctial gale blew violently,
      and scattered the yellow leaves of Liberty Tree all along the street. Mr.
      Oliver’s wig was dripping with water-drops; and he probably looked
      haggard, disconsolate, and humbled to the earth. Beneath the tree, in
      Grandfather’s chair,—our own venerable chair,—sat Mr. Richard
      Dana, a justice of the peace. He administered an oath to Mr. Oliver that
      he would never have anything to do with distributing the stamps. A vast
      concourse of people heard the oath, and shouted when it was taken.”

“There is something grand in this,” said Laurence. “I like it, because the
      people seem to have acted with thoughtfulness and dignity; and this proud
      gentleman, one of his Majesty’s high officers, was made to feel that King
      George could not protect him in doing wrong.”

“But it was a sad day for poor Mr. Oliver,” observed Grandfather. “From
      his youth upward it had probably been the great principle of his life to
      be faithful and obedient to the king. And now, in his old age, it must
      have puzzled and distracted him to find the sovereign people setting up a
      claim to his faith and obedience.”

Grandfather closed the evening’s conversation by saying that the
      discontent of America was so great, that, in 1766, the British Parliament
      was compelled to repeal the Stamp Act. The people made great rejoicings,
      but took care to keep Liberty Tree well pruned and free from caterpillars
      and canker-worms. They foresaw that there might yet be occasion for them
      to assemble under its far-projecting shadow.

THE NEXT evening, Clara, who remembered that our chair had been left
      standing in the rain under Liberty Tree, earnestly besought Grandfather to
      tell when and where it had next found shelter. Perhaps she was afraid that
      the venerable chair, by being exposed to the inclemency of a September
      gale, might get the rheumatism in its aged joints.

“The chair,” said Grandfather, “after the ceremony of Mr. Oliver’s oath,
      appears to have been quite forgotten by the multitude. Indeed, being much
      bruised and rather rickety, owing to the violent treatment it had suffered
      from the Hutchinson mob, most people would have thought that its days of
      usefulness were over. Nevertheless, it was conveyed away under cover of
      the night and committed to the care of a skilful joiner. He doctored our
      old friend so successfully, that, in the course of a few days, it made its
      appearance in the public room of the British Coffee Houses in King
      Street.”

“I know not,” answered Grandfather, “unless he considered it a dishonor
      and disgrace to the chair to have stood under Liberty Tree. At all events,
      he suffered it to remain at the British Coffee House, which was the
      principal hotel in Boston. It could not possibly have found a situation
      where it would be more in the midst of business and bustle, or would
      witness more important events, or be occupied by a greater variety of
      persons.”

Grandfather went on to tell the proceedings of the despotic king and
      ministry of England after the repeal of the Stamp Act. They could not bear
      to think that their right to tax America should be disputed by the people.
      In the year 1767, therefore, they caused Parliament to pass an act for
      laying a duty on tea and some other articles that were in general use.
      Nobody could now buy a pound of tea without paying a tax to King George.
      This scheme was pretty craftily contrived; for the women of America were
      very fond of tea, and did not like to give up the use of it.

But the people were as much opposed to this new act of Parliament as they
      had been to the Stamp Act. England, however, was determined that they
      should submit. In order to compel their obedience, two regiments,
      consisting of more than seven hundred British soldiers, were sent to
      Boston. They arrived in September, 1768, and were landed on Long Wharf.
      Thence they marched to the Common with loaded muskets, fixed bayonets, and
      great pomp and parade. So now, at last, the free town of Boston was
      guarded and overawed by redcoats as it had been in the days of old Sir
      Edmund Andros.

In the month of November more regiments arrived. There were now four
      thousand troops in Boston. The Common was whitened with their tents. Some
      of the soldiers were lodged in Faneuil Hall, which the inhabitants looked
      upon as a consecrated place, because it had been the scene of a great many
      meetings in favor of liberty. One regiment was placed in the Town House,
      which we now call the Old State House. The lower floor of this edifice had
      hitherto been used by the merchants as an exchange. In the upper stories
      were the chambers of the judges, the representatives, and the governor’s
      council. The venerable councillors could not assemble to consult about the
      welfare of the province without being challenged by sentinels and passing
      among the bayonets of the British soldiers.

Sentinels likewise were posted at the lodgings of the officers in many
      parts of the town. When the inhabitants approached they were greeted by
      the sharp question, “Who goes there?” while the rattle of the soldier’s
      musket was heard as he presented it against their breasts. There was no
      quiet even on the sabbath day. The quiet descendants of the Puritans were
      shocked by the uproar of military music; the drum, fife, and bugle
      drowning the holy organ peal and the voices of the singers. It would
      appear as if the British took every method to insult the feelings of the
      people.

“Grandfather,” cried Charley, impatiently, “the people did not go to
      fighting half soon enough! These British redcoats ought to have been
      driven back to their vessels the very moment they landed on Long Wharf.”

“Many a hot-headed young man said the same as you do, Charley,” answered
      Grandfather. “But the elder and wiser people saw that the time was not yet
      come. Meanwhile, let us take another peep at our old chair.”

“Ah, it drooped its head, I know,” said Charley, “when it saw how the
      province was disgraced. Its old Puritan friends never would have borne
      such doings.”

“The chair,” proceeded Grandfather, “was now continually occupied by some
      of the high tories, as the king’s friends were called, who frequented the
      British Coffee House. Officers of the Custom House, too, which stood on
      the opposite side of King Street, often sat in the chair wagging their
      tongues against John Hancock.”

“Because he was a great merchant and contended against paying duties to
      the king,” said Grandfather.

“Well, frequently, no doubt, the officers of the British regiments, when
      not on duty, used to fling themselves into the arms of our venerable
      chair. Fancy one of them, a red-nosed captain in his scarlet uniform,
      playing with the hilt of his sword, and making a circle of his brother
      officers merry with ridiculous jokes at the expense of the poor Yankees.
      And perhaps he would call for a bottle of wine, or a steaming bowl of
      punch, and drink confusion to all rebels.”

“Our grave old chair must have been scandalized at such scenes,” observed
      Laurence; “the chair that had been the Lady Arbella’s, and which the holy
      apostle Eliot had consecrated.”

“It certainly was little less than sacrilege,” replied Grandfather; “but
      the time was coming when even the churches, where hallowed pastors had
      long preached the word of God, were to be torn down or desecrated by the
      British troops. Some years passed, however, before such things were done.”

Grandfather now told his auditors that, in 1769, Sir Francis Bernard went
      to England after having been governor of Massachusetts ten years. He was a
      gentleman of many good qualities, an excellent scholar, and a friend to
      learning. But he was naturally of an arbitrary disposition; and he had
      been bred at the University of Oxford, where young men were taught that
      the divine right of kings was the only thing to be regarded in matters of
      government. Such ideas were ill adapted to please the people of
      Massachusetts. They rejoiced to get rid of Sir Francis Bernard, but liked
      his successor, Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson, no better than himself.

About this period the people were much incensed at an act committed by a
      person who held an office in the Custom House. Some lads, or young men,
      were snowballing his windows. He fired a musket at them, and killed a poor
      German boy, only eleven years old. This event made a great noise in town
      and country, and much increased the resentment that was already felt
      against the servants of the crown.

“Now, children,” said Grandfather, “I wish to make you comprehend the
      position of the British troops in King Street. This is the same which we
      now call State Street. On the south side of the Town House, or Old State
      House, was what military men call a court of guard, defended by two brass
      cannons, which pointed directly at one of the doors of the above edifice.
      A large party of soldiers were always stationed in the court of guard. The
      Custom House stood at a little distance down King Street, nearly where the
      Suffolk Bank now stands, and a sentinel was continually pacing before its
      front.”

“I shall remember this to-morrow,” said Charley; “and I will go to State
      Street, so as to see exactly where the British troops were stationed.”

“And before long,” observed Grandfather, “I shall have to relate an event
      which made King Street sadly famous on both sides of the Atlantic. The
      history of our chair will soon bring us to this melancholy business.”

Here Grandfather described the state of things which arose from the ill
      will that existed between the inhabitants and the redcoats. The old and
      sober part of the townspeople were very angry at the government for
      sending soldiers to overawe them. But those gray-headed men were cautious,
      and kept their thoughts and feelings in their own breasts, without putting
      themselves in the way of the British bayonets.

The younger people, however, could hardly be kept within such prudent
      limits. They reddened with wrath at the very sight of a soldier, and would
      have been willing to come to blows with them at any moment. For it was
      their opinion that every tap of a British drum, within the peninsula of
      Boston was an insult to the brave old town.

“It was sometimes the case,” continued Grandfather, “that affrays happened
      between such wild young men as these and small parties of the soldiers. No
      weapons had hitherto been used except fists or cudgels. But when men have
      loaded muskets in their hands, it is easy to foretell that they will soon
      be turned against the bosoms of those who provoke their anger.”

“Grandfather,” said little Alice, looking fearfully into his face, “your
      voice sounds as though you were going to tell us something awful!”

LITTLE ALICE, by her last remark, proved herself a good judge of what was
      expressed by the tones of Grandfather’s voice. He had given the above
      description of the enmity between the townspeople and the soldiers in
      order to Prepare the minds of his auditors for a very terrible event. It
      was one that did more to heighten the quarrel between England and America
      than anything that had yet occurred.

It was now the 8d of March, 1770. The sunset music of the British
      regiments was heard as usual throughout the town. The shrill fife and
      rattling drum awoke the echoes in King Street, while the last ray of
      sunshine was lingering on the cupola of the Town House. And now all the
      sentinels were posted. One of them marched up and down before the Custom
      House, treading a short path through the snow, and longing for the time
      when he would be dismissed to the warm fireside of the guard room.
      Meanwhile Captain Preston was, perhaps, sitting in our great chair before
      the hearth of the British Coffee House. In the course of the evening there
      were two or three slight commotions, which seemed to indicate that trouble
      was at hand. Small parties of young men stood at the corners of the
      streets or walked along the narrow pavements. Squads of soldiers who were
      dismissed from duty passed by them, shoulder to shoulder, with the regular
      step which they had learned at the drill. Whenever these encounters took
      place, it appeared to be the object of the young men to treat the soldiers
      with as much incivility as possible.

“Turn out, you lobsterbacks!” one would say. “Crowd them off the
      sidewalks!” another would cry. “A redcoat has no right in Boston streets!”

“O, you rebel rascals!” perhaps the soldiers would reply, glaring fiercely
      at the young men. “Some day or other we’ll make our way through Boston
      streets at the point of the bayonet!”

Once or twice such disputes as these brought on a scuffle; which passed
      off, however, without attracting much notice. About eight o’clock, for
      some unknown cause, an alarm-bell rang loudly and hurriedly.

At the sound many people ran out of their houses, supposing it to be an
      alarm of fire. But there were no flames to be seen, nor was there any
      smell of smoke in the clear, frosty air; so that most of the townsmen went
      back to their own firesides and sat talking with their wives and children
      about the calamities of the times. Others who were younger and less
      prudent remained in the streets; for there seems to have been a
      presentiment that some strange event was on the eve of taking place.

Later in the evening, not far from nine o’clock, several young men passed
      by the Town House and walked down King Street. The sentinel was still on
      his post in front of the Custom House, pacing to and fro; while, as he
      turned, a gleam of light from some neighboring window glittered on the
      barrel of his musket. At no great distance were the barracks and the
      guard-house, where his comrades were probably telling stories of battle
      and bloodshed.

Down towards the Custom House, as I told you, came a party of wild young
      men. When they drew near the sentinel he halted on his post, and took his
      musket from his shoulder, ready to present the bayonet at their breasts.

“Who goes there?” he cried, in the gruff, peremptory tones of a soldier’s
      challenge. The young men, being Boston boys, felt as if they had a right
      to walk their own streets without being accountable to a British redcoat,
      even though he challenged them in King George’s name. They made some rude
      answer to the sentinel. There was a dispute, or perhaps a scuffle. Other
      soldiers heard the noise, and ran hastily from the barracks to assist
      their comrades. At the same time many of the townspeople rushed into King
      Street by various avenues, and gathered in a crowd round about the Custom
      House. It seemed wonderful how such a multitude had started up all of a
      sudden.

The wrongs and insults which the people had been suffering for many months
      now kindled them into a rage. They threw snowballs and lumps of ice at the
      soldiers. As the tumult grew louder it reached the ears of Captain
      Preston, the officer of the day. He immediately ordered eight soldiers of
      the main guard to take their muskets and follow him. They marched across
      the street, forcing their way roughly through the crowd, and pricking the
      townspeople with their bayonets.

A gentleman (it was Henry Knox, afterwards general of the American
      artillery) caught Captain Preston’s arm.

“Stand aside!” answered Captain Preston, haughtily. “Do not interfere,
      sir. Leave me to manage the affair.”

Arriving at the sentinel’s post, Captain Preston drew up his men in a
      semicircle, with their faces to the crowd and their rear to the Custom
      House. When the people saw the officer and beheld the threatening attitude
      with which the soldiers fronted them, their rage became almost
      uncontrollable.

“Rush upon them!” shouted many voices. “Drive the rascals to their
      barracks! Down with them! Down with them! Let them fire if they dare!”

Amid the uproar, the soldiers stood glaring at the people with the
      fierceness of men whose trade was to shed blood.

Oh, what a crisis had now arrived! Up to this very moment, the angry
      feelings between England and America might have been pacified. England had
      but to stretch out the hand of reconciliation, and acknowledge that she
      had hitherto mistaken her rights, but would do so no more. Then the
      ancient bonds of brotherhood would again have been knit together as firmly
      as in old times. The habit of loyalty, which had grown as strong as
      instinct, was not utterly overcome. The perils shared, the victories won,
      in the old French War, when the soldiers of the colonies fought side by
      side with their comrades from beyond the sea, were unforgotten yet.
      England was still that beloved country which the colonists called their
      home. King George, though he had frowned upon America, was still
      reverenced as a father.

But should the king’s soldiers shed one drop of American blood, then it
      was a quarrel to the death. Never, never would America rest satisfied
      until she had torn down the royal authority and trampled it in the dust.

“Fire, if you dare, villains!” hoarsely shouted the people, while the
      muzzles of the muskets were turned upon them. “You dare not fire!”

They appeared ready to rush upon the levelled bayonets. Captain Preston
      waved his sword, and uttered a command which could not be distinctly heard
      amid the uproar of shouts that issued from a hundred throats. But his
      soldiers deemed that he had spoken the fatal mandate, “Fire!” The flash of
      their muskets lighted up the streets, and the report rang loudly between
      the edifices. It was said, too, that the figure of a man, with a cloth
      hanging down over his face, was seen to step into the balcony of the
      Custom House and discharge a musket at the crowd.

A gush of smoke had overspread the scene. It rose heavily, as if it were
      loath to reveal the dreadful spectacle beneath it. Eleven of the sons of
      New England lay stretched upon the street. Some, sorely wounded, were
      struggling to rise again. Others stirred not nor groaned; for they were
      past all pain. Blood was streaming upon the snow; and that purple stain in
      the midst of King Street, though it melted away in the next day’s sun, was
      never forgotten nor forgiven by the people.

Grandfather was interrupted by the violent sobs of little Alice. In his
      earnestness he had neglected to soften clown the narrative so that it
      might not terrify the heart of this unworldly infant. Since Grandfather
      began the history of our chair, little Alice had listened to many tales of
      war. But probably the idea had never really impressed itself upon her mind
      that men have shed the blood of their fellow-creatures. And now that this
      idea was forcibly presented to her, it affected the sweet child with
      bewilderment and horror.

“I ought to have remembered our dear little Alice,” said Grandfather
      reproachfully to himself. “Oh, what a pity! Her heavenly nature has now
      received its first impression of earthly sin and violence. Well, Clara,
      take her to bed and comfort her. Heaven grant that she may dream away the
      recollection of the Boston massacre!”

“Grandfather,” said Charley, when Clara and little Alice had retired, “did
      not the people rush upon the soldiers and take revenge?”

“The town drums beat to arms,” replied Grandfather, “the alarm-bells rang,
      and an immense multitude rushed into King Street. Many of them had weapons
      in their hands. The British prepared to defend themselves. A whole
      regiment was drawn up in the street, expecting an attack; for the townsmen
      appeared ready to throw themselves upon the bayonets.”

“Governor Hutchinson hurried to the spot,” said Grandfather, “and besought
      the people to have patience, promising that strict justice should be done.
      A day or two afterward the British troops were withdrawn from town and
      stationed at Castle William. Captain Preston and the eight soldiers were
      tried for murder. But none of them were found guilty. The judges told the
      jury that the insults and violence which had been offered to the soldiers
      justified them in firing at the mob.”

“The Revolution,” observed Laurence, who had said but little during the
      evening, “was not such a calm, majestic movement as I supposed. I do not
      love to hear of mobs and broils in the street. These things were unworthy
      of the people when they had such a great object to accomplish.”

“Nevertheless, the world has seen no grander movement than that of our
      Revolution from first to last,” said Grandfather. “The people, to a man,
      were full of a great and noble sentiment. True, there may be much fault to
      find with their mode of expressing this sentiment; but they knew no
      better; the necessity was upon them to act out their feelings in the best
      manner they could. We must forgive what was wrong in their actions, and
      look into their hearts and minds for the honorable motives that impelled
      them.”

“And I suppose,” said Laurence, “there were men who knew how to act
      worthily of what they felt.”

Grandfather here made a pause. That night Charley had a dream about the
      Boston massacre, and thought that he himself was in the crowd and struck
      down Captain Preston with a great club. Laurence dreamed that he was
      sitting in our great chair, at the window of the British Coffee House, and
      beheld the whole scene which Grandfather had described. It seemed to him,
      in his dream, that, if the townspeople and the soldiers would but have
      heard him speak a single word, all the slaughter might have been averted.
      But there was such an uproar that it drowned his voice.

The next morning the two boys went together to State Street and stood on
      the very spot where the first blood of the Revolution had been shed. The
      Old State House was still there, presenting almost the same aspect that it
      had worn on that memorable evening, one-and-seventy years ago. It is the
      sole remaining witness of the Boston massacre.

THE NEXT evening the astral lamp was lighted earlier than usual, because
      Laurence was very much engaged in looking over the collection of portraits
      which had been his New-Year’s gift from Grandfather.

Among them he found the features of more than one famous personage who had
      been connected with the adventures of our old chair. Grandfather bade him
      draw the table nearer to the fireside; and they looked over the portraits
      together, while Clara and Charley likewise lent their attention. As for
      little Alice, she sat in Grandfather’s lap, and seemed to see the very men
      alive whose faces were there represented.

Turning over the volume, Laurence came to the portrait of a stern,
      grim-looking man, in plain attire, of much more modern fashion than that
      of the old Puritans. But the face might well have befitted one of those
      iron-hearted men. Beneath the portrait was the name of Samuel Adams.

“He was a man of great note in all the doings that brought about the
      Revolution,” said Grandfather. “His character was such, that it seemed as
      if one of the ancient Puritans had been sent back to earth to animate the
      people’s hearts with the same abhorrence of tyranny that had distinguished
      the earliest settlers. He was as religious as they, as stern and
      inflexible, and as deeply imbued with democratic principles. He, better
      than any one else, may be taken as a representative of the people of New
      England, and of the spirit with which they engaged in the Revolutionary
      struggle. He was a poor man, and earned his bread by a humble occupation;
      but with his tongue and pen he made the King of England tremble on his
      throne. Remember him, my children, as one of the strong men of our
      country.”

“Here is one whose looks show a very different character,” observed
      Laurence, turning to the portrait of John Hancock. “I should think, by his
      splendid dress and courtly aspect, that he was one of the king’s friends.”

“There never was a greater contrast than between Samuel Adams and John
      Hancock,” said Grandfather. “Yet they were of the same side in politics,
      and had an equal agency in the Revolution. Hancock was born to the
      inheritance of the largest fortune in New England. His tastes and habits
      were aristocratic. He loved gorgeous attire, a splendid mansion,
      magnificent furniture, stately festivals, and all that was glittering and
      pompous in external things. His manners were so polished that there stood
      not a nobleman at the footstool of King George’s throne who was a more
      skilful courtier than John Hancock might have been. Nevertheless, he in
      his embroidered clothes, and Samuel Adams in his threadbare coat, wrought
      together in the cause of liberty. Adams acted from pure and rigid
      principle. Hancock, though he loved his country, yet thought quite as much
      of his own popularity as he did of the people’s rights. It is remarkable
      that these two men, so very different as I describe them, were the only
      two exempted from pardon by the king’s proclamation.”

On the next leaf of the book was the portrait of General Joseph Warren.
      Charley recognized the name, and said that here was a greater man than
      either Hancock or Adams.

“Warren was an eloquent and able patriot,” replied Grandfather. “He
      deserves a lasting memory for his zealous efforts in behalf of liberty. No
      man’s voice was more powerful in Faneuil Hall than Joseph Warren’s. If his
      death had not happened so early in the contest, he would probably have
      gained a high name as a soldier.”

The next portrait was a venerable man, who held his thumb under his chin,
      and, through his spectacles, appeared to be attentively reading a
      manuscript.

“Here we see the most illustrious Boston boy that ever lived,” said
      Grandfather. “This is Benjamin Franklin. But I will not try to compress
      into a few sentences the character of the sage, who, as a Frenchman
      expressed it, snatched the lightning from the sky and the sceptre from a
      tyrant. Mr. Sparks must help you to the knowledge of Franklin.”

The book likewise contained portraits of James Otis and Josiah Quincy.
      Both of them, Grandfather observed, were men of wonderful talents and true
      patriotism. Their voices were like the stirring tones of a trumpet
      arousing the country to defend its freedom. Heaven seemed to have provided
      a greater number of eloquent men than had appeared at any other period, in
      order that the people might be fully instructed as to their wrongs and the
      method of resistance.

“It is marvellous,” said Grandfather, “to see how many powerful writers,
      orators, and soldiers started up just at the time when they were wanted.
      There was a man for every kind of work. It is equally wonderful that men
      of such different characters were all made to unite in the one object of
      establishing the freedom and independence of America. There was an
      over-ruling Providence above them.”

“Yes; an earnest, warm-tempered, honest and most able man,” said
      Grandfather. “At the period of which we are now speaking he was a lawyer
      in Boston. He was destined in after years to be ruler over the whole
      American people, whom he contributed so much to form into a nation.”

Grandfather here remarked that many a New-Englander, who had passed his
      boyhood and youth in obscurity, afterward attained to a fortune which he
      never could have foreseen even in his most ambitious dreams. John Adams,
      the second President of the United States and the equal of crowned kings,
      was once a schoolmaster and country lawyer. Hancock, the first signer of
      the Declaration of Independence, served his apprenticeship with a
      merchant. Samuel Adams, afterwards governor of Massachusetts, was a small
      tradesman and a tax-gatherer. General Warren was a physician, General
      Lincoln a farmer, and General Knox a bookbinder. General Nathaniel Greene,
      the best soldier, except Washington, in the Revolutionary army, was a
      Quaker and a blacksmith. All these became illustrious men, and can never
      be forgotten in American history.

“And any boy who is born in America may look forward to the same things,”
       said our ambitious friend Charley.

After these observations, Grandfather drew the book of portraits towards
      him and showed the children several British peers and members of
      Parliament who had exerted themselves either for or against the rights of
      America. There were the Earl of Bute, Mr. Grenville, and Lord North. These
      were looked upon as deadly enemies to our country.

Among the friends of America was Mr. Pitt, afterward Earl of Chatham, who
      spent so much of his wondrous eloquence in endeavoring to warn England of
      the consequences of her injustice. He fell down on the floor of the House
      of Lords after uttering almost his dying words in defence of our
      privileges as freemen. There was Edmund Burke, one of the wisest men and
      greatest orators that ever the world produced. There was Colonel Barry,
      who had been among our fathers, and knew that they had courage enough to
      die for their rights. There was Charles James Fox, who never rested until
      he had silenced our enemies in the House of Commons.

“It is very remarkable to observe how many of the ablest orators in the
      British Parliament were favorable to America,” said Grandfather. “We ought
      to remember these great Englishmen with gratitude; for their speeches
      encouraged our fathers almost as much as those of our own orators in
      Faneuil Hall and under Liberty Tree. Opinions which might have been
      received with doubt, if expressed only by a native American, were set down
      as true, beyond dispute, when they came from the lips of Chatham, Burke,
      Barre, or Fox.”

“But, Grandfather,” asked Lawrence, “were there no able and eloquent men
      in this country who took the part of King George?”

“There were many men of talent who said what they could in defence of the
      king’s tyrannical proceedings,” replied Grandfather. “But they had the
      worst side of the argument, and therefore seldom said anything worth
      remembering. Moreover, their hearts were faint and feeble; for they felt
      that the people scorned and detested them. They had no friends, no
      defence, except in the bayonets of the British troops. A blight fell upon
      all their faculties, because they were contending against the rights of
      their own native land.”

“Governor Hutchinson, Chief Justice Oliver, Judge Auchmuty, the Rev.
      Mather Byles, and several other clergymen, were among the most noted
      loyalists,” answered Grandfather.

“That wish is very wrong, Charley,” said Grandfather. “You must not think
      that there is no integrity and honor except among those who stood up for
      the freedom of America. For aught I know, there was quite as much of these
      qualities on one side as on the other. Do you see nothing admirable in a
      faithful adherence to an unpopular cause? Can you not respect that
      principle of loyalty which made the royalists give up country, friends,
      fortune, everything, rather than be false to their king? It was a mistaken
      principle; but many of them cherished it honorably, and were martyrs to
      it.”

“And I would risk my life rather than one of those good old royalists
      should be tarred and feathered.”

“The time is now come when we may judge fairly of them,” continued
      Grandfather. “Be the good and true men among them honored; for they were
      as much our countrymen as the patriots were. And, thank Heaven, our
      country need not be ashamed of her sons,—of most of them at least,—whatever
      side they took in the Revolutionary contest.”

Among the portraits was one of King George III Little Alice clapped her
      hands, and seemed pleased with the bluff good-nature of his physiognomy.
      But Laurence thought it strange that a man with such a face, indicating
      hardly a common share of intellect, should have had influence enough on
      human affairs to convulse the world with war. Grandfather observed that
      this poor king had always appeared to him one of the most unfortunate
      persons that ever lived. He was so honest and conscientious, that, if he
      had been only a private man, his life would probably have been blameless
      and happy. But his was that worst of fortunes,—to be placed in a
      station far beyond his abilities.

“And so,” said Grandfather, “his life, while he retained what intellect
      Heaven had gifted him with, was one long mortification. At last he grew
      crazed with care and trouble. For nearly twenty years the men arch of
      England was confined as a madman. In his old age, too, God took away his
      eyesight; so that his royal palace was nothing to him but a dark, lonesome
      prison-house.”

“OUR old chair?” resumed Grandfather, “did not now stand in the midst of a
      gay circle of British officers. The troops, as I told you, had been
      removed to Castle William immediately after the Boston massacre. Still,
      however, there were many tories, custom-house officers, and Englishmen who
      used to assemble in the British Coffee House and talk over the affairs of
      the period. Matters grew worse and worse; and in 1773 the people did a
      deed which incensed the king and ministry more than any of their former
      doings.”

Grandfather here described the affair, which is known by the name of the
      Boston Tea Party. The Americans, for some time past, had left off
      importing tea, on account of the oppressive tax. The East India Company,
      in London, had a large stock of tea on hand, which they had expected to
      sell to the Americans, but could find no market for it. But after a while,
      the government persuaded this company of merchants to send the tea to
      America.

“How odd it is,” observed Clara, “that the liberties of America should
      have had anything to do with a cup of tea!”

Grandfather smiled, and proceeded with his narrative. When the people of
      Boston heard that several cargoes of tea were coming across the Atlantic,
      they held a great many meetings at Faneuil Hall, in the Old South Church,
      and under Liberty Tree. In the midst of their debates, three ships arrived
      in the harbor with the tea on board. The people spent more than a
      fortnight in consulting what should be done. At last, on the 16th of
      December, 1773, they demanded of Governor Hutchinson that he should
      immediately send the ships back to England.

The governor replied that the ships must not leave the harbor until the
      custom-house duties upon the tea should be paid. Now, the payment of these
      duties was the very thing against which the people had set their faces;
      because it was a tax unjustly imposed upon America by the English
      government. Therefore, in the dusk of the evening, as soon as Governor
      Hutchinson’s reply was received, an immense crowd hastened to Griffin’s
      Wharf, where the tea-ships lay. The place is now called Liverpool Wharf.

“When the crowd reached the wharf,” said Grandfather, “they saw that a set
      of wild-looking figures were already on board of the ships. You would have
      imagined that the Indian warriors of old times had come back again; for
      they wore the Indian dress, and had their faces covered with red and black
      paint, like the Indians when they go to war. These grim figures hoisted
      the tea-chests on the decks of the vessels; broke them open, and threw all
      the contents into the harbor.”

“Grandfather,” said little Alice, “I suppose Indians don’t love tea; else
      they would never waste it so.”

“They were not real Indians, my child,” answered Grandfather. “They were
      white men in disguise; because a heavy punishment would have been
      inflicted on them if the king’s officers had found who they were. But it
      was never known. From that day to this, though the matter has been talked
      of by all the world, nobody can tell the names of those Indian figures.
      Some people say that there were very famous men among them, who afterwards
      became governors and generals. Whether this be true I cannot tell.”

When tidings of this bold deed were carried to England, King George was
      greatly enraged. Parliament immediately passed an act, by which all
      vessels were forbidden to take in or discharge their cargoes at the port
      of Boston. In this way they expected to ruin all the merchants, and starve
      the poor people, by depriving them of employment. At the same time another
      act was passed, taking away many rights and privileges which had been
      granted in the charter of Massachusetts.

Governor Hutchinson, soon afterward, was summoned to England, in order
      that he might give his advice about the management of American affairs.
      General Gage, an officer of the old French War, and since
      commander-in-chief of the British forces in America, was appointed
      governor in his stead. One of his first acts was to make Salem, instead of
      Boston, the metropolis of Massachusetts, by summoning the General Court to
      meet there.

According to Grandfather’s description, this was the most gloomy time that
      Massachusetts had ever seen. The people groaned under as heavy a tyranny
      as in the days of Sir Edmund Andros. Boston looked as if it were afflicted
      with some dreadful pestilence,—so sad were the inhabitants, and so
      desolate the streets. There was no cheerful hum of business. The merchants
      shut up their warehouses, and the laboring men stood idle about the
      wharves. But all America felt interested in the good town of Boston; and
      contributions were raised, in many places, for the relief of the poor
      inhabitants.

“Oh,” replied Grandfather, “a gay throng of officers had now come back to
      the British Coffee House; so that the old chair had no lack of mirthful
      company. Soon after General Gage became governor a great many troops had
      arrived, and were encamped upon the Common. Boston was now a garrisoned
      and fortified town; for the general had built a battery across the Neck,
      on the road to Roxbury, and placed guards for its defence. Everything
      looked as if a civil war were close at hand.”

“A Continental Congress assembled at Philadelphia,” said Grandfather, “and
      proposed such measures as they thought most conducive to the public good.
      A Provincial Congress was likewise chosen in Massachusetts. They exhorted
      the people to arm and discipline themselves. A great number of minutemen
      were enrolled. The Americans called them minute-men, because they engaged
      to be ready to fight at a minute’s warning. The English officers laughed,
      and said that the name was a very proper one, because the minute-men would
      run away the minute they saw the enemy. Whether they would fight or run
      was soon to be proved.”

Grandfather told the children that the first open resistance offered to
      the British troops, in the province of Massachusetts, was at Salem.
      Colonel Timothy Pickering, with thirty or forty militia-men, prevented the
      English colonel, Leslie, with four times as many regular soldiers, from
      taking possession of some military stores. No blood was shed on this
      occasion; but soon afterward it began to flow.

General Gage sent eight hundred soldiers to Concord, about eighteen miles
      from Boston, to destroy some ammunition and provisions which the colonists
      had collected there. They set out on their march on the evening of the
      18th of April, 1775. The next morning the general sent Lord’ Percy with
      nine hundred men to strengthen the troops that had gone before. All that
      day the inhabitants of Boston heard various rumors. Some said that the
      British were making great slaughter among our countrymen. Others affirmed
      that every man had turned out with his musket, and that not a single
      soldier would ever get back to Boston.

“It was after sunset,” continued Grandfather, “when the troops, who had
      marched forth so proudly, were seen entering Charlestown. They were
      covered with dust, and so hot and weary that their tongues hung out of
      their mouths. Many of them were faint with wounds. They had not all
      returned. Nearly three hundred were strewn, dead or dying, along the road
      from Concord. The yeomanry had risen upon the invaders and driven them
      back.”

“Yes,” replied Grandfather; “it was so called, because the British,
      without provocation, had fired upon a party of minute-men, near Lexington
      meeting-house, and killed eight of them. That fatal volley, which was
      fired by order of Major Pitcairn, began the war of the Revolution.”

About this time, if Grandfather had been correctly informed, our chair
      disappeared from the British Coffee House. The manner of its departure
      cannot be satisfactorily ascertained. Perhaps the keeper of the Coffee
      House turned it out of doors on account of its old-fashioned aspect.
      Perhaps he sold it as a curiosity. Perhaps it was taken, without leave, by
      some person who regarded it as public property because it had once figured
      under Liberty Tree. Or perhaps the old chair, being of a peaceable
      disposition, has made use of its four oaken legs and run away from the
      seat of war.

“Meanwhile,” continued Grandfather, “during the mysterious non-appearance
      of our chair, an army of twenty thousand men had started up and come to
      the siege of Boston. General Gage and his troops were cooped up within the
      narrow precincts of the peninsula. On the 17th of June, 1775, the famous
      battle of Bunker Hill was fought. Here General Warren fell. The British
      got the victory, indeed, but with the loss of more than a thousand
      officers and men.”

“No, Charley,” said Grandfather, “I am not like other historians. Battles
      shall not hold a prominent place in the history of our quiet and
      comfortable old chair. But to-morrow evening, Laurence, Clara, and
      yourself, and dear little Alice too, shall visit the Diorama of Bunker
      Hill. There you shall see the whole business, the burning of Charlestown
      and all, with your own eyes, and hear the cannon and musketry with your
      own ears.”

THE next evening but one, when the children had given Grandfather a full
      account of the Diorama of Bunker Hill, they entreated him not to keep them
      any longer in suspense about the fate of his chair. The reader will
      recollect that, at the last accounts, it had trotted away upon its poor
      old legs nobody knew whither. But, before gratifying their curiosity,
      Grandfather found it necessary to say something about public events.

The Continental Congress, which was assembled at Philadelphia, was
      composed of delegates from all the colonies. They had now appointed George
      Washington, of Virginia, to be commander-in-chief of all the American
      armies. He was, at that time, a member of Congress; but immediately left
      Philadelphia, and began his journey to Massachusetts. On the 3d of July,
      1775, he arrived at Cambridge, and took command of the troops which were
      besieging General Gage.

“O Grandfather,” exclaimed Laurence, “it makes my heart throb to think
      what is coming now. We are to see General Washington himself.”

The children crowded around Grandfather and looked earnestly into his
      face. Even little Alice opened her sweet blue eyes, with her lips apart,
      and almost held her breath to listen; so instinctive is the reverence of
      childhood for the father of his country.

Grandfather paused a moment; for he felt as if it might be irreverent to
      introduce the hallowed shade of Washington into a history where an ancient
      elbow-chair occupied the most prominent place. However, he determined to
      proceed with his narrative, and speak of the hero when it was needful, but
      with an unambitious simplicity.

So Grandfather told his auditors, that, on General Washington’s arrival at
      Cambridge, his first care was to reconnoitre the British troops with his
      spy-glass, and to examine the condition of his own army. He found that the
      American troops amounted to about fourteen thousand men. They were
      extended all round the peninsula of Boston, a space of twelve miles, from
      the high grounds of Roxbury on the right to Mystic River on the left. Some
      were living in tents of sailcloth, some in shanties rudely constructed of
      boards, some in huts of stone or turf with curious windows and doors of
      basket-work.

In order to be near the centre and oversee the whole of this
      wide-stretched army, the commander-in-chief made his headquarters at
      Cambridge, about half a mile from the colleges. A mansion-house, which
      perhaps had been the country seat of some Tory gentle man, was provided
      for his residence.

“When General Washington first entered this mansion,” said Grandfather,
      “he was ushered up the staircase and shown into a handsome apartment. He
      sat down in a large chair, which was the most conspicuous object in the
      room. The noble figure of Washington would have done honor to a throne. As
      he sat there, with his hand resting on the hilt of his sheathed sword,
      which was placed between his knees, his whole aspect well befitted the
      chosen man on whom his country leaned for the defence of her dearest
      rights. America seemed safe under his protection. His face was grander
      than any sculptor had ever wrought in marble; none could behold him
      without awe and reverence. Never before had the lion’s head at the summit
      of the chair looked down upon such a face and form as Washington’s.”

“Why, Grandfather!” cried Clara, clasping her hands in amazement, “was it
      really so? Did General Washington sit in our great chair?”

“I knew how it would be,” said Laurence; “I foresaw it the moment
      Grandfather began to speak.”

Grandfather smiled. But, turning from the personal and domestic life of
      the illustrious leader, he spoke of the methods which Washington adopted
      to win back the metropolis of New England from the British.

The army, when he took command of it, was without any discipline or order.
      The privates considered themselves as good as their officers; and seldom
      thought it necessary to obey their commands, unless they understood the
      why and wherefore. Moreover, they were enlisted for so short a period,
      that, as soon as they began to be respectable soldiers, it was time to
      discharge them. Then came new recruits, who had to be taught their duty
      before they could be of any service. Such was the army with which
      Washington had to contend against more than twenty veteran British
      regiments.

Some of the men had no muskets, and almost all were without bayonets.
      Heavy cannon, for battering the British fortifications, were much wanted.
      There was but a small quantity of powder and ball, few tools to build
      intrenchments with, and a great deficiency of provisions and clothes for
      the soldiers. Yet, in spite of these perplexing difficulties, the eyes of
      the whole people were fixed on General Washington, expecting him to
      undertake some great enterprise against the hostile army.

The first thing that he found necessary was to bring his own men into
      better order and discipline. It is wonderful how soon he transformed this
      rough mob of country people into the semblance of a regular army. One of
      Washington’s most invaluable characteristics was the faculty of bringing
      order out of confusion. All business with which he had any concern seemed
      to regulate itself as if by magic. The influence of his mind was like
      light gleaming through an unshaped world. It was this faculty, more than
      any other, that made him so fit to ride upon the storm of the Revolution
      when everything was unfixed and drifting about in a troubled sea.

“Washington had not been long at the head of the army,” proceeded
      Grandfather, “before his soldiers thought as highly of him as if he had
      led them to a hundred victories. They knew that he was the very man whom
      the country needed, and the only one who could bring them safely through
      the great contest against the might of England. They put entire confidence
      in his courage, wisdom, and integrity.”

“Doubtless they would have gone whithersoever his sword pointed the way,”
       answered Grandfather; “and Washington was anxious to make a decisive
      assault upon the enemy. But as the enterprise was very hazardous, he
      called a council of all the generals in the army. Accordingly they came
      from their different posts, and were ushered into the reception-room. The
      commander-in-chief arose from our great chair to greet them.”

“There was General Artemas Ward,” replied Grandfather, “a lawyer by
      profession. He had commanded the troops before Washington’s arrival
      Another was General Charles Lee, who had been a colonel in the English
      army, and was thought to possess vast military science. He came to the
      council, followed by two or three dogs which were always at his heels.
      There was General Putnam, too, who was known all over New England by the
      name of Old Put.”

“The same,” said Grandfather; “and he had done good service in the old
      French War. His occupation was that of a farmer; but he left his plough in
      the furrow at the news of Lexington battle. Then there was General Gates,
      who afterward gained great renown at Saratoga, and lost it again at
      Camden. General Greene, of Rhode Island, was likewise at the council.
      Washington soon discovered him to be one of the best officers in the
      army.”

When the generals were all assembled, Washington consulted them about a
      plan for storming the English batteries. But it was their unanimous
      opinion that so perilous an enterprise ought not to be attempted. The
      army, therefore, continued to besiege Boston, preventing the enemy from
      obtaining supplies of provisions, but without taking any immediate
      measures to get possession of the town. In ‘this manner the sum met,
      autumn, and winter passed away.

“Many a night, doubtless,” said Grandfather, “after Washington had been
      all day on horseback, galloping from one post of the army to another, he
      used to sit in our great chair, rapt in earnest thought. Had you seen him,
      you might have supposed that his whole mind was fixed on the blue china
      tiles which adorned the old-fashioned fireplace. But, in reality, he was
      meditating how to capture the British army, or drive it out of Boston.
      Once, when there was a hard frost, he formed a scheme to cross the Charles
      River on the ice. But the other generals could not be persuaded that there
      was any prospect of success.”

“They lay idle in the town,” replied Grandfather. “General Gage had been
      recalled to England, and was succeeded by Sir William Howe. The British
      army and the inhabitants of Boston were now in great distress. Being shut
      up in the town so long, they had consumed almost all their provisions and
      burned up all their fuel. The soldiers tore down the Old North Church, and
      used its rotten boards and timbers for firewood. To heighten their
      distress, the small-pox broke out. They probably lost far more men by
      cold, hunger, and sickness than had been slain at Lexington and Bunker
      Hill.”

“At length,” continued Grandfather, “in March, 1776, General Washington,
      who had now a good supply of powder, began a terrible cannonade and
      bombardment from Dorchester Heights. One of the cannon-balls which he
      fired into the town struck the tower of the Brattle Street Church, where
      it may still be seen. Sir William Howe made preparations to cross over in
      boats and drive the Americans from their batteries, but was prevented by a
      violent gale and storm. General Washington next erected a battery on
      Nook’s Hill, so near the enemy that it was impossible for them to remain
      in Boston any longer.”

“Hurrah! Hurrah!” cried Charley, clapping his hands triumphantly. “I wish
      I had been there to see how sheepish the Englishmen looked.”

And as Grandfather thought that Boston had never witnessed a more
      interesting period than this, when the royal power was in its death agony,
      he determined to take a peep into the town and imagine the feelings of
      those who were quitting it forever.

“ALAS for the poor tories!” said Grandfather. “Until the very last morning
      after Washington’s troops had shown themselves on Nook’s Hill, these
      unfortunate persons could not believe that the audacious rebels, as they
      called the Americans, would ever prevail against King George’s army. But
      when they saw the British soldiers preparing to embark on board of the
      ships of war, then they knew that they had lost their country. Could the
      patriots have known how bitter were their regrets, they would have
      forgiven them all their evil deeds, and sent a blessing after them as they
      sailed away from their native shore.”

In order to make the children sensible of the pitiable condition of these
      men, Grandfather singled out Peter Oliver, chief justice of Massachusetts
      under the crown, and imagined him walking through the streets of Boston on
      the morning before he left it forever.

Old Chief Justice Oliver threw on his red cloak, and placed his
      three-cornered hat on the top of his white wig. In this garb he intended
      to go forth and take a parting look at objects that had been familiar to
      him from his youth. Accordingly, he began his walk in the north part of
      the town, and soon came to Faneuil Hall. This edifice, the cradle of
      liberty, had been used by the British officers as a playhouse.

“Would that I could see its walls crumble to dust!” thought the chief
      justice; and, in the bitterness of his heart, he shook his fist at the
      famous hall. “There began the mischief which now threatens to rend asunder
      the British empire. The seditious harangues of demagogues in Faneuil Hall
      have made rebels of a loyal people and deprived me of my country.”

He then passed through a narrow avenue and found himself in King Street,
      almost on the very spot which, six years before, had been reddened by the
      blood of the Boston massacre. The chief justice stepped cautiously, and
      shuddered, as if he were afraid that, even now, the gore of his
      slaughtered countrymen might stain his feet.

Before him rose the Town House, on the front of which were still displayed
      the royal arms. Within that edifice he had dispensed justice to the people
      in the days when his name was never mentioned without honor. There, too,
      was the balcony whence the trumpet had been sounded and the proclamation
      read to an assembled multitude, whenever a new king of England ascended
      the throne.

“I remember—I remember,” said Chief Justice Oliver to himself, “when
      his present most sacred Majesty was proclaimed. Then how the people
      shouted! Each man would have poured out his life-blood to keep a hair of
      King George’s head from harm. But now there is scarcely a tongue in all
      New England that does not imprecate curses on his name. It is ruin and
      disgrace to love him. Can it be possible that a few fleeting years have
      wrought such a change?”

It did not occur to the chief justice that nothing but the most grievous
      tyranny could so soon have changed the people’s hearts. Hurrying from the
      spot, he entered Cornhill, as the lower part of Washington Street was then
      called. Opposite to the Town House was the waste foundation of the Old
      North Church. The sacrilegious hands of the British soldiers had torn it
      down, and kindled their barrack fires with the fragments.

Farther on he passed beneath the tower of the Old South. The threshold of
      this sacred edifice was worn by the iron tramp of horses’ feet; for the
      interior had been used as a riding-school and rendezvous for a regiment of
      dragoons. As the chief justice lingered an instant at the door a trumpet
      sounded within, and the regiment came clattering forth and galloped down
      the street. They were proceeding to the place of embarkation.

“Let them go!” thought the chief justice, with somewhat of an old Puritan
      feeling in his breast. “No good can come of men who desecrate the house of
      God.”

He went on a few steps farther, and paused before the Province House. No
      range of brick stores had then sprung up to hide the mansion of the royal
      governors from public view. It had a spacious courtyard, bordered with
      trees, and enclosed with a wrought-iron fence. On the cupola that
      surmounted the edifice was the gilded figure of an Indian chief, ready to
      let fly an arrow from his bow. Over the wide front door was a balcony, in
      which the chief justice had often stood when the governor and high
      officers of the province showed themselves to the people.

While Chief Justice Oliver gazed sadly at the Province House, before which
      a sentinel was pacing, the double leaves of the door were thrown open, and
      Sir William Howe made his appearance. Behind him came a throng of
      officers, whose steel scabbards clattered against the stones as they
      hastened down the court-yard. Sir William Howe was a dark-complexioned
      man, stern and haughty in his deportment. He stepped as proudly in that
      hour of defeat as if he were going to receive the submission of the rebel
      general.

“Forward! gentlemen,” said Sir William Howe to the officers who attended
      him; “we have no time to hear lamentations now.”

And, coldly bowing, he departed. Thus the chief justice had a foretaste of
      the mortifications which the exiled New-Englanders afterwards suffered
      from the haughty Britons. They were despised even by that country which
      they had served more faithfully than their own.

A still heavier trial awaited Chief Justice Oliver, as he passed onward
      from the Province House. He was recognized by the people in the street.
      They had long known him as the descendant of an ancient and honorable
      family. They had seen him sitting in his scarlet robes upon the
      judgment-seat. All his life long, either for the sake of his ancestors or
      on account of his own dignified station and unspotted character, he had
      been held in high respect. The old gentry of the province were looked upon
      almost as noblemen while Massachusetts was under royal government.

But now all hereditary reverence for birth and rank was gone. The
      inhabitants shouted in derision when they saw the venerable form of the
      old chief justice. They laid the wrongs of the country and their own
      sufferings during the siege—their hunger, cold, and sickness—partly
      to his charge and to that of his brother Andrew and his kinsman
      Hutchinson. It was by their advice that the king had acted in all the
      colonial troubles. But the day of recompense was come.

“See the old tory!” cried the people, with bitter laughter. “He is taking
      his last look at us. Let him show his white wig among us an hour hence,
      and we’ll give him a coat of tar and feathers!”

The chief justice, however, knew that he need fear no violence so long as
      the British troops were in possession of the town. But, alas! it was a
      bitter thought that he should leave no loving memory behind him. His
      forefathers, long after their spirits left the earth, had been honored in
      the affectionate remembrance of the people. But he, who would henceforth
      be dead to his native land, would have no epitaph save scornful and
      vindictive words. The old man wept.

“They curse me, they invoke all kinds of evil on my head!” thought he, in
      the midst of his tears. “But, if they could read my heart, they would know
      that I love New England well. Heaven bless her, and bring her again under
      the rule of our gracious king! A blessing, too, on these poor, misguided
      people!”

The chief justice flung out his hands with a gesture, as if he were
      bestowing a parting benediction on his countrymen. He had now reached the
      southern portion of the town, and was far within the range of cannon-shot
      from the American batteries. Close beside him was the bread stump of a
      tree, which appeared to have been recently cut down. Being weary and heavy
      at heart, he was about to sit down upon the stump.

Suddenly it flashed upon his recollection that this was the stump of
      Liberty Tree! The British soldiers had cut it down, vainly boasting that
      they could as easily overthrow the liberties of America. Under its shadowy
      branches, ten years before, the brother of Chief Justice Oliver had been
      compelled to acknowledge the supremacy of the people by taking the oath
      which they prescribed. This tree was connected with all the events that
      had severed America from England.

“Accursed tree!” cried the chief justice, gnashing his teeth; for anger
      overcame his sorrow. “Would that thou hadst been left standing till
      Hancock, Adams, and every other traitor, were hanged upon thy branches!
      Then fitly mightest thou have been hewn down and cast into the flames.”

He turned back, hurried to Long Wharf without looking behind him, embarked
      with the British troops for Halifax, and never saw his country more.
      Throughout the remainder of his days Chief Justice Oliver was agitated
      with those same conflicting emotions that had tortured him while taking
      his farewell walk through the streets of Boston. Deep love and fierce
      resentment burned in one flame within his breast, Anathemas struggled with
      benedictions. He felt as if one breath of his native air would renew his
      life, yet would have died rather than breathe the same air with rebels.
      And such likewise were the feelings of the other exiles, a thousand in
      number, who departed with the British army. Were they not the most
      unfortunate of men?

“The misfortunes of those exiled tories,” observed Laurence, “must have
      made them think of the poor exiles of Acadia.”

“They had a sad time of it, I suppose,” said Charley. “But I choose to
      rejoice with the patriots, rather than be sorrowful with the tories.
      Grandfather, what did General Washington do now?”

“As the rear of the British army embarked from the wharf,” replied
      Grandfather, “General Washington’s troops marched over the Neck, through
      the fortification gates, and entered Boston in triumph. And now, for the
      first time since the Pilgrims landed, Massachusetts was free from the
      dominion of England. May she never again be subjected to foreign rule,—never
      again feel the rod of oppression!”

“Dear Grandfather,” asked little Alice, “did General Washington bring our
      chair back to Boston?”

“I know not how long the chair remained at Cambridge,” said Grandfather.
      “Had it stayed there till this time, it could not have found a better or
      more appropriate shelter, The mansion which General Washington occupied is
      still standing, and his apartments have since been tenanted by several
      eminent men. Governor Everett, while a professor in the University,
      resided there. So at an after period did Mr. Sparks, whose invaluable
      labors have connected his name with the immortality of Washington. And at
      this very time a venerable friend and contemporary of your Grandfather,
      after long pilgrimages beyond the sea, has set up his staff of rest at
      Washington’s headquarters.”

“You mean Professor Longfellow, Grandfather,” said Laurence. “Oh, how I
      should love to see the author of those beautiful Voices of the Night!”

“We will visit him next summer,” answered Grandfather, “and take Clara and
      little Alice with us,—and Charley, too, if he will be quiet.”

WHEN Grandfather resumed his narrative the next evening, he told the
      children that he had some difficulty in tracing the movements of the chair
      during a short period after General Washington’s departure from Cambridge.

Within a few months, however, it made its appearance at a shop in Boston,
      before the door of which was seen a striped pole. In the interior was
      displayed a stuffed alligator, a rattlesnake’s skin, a bundle of Indian
      arrows, an old-fashioned matchlock gun, a walking-stick of Governor
      Winthrop’s, a wig of old Cotton Mather’s, and a colored print of the
      Boston massacre. In short, it was a barber’s shop, kept by a Mr. Pierce,
      who prided himself on having shaved General Washington, Old Put, and many
      other famous persons.

“This was not a very dignified situation for our venerable chair,”
       continued Grandfather; “but, you know, there is no better place for news
      than a barber’s shop. All the events of the Revolutionary War were heard
      of there sooner than anywhere else. People used to sit in the chair,
      reading the newspaper, or ' WHERE id = 'affcd6f7-8336-4784-9dfe-4231bc1e20f6';
