of appropriation with which they began; for at first they gave a tithe
to the Lord''s uses, reserving nine tenths, whereas later on they
appropriated nine tenths to the Lord''s uses, and reserved for themselves
only a tithe. Those who learn the deep meaning of our Lord''s words, "It
is more blessed to give than to receive," find such joy in holding all
things at His disposal that even personal expenditures are subjected to
the scrutiny of conscience and love, lest anything be wasted in
extravagance or careless self-indulgence. Frances Ridley Havergal in her
later years felt herself and all she possessed to be so fully and
joyfully given up to God, that she never went into a shop to spend a
shilling without asking herself whether it would be for God''s glory.

Gifts were valued by Mr. Müller only so far as they were the Lord''s
money, procured by lawful means and given in the Lord''s own way. To the
last his course was therefore most conscientious in the caution with
which he accepted offerings even in times of sorest extremity.

In October, 1842, he felt led to offer aid to a sister who seemed in
great distress and destitution, offering to share with her, if need be,
even his house and purse.

This offer drew out the acknowledgment that she had some five hundred
pounds of her own; and her conversation revealed that this money was
held as a provision against possible future want, and that she was
leaning upon that instead of upon God. Mr. Müller said but little to
her, but after her withdrawal he besought the Lord to make so real to
her the exhaustless riches she possessed in Christ, and her own heavenly
calling, that she might be constrained to lay down at His feet the whole
sum which was thus a snare to her faith and an idol to her love. Not a
word spoken or written passed between him and her on the subject, nor
did he even see her; his express desire being that if any such step
were to be taken by her, it might result from no human influence or
persuasion, lest her subsequent regret might prove both a damage to
herself and a dishonour to her Master.

For nearly four weeks, however, he poured out his heart to God for her
deliverance from greed. Then she again sought an interview and told him
how she had been day by day seeking to learn the will of God as to this
hoarded sum, and had been led to a clear conviction that it should be
laid entire upon His altar. Thus the goodly sum of five hundred pounds
was within so easy reach, at a time of very great need, that a word from
Mr. Müller would secure it. Instead of saying that word, he exhorted her
to make no such disposition of the money at that time, but to count the
cost; to do nothing rashly lest she should repent it, but wait at least
a fortnight more before reaching a final decision. His correspondence
with this sister may be found fully spread out in his journal,* and is a
model of devout carefulness lest he should snatch at a gift that might
be prompted by wrong motives or given with an unprepared heart. When
finally given, unexpected hindrances arose affecting her actual
possession and transfer, so that more than a third of a year elapsed
before it was received; but meanwhile there was on his part neither
impatience nor distrust, nor did he even communicate further with her.
To the glory of God let it be added that she afterward bore cheerful
witness that never for one moment did she regret giving the whole sum to
His service, and thus transferring her trust from the money to the
Master.

In August, 1853, a poor widow of sixty, who had sold the little house
which constituted her whole property, put into an orphan-house box
elsewhere, for Mr. Müller, the entire proceeds, ninety pounds. Those who
conveyed it to Mr. Müller, knowing the circumstances, urged her to
retain at least a part of this sum, and prevailed on her to keep five
pounds and sent on the other eighty-five. Mr. Müller, learning the
facts, and fearing lest the gift might result from a sudden impulse to
be afterward regretted, offered to pay her travelling expenses that he
might have an interview with her. He found her mind had been quite made
up for ten years before the house was sold that such disposition should
be made of the proceeds. But he was the more reluctant to accept the
gift lest, as she had already been prevailed on to take back five pounds
of the original donation, she might wish she had reserved more; and only
after much urgency had failed to persuade her to reconsider the step
would he accept it. Even then, however, lest he should be evil spoken of
in the matter, he declined to receive any part of the gift for personal
uses.

In October, 1867, a small sum was sent in by one who had years before
taken it from another, and who desired thus to make restitution,
believing that the Christian believer from whom it was taken would
approve of this method of restoring it. Mr. Müller promptly returned it,
irrespective of amount, that restitution might be made directly to the
party who had been robbed or wronged, claiming that such party should
first receive it and then dispose of it as might seem fit. As it did not
belong to him who took it, it was not his to give even in another''s
behalf.

During a season of great straits Mr. Müller received a sealed parcel
containing money. He knew from whom it came, and that the donor was a
woman not only involved in debt, but frequently asked by creditors for
their lawful dues in vain. It was therefore clear that it was not her
money, and therefore not hers to give; and without even opening the
paper wrapper he returned it to the sender—and this at a time when
there was not in hand enough to meet the expenses of that very day. In
June, 1838, a stranger, who confessed to an act of fraud, wished through
Mr. Müller to make restitution, with interest; and, instead of sending
the money by post, Mr. Müller took pains to transmit it by bank orders,
which thus enabled him, in case of need, to prove his fidelity in acting
as a medium of transmission—an instance of the often-quoted maxim that
it is the honest man who is most careful to provide things honest in the
sight of all men.

Money sent as proceeds of a musical entertainment held for the benefit
of the orphans in the south of Devon was politely returned, Mr. Müller
had no doubt of the kind intention of those who set this scheme on foot,
but he felt that money for the work of God should not be obtained in
this manner, and he desired only money provided in God''s way.

Friends who asked that they might know whether their gifts had come at a
particularly opportune time were referred to the next Report for answer.
To acknowledge that the help came very seasonably would be an indirect
revelation of need, and might be construed into an indirect appeal for
more aid—as help that was peculiarly timely would soon be exhausted.
And so this man of God consistently avoided any such disclosure of an
exigency, lest his chief object should be hindered, namely, "to show how
blessed it is to deal with God alone, and to trust Him in the darkest
moments." And though the need was continual, and one demand was no
sooner met than another arose, he did not find this a trying life nor
did he ever tire of it.

"With regard to property, I do not see my way clearly. I trust it is all
indeed at the disposal of the Lord; and, if you would let me know of any
need of it in His service, any sum under two hundred pounds shall be at
your disposal at about a week''s notice."

The need at that time was great. How easy and natural to write back that
the orphan work was then in want of help, and that, as Mr. Müller was
just going away from Bristol for rest, it would be a special comfort if
his correspondent would send on, say a hundred and ninety pounds or so!
But to deal with the Lord alone in the whole matter seemed so
indispensable, both for the strengthening of his own faith and for the
effectiveness of his testimony to the church and the world, that at once
this temptation was seen to be a snare, and he replied that only to the
Lord could the need of any part of the work be confided.

Money to be laid up as a fund for his old age or possible seasons of
illness or family emergencies was always declined. Such a donation of
one hundred pounds was received October 12, 1856, with a note so
considerate and Christian that the subtle temptation to lay up for
himself treasures on earth would have triumphed but for a heart fixed
immovably in the determination that there should be no dependence upon
any such human provision. He had settled the matter beyond raising the
question again, that he would live from day to day upon the Lord''s
bounty, and would make but one investment, namely, using whatever
means God gave, to supply the necessities of the poor, depending on God
richly to repay him in the hour of his own need, according to the
promise:

"He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord;
        And that which he hath given will He pay him again."
          Proverbs xix. 17.

God so owned, at once, this disposition on Mr. Müller''s part that his
courteous letter, declining the gift for himself, led the donor not only
to ask him to use the hundred pounds for the orphan work, but to add to
this sum a further gift of two hundred pounds more.

THE eleventh chapter of Hebrews—that "Westminster Abbey" where Old
Testament saints have a memorial before God—gives a hint of a peculiar
reward which faith enjoys, even in this life, as an earnest and
foretaste of its final recompense.

By faith "the elders obtained a good report," that is, they had witness
borne to them by God in return for witness borne to Him. All the marked
examples of faith here recorded show this twofold testimony. Abel
testified to his faith in God''s Atoning Lamb, and God testified to his
gifts. Enoch witnessed to the unseen God by his holy walk with Him, and
He testified to Enoch, by his translation, and even before it, that he
pleased God. Noah''s faith bore witness to God''s word, by building the
ark and preaching righteousness, and God bore witness to him by bringing
a flood upon a world of the ungodly and saving him and his family in the
ark.

George Müller''s life was one long witness to the prayer-hearing God;
and, throughout, God bore him witness that his prayers were heard and
his work accepted. The pages of his journal are full of striking
examples of this witness—the earnest or foretaste of the fuller
recompense of reward reserved for the Lord''s coming.

Compensations for renunciations, and rewards for service, do not all
wait for the judgment-seat of Christ, but, as some men''s sins are open
beforehand, going before to judgment, so the seed sown for God yields a
harvest that is ''open beforehand'' to joyful recognition. Divine love
graciously and richly acknowledged these many years of self-forgetful
devotion to Him and His needy ones, by large and unexpected tokens of
blessing. Toils and trials, tears and prayers, were not in vain even
this side of the Hereafter.

For illustrations of this we naturally turn first of all to the orphan
work. Ten thousand motherless and fatherless children had found a home
and tender parental care in the institution founded by George Müller,
and were there fed, clad, and taught, before he was called up higher.
His efforts to improve their state physically, morally, and spiritually
were so manifestly owned of God that he felt his compensation to be both
constant and abundant, and his journal, from time to time, glows with
his fervent thanksgivings.

This orphan work would amply repay all its cost during two thirds of a
century, should only its temporal benefits be reckoned. Experience
proved that, with God''s blessing, one half of the lives sacrificed among
the children of poverty would be saved by better conditions of
body—such as regularity and cleanliness of habits, good food, pure air,
proper clothing, and wholesome exercise. At least two thirds, if not
three fourths, of the parents whose offspring have found a shelter on
Ashley Down had died of consumption and kindred diseases; and hence the
children had been largely tainted with a like tendency. And yet, all
through the history of this orphan work, there has been such care of
proper sanitary conditions that there has been singular freedom from all
sorts of ailments, and especially epidemic diseases; and when scarlet
fever, measles, and such diseases have found entrance, the cases of
sickness have been comparatively few and mild, and the usual percentage
of deaths exceedingly small.

This is not the only department of training in which the recompense has
been abundant. Ignorance is everywhere the usual handmaid of poverty,
and there has been very careful effort to secure proper mental
culture. With what success the education of these orphans has been
looked after will sufficiently appear from the reports of the school
inspector. From year to year these pupils have been examined in reading,
writing, arithmetic, Scripture, dictation, geography, history, grammar,
composition, and singing; and Mr. Horne reported in 1885 an average per
cent of all marks as high as 91.1, and even this was surpassed the next
year when it was 94, and, two years later, when it was 96.1.

But in the moral and spiritual welfare of these orphans, which has been
primarily sought, the richest recompense has been enjoyed. The one main
aim of Mr. Müller and his whole staff of helpers, from first to last,
has been to save these children—to bring them up in the nurture and
admonition of the Lord. The hindrances were many and formidable. If the
hereditary taint of disease is to be dreaded, what of the awful legacy
of sin and crime! Many of these little ones had no proper bringing up
till they entered the orphan houses; and not a few had been trained
indeed, but only in Satan''s schools of drink and lust. And yet,
notwithstanding all these drawbacks, Mr. Müller records, with devout
thankfulness, that "the Lord had constrained them, on the whole, to
behave exceedingly well, so much so as to attract the attention of
observers." Better still, large numbers have, throughout the whole
history of this work, given signs of a really regenerate state, and have
afterwards maintained a consistent character and conduct, and in some
cases have borne singular witness to the grace of God, both by their
complete transformation and by their influence for good.

In August, 1858, an orphan girl, Martha Pinnell, who had been for over
twelve years under Mr. Müller''s care, and for more than five years ill
with consumption, fell asleep in Jesus. Before her death, she had, for
two and a half years, known the Lord, and the change in her character
and conduct had been remarkable. From an exceedingly disobedient and
troublesome child with a pernicious influence, she had become both very
docile and humble and most influential for good. In her unregenerate
days she had declared that, if she should ever be converted, she would
be "a thorough Christian," and so it proved. Her happiness in God, her
study of His word, her deep knowledge of the Lord Jesus, her earnest
passion for souls, seemed almost incredible in one so young and so
recently turned to God. And Mr. Müller has preserved in the pages of his
Journal four of the precious letters written by her to other inmates of
the orphan houses.*

At times, and frequently, extensive revivals have been known among them
when scores and hundreds have found the Lord. The year ending May 26,
1858 was especially notable for the unprecedented greatness and rapidity
of the work which the Spirit of God had wrought, in such conversions.
Within a few days and without any special apparent cause except the very
peaceful death of a Christian orphan, Caroline Bailey, more than fifty
of the one hundred and forty girls in Orphan House No. 1 were under
conviction of sin, and the work spread into the other departments, till
about sixty were shortly exercising faith. In July, 1859, again, in a
school of one hundred and twenty girls more than half were brought under
deep spiritual concern; and, after a year had passed, shewed the grace
of continuance in a new life. In January and February, 1860, another
mighty wave of Holy Spirit power swept over the institution. It began
among little girls, from six to nine years old, then extended to the
older girls, and then to the boys, until, inside of ten days, above two
hundred were inquiring and in many instances found immediate peace. The
young converts at once asked to hold prayer meetings among themselves,
and were permitted; and not only so, but many began to labour and pray
for others, and, out of the seven hundred orphans then in charge, some
two hundred and sixty were shortly regarded as either converted or in a
most hopeful state.

Again, in 1872, on the first day of the week of prayer, the Holy Spirit
so moved that, without any unusual occasion for deep seriousness,
hundreds were, during that season, hopefully converted. Constant prayer
for their souls made the orphan homes a hallowed place, and by August
1st, it was believed, after careful investigation, that seven hundred
and twenty-nine might be safely counted as being disciples of Christ,
the number of believing orphans being thus far in excess of any previous
period. A series of such blessings have, down to this date, crowned the
sincere endeavours of all who have charge of these children, to lead
them to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.

By far the majority of orphans sent out for service or apprenticeship,
had for some time before known the Lord; and even of those who left the
Institution unconverted, the after-history of many showed that the
training there received had made impossible continuance in a life of
sin.

Thus, precious harvests of this seed-sowing, gathered in subsequent
years, have shown that God was not unrighteous to forget this work of
faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope.

In April, 1874, a letter from a former inmate of the orphanage enclosed
a thank offering for the excellent Bible-teaching there received which
had borne fruit years after. So carefully had she been instructed in the
way of salvation that, while yet herself unrenewed, she had been God''s
instrument of leading to Christ a fellow servant who had long been
seeking peace, and so, became, like a sign-board on the road, the means
of directing another to the true path, by simply telling her what she
had been taught, though not then following the path herself.

Another orphan wrote, in 1876, that often, when tempted to indulge the
sin of unbelief, the thought of that six years'' sojourn in Ashley Down
came across the mind like a gleam of sunshine. It was remembered how the
clothes there worn, the food eaten, the bed slept on, and the very walls
around, were the visible answers to believing prayer, and the
recollection of all these things proved a potent prescription and remedy
for the doubts and waverings of the child of God, a shield against the
fiery darts of satanic suggestion.

During the thirty years between 1865 and 1895, two thousand five hundred
and sixty-six orphans were known to have left the institution as
believers, an average of eighty-five every year; and, at the close of
this thirty years, nearly six hundred were yet in the homes on Ashley
Down who had given credible evidence of a regenerate state.

Mr. Müller was permitted to know that not only had these orphans been
blessed in health, educated in mind, converted to God, and made useful
Christian citizens, but many of them had become fathers or mothers of
Christian households. One representative instance may be cited. A man
and a woman who had formerly been among these orphans became husband and
wife, and they have had eight children, all earnest disciples, one of
whom went as a foreign missionary to Africa.

From the first, God set His seal upon this religious training in the
orphan houses. The first two children received into No. 1 both became
true believers and zealous workers: one, a Congregational deacon, who,
in a benighted neighbourhood, acted the part of a lay preacher; and the
other, a laborious and successful clergyman in the Church of England,
and both largely used of God in soul-winning. Could the full history be
written of all who have gone forth from these orphan homes, what a
volume of testimony would be furnished, since these are but a few
scattered examples of the conspicuously useful service to which God has
called those whose after-career can be traced!

In his long and extensive missionary tours, Mr. Müller was permitted to
see, gather, and partake of many widely scattered fruits of his work on
Ashley Down. When preaching in Brooklyn, N. Y., in September, 1877, he
learned that in Philadelphia a legacy of a thousand pounds was waiting
for him, the proceeds of a life-insurance, which the testator had willed
to the work, and in city after city he had the joy of meeting scores of
orphans brought up under his care.

He minutely records the remarkable usefulness of a Mr. Wilkinson, who,
up to the age of fourteen and a half years, had been taught at the
orphanage. Twenty years had elapsed since Mr. Müller had seen him, when,
in 1878, he met him in Calvary Church, San Francisco, six thousand five
hundred miles from Bristol. He found him holding fast his faith in the
Lord Jesus, a happy and consistent Christian. He further heard most
inspiring accounts of this man''s singular service during the Civil War
in America. Being on the gunboat Louisiana, he had there been the
leading spirit and recognized head of a little Bethel church among his
fellow seamen, who were by him led so to engage in the service of Christ
as to exhibit a devotion that, without a trace of fanatical enthusiasm,
was full of holy zeal and joy. Their whole conversation was of God. It
further transpired that, months previous, when the cloud of impending
battle overhung the ship''s company, he and one of his comrades had met
for prayer in the ''chain-locker''; and thus began a series of most
remarkable meetings which, without one night''s interruption, lasted for
some twenty months. Wilkinson alone among the whole company had any
previous knowledge of the word of God, and he became not only the leader
of the movement, but the chief interpreter of the Scriptures as they met
to read the Book of God and exchange views upon it. Nor was he satisfied
to do thus much with his comrades daily, but at another stated hour he,
with some chosen helpers, gathered the coloured sailors of the ship to
teach them reading, writing, etc.

A member of the Christian Commission, Mr. J. E. Hammond, who gave these
facts publicity, and who was intimately acquainted with Mr. Wilkinson
and his work on shipboard, said that he seemed to be a direct "product
of Mr. Müller''s faith, his calm confidence in God, the method in his
whole manner of life, the persistence of purpose, and the quiet
spiritual power," which so characterized the founder of the Bristol
orphanage, being eminently reproduced in this young man who had been
trained under his influence. When in a sail-loft ashore, he was
compelled for two weeks to listen to the lewd and profane talk of two
associates detailed with him for a certain work. For the most part he
took refuge in silence; but his manner of conduct, and one sentence
which dropped from his lips, brought both those rough and wicked sailors
to the Saviour he loved, one of whom in three months read the word of
God from Genesis to Revelation.

Mr. Müller went nowhere without meeting converted orphans or hearing of
their work, even in the far-off corners of the earth. Sometimes in great
cities ten or fifteen would be waiting at the close of an address to
shake the hand of their "father," and tell him of their debt of
gratitude and love. He found them in every conceivable sphere of
service, many of them having households in which the principles taught
in the orphan homes were dominant, and engaged in the learned
professions as well as humbler walks of life.

God gave His servant also the sweet compensation of seeing great
blessing attending the day-schools supported by the Scriptural Knowledge
Institution.

The master of the school at Clayhidon, for instance, wrote of a poor
lad, a pupil in the day-school, prostrate with rheumatic fever, in a
wretched home and surrounded by bitter opposers of the truth. Wasted to
a skeleton, and in deep anxiety about his own soul, he was pointed to
Him who says, "Come unto Me,... and I will give you rest." While yet
this conversation was going on, as though suddenly he had entered into a
new world, this emaciated boy began to repeat texts such as "Suffer the
little children to come unto me," and burst out singing:

He seemed transported with ecstasy, and recited text after text and hymn
after hymn, learned at that school. No marvel is it if that schoolmaster
felt a joy, akin to the angels, in this one proof that his labour in the
Lord was not in vain. Such examples might be indefinitely multiplied,
but this handful of first-fruits of a harvest may indicate the character
of the whole crop.

Letters were constantly received from missionary labourers in various
parts of the world who were helped by the gifts of the Scriptural
Knowledge Institution. The testimony from this source alone would fill a
good-sized volume, and therefore its incorporation into this memoir
would be impracticable. Those who would see what grand encouragement
came to Mr. Müller from fields of labour where he was only represented
by others, whom his gift''s aided, should read the annual reports. A few
examples may be given of the blessed results of such wide scattering of
the seed of the kingdom, as specimens of thousands.

Mr. Albert Fenn, who was labouring in Madrid, wrote of a civil guard
who, because of his bold witness for Christ and renunciation of the
Romish confessional, was sent from place to place and most cruelly
treated, and threatened with banishment to a penal settlement. Again he
writes of a convert from Borne who, for trying to establish a small
meeting, was summoned before the governor.

"Who pays you for this?" "No one." "What do you gain by it?" "Nothing."
"How do you live?" "I work with my hands in a mine." "Why do you hold
meetings?" "Because God has blessed my soul, and I wish others to be
blessed." "You? you were made a miserable day-labourer; I prohibit the
meetings." "I yield to force," was the calm reply, "but as long as I
have a mouth to speak I shall speak for Christ." How like those
primitive disciples who boldly faced the rulers at Jerusalem, and, being
forbidden to speak in Jesus'' name, firmly answered: "We ought to obey
God rather than men. Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken
unto you more than unto God judge ye: for we cannot but speak the things
which we have seen and heard."

A missionary labourer writes from India, of three Brahman priests and
scores of Santhals and Hindus, sitting down with four Europeans to keep
the supper of the Lord—all fruits of his ministry. Within a twelvemonth,
sixty-two men and women, including head men of villages, and four
Brahman women, wives of priests and of head men, were baptized,
representing twenty-three villages in which the gospel had been
preached. At one time more than one hundred persons were awakened in one
mission in Spain; and such harvests as these were not infrequent in
various fields to which the founder of the orphan work had the joy of
sending aid.

In 1885, a scholar of one of the schools at Carrara, Italy, was
confronted by a priest. "In the Bible," said he, "you do not find the
commandments of the church." "No, sir," said the child, "for it is not
for the church of God to command, but to obey." "Tell me, then,"
said the priest, "these commandments of God." "Yes, sir," replied the
child; "I am the Lord thy God. Thou shalt have no other God before me.
Neither shalt thou make any graven image." "Stop! stop!" cried the
priest, "I do not understand it so." "But so," quietly replied the
child, "it is written in God''s word." This simple incident may
illustrate both the character of the teaching given in the schools, and
the character often developed in those who were taught.

Out of the many pages of Mr. Müller''s journal, probably about one-fifth
are occupied wholly with extracts from letters like these from
missionaries, teachers, and helpers, which kept him informed of the
progress of the Lord''s work at home and in many lands where the
labourers were by him enabled to continue their service.
Bible-carriages, open-air services, Christian schools, tract
distribution, and various other forms of holy labour for the benighted
souls near and far, formed part of the many-branching tree of life that
was planted on Ashley Down.

Another of the main encouragements and rewards which Mr. Müller enjoyed
in this life was the knowledge that his example had emboldened other
believers to attempt like work for God, on like principles. This he
himself regarded as the greatest blessing resulting from his life-work,
that hundreds of thousands of children of God had been led in various
parts of the world to trust in God in all simplicity; and when such
trust found expression in similar service to orphans, it seemed the
consummation of his hopes, for the work was thus proven to have its seed
in itself after its kind, a self-propagating life, which doubly
demonstrated it to be a tree of the Lord''s own planting, that He might
be glorified.

In December, 1876, Mr. Müller learned, for instance, that a Christian
evangelist, simply through reading about the orphan work in Bristol, had
it laid on his heart to care about orphans, and encouraged by Mr.
Müller''s example, solely in dependence on the Lord, had begun in 1863
with three orphans at Nimwegen in Holland, and had at that date, only
fourteen years after, over four hundred and fifty in the institution. It
pleased the Lord that he and Mrs. Müller should, with their own eyes,
see this institution, and he says that in "almost numberless instances"
the Lord permitted him to know of similar fruits of his work.

At his first visit to Tokyo, Japan, he gave an account of it, and as the
result, Mr. Ishii, a native Christian Japanese, started an orphanage
upon a similar basis of prayer, faith, and dependence upon the Living
God, and at Mr. Müller''s second visit to the Island Empire he found this
orphan work prosperously in progress.

How generally fruitful the example thus furnished on Ashley Down has
been in good to the church and the world will never be known on earth. A
man living at Horfield, in sight of the orphan buildings, has said that,
whenever he felt doubts of the Living God creeping into his mind, he
used to get up and look through the night at the many windows lit up on
Ashley Down, and they gleamed out through the darkness as stars in the
sky.

It was the witness of Mr. Müller to a prayer-hearing God which
encouraged Rev. J. Hudson Taylor, in 1863, thirty years after Mr.
Müller''s great step was taken, to venture wholly on the Lord, in
founding the China Inland Mission. It has been said that to the example
of A. H. Francke in Halle, or George Müller in Bristol, may be more or
less directly traced every form of ''faith work,'' prevalent since.

The Scriptural Knowledge Institution was made in all its departments a
means of blessing. Already in the year ending May 26, 1860, a hundred
servants of Christ had been more or less aided, and far more souls had
been hopefully brought to God through their labours than during any year
previous. About six hundred letters, received from them, had cheered Mr.
Müller''s heart during the twelvemonth, and this source of joy overflowed
during all his life. In countless cases children of God were lifted to a
higher level of faith and life, and unconverted souls were turned to God
through the witness borne to God by the institutions on Ashley Down. Mr.
Müller has summed up this long history of blessing by two statements
which are worth pondering.

First, that the Lord was pleased to give him far beyond all he at first
expected to accomplish or receive.

And secondly, that he was fully persuaded that all he had seen and known
would not equal the thousandth part of what he should see and know when
the Lord should come, His reward with Him, to give every man according
as his work shall be.

In November, 1856, Mr. James McQuilkin, a young Irishman, was converted,
and early in the next year, read the first two volumes of that Narrative
He said to himself: "Mr. Müller obtains all this simply by prayer; so
may I be blessed by the same means," and he began to pray. First of all
he received from the Lord, in answer, a spiritual companion, and then
two more of like mind; and they four began stated seasons of prayer in a
small schoolhouse near Kells, Antrim, Ireland, every Friday evening. On
the first day of the new year, 1858, a farm-servant was remarkably
brought to the Lord in answer to their prayers, and these five gave
themselves anew to united supplication. Shortly a sixth young man was
added to their number by conversion, and so the little company of
praying souls slowly grew, only believers being admitted to these simple
meetings for fellowship in reading of the Scriptures, prayer, and mutual
exhortation.

About Christmas, that year, Mr. McQuilkin, with the two brethren who had
first joined him—one of whom was Mr. Jeremiah Meneely, who is still at
work for God—held a meeting by request at Ahoghill. Some believed and
some mocked, while others thought these three converts presumptuous; but
two weeks later another meeting was held, at which God''s Spirit began to
work most mightily and conversions now rapidly multiplied. Some converts
bore the sacred coals and kindled the fire elsewhere, and so in many
places revival flames began to burn; and in Ballymena, Belfast, and at
other points the Spirit''s gracious work was manifest.

Such was the starting-point, in fact, of one of the most widespread and
memorable revivals ever known in our century, and which spread the next
year in England, Wales, and Scotland. Thousands found Christ, and walked
in newness of life; and the results are still manifest after more than
forty years.

As early as 1868 it was found that one who had thankfully read this
Narrative had issued a compendium of it in Swedish. We have seen how
widely useful it has been in Germany; and in many other languages its
substance at least has been made available to native readers.

Knowledge came to Mr. Müller of a boy of ten years who got hold of one
of these Reports, and, although belonging to a family of unbelievers,
began to pray: "God, teach me to pray like George Müller, and hear me as
Thou dost hear George Müller." He further declared his wish to be a
preacher, which his widowed mother very strongly opposed, objecting that
the boy did not know enough to get into the grammar-school, which is the
first step toward such a high calling. The lad, however, rejoined: "I
will learn and pray, and God will help me through as He has done George
Müller." And soon, to the surprise of everybody, the boy had
successfully passed his examination and was received at the school.

A donor writes, September 20, 1879, that the reading of the Narrative
totally changed his inner life to one of perfect trust and confidence in
God. It led to the devoting of at least a tenth of his earnings to the
Lord''s purposes, and showed him how much more blessed it is to give than
to receive; and it led him also to place a copy of that Narrative on the
shelves of a Town Institute library where three thousand members and
subscribers might have access to it.

Another donor suggests that it might be well if Prof. Huxley and his
sympathisers, who had been proposing some new arbitrary "prayer-gauge"
would, instead of treating prayer as so much waste of breath, try how
long they could keep five orphan houses running, with over two thousand
orphans, and without asking any one for help,—either "GOD or MAN."

In September, 1882, another donor describes himself as "simply astounded
at the blessed results of prayer and faith," and many others have found
this brief narrative "the most wonderful and complete refutation of
skepticism it had ever been their lot to meet with"—an array of facts
constituting the most undeniable "evidences of Christianity." There are
abundant instances of the power exerted by Mr. Müller''s testimony, as
when a woman who had been an infidel, writes him that he was "the first
person by whose example she learned that there are some men who live by
faith," and that for this reason she had willed to him all that she
possessed.

Another reader found these Reports "more faith-strengthening and
soul-refreshing than many a sermon," particularly so after just wading
through the mire of a speech of a French infidel who boldly affirmed
that of all of the millions of prayers uttered every day, not one is
answered. We should like to have any candid skeptic confronted with Mr.
Müller''s unvarnished story of a life of faith, and see how he would on
any principle of'' compound probability'' and ''accidental coincidences,''
account for the tens of thousand''s of answers to believing prayer! The
fact is that one half of the infidelity in the world is dishonest, and
the other half is ignorant of the daily proofs that God is, and is a
Rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.

From almost the first publication of his Narrative, Mr. Müller had felt
a conviction that it was thus to be greatly owned of God as a witness to
His faithfulness; and, as early as 1842, it was laid on his heart to
send a copy of his Annual Report gratuitously to every Christian
minister of the land, which the Lord helped him to do, his aim being not
to get money or even awaken interest in the work, but rather to
stimulate faith and quicken prayer.*

* The author of this memoir purposes to give a copy of it to every
foreign missionary, and to workers in the home fields, so far as means
are supplied in answer to prayer. His hope is that the witness of this
life may thus have still wider influence in stimulating prayer and
faith. The devout reader is asked to unite his supplications with those
of many others who are asking that the Lord may be pleased to furnish
the means whereby this purpose may be carried out. Already about one
hundred pounds sterling have been given for this end, and part of it,
small in amount but rich in self-denial, from the staff of helpers and
the orphans on Ashley Down. A. T. P.

Twenty-two years later, in 1868, it was already so apparent that the
published accounts of the Lord''s dealings was used so largely to
sanctify and edify saints and even to convert sinners and convince
infidels, that he records this as the greatest of all the spiritual
blessings hitherto resulting from his work for God. Since then thirty
years more have fled, and, during this whole period, letters from a
thousand sources have borne increasing witness that the example he set
has led others to fuller faith and firmer confidence in God''s word,
power, and love; to a deeper persuasion that, though Elijah has been
taken up, God, the God of Elijah, is still working His wonders.

And so, in all departments of his work for God, the Lord to whom he
witnessed bore witness to him in return, and anticipated his final
reward in a recompense of present and overflowing joy. This was
especially true in the long tours undertaken, when past threescore and
ten, to sow in lands afar the seeds of the Kingdom! As the sower went
forth to sow he found not fallow fields only, but harvest fields also,
from which his arms were filled with sheaves. Thus, in a new sense the
reaper overtook the ploughman, and the harvester, him that scattered the
seed. In every city of the United Kingdom and in the "sixty-eight
cities" where, up to 1877, he had preached on the continents of Europe
and America, he had found converted orphans, and believers to whom
abundant blessing had come through reading his reports. After this date,
twenty-one years more yet remained crowded with experiences of good.
Thus, before the Lord called George Müller higher, He had given him a
foretaste of his reward, in the physical, intellectual and spiritual
profit of the orphans; in the fruits of his wide seed-sowing in other
lands as well as Britain; in the scattering of God''s word and Christian
literature; in the Christian education of thousands of children in the
schools he aided; in the assistance afforded to hundreds of devoted
missionaries; in the large blessing imparted by his published narrative,
and in his personal privilege of bearing witness throughout the world to
the gospel of grace.

THE mountain-climber, at the sunset hour, naturally takes a last
lingering look backward at the prospect visible from the lofty height,
before he begins his descent to the valley. And, before we close this
volume, we as naturally cast one more glance backward over this
singularly holy and useful life, that we may catch further inspiration
from its beauty and learn some new lessons in holy living and unselfish
serving.

George Müller was divinely fitted for, fitted into his work, as a
mortise fits the tenon, or a ball of bone its socket in the joint. He
had adaptations, both natural and gracious, to the life of service to
which he was called, and these adaptations made possible a career of
exceptional sanctity and service, because of his complete self-surrender
to the will of God and his childlike faith in His word.

Three qualities or characteristics stand out very conspicuous in him:
truth, faith, and love. Our Lord frequently taught His disciples
that the childlike spirit is the soul of discipleship, and in the ideal
child these three traits are central. Truth is one centre, about which
revolve childlike frankness and sincerity, genuineness and simplicity.
Faith is another, about which revolve confidence and trust, docility and
humility. Love is another centre, around which gather unselfishness and
generosity, gentleness and restfulness of spirit. In the typical or
perfect child, therefore, all these beautiful qualities would coexist,
and, in proportion as they are found in a disciple, is he worthy to be
called a child of God.

In Mr. Müller these traits were all found and conjoined in a degree very
seldom found in any one man, and this fact sufficiently accounts for his
remarkable likeness to Christ and fruitfulness in serving God and man.
No pen-portrait of him which fails to make these features very prominent
can either be accurate in delineation or warm in colouring. It is
difficult to overestimate their importance in their relation to what
George Müller was and did.

Truth is the corner-stone of all excellence, for without it nothing else
is true, genuine, or real. From the hour of his conversion his
truthfulness was increasingly dominant and apparent. In fact, there was
about him a scrupulous exactness which sometimes seemed unnecessary. One
smiles at the mathematical precision with which he states facts, giving
the years, days, and hours since he was brought to the knowledge of God,
or since he began to pray for some given object; and the pounds,
shillings, pence, halfpence, and even farthings that form the total sum
expended for any given purpose. We see the same conscientious exactness
in the repetitions of statements, whether of principles or of
occurrences, which we meet in his journal, and in which oftentimes there
is not even a change of a word. But all this has a significance. It
inspires absolute confidence in the record of the Lord''s dealings.

First, because it shows that the writer has disciplined himself to
accuracy of statement. Many a falsehood is not an intentional lie, but
an undesigned inaccuracy. Three of our human faculties powerfully affect
our veracity: one is memory, another is imagination, and another is
conscience. Memory takes note of facts, imagination colours facts with
fancies, and conscience brings the moral sense to bear in sifting the
real from the unreal. Where conscience is not sensitive and dominant,
memory and imagination will become so confused that facts and fancies
will fail to be separated. The imagination will be so allowed to invest
events and experiences with either a halo of glory or a cloud of
prejudice that the narrator will constantly tell, not what he clearly
sees written in the book of his remembrance, but what he beholds painted
upon the canvas of his own imagination. Accuracy will be, half
unconsciously perhaps, sacrificed to his own imaginings; he will
exaggerate or depreciate—as his own impulses lead him; and a man who
would not deliberately lie may thus be habitually untrustworthy: you
cannot tell, and often he cannot tell, what the exact truth would be,
when all the unreality with which it has thus been invested is
dissipated like the purple and golden clouds about a mountain, leaving
the bare crag of naked rock to be seen, just as it is in itself.

George Müller felt the immense importance of exact statement. Hence he
disciplined himself to accuracy. Conscience presided over his narrative,
and demanded that everything else should be scrupulously sacrificed to
veracity. But, more than this, God made him, in a sense, a man without
imagination—comparatively free from the temptations of an enthusiastic
temperament. He was a mathematician rather than a poet, an artisan
rather than an artist, and he did not see things invested with a false
halo. He was deliberate, not impulsive; calm and not excitable. He
naturally weighed every word before he spoke, and scrutinized every
statement before he gave it form with pen or tongue. And therefore the
very qualities that, to some people, may make his narrative bare of
charm, and even repulsively prosaic, add to its value as a plain,
conscientious, unimaginative, unvarnished, and trustworthy statement of
facts. Had any man of a more poetic mind written that journal, the
reader would have found himself constantly and unconsciously making
allowance for the writer''s own enthusiasm, discounting the facts,
because of the imaginative colouring. The narrative might have been more
readable, but it would not have been so reliable; and, in this story of
the Lord''s dealings, nothing was so indispensable as exact truth. It
would be comparatively worthless, were it not undeniable. The Lord
fitted the man who lived that life of faith and prayer, and wrote that
life-story, to inspire confidence, so that even skeptics and doubters
felt that they were reading, not a novel or a poem, but a history.

Faith was the second of these central traits in George Müller, and it
was purely the product of grace. We are told, in that first great lesson
on faith in the Scripture, that (Genesis xv. 6) Abram believed in
Jehovah—literally, Amened Jehovah. The word "Amen" means not ''Let it
be so,'' but rather ''it shall be so.'' The Lord''s word came to Abram,
saying this ''shall not be,'' but something else ''shall be''; and Abram
simply said with all his heart, ''Amen''—''it shall be as God hath said.''
And Paul seems to be imitating Abram''s faith when, in the shipwreck off
Malta, he said, "I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told
me." That is faith in its simplest exercise and it was George Müller''s
faith. He found the word of the Lord in His blessed Book, a new word of
promise for each new crisis of trial or need; he put his finger upon the
very text and then looked up to God and said: "Thou hast spoken. I
believe." Persuaded of God''s unfailing truth, he rested on His word with
unwavering faith, and consequently he was at peace.

Nothing is more noticeable, in the entire career of this man of God,
reaching through sixty-five years, than the steadiness of his faith and
the steadfastness it gave to his whole character. To have a word of God
was enough. He built upon it, and, when floods came and beat against
that house, how could it fall! He was never confounded nor obliged to
flee. Even the earthquake may shake earth and heaven, but it leaves the
true believer the inheritor of a kingdom which cannot be moved; for the
object of all such shaking is to remove what can be shaken, that what
cannot be shaken may remain.

If Mr. Müller had any great mission, it was not to found a world-wide
institution of any sort, however useful in scattering Bibles and books
and tracts, or housing and feeding thousands of orphans, or setting up
Christian schools and aiding missionary workers. His main mission was to
teach men that it is safe to trust God''s word, to rest implicitly upon
whatever He hath said, and obey explicitly whatever He has bidden; that
prayer offered in faith, trusting His promise and the intercession of
His dear Son, is never offered in vain; and that the life lived by faith
is a walk with God, just outside the very gates of heaven.

Love, the third of that trinity of graces, was the other great secret
and lesson of this life. And what is love? Not merely a complacent
affection for what is lovable, which is often only a half-selfish taking
of pleasure in the society and fellowship of those who love us. Love is
the principle of unselfishness: love ''seeketh not her own''; it is the
preference of another''s pleasure and profit over our own, and hence is
exercised toward the unthankful and unlovely, that it may lift them to a
higher level. Such love is benevolence rather than complacence, and so
it is "of God," for He loveth the unthankful and the evil: and he that
loveth is born of God and knoweth God. Such love is obedience to a
principle of unselfishness, and makes self-sacrifice habitual and even
natural. While Satan''s motto is ''Spare thyself!'' Christ''s motto is to
Deny thyself!'' The sharpest rebuke ever administered by our Lord was
that to Peter when he became a Satan by counselling his Master to adopt
Satan''s maxim.* We are bidden by Paul, "Remember Jesus
Christ,"† and
by Peter, "Follow His steps."‡ If we seek the inmost meaning of these
two brief mottoes, we shall find that, about Jesus Christ''s character,
nothing was more conspicuous than the obedience of faith and
self-surrender to God: and in His career, which we are bidden to follow,
the renunciation of love, or self-sacrifice for man. The taunt was
sublimely true: "He saved others, Himself He cannot save"; it was
because he saved others that He could not save Himself. The seed must
give up its own life for the sake of the crop; and he who will be life
to others must, like his Lord, consent to die.

Here is the real meaning of that command, "Let him deny himself and take
up his cross." Self-denial is not cutting off an indulgence here and
there, but laying the axe at the root of the tree of self, of which all
indulgences are only greater or smaller branches. Self-righteousness and
self-trust, self-seeking and self-pleasing, self-will, self-defence,
self-glory—these are a few of the myriad branches of that deeply rooted
tree. And what if one or more of these be cut off, if such lopping off
of some few branches only throws back into others the self-life to
develop more vigorously in them?

And what is cross-bearing? We speak of our ''crosses''—but the word of
God never uses that word in the plural, for there is but one
cross—the cross on which the self-life is crucified, the cross of
voluntary self-renunciation. How did Christ come to the cross? We read
in Philippians the seven steps of his descent from heaven to Calvary. He
had everything that even the Son of God could hold precious, even to the
actual equal sharing of the glory of God. Yet for man''s sake what did he
do? He did not hold fast even His equality with God, He emptied Himself,
took on Him the form of a servant, was made in the likeness of fallen
humanity; even more than this, He humbled Himself even as a man,
identifying Himself with our poverty and misery and sin; He accepted
death for our sakes, and that, the death of shame on the tree of curse.
Every step was downward until He who had been worshipped by angels was
reviled by thieves, and the crown of glory was displaced by the crown of
thorns! That is what the cross meant to Him. And He says: "If any man
will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up the cross and
follow Me." This cross is not forced upon us as are many of the little
vexations and trials which we call ''our crosses''; it is taken up by
us, in voluntary self-sacrifice for His sake. We choose self-abnegation,
to lose our life in sacrifice that we may find it again in service. That
is the self-oblivion of love. And Mr. Müller illustrated it. From the
hour when he began to serve the Crucified One he entered more and more
fully into the fellowship of His sufferings, seeking to be made
conformable unto His death. He gave up fortune-seeking and fame-seeking;
he cut loose from the world with its snares and joys; he separated
himself from even its doubtful practices, he tested even churchly
traditions and customs by the word of God, and step by step conformed to
the pattern showed in that word. Every such step was a new self-denial,
but it was following Him. He chose voluntary poverty that others might
be rich, and voluntary loss that others might have gain. His life was
one long endeavour to bless others, to be the channel for conveying
God''s truth and love and grace to them. Like Paul he rejoiced in such
sufferings for others, because thus he filled up that which is behind of
the afflictions of Christ in his flesh for His body''s sake which is the
church.* And unless Love''s voluntary sacrifice be taken into account,
George Müller''s life will still remain an enigma. Loyalty to truth, the
obedience of faith, the sacrifice of love—these form the threefold key
that unlocks to us all the closed chambers of that life, and these will,
in another sense, unlock any other life to the entrance of God, and
present to Him an open door into all departments of one''s being. George
Müller had no monopoly of holy living and holy serving. He followed his
Lord, both in self-surrender to the will of God and in self-sacrifice
for the welfare of man, and herein lay his whole secret.

To one who asked him the secret of his service he said: "There was a day
when I died, utterly died;" and, as he spoke, he bent lower and lower
until he almost touched the floor—"died to George Müller, his opinions,
preferences, tastes and will—died to the world, its approval or
censure—died to the approval or blame even of my brethren and
friends—and since then I have studied only to show myself approved unto
God."

When George Müller trusted the blood for salvation, he took Abel''s
position; when he undertook a consecrated walk he took Enoch''s; when he
came into fellowship with God for his life-work he stood beside Noah;
when he rested only on God''s word, he was one with Abraham; and when he
died to self and the world, he reached the self-surrender of Moses.

The godlike qualities of this great and good man made him none the less
a man. His separation unto God implied no unnatural isolation from his
fellow mortals. Like Terence, he could say: "I am a man, and nothing
common to man is foreign to me." To be well known, Mr. Müller needed to
be known in his daily, simple, home life. It was my privilege to meet
him often, and in his own apartment at Orphan House No. 3. His room was
of medium size, neatly but plainly furnished, with table and chairs,
lounge and writing-desk, etc. His Bible almost always lay open, as a
book to which he continually resorted.

His form was tall and slim, always neatly attired, and very erect, and
his step firm and strong. His countenance, in repose, might have been
thought stern, but for the smile which so habitually lit up his eyes and
played over his features that it left its impress on the lines of his
face. His manner was one of simple courtesy and unstudied dignity: no
one would in his presence, have felt like vain trifling, and there was
about him a certain indescribable air of authority and majesty that
reminded one of a born prince; and yet there was mingled with all this a
simplicity so childlike that even children felt themselves at home with
him. In his speech, he never quite lost that peculiar foreign quality,
known as accent, and he always spoke with slow and measured
articulation, as though a double watch were set at the door of his lips.
With him that unruly member, the tongue, was tamed by the Holy Spirit,
and he had that mark of what James calls a ''perfect man, able also to
bridle the whole body.''

Those who knew but little of him and saw him only in his serious moods
might have thought him lacking in that peculiarly human quality,
humour. But neither was he an ascetic nor devoid of that element of
innocent appreciation of the ludicrous and that keen enjoyment of a good
story which seem essential to a complete man. His habit was sobriety,
but he relished a joke that was free of all taint of uncleanness and
that had about it no sting for others. To those whom he best knew and
loved he showed his true self, in his playful moods,—as when at
Ilfracombe, climbing with his wife and others the heights that overlook
the sea, he walked on a little in advance, seated himself till the rest
came up with him, and then, when they were barely seated, rose and
quietly said, "Well now, we have had a good rest, let us go on." This
one instance may suffice to show that his sympathy with his divine
Master did not lessen or hinder his complete fellow feeling with man.
That must be a defective piety which puts a barrier between a saintly
soul and whatsoever pertains to humanity. He who chose us out of the
world sent us back into it, there to find our sphere of service; and in
order to such service we must keep in close and vital touch with human
beings as did our divine Lord Himself.

Service to God was with George Müller a passion. In the month of May,
1897, he was persuaded to take at Huntly a little rest from his constant
daily work at the orphan houses. The evening that he arrived he said,
What opportunity is there here for services for the Lord? When it was
suggested to him that he had just come from continuous work, and that it
was a time for rest, he replied that, being now free from his usual
labours, he felt he must be occupied in some other way in serving the
Lord, to glorify whom was his object in life. Meetings were accordingly
arranged and he preached both at Huntly and at Teignmouth.

As we cast this last glance backward over this life of peculiar sanctity
and service, one lesson seems written across it in unmistakable letters:
PREVAILING PRAYER. If a consecrated human life is an example used by
God to teach us the philosophy of holy living, then this man was meant
to show us how prayer, offered in simple faith, has power with God.

One paragraph of Scripture conspicuously presents the truth which George
Müller''s living epistle enforces and illustrates; it is found in James
v. 16-18:

"The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much," is the
sentence which opens the paragraph. No translation has ever done it
justice. Rotherham renders it: "Much avails a righteous man''s
supplication, working inwardly." The Revised Version translates, "avails
much in its working." The difficulty of translating lies not in the
obscurity but in the fulness of the meaning of the original. There
is a Greek middle participle here
(ενεργουμενη),
which may indicate "either the cause or
the time of the effectiveness of the prayer," and may mean, through
its working, or while it is actively working. The idea is that such
prayer has about it supernatural energy. Perhaps the best key to the
meaning of these ten words is to interpret them in the light of the
whole paragraph:

"Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed
earnestly that it might not rain; and it rained not on the earth by the
space of three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven
gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit."

Two things are here plainly put before us: first, that Elijah was but a
man, of like nature with other men and subject to all human frailties
and infirmities; and, secondly, that this man was such a power because
he was a man of prayer: he prayed earnestly; literally "he prayed with
prayer"; prayed habitually and importunately. No man can read Elijah''s
short history as given in the word of God, without seeing that he was a
man like ourselves. Under the juniper-tree of doubt and despondency, he
complained of his state and wished he might die. In the cave of a morbid
despair, he had to be met and subdued by the vision of God and by the
still, small voice. He was just like other men. It was not, therefore,
because he was above human follies and frailties, but because he was
subject to them, that he is held up to us as an encouraging example of
power that prevails in prayer. He laid hold of the Almighty Arm because
he was weak, and he kept hold because to lose hold was to let weakness
prevail. Nevertheless, this man, by prayer alone, shut up heaven''s
floodgates for three years and a half, and then by the same key unlocked
them. Yes, this man tested the meaning of those wonderful words:
"concerning the work of My hands command ye Me." (Isaiah xlv. 11.) God
put the forces of nature for the time under the sway of this one man''s
prayer—one frail, feeble, foolish mortal locked and unlocked the
springs of waters, because he held God''s key.

George Müller was simply another Elijah. Like him, a man subject to all
human infirmities, he had his fits of despondency and murmuring, of
distrust and waywardness; but he prayed and kept praying. He denied that
he was a miracle-worker, in any sense that implies elevation of
character and endowment above other fellow disciples, as though he were
a specially privileged saint; but in a sense he was a miracle-worker,
if by that is meant that he wrought wonders impossible to the natural
and carnal man. With God all things are possible, and so are they
declared to be to him that believeth. God meant that George Müller,
wherever his work was witnessed or his story is read, should be a
standing rebuke, to the practical impotence of the average disciple.
While men are asking whether prayer can accomplish similar wonders as of
old, here is a man who answers the question by the indisputable logic of
facts. Powerlessness always means prayerlessness. It is not necessary
for us to be sinlessly perfect, or to be raised to a special dignity of
privilege and endowment, in order to wield this wondrous weapon of power
with God; but it is necessary that we be men and women of
prayer—habitual, believing, importunate prayer.

George Müller considered nothing too small to be a subject of prayer,
because nothing is too small to be the subject of God''s care. If He
numbers our hairs, and notes a sparrow''s fall, and clothes the grass in
the field, nothing about His children is beneath His tender thought. In
every emergency, his one resort was to carry his want to his Father.
When, in 1858, a legacy of five hundred pounds was, after fourteen
months in chancery, still unpaid, the Lord was besought to cause this
money soon to be placed in his hands; and he prayed that legacy out of
the bonds of chancery as prayer, long before, brought Peter out of
prison. The money was paid contrary to all human likelihood, and with
interest at four per cent. When large gifts were proffered, prayer was
offered for grace to know whether to accept or decline, that no money
might be greedily grasped at for its own sake; and he prayed that, if it
could not be accepted without submitting to conditions which were
dishonouring to God, it might be declined so graciously, lovingly,
humbly, and yet firmly, that the manner of its refusal and return might
show that he was acting, not in his own behalf, but as a servant under
the authority of a higher Master.

These are graver matters and might well be carried to God for guidance
and help. But George Müller did not stop here. In the lesser affairs,
even down to the least, he sought and received like aid. His oldest
friend, Robert C. Chapman of Barnstaple, gave the writer the following
simple incident:

In the early days of his love to Christ, visiting a friend, and seeing
him mending a quill pen, he said: "Brother H——, do you pray to God
when you mend your pen?" The answer was: "It would be well to do so, but
I cannot say that I do pray when mending my pen." Brother Müller
replied: "I always do, and so I mend my pen much better."

As we cast this last backward glance at this man of God, seven
conspicuous qualities stand out in him, the combination of which made
him what he was: Stainless uprightness, child-like simplicity,
business-like precision, tenacity of purpose, boldness of faith,
habitual prayer, and cheerful self-surrender. His holy living was a
necessary condition of his abundant serving, as seems so beautifully
hinted in the seventeenth verse of the ninetieth Psalm:

"Let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us,
        And establish Thou the work of our hands upon us."

How can the work of our hands be truly established by the blessing of
our Lord, unless His beauty also is upon us—the beauty of His holiness
transforming our lives and witnessing to His work in us?

So much for the backward look. We must not close without a forward look
also. There are two remarkable sayings of our Lord which are complements
to each other and should be put side by side:

One of these presents the cross, the other the crown; one the
renunciation, the other the compensation. In both cases it is, "Let him
follow Me"; but in the second of these passages the following of Christ
goes further than the cross of Calvary; it reaches through the
sepulchre to the Resurrection Life, the Forty Days'' Holy Walk in the
Spirit, the Ascension to the Heavenlies, the session at the Right Hand
of God, the Reappearing at His Second Coming, and the fellowship of His
final Reign in Glory. And two compensations are especially made
prominent: first, the Eternal Home with Christ; and, second the
Exalted Honour from the Father. We too often look only at the cross
and the crucifixion, and so see our life in Christ only in its oneness
with Him in suffering and serving; we need to look beyond and see our
oneness with Him in recompense and reward, if we are to get a complete
view of His promise and our prospect. Self-denial is not so much an
impoverishment as a postponement: we make a sacrifice of a present
good for the sake of a future and greater good. Even our Lord Himself
was strengthened to endure the cross and despise the shame by the joy
that was set before Him and the glory of His final victory. If there
were seven steps downward in humiliation, there are seven upward in
exaltation, until beneath His feet every knee shall bow in homage, and
every tongue confess His universal Lordship. He that descended is the
same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that He might fill all
things.

George Müller counted all as loss that men count gain, but it was for
the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus, his Lord. He suffered the loss
of all things and counted them as dung, but it was that he might win
Christ and be found in Him; that he might know Him, and not only the
fellowship of His sufferings and conformity to His death, but the power
of His resurrection, conformity to His life, and fellowship in His
glory. He left all behind that the world values, but he reached forth
and pressed forward toward the goal, for the prize of the high calling
of God in Christ Jesus. "Let us, therefore, as many as be perfect, be
thus minded."

When the Lord Jesus was upon earth, there was one disciple whom He
loved, who also leaned on His breast, having the favoured place which
only one could occupy. But now that He is in heaven, every disciple may
be the loved one, and fill the favoured place, and lean on His bosom.
There is no exclusive monopoly of privilege and blessing. He that
follows closely and abides in Him knows the peculiar closeness of
contact, the honour of intimacy, that are reserved for such as are
called and chosen and faithful, and follow the Lamb whithersoever He
goeth. God''s self-denying servants are on their way to the final
sevenfold perfection, at home with Him, and crowned with honour:
      "And there shall be no more
curse;
        But the throne of God
and of the Lamb shall be in it;
        And His servants shall
serve Him;
        And they shall see His
face;
        And His name shall be in
their foreheads,
        And there shall be no
night there,
        And they shall reign for
ever and ever."
          Amen!

CERTAIN marked Scripture precepts and promises had such a singular
influence upon this man of God, and so often proved the guides to his
course, that they illustrate Psalm cxix. 105:

Those texts which, at the parting of the way, became to him God''s
signboards, showing him the true direction, are here given, as nearly as
may be in the order in which they became so helpful to him. The study of
them will prove a kind of spiritual biography, outlining his career.

1. That the word of God alone is our standard of judgment in spiritual
things; that it can be explained only by the Holy Spirit; and that in
our day, as well as in former times, He is the teacher of His people.
The office of the Holy Spirit I had not experimentally understood before
that time. Indeed, of the office of each of the blessed persons, in what
is commonly called the Trinity, I had no experimental apprehension. I
had not before seen from the Scriptures that the Father chose us before
the foundation of the world; that in Him that wonderful plan of our
redemption originated, and that He also appointed all the means by which
it was to be brought about. Further, that the Son, to save us, had
fulfilled the law, to satisfy its demands, and with it also the holiness
of God; that He had borne the punishment due to our sins, and had thus
satisfied the justice of God. And further, that the Holy Spirit alone
can teach us about our state by nature, show us the need of a Saviour,
enable us to believe in Christ, explain to us the Scriptures, help us in
preaching, etc. It was my beginning to understand this latter point in
particular, which had a great effect on me; for the Lord enabled me to
put it to the test of experience, by laying aside commentaries, and
almost every other book, and simply reading the word of God and studying
it. The result of this was, that the first evening that I shut myself
into my room, to give myself to prayer and meditation over the
Scriptures, I learned more in a few hours than I had done during a
period of several months previously. But the particular difference was
that I received real strength for my soul in doing so. I now began to
try by the test of the Scriptures the things which I had learned and
seen, and found that only those principles which stood the test were
really of value.

2. Before this period I had been much opposed to the doctrines of
election, particular redemption, and final persevering grace: so much so
that, a few days after my arrival at Teignmouth I called election a
