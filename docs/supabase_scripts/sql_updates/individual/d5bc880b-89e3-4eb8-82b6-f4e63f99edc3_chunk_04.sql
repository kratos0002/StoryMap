guests had an earthenware jug standing in front
of him. The philosopher Thomas had to take
part in the feast, and as the Little Russians when
they are intoxicated always begin to kiss each
other or to weep, the whole room soon began to
echo with demonstrations of affection.

One Cossack, with a grey moustache, the
eldest of them all, leant his head on his hand
and began to weep bitterly because he was an
orphan and alone in God''s wide world. Another
tall, loquacious man did his best to comfort him,
 
saying, “Don''t weep, for God''s sake, don''t
weep! For over there—God knows best.”

The Cossack who had been addressed as
Dorosch was full of curiosity, and addressed
many questions to the philosopher Thomas. “I
should like to know,” he said, “what you learn
in your seminary; do you learn the same things
as the deacon reads to us in church, or something
else?”

“Don''t ask,” said the consoler; “let them
learn what they like. God knows what is to
happen; God knows everything.”

“No, I will know,” answered Dorosch, “I
will know what is written in their books; perhaps
it is something quite different from that in the
deacon''s book.”

“O good heavens!” said the other, “why all
this talk? It is God''s will, and one cannot
change God''s arrangements.”

“But I will know everything that is written;
I will enter the seminary too, by heaven I will!
Do you think perhaps I could not learn? I will
learn everything, everything.”

“Oh, heavens!” exclaimed the consoler, and
let his head sink on the table, for he could no
longer hold it upright.

When the philosopher Thomas saw the state
they were in, he determined to profit by it, and
 
to make his escape. In the first place he turned
to the grey-headed Cossack, who was lamenting
the loss of his parents. “But, little uncle,” he
said to him, “why do you weep so? I too am
an orphan! Let me go, children; why do you
want me?”

They were about to take him outside themselves,
when the one who had displayed a special
thirst for knowledge, stopped them, saying, “No,
I want to talk with him about the seminary; I am
going to the seminary myself.”

Moreover, it was not yet certain whether the
philosopher could have executed his project of
flight, for when he tried to rise from his chair,
he felt as though his feet were made of wood,
and he began to see such a number of doors leading
out of the room that it would have been
difficult for him to have found the right one.

It was not till evening that the company remembered
that they must continue their journey.
They crowded into the kibitka, whipped up the
horses, and struck up a song, the words and sense
of which were hard to understand. During a
great part of the night, they wandered about,
having lost the road which they ought to have
been able to find blindfolded. At last they drove
down a steep descent into a valley, and the
philosopher noticed, by the sides of the road,
 
hedges, behind which he caught glimpses of
small trees and house-roofs. All these belonged
to the colonel''s estate.

It was already long past midnight. The sky
was dark, though little stars glimmered here
and there; no light was to be seen in any of
the houses. They drove into a large court-yard,
while the dogs barked. On all sides were barns
and cottages with thatched roofs. Just opposite
the gateway was a house, which was larger than
the others, and seemed to be the colonel''s dwelling.
The kibitka stopped before a small barn,
and the travellers hastened into it and laid
themselves down to sleep. The philosopher however
attempted to look at the exterior of the
house, but, rub his eyes as he might, he could
distinguish nothing; the house seemed to turn
into a bear, and the chimney into the rector of
the seminary. Then he gave it up and lay down
to sleep.

When he woke up the next morning, the whole
house was in commotion; the young lady had
died during the night. The servants ran hither
and thither in a distracted state; the old women
wept and lamented; and a number of curious
people gazed through the enclosure into the
court-yard, as though there were something
special to be seen. The philosopher began now
to inspect the locality and the buildings, which
he had not been able to do during the night.

The colonel''s house was one of those low,
small buildings, such as used formerly to be constructed
in Russia. It was thatched with straw;
a small, high-peaked gable, with a window
shaped like an eye, was painted all over with
blue and yellow flowers and red crescent-moons;
it rested on little oaken pillars, which were round
above the middle, hexagonal below, and whose
capitals were adorned with quaint carvings.
Under this gable was a small staircase with seats
at the foot of it on either side.

The walls of the house were supported by
similar pillars. Before the house stood a large
pear-tree of pyramidal shape, whose leaves incessantly
trembled. A double row of buildings
formed a broad street leading up to the colonel''s
house. Behind the barns near the entrance-gate
stood two three-cornered wine-houses, also
thatched with straw; each of the stone walls had
a door in it, and was covered with all kinds of
paintings. On one was represented a Cossack
sitting on a barrel and swinging a large pitcher
over his head; it bore the inscription “I will
drink all that!” Elsewhere were painted large
and small bottles, a beautiful girl, a running
horse, a pipe, and a drum bearing the words
“Wine is the Cossack''s joy.”

In the loft of one of the barns one saw through
a huge round window a drum and some trumpets.
At the gate there stood two cannons. All this
 
showed that the colonel loved a cheerful life, and
the whole place often rang with sounds of merriment.
Before the gate were two windmills, and
behind the house gardens sloped away; through
the tree-tops the dark chimneys of the peasants''
houses were visible. The whole village lay on a
broad, even plateau, in the middle of a mountain-slope
which culminated in a steep summit on
the north side. When seen from below, it
looked still steeper. Here and there on the top
the irregular stems of the thick steppe-brooms
showed in dark relief against the blue sky. The
bare clay soil made a melancholy impression,
worn as it was into deep furrows by rain-water.
On the same slope there stood two cottages, and
over one of them a huge apple-tree spread its
branches; the roots were supported by small
props, whose interstices were filled with mould.
The apples, which were blown off by the wind,
rolled down to the court-yard below. A road
wound round the mountain to the village.

When the philosopher looked at this steep
slope, and remembered his journey of the night
before, he came to the conclusion that either the
colonel''s horses were very sagacious, or that the
Cossacks must have very strong heads, as they
ventured, even when the worse for drink, on
such a road with the huge kibitka.

When the philosopher turned and looked in
the opposite direction, he saw quite another
 
picture. The village reached down to the plain;
meadows stretched away to an immense distance,
their bright green growing gradually dark; far
away, about twenty versts off, many other villages
were visible. To the right of these meadows
were chains of hills, and in the remote distance
one saw the Dnieper shimmer and sparkle like a
mirror of steel.

“What a splendid country!” said the
philosopher to himself. “It must be fine to live
here! One could catch fish in the Dnieper, and
in the ponds, and shoot and snare partridges and
bustards; there must be quantities here. Much
fruit might be dried here and sold in the town,
or, better still, brandy might be distilled from it,
for fruit-brandy is the best of all. But what prevents
me thinking of my escape after all?”

Behind the hedge he saw a little path which
was almost entirely concealed by the high grass
of the steppe. The philosopher approached it
mechanically, meaning at first to walk a little
along it unobserved, and then quite quietly to
gain the open country behind the peasants''
houses. Suddenly he felt the pressure of a fairly
heavy hand on his shoulder.

Behind him stood the same old Cossack who
yesterday had so bitterly lamented the death of
his father and mother, and his own loneliness.
“You are giving yourself useless trouble, Mr
Philosopher, if you think you can escape from
 
us,” he said. “One cannot run away here; and
besides, the roads are too bad for walkers. Come
to the colonel; he has been waiting for you for
some time in his room.”

“Yes, of course! What are you talking
about? I will come with the greatest pleasure,”
said the philosopher, and followed the Cossack.

The colonel was an elderly man; his moustache
was grey, and his face wore the signs of deep sadness.
He sat in his room by a table, with his
head propped on both hands. He seemed about
five-and-fifty, but his attitude of utter despair,
and the pallor on his face, showed that his heart
had been suddenly broken, and that all his former
cheerfulness had for ever disappeared.

When Thomas entered with the Cossack, he
answered their deep bows with a slight inclination
of the head.

“Who are you, whence do you come, and
what is your profession, my good man?” asked
the colonel in an even voice, neither friendly nor
austere.

“I don''t know either; I know that I must have
had a mother, but who she was, and where she
lived, by heavens, I do not know.”

The colonel was silent, and seemed for a
moment lost in thought. “Where did you come
to know my daughter?”

The philosopher shrugged his shoulders.
“God only knows. It is a well-known fact that
grand people often demand things which the
most learned man cannot comprehend; and does
not the proverb say, ‘Dance, devil, as the Lord
commands!’”

“If she had only lived a moment longer,”
said the colonel sadly, “then I had certainly
found out everything. She said, ‘Let no one
offer up prayers for me, but send, father, at once
to the seminary in Kieff for the student Thomas
Brutus; he shall pray three nights running for
my sinful soul—he knows.’ But what he really
knows she never said. The poor dove could
speak no more, and died. Good man, you are
probably well known for your sanctity and
devout life, and she has perhaps heard of you.”

“What? Of me?” said the philosopher, and
took a step backward in amazement. “I and
 
sanctity!” he exclaimed, and stared at the
colonel. “God help us, gracious sir! What
are you saying? It was only last Holy Thursday
that I paid a visit to the tart-shop.”

“Well, she must at any rate have had some
reason for making the arrangement, and you
must begin your duties to-day.”

“I should like to remark to your honour—naturally
everyone who knows the Holy Scripture
at all can in his measure—but I believe it would
be better on this occasion to send for a deacon
or subdeacon. They are learned people, and
they know exactly what is to be done. I have
not got a good voice, nor any official standing.”

“You may say what you like, but I shall carry
out all my dove''s wishes. If you read the prayers
for her three nights through in the proper way, I
will reward you; and if not—I advise the devil
himself not to oppose me!”

The colonel spoke the last words in such an
emphatic way that the philosopher quite understood
them.

They went into the hall. The colonel opened
a door which was opposite his own. The
philosopher remained for a few minutes in the
hall in order to look about him; then he stepped
over the threshold with a certain nervousness.

The whole floor of the room was covered with
red cloth. In a corner under the icons of the
 
saints, on a table covered with a gold-bordered,
velvet cloth, lay the body of the girl. Tall
candles, round which were wound branches of
the “calina,” stood at her head and feet, and
burned dimly in the broad daylight. The face
of the dead was not to be seen, as the inconsolable
father sat before his daughter, with his
back turned to the philosopher. The words
which the latter overheard filled him with a
certain fear:

“I do not mourn, my daughter, that in the
flower of your age you have prematurely left the
earth, to my grief; but I mourn, my dove, that
I do not know my deadly enemy who caused your
death. Had I only known that anyone could
even conceive the idea of insulting you, or of
speaking a disrespectful word to you, I swear by
heaven he would never have seen his children
again, if he had been as old as myself; nor his
father and mother, if he had been young. And I
would have thrown his corpse to the birds of the
air, and the wild beasts of the steppe. But woe
is me, my flower, my dove, my light! I will spend
the remainder of my life without joy, and wipe
the bitter tears which flow out of my old eyes,
while my enemy will rejoice and laugh in secret
over the helpless old man!”

The philosopher was deeply affected by the
 
sight of such inconsolable sorrow. He coughed
gently in order to clear his throat. The colonel
turned and signed to him to take his place at the
head of the dead girl, before a little prayer-desk
on which some books lay.

“I can manage to hold out for three nights,”
thought the philosopher; “and then the colonel
will fill both my pockets with ducats.”

He approached the dead girl, and after coughing
once more, began to read, without paying
attention to anything else, and firmly resolved
not to look at her face.

Soon there was deep silence, and he saw that
the colonel had left the room. Slowly he turned
his head in order to look at the corpse. A
violent shudder thrilled through him; before him
lay a form of such beauty as is seldom seen
upon earth. It seemed to him that never in a
single face had so much intensity of expression
and harmony of feature been united. Her brow,
soft as snow and pure as silver, seemed to be
thinking; the fine, regular eyebrows shadowed
proudly the closed eyes, whose lashes gently
rested on her cheeks, which seemed to glow with
secret longing; her lips still appeared to smile.
But at the same time he saw something in these
features which appalled him; a terrible depression
seized his heart, as when in the midst of
dance and song someone begins to chant a dirge.
He felt as though those ruby lips were coloured
 
with his own heart''s blood. Moreover, her face
seemed dreadfully familiar.

“The witch!” he cried out in a voice which
sounded strange to himself; then he turned away
and began to read the prayers with white cheeks.
It was the witch whom he had killed.

When the sun had sunk below the horizon,
the corpse was carried into the church. The
philosopher supported one corner of the black-draped
coffin upon his shoulder, and felt an ice-cold
shiver run through his body. The colonel
walked in front of him, with his right hand
resting on the edge of the coffin.

The wooden church, black with age and
overgrown with green lichen, stood quite at the
end of the village in gloomy solitude; it was
adorned with three round cupolas. One saw at
the first glance that it had not been used for
divine worship for a long time.

Lighted candles were standing before almost
every icon. The coffin was set down before the
altar. The old colonel kissed his dead daughter
once more, and then left the church, together
with the bearers of the bier, after he had ordered
his servants to look after the philosopher and to
take him back to the church after supper.

The coffin-bearers, when they returned to the
 
house, all laid their hands on the stove. This
custom is always observed in Little Russia by
those who have seen a corpse.

The hunger which the philosopher now began
to feel caused him for a while to forget the dead
girl altogether. Gradually all the domestics of
the house assembled in the kitchen; it was really
a kind of club, where they were accustomed to
gather. Even the dogs came to the door, wagging
their tails in order to have bones and offal
thrown to them.

If a servant was sent on an errand, he always
found his way into the kitchen to rest there for
a while, and to smoke a pipe. All the Cossacks
of the establishment lay here during the whole
day on and under the benches—in fact, wherever
a place could be found to lie down in. Moreover,
everyone was always leaving something
behind in the kitchen—his cap, or his whip, or
something of the sort. But the numbers of the
club were not complete till the evening, when
the groom came in after tying up his horses in
the stable, the cowherd had shut up his cows
in their stalls, and others collected there who
were not usually seen in the day-time. During
supper-time even the tongues of the laziest were
set in motion. They talked of all and everything—of
the new pair of breeches which someone
had ordered for himself, of what might be
in the centre of the earth, and of the wolf which
 
someone had seen. There were a number of
wits in the company—a class which is always
represented in Little Russia.

The philosopher took his place with the rest in
the great circle which sat round the kitchen door
in the open-air. Soon an old woman with a red
cap issued from it, bearing with both hands a
large vessel full of hot “galuchkis,” which she
distributed among them. Each drew out of
his pocket a wooden spoon, or a one-pronged
wooden fork. As soon as their jaws began to
move a little more slowly, and their wolfish
hunger was somewhat appeased, they began to
talk. The conversation, as might be expected,
turned on the dead girl.

“Is it true,” said a young shepherd, “is it
true—though I cannot understand it—that our
young mistress had traffic with evil spirits?”

“Who, the young lady?” answered Dorosch,
whose acquaintance the philosopher had already
made in the kibitka. “Yes, she was a regular
witch! I can swear that she was a witch!”

“Hold your tongue, Dorosch!” exclaimed
another—the one who, during the journey, had
played the part of a consoler. “We have
nothing to do with that. May God be merciful
to her! One ought not to talk of such things.”

But Dorosch was not at all inclined to be
silent; he had just visited the wine-cellar with
the steward on important business, and having
 
stooped two or three times over one or two casks,
he had returned in a very cheerful and loquacious
mood.

“Why do you ask me to be silent?” he
answered. “She has ridden on my own shoulders,
I swear she has.”

“No, there are not,” answered Dorosch;
“even if you knew the Psalter by heart, you
could not recognise one.”

“Yes, Dorosch, it is possible; don''t talk such
nonsense,” retorted the former consoler. “It
is not for nothing that God has given each some
special peculiarity; the learned maintain that
every witch has a little tail.”

“Yes, you are a fine lot,” retorted the old
woman who entered at that moment with a vessel
full of fresh “galuchkis.” “You are great fat
pigs!”

A self-satisfied smile played round the lips of
the old Cossack whose name was Javtuch, when
he found that his remark had touched the old
woman on a tender point. The shepherd burst
into such a deep and loud explosion of laughter
as if two oxen were lowing together.

This conversation excited in the philosopher
 
a great curiosity, and a wish to obtain more
exact information regarding the colonel''s
daughter. In order to lead the talk back to the
subject, he turned to his next neighbour and
said, “I should like to know why all the people
here think that the young lady was a witch.
Has she done harm to anyone, or killed them by
witchcraft?”

“Yes, there are reports of that kind,”
answered a man, whose face was as flat as a
shovel. “Who does not remember the huntsman
Mikita, or the——”

“You, Mr Philosopher Thomas, did not know
Mikita. Ah! he was an extraordinary man.
He knew every dog as though he were his own
father. The present huntsman, Mikola, who sits
three places away from me, is not fit to hold a
candle to him, though good enough in his way;
but compared to Mikita, he is a mere milksop.”

“He saw a hare in the field quicker than
you can take a pinch of snuff. He only needed
to whistle ‘Come here, Rasboy! Come here,
Bosdraja!’ and flew away on his horse like the
wind, so that you could not say whether he went
quicker than the dog or the dog than he. He
could empty a quart pot of brandy in the twinkling
of an eye. Ah! he was a splendid huntsman,
only for some time he always had his eyes
fixed on the young lady. Either he had fallen
in love with her or she had bewitched him—in
short, he went to the dogs. He became a regular
old woman; yes, he became the devil knows what—it
is not fitting to relate it.”

“If the young lady only looked at him, he let
the reins slip out of his hands, called Bravko
instead of Rasboy, stumbled, and made all kinds
of mistakes. One day when he was currycombing
a horse, the young lady came to him in the
stable. ‘Listen, Mikita,’ she said. ‘I should
like for once to set my foot on you.’ And he,
the booby, was quite delighted, and answered,
‘Don''t only set your foot there, but sit on me
altogether.’ The young lady lifted her white
little foot, and as soon as he saw it, his delight
robbed him of his senses. He bowed his neck,
the idiot, took her feet in both hands, and began
to trot about like a horse all over the place.
 
Whither they went he could not say; he returned
more dead than alive, and from that time he
wasted away and became as dry as a chip of
wood. At last someone coming into the stable
one day found instead of him only a handful
of ashes and an empty jug; he had burned
completely out. But it must be said he
was a huntsman such as the world cannot
match.”

When Spirid had ended his tale, they all began
to vie with one another in praising the deceased
huntsman.

“Ha! Ha! One sees they don''t teach you
much in your seminary. Well, listen. We
have here in our village a Cossack called Cheptoun,
a fine fellow. Sometimes indeed he
amuses himself by stealing and lying without any
reason; but he is a fine fellow for all that. His
house is not far away from here. One evening,
just about this time, Cheptoun and his wife went
to bed after they had finished their day''s work.
Since it was fine weather, Cheptchicha went to
sleep in the court-yard, and Cheptoun in the
house—no! I mean Cheptchicha went to sleep
in the house on a bench and Cheptoun outside——”

“No, Cheptchicha didn''t go to sleep on a
 
bench, but on the ground,” interrupted the old
woman who stood at the door.

Dorosch looked at her, then at the ground,
then again at her, and said after a pause, “If I
tore your dress off your back before all these
people, it wouldn''t look pretty.”

“In the cradle which hung in the middle of the
room lay a one-year-old child. I do not know
whether it was a boy or a girl. Cheptchicha had
lain down, and heard on the other side of the
door a dog scratching and howling loud enough
to frighten anyone. She was afraid, for women
are such simple folk that if one puts out one''s
tongue at them behind the door in the dark, their
hearts sink into their boots. ‘But,’ she thought
to herself, ‘I must give this cursed dog one on
the snout to stop his howling!’ So she seized
the poker and opened the door. But hardly had
she done so than the dog rushed between her
legs straight to the cradle. Then Cheptchicha
saw that it was not a dog but the young lady;
and if it had only been the young lady as she
knew her it wouldn''t have mattered, but she
looked quite blue, and her eyes sparkled like fiery
coals. She seized the child, bit its throat, and
began to suck its blood. Cheptchicha shrieked,
‘Ah! my darling child!’ and rushed out of the
 
room. Then she saw that the house-door was
shut and rushed up to the attic and sat there, the
stupid woman, trembling all over. Then the
young lady came after her and bit her too, poor
fool! The next morning Cheptoun carried his
wife, all bitten and wounded, down from the
attic, and the next day she died. Such strange
things happen in the world. One may wear fine
clothes, but that does not matter; a witch is and
remains a witch.”

After telling his story, Dorosch looked around
him with a complacent air, and cleaned out his
pipe with his little finger in order to fill it again.
The story of the witch had made a deep impression
on all, and each of them had something to
say about her. One had seen her come to the
door of his house in the form of a hayrick; from
others she had stolen their caps or their pipes;
she had cut off the hair-plaits of many girls in
the village, and drunk whole pints of the blood
of others.

At last the whole company observed that they
had gossiped over their time, for it was already
night. All looked for a sleeping place—some
in the kitchen and others in the barn or the
court-yard.

“Now, Mr Thomas, it is time that we go
to the dead,” said the grey-headed Cossack,
turning to the philosopher. All four—Spirid,
Dorosch, the old Cossack, and the philosopher—betook
 
themselves to the church, keeping off with
their whips the wild dogs who roamed about the
roads in great numbers and bit the sticks of
passers-by in sheer malice.

Although the philosopher had seized the opportunity
of fortifying himself beforehand with a
stiff glass of brandy, yet he felt a certain secret
fear which increased as he approached the
church, which was lit up within. The strange
tales he had heard had made a deep impression
on his imagination. They had passed the thick
hedges and trees, and the country became more
open. At last they reached the small enclosure
round the church; behind it there were no more
trees, but a huge, empty plain dimly visible in
the darkness. The three Cossacks ascended the
steep steps with Thomas, and entered the church.
Here they left the philosopher, expressing their
hope that he would successfully accomplish his
duties, and locked him in as their master had
ordered.

He was left alone. At first he yawned, then
he stretched himself, blew on both hands, and
finally looked round him. In the middle of the
church stood the black bier; before the dark
pictures of saints burned the candles, whose
light only illuminated the icons, and cast a faint
glimmer into the body of the church; all the
corners were in complete darkness. The lofty
icons seemed to be of considerable age; only a
 
little of the original gilt remained on their broken
traceries; the faces of the saints had become
quite black and looked uncanny.

Once more the philosopher cast a glance
around him. “Bother it!” said he to himself.
“What is there to be afraid about? No living
creature can get in, and as for the dead and
those who come from the ‘other side,’ I can
protect myself with such effectual prayers that
they cannot touch me with the tips of their
fingers. There is nothing to fear,” he repeated,
swinging his arms. “Let us begin the
prayers!”

As he approached one of the side-aisles, he
noticed two packets of candles which had been
placed there.

“That is fine,” he thought. “I must
illuminate the whole church, till it is as bright
as day. What a pity that one cannot smoke
in it.”

He began to light the candles on all the wall-brackets
and all the candelabra, as well as those
already burning before the holy pictures; soon
the whole church was brilliantly lit up. Only
the darkness in the roof above seemed still
denser by contrast, and the faces of the saints
peering out of the frames looked as unearthly as
before. He approached the bier, looked nervously
at the face of the dead girl, could not
help shuddering slightly, and involuntarily closed
 
his eyes. What terrible and extraordinary
beauty!

He turned away and tried to go to one side,
but the strange curiosity and peculiar fascination
which men feel in moments of fear, compelled
him to look again and again, though with a
similar shudder. And in truth there was something
terrible about the beauty of the dead girl.
Perhaps she would not have inspired so much
fear had she been less beautiful; but there was
nothing ghastly or deathlike in the face, which
wore rather an expression of life, and it seemed
to the philosopher as though she were watching
him from under her closed eyelids. He even
thought he saw a tear roll from under the eyelash
of her right eye, but when it was half-way
down her cheek, he saw that it was a drop
of blood.

He quickly went into one of the stalls, opened
his book, and began to read the prayers in a very
loud voice in order to keep up his courage. His
deep voice sounded strange to himself in the
grave-like silence; it aroused no echo in the
silent and desolate wooden walls of the church.

“What is there to be afraid of?” he thought
to himself. “She will not rise from her bier,
since she fears God''s word. She will remain
quietly resting. Yes, and what sort of a Cossack
should I be, if I were afraid? The fact is, I
have drunk a little too much—that is why I feel
 
so queer. Let me take a pinch of snuff. It is
really excellent—first-rate!”

At the same time he cast a furtive glance over
the pages of the prayer-book towards the bier,
and involuntarily he said to himself, “There!
See! She is getting up! Her head is already
above the edge of the coffin!”

But a death-like silence prevailed; the coffin
was motionless, and all the candles shone
steadily. It was an awe-inspiring sight, this
church lit up at midnight, with the corpse in the
midst, and no living soul near but one. The
philosopher began to sing in various keys in
order to stifle his fears, but every moment he
glanced across at the coffin, and involuntarily the
question came to his lips, “Suppose she rose up
after all?”

But the coffin did not move. Nowhere was
there the slightest sound nor stir. Not even
did a cricket chirp in any corner. There was
nothing audible but the slight sputtering of
some distant candle, or the faint fall of a drop
of wax.

He raised his head. Then he looked round
him wildly and rubbed his eyes. Yes, she was
no longer lying in the coffin, but sitting upright.
He turned away his eyes, but at once looked
again, terrified, at the coffin. She stood up;
then she walked with closed eyes through the
 
church, stretching out her arms as though she
wanted to seize someone.

She now came straight towards him. Full of
alarm, he traced with his finger a circle round
himself; then in a loud voice he began to recite
the prayers and formulas of exorcism which he
had learnt from a monk who had often seen
witches and evil spirits.

She had almost reached the edge of the circle
which he had traced; but it was evident that she
had not the power to enter it. Her face wore a
bluish tint like that of one who has been several
days dead.

Thomas had not the courage to look at her, so
terrible was her appearance; her teeth chattered
and she opened her dead eyes, but as in her rage
she saw nothing, she turned in another direction
and felt with outstretched arms among the pillars
and corners of the church in the hope of seizing
him.

The philosopher could not recover his self-possession,
and kept on gazing anxiously at it.
Suddenly it rose from its place and began hurtling
about the church with a whizzing sound.
At one time it was almost directly over his head;
but the philosopher observed that it could not
pass over the area of his charmed circle, so he
kept on repeating his formulas of exorcism. The
 
coffin now fell with a crash in the middle of the
church, and remained lying there motionless.
The corpse rose again; it had now a greenish-blue
colour, but at the same moment the distant
crowing of a cock was audible, and it lay down
again.

The philosopher''s heart beat violently, and the
perspiration poured in streams from his face;
but heartened by the crowing of the cock, he
rapidly repeated the prayers.

As the first light of dawn looked through the
windows, there came a deacon and the grey-haired
Javtuk, who acted as sacristan, in order
to release him. When he had reached the
house, he could not sleep for a long time; but at
last weariness overpowered him, and he slept till
noon. When he awoke, his experiences of the
night appeared to him like a dream. He was
given a quart of brandy to strengthen him.

At table he was again talkative and ate a fairly
large sucking pig almost without assistance.
But none the less he resolved to say nothing of
what he had seen, and to all curious questions
only returned the answer, “Yes, some wonderful
things happened.”

The philosopher was one of those men who,
when they have had a good meal, are uncommonly
amiable. He lay down on a bench, with
his pipe in his mouth, looked blandly at all, and
expectorated every minute.

But as the evening approached, he became
more and more pensive. About supper-time
nearly the whole company had assembled in order
to play “krapli.” This is a kind of game of
skittles, in which, instead of bowls, long staves
are used, and the winner has the right to ride on
the back of his opponent. It provided the spectators
with much amusement; sometimes the
groom, a huge man, would clamber on the back
of the swineherd, who was slim and short
and shrunken; another time the groom would
present his own back, while Dorosch sprang on
it shouting, “What a regular ox!” Those
of the company who were more staid sat by the
threshold of the kitchen. They looked uncommonly
serious, smoked their pipes, and did not
even smile when the younger ones went into fits
of laughter over some joke of the groom or
Spirid.

Thomas vainly attempted to take part in the
game; a gloomy thought was firmly fixed like a
nail in his head. In spite of his desperate efforts
to appear cheerful after supper, fear had overmastered
his whole being, and it increased with
the growing darkness.

“Now it is time for us to go, Mr Student!”
said the grey-haired Cossack, and stood up with
Dorosch. “Let us betake ourselves to our
work.”

Thomas was conducted to the church in the
 
same way as on the previous evening; again he
was left alone, and the door was bolted behind
him.

As soon as he found himself alone, he began
to feel in the grip of his fears. He again saw
the dark pictures of the saints in their gilt
frames, and the black coffin, which stood menacing
and silent in the middle of the church.

“Never mind!” he said to himself. “I am
over the first shock. The first time I was frightened,
but I am not so at all now—no, not at
all!”

He quickly went into a stall, drew a circle
round him with his finger, uttered some prayers
and formulas for exorcism, and then began to
read the prayers for the dead in a loud voice and
with the fixed resolution not to look up from the
book nor take notice of anything.

He did so for an hour, and began to grow a
little tired; he cleared his throat and drew his
snuff-box out of his pocket, but before he had
taken a pinch he looked nervously towards the
coffin.

A sudden chill shot through him. The witch
was already standing before him on the edge of
the circle, and had fastened her green eyes upon
him. He shuddered, looked down at the book,
and began to read his prayers and exorcisms
aloud. Yet all the while he was aware how her
teeth chattered, and how she stretched out her
 
arms to seize him. But when he cast a hasty
glance towards her, he saw that she was not
looking in his direction, and it was clear that she
could not see him.

Then she began to murmur in an undertone,
and terrible words escaped her lips—words that
sounded like the bubbling of boiling pitch. The
philosopher did not know their meaning, but he
knew that they signified something terrible, and
were intended to counteract his exorcisms.

After she had spoken, a stormy wind arose
in the church, and there was a noise like the
rushing of many birds. He heard the noise of
their wings and claws as they flapped against and
scratched at the iron bars of the church windows.
There were also violent blows on the church
door, as if someone were trying to break it in
pieces.

The philosopher''s heart beat violently; he did
not dare to look up, but continued to read
the prayers without a pause. At last there was
heard in the distance the shrill sound of a cock''s
crow. The exhausted philosopher stopped and
gave a great sigh of relief.

Those who came to release him found him
more dead than alive; he had leant his back
against the wall, and stood motionless, regarding
them without any expression in his eyes.
They were obliged almost to carry him to the
house; he then shook himself, asked for and
 
drank a quart of brandy. He passed his hand
through his hair and said, “There are all sorts
of horrors in the world, and such dreadful things
happen that——” Here he made a gesture as
though to ward off something. All who heard
him bent their heads forward in curiosity.
Even a small boy, who ran on everyone''s
errands, stood by with his mouth wide open.

Just then a young woman in a close-fitting
dress passed by. She was the old cook''s assistant,
and very coquettish; she always stuck
something in her bodice by way of ornament, a
ribbon or a flower, or even a piece of paper if
she could find nothing else.

“Good day, Thomas,” she said, as she saw
the philosopher. “Dear me! what has happened
to you?” she exclaimed, striking her
hands together.

“Yes, so he has!” said Spirid, regarding him
more closely. “You have grown as grey as our
old Javtuk.”

When the philosopher heard that, he hastened
into the kitchen, where he had noticed on the wall
a dirty, three-cornered piece of looking-glass.
In front of it hung some forget-me-nots, evergreens,
and a small garland—a proof that it was
the toilette-glass of the young coquette. With
 
alarm he saw that it actually was as they had
said—his hair was quite grizzled.

He sank into a reverie; at last he said to
himself, “I will go to the colonel, tell him all,
and declare that I will read no more prayers.
He must send me back at once to Kieff.” With
this intention he turned towards the door-steps
of the colonel''s house.

The colonel was sitting motionless in his room;
his face displayed the same hopeless grief which
Thomas had observed on it on his first arrival,
only the hollows in his cheeks had deepened. It
was obvious that he took very little or no food.
A strange paleness made him look almost as
though made of marble.

“Good day,” he said as he observed Thomas
standing, cap in hand, at the door. “Well,
how are you getting on? All right?”

“Yes, sir, all right! Such hellish things are
going on, that one would like to rush away as
far as one''s feet can carry one.”

“Your daughter, sir…. When one considers
the matter, she is, of course, of noble
descent—no one can dispute that; but don''t be
angry, and may God grant her eternal rest!”

“Pray! Pray! It was not for nothing that
she sent for you. My dove was troubled about
her salvation, and wished to expel all evil
influences by means of prayer.”

“Pray! Pray!” continued the colonel in the
same persuasive tone. “There is only one night
more; you are doing a Christian work, and I will
reward you richly.”

“However great your rewards may be, I will
not read the prayers any more, sir,” said
Thomas in a tone of decision.

“Listen, philosopher!” said the colonel with
a menacing air. “I will not allow any objections.
In your seminary you may act as you
like, but here it won''t do. If I have you
knouted, it will be somewhat different to the
rector''s canings. Do you know what a strong
‘kantchuk’(2) is?”

“Of course I do,” said the philosopher in a
low voice; “a number of them together are
insupportable.”

“Yes, I think so too. But you don''t know
yet how hot my fellows can make it,” replied
the colonel threateningly. He sprang up, and
his face assumed a fierce, despotic expression,
betraying the savagery of his nature, which
had been only temporarily modified by grief.
 
“After the first flogging they pour on brandy
and then repeat it. Go away and finish your
work. If you don''t obey, you won''t be able
to stand again, and if you do, you will get a
thousand ducats.”

“That is a devil of a fellow,” thought the
philosopher to himself, and went out. “One
can''t trifle with him. But wait a little, my
friend; I will escape you so cleverly, that even
your hounds can''t find me!”

He determined, under any circumstances, to
run away, and only waited till the hour after
dinner arrived, when all the servants were accustomed
to take a nap on the hay in the barn, and
to snore and puff so loudly that it sounded as if
machinery had been set up there. At last the
time came. Even Javtuch stretched himself out
in the sun and closed his eyes. Tremblingly,
and on tiptoe, the philosopher stole softly into
the garden, whence he thought he could escape
more easily into the open country. This garden
was generally so choked up with weeds that it
seemed admirably adapted for such an attempt.
With the exception of a single path used by the
people of the house, the whole of it was covered
with cherry-trees, elder-bushes, and tall heath-thistles
with fibrous red buds. All these trees
and bushes had been thickly overgrown with ivy,
which formed a kind of roof. Its tendrils
reached to the hedge and fell down on the other
 
side in snake-like curves among the small, wild
field-flowers. Behind the hedge which bordered
the garden was a dense mass of wild heather, in
which it did not seem probable that anyone would
care to venture himself, and the strong, stubborn
stems of which seemed likely to baffle any
attempt to cut them.

As the philosopher was about to climb over the
hedge, his teeth chattered, and his heart beat
so violently that he felt frightened at it. The
skirts of his long cloak seemed to cling to the
ground as though they had been fastened to it
by pegs. When he had actually got over the
hedge he seemed to hear a shrill voice crying
behind him “Whither? Whither?”

He jumped into the heather and began to run,
stumbling over old roots and treading on unfortunate
moles. When he had emerged from the
heather he saw that he still had a wide field to
cross, behind which was a thick, thorny underwood.
This, according to his calculation, must
stretch as far as the road leading to Kieff, and
if he reached it he would be safe. Accordingly
he ran over the field and plunged into the thorny
copse. Every sharp thorn he encountered tore
a fragment from his coat. Then he reached a
small open space; in the centre of it stood a
willow, whose branches hung down to the earth,
and close by flowed a clear spring bright as
silver. The first thing the philosopher did was
 
to lie down and drink eagerly, for he was intolerably
thirsty.

“This devil of a Javtuch!” he thought. “I
should like to seize him by the feet and smash
his hang-dog face against the trunk of a tree.”

“Why did you go round such a long way?”
continued Javtuch. “You had much better
have chosen the path by which I came; it leads
directly by the stable. Besides, it is a pity about
your coat. Such splendid cloth! How much
did it cost an ell? Well, we have had a long
enough walk; it is time to go home.”

“Now the accursed witch will attack me in
earnest,” he thought. “But what have I really
to fear? Am I not a Cossack? I have read the
prayers for two nights already; with God''s help
I will get through the third night also. It is plain
that the witch must have a terrible load of guilt
upon her, else the evil one would not help her
so much.”

Feeling somewhat encouraged by these reflections,
 
he returned to the court-yard and asked
Dorosch, who sometimes, by the steward''s permission,
had access to the wine-cellar, to fetch
him a small bottle of brandy. The two friends
sat down before a barn and drank a pretty
large one. Suddenly the philosopher jumped
up and said, “I want musicians! Bring some
musicians!”

But without waiting for them he began to
dance the “tropak” in the court-yard. He
danced till tea-time, and the servants, who, as is
usual in such cases, had formed a small circle
round him, grew at last tired of watching him,
and went away saying, “By heavens, the man
can dance!”

Finally the philosopher lay down in the place
where he had been dancing, and fell asleep.
It was necessary to pour a bucket of cold water
on his head to wake him up for supper. At the
meal he enlarged on the topic of what a Cossack
ought to be, and how he should not be afraid of
anything in the world.

“I wish I could put a lighted match to your
tongue,” thought the philosopher; then he stood
up and said, “Let us go.”

On their way to the church, the philosopher
kept looking round him on all sides, and tried to
start a conversation with his companions; but
both Javtuch and Dorosch remained silent. It
 
was a weird night. In the distance wolves
howled continually, and even the barking of the
dogs had something unearthly about it.

They reached the church and walked over
the old wooden planks, whose rotten condition
showed how little the lord of the manor cared
about God and his soul. Javtuch and Dorosch
left the philosopher alone, as on the previous
evenings.

There was still the same atmosphere of menacing
silence in the church, in the centre of which
stood the coffin with the terrible witch inside it.

“I am not afraid, by heavens, I am not
afraid!” he said; and after drawing a circle
round himself as before, he began to read the
prayers and exorcisms.

An oppressive silence prevailed; the flickering
candles filled the church with their clear light.
The philosopher turned one page after another,
and noticed that he was not reading what was in
the book. Full of alarm, he crossed himself and
began to sing a hymn. This calmed him somewhat,
and he resumed his reading, turning the
pages rapidly as he did so.

Suddenly in the midst of the sepulchral silence
the iron lid of the coffin sprang open with a
 
jarring noise, and the dead witch stood up. She
was this time still more terrible in aspect than at
first. Her teeth chattered loudly and her lips,
through which poured a stream of dreadful
curses, moved convulsively. A whirlwind arose
in the church; the icons of the saints fell on the
ground, together with the broken window-panes.
The door was wrenched from its hinges, and a
huge mass of monstrous creatures rushed into
the church, which became filled with the noise
of beating wings and scratching claws. All these
creatures flew and crept about, seeking for the
philosopher, from whose brain the last fumes of
intoxication had vanished. He crossed himself
ceaselessly and uttered prayer after prayer, hearing
all the time the whole unclean swarm rustling
about him, and brushing him with the tips of
their wings. He had not the courage to look at
them; he only saw one uncouth monster standing
by the wall, with long, shaggy hair and two
flaming eyes. Over him something hung in the
air which looked like a gigantic bladder covered
with countless crabs'' claws and scorpions'' stings,
and with black clods of earth hanging from it.
All these monsters stared about seeking him, but
they could not find him, since he was protected
by his sacred circle.

A sudden silence followed; the howling of
wolves was heard in the distance, and soon
heavy footsteps resounded through the church.
Thomas looked up furtively and saw that an
ungainly human figure with crooked legs was
being led into the church. He was quite covered
with black soil, and his hands and feet resembled
knotted roots. He trod heavily and stumbled
at every step. His eyelids were of enormous
length. With terror, Thomas saw that his face
was of iron. They led him in by the arms and
placed him near Thomas''s circle.

“Raise my eyelids! I can''t see anything!”
said the Viy in a dull, hollow voice, and they all
hastened to help in doing so.

“There he is!” exclaimed the Viy, pointing
an iron finger at him; and all the monsters rushed
on him at once.

At that moment there sounded a cock''s crow
for the second time; the earth-spirits had not
heard the first one. In alarm they hurried to the
windows and the door to get out as quickly as
possible. But it was too late; they all remained
hanging as though fastened to the door and the
windows.

When the priest came he stood amazed at such
a desecration of God''s house, and did not venture
to read prayers there. The church remained
standing as it was, with the monsters hanging on
the windows and the door. Gradually it became
overgrown with creepers, bushes, and wild
heather, and no one can discover it now.

When the report of this event reached Kieff,
and the theologian Khalava heard what a fate had
overtaken the philosopher Thomas, he sank for a
whole hour into deep reflection. He had greatly
altered of late; after finishing his studies he had
become bell-ringer of one of the chief churches
in the city, and he always appeared with a bruised
nose, because the belfry staircase was in a
ruinous condition.

“Have you heard what has happened to
Thomas?” said Tiberius Gorobetz, who had
become a philosopher and now wore a moustache.

“Yes; God had appointed it so,” answered
the bell-ringer. “Let us go to the ale-house;
we will drink a glass to his memory.”

The young philosopher, who, with the enthusiasm
of a novice, had made such full use of his
privileges as a student that his breeches and coat
and even his cap reeked of brandy and tobacco,
agreed readily to the proposal.

“He was a fine fellow, Thomas,” said the
bell-ringer as the limping innkeeper set the third
 
jug of beer before him. “A splendid fellow!
And lost his life for nothing!”

“I know why he perished,” said Gorobetz;
“because he was afraid. If he had not feared
her, the witch could have done nothing to him.
One ought to cross oneself incessantly and spit
exactly on her tail, and then not the least harm
can happen. I know all about it, for here, in
Kieff, all the old women in the market-place are
witches.”

The bell-ringer nodded assent. But being
aware that he could not say any more, he got up
cautiously and went out, swaying to the right and
left in order to find a hiding-place in the thick
steppe grass outside the town. At the same time,
in accordance with his old habits, he did not
forget to steal an old boot-sole which lay on the
ale-house bench.
