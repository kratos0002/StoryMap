UPDATE stories SET original_text = original_text || ' the gates of the yard—a crowd, for no known
      reason, always hovers for a day or two near the scene of a sudden death in
      London—two or three reporters percolated somehow into the
      engine-shed, and one even got to Azuma-zi; but the scientific expert
      cleared them out again, being himself an amateur journalist.

Presently the body was carried away, and public interest departed with it.
      Azuma-zi remained very quietly at his furnace, seeing over and over again
      in the coals a figure that wriggled violently and became still. An hour
      after the murder, to any one coming into the shed it would have looked
      exactly as if nothing remarkable had ever happened there. Peeping
      presently from his engine-room the black saw the Lord Dynamo spin and
      whirl beside his little brothers, and the driving wheels were beating
      round, and the steam in the pistons went thud, thud, exactly as it had
      been earlier in the evening. After all, from the mechanical point of view,
      it had been a most insignificant incident—the mere temporary
      deflection of a current. But now the slender form and slender shadow of
      the scientific manager replaced the sturdy outline of Holroyd travelling
      up and down the lane of light upon the vibrating floor under the straps
      between the engines and the dynamos.

"Have I not served my Lord?" said Azuma-zi inaudibly, from his shadow, and
      the note of the great dynamo rang out full and clear. As he looked at the
      big whirling mechanism the strange fascination of it that had been a
      little in abeyance since Holroyd''s death resumed its sway.

Never had Azuma-zi seen a man killed so swiftly and pitilessly. The big
      humming machine had slain its victim without wavering for a second from
      its steady beating. It was indeed a mighty god.

The unconscious scientific manager stood with his back to him, scribbling
      on a piece of paper. His shadow lay at the foot of the monster.

Azuma-zi made a stealthy step forward; then stopped. The scientific
      manager suddenly ceased his writing, walked down the shed to the endmost
      of the dynamos, and began to examine the brushes.

Azuma-zi hesitated, and then slipped across noiselessly into the shadow by
      the switch. There he waited. Presently the manager''s footsteps could be
      heard returning. He stopped in his old position, unconscious of the stoker
      crouching ten feet away from him. Then the big dynamo suddenly fizzled,
      and in another moment Azuma-zi had sprung out of the darkness upon him.

First, the scientific manager was gripped round the body and swung towards
      the big dynamo, then, kicking with his knee and forcing his antagonist''s
      head down with his hands, he loosened the grip on his waist and swung
      round away from the machine. Then the black grasped him again, putting a
      curly head against his chest, and they swayed and panted as it seemed for
      an age or so. Then the scientific manager was impelled to catch a black
      ear in his teeth and bite furiously. The black yelled hideously.

They rolled over on the floor, and the black, who had apparently slipped
      from the vice of the teeth or parted with some ear—the scientific
      manager wondered which at the time—tried to throttle him. The
      scientific manager was making some ineffectual efforts to claw something
      with his hands and to kick, when the welcome sound of quick footsteps
      sounded on the floor. The next moment Azuma-zi had left him and darted
      towards the big dynamo. There was a splutter amid the roar.

The officer of the company who had entered stood staring as Azuma-zi
      caught the naked terminals in his hands, gave one horrible convulsion, and
      then hung motionless from the machine, his face violently distorted.

"I''m jolly glad you came in when you did," said the scientific manager,
      still sitting on the floor.

He looked at the still quivering figure. "It is not a nice death to die,
      apparently—but it is quick."

The scientific manager got up on his feet rather awkwardly. He ran his
      fingers along his collar thoughtfully, and moved his head to and fro
      several times.

"Poor Holroyd! I see now." Then almost mechanically he went towards the
      switch in the shadow and turned the current into the railway circuit
      again. As he did so the singed body loosened its grip upon the machine and
      fell forward on its face. The core of the dynamo roared out loud and
      clear, and the armature beat the air.

So ended prematurely the worship of the Dynamo Deity, perhaps the most
      short-lived of all religions. Yet withal it could at least boast a
      Martyrdom and a Human Sacrifice.

Probably you have heard of Hapley—not W. T. Hapley, the son, but the
      celebrated Hapley, the Hapley of Periplaneta Hapliia, Hapley the
      entomologist.

If so you know at least of the great feud between Hapley and Professor
      Pawkins, though certain of its consequences may be new to you. For those
      who have not, a word or two of explanation is necessary, which the idle
      reader may go over with a glancing eye, if his indolence so incline him.

It is amazing how very widely diffused is the ignorance of such really
      important matters as this Hapley-Pawkins feud. Those epoch-making
      controversies, again, that have convulsed the Geological Society are, I
      verily believe, almost entirely unknown outside the fellowship of that
      body. I have heard men of fair general education even refer to the great
      scenes at these meetings as vestry-meeting squabbles. Yet the great hate
      of the English and Scotch geologists has lasted now half a century, and
      has "left deep and abundant marks upon the body of the science." And this
      Hapley-Pawkins business, though perhaps a more personal affair, stirred
      passions as profound, if not profounder. Your common man has no conception
      of the zeal that animates a scientific investigator, the fury of
      contradiction you can arouse in him. It is the odium theologicum in
      a new form. There are men, for instance, who would gladly burn Professor
      Ray Lankester at Smithfield for his treatment of the Mollusca in the
      Encyclopaedia. That fantastic extension of the Cephalopods to cover the
      Pteropods ... But I wander from Hapley and Pawkins.

It began years and years ago, with a revision of the Microlepidoptera
      (whatever these may be) by Pawkins, in which he extinguished a new species
      created by Hapley. Hapley, who was always quarrelsome, replied by a
      stinging impeachment of the entire classification of Pawkins.[A] Pawkins
      in his "Rejoinder"[B] suggested that Hapley''s microscope was as defective
      as his power of observation, and called him an "irresponsible meddler"—
      Hapley was not a professor at that time. Hapley in his retort,[C] spoke of
      "blundering collectors," and described, as if inadvertently, Pawkins''
      revision as a "miracle of ineptitude." It was war to the knife. However,
      it would scarcely interest the reader to detail how these two great men
      quarrelled, and how the split between them widened until from the
      Microlepidoptera they were at war upon every open question in entomology.
      There were memorable occasions. At times the Royal Entomological Society
      meetings resembled nothing so much as the Chamber of Deputies. On the
      whole, I fancy Pawkins was nearer the truth than Hapley. But Hapley was
      skilful with his rhetoric, had a turn for ridicule rare in a scientific
      man, was endowed with vast energy, and had a fine sense of injury in the
      matter of the extinguished species; while Pawkins was a man of dull
      presence, prosy of speech, in shape not unlike a water-barrel, over
      conscientious with testimonials, and suspected of jobbing museum
      appointments. So the young men gathered round Hapley and applauded him. It
      was a long struggle, vicious from the beginning and growing at last to
      pitiless antagonism. The successive turns of fortune, now an advantage to
      one side and now to another—now Hapley tormented by some success of
      Pawkins, and now Pawkins outshone by Hapley, belong rather to the history
      of entomology than to this story.

[A  "Remarks on a Recent
      Revision of Microlepidoptera." Quart. Journ. Entomological Soc.,
      1863.]

But in 1891 Pawkins, whose health had been bad for some time, published
      some work upon the "mesoblast" of the Death''s Head Moth. What the
      mesoblast of the Death''s Head Moth may be does not matter a rap in this
      story. But the work was far below his usual standard, and gave Hapley an
      opening he had coveted for years. He must have worked night and day to
      make the most of his advantage.

In an elaborate critique he rent Pawkins to tatters—one can fancy
      the man''s disordered black hair, and his queer dark eyes flashing as he
      went for his antagonist—and Pawkins made a reply, halting,
      ineffectual, with painful gaps of silence, and yet malignant. There was no
      mistaking his will to wound Hapley, nor his incapacity to do it. But few
      of those who heard him—I was absent from that meeting—realised
      how ill the man was.

Hapley got his opponent down, and meant to finish him. He followed with a
      simply brutal attack upon Pawkins, in the form of a paper upon the
      development of moths in general, a paper showing evidence of a most
      extraordinary amount of mental labour, and yet couched in a violently
      controversial tone. Violent as it was, an editorial note witnesses that it
      was modified. It must have covered Pawkins with shame and confusion of
      face. It left no loophole; it was murderous in argument, and utterly
      contemptuous in tone; an awful thing for the declining years of a man''s
      career.

The world of entomologists waited breathlessly for the rejoinder from
      Pawkins. He would try one, for Pawkins had always been game. But when it
      came it surprised them. For the rejoinder of Pawkins was to catch
      influenza, proceed to pneumonia, and die.

It was perhaps as effectual a reply as he could make under the
      circumstances, and largely turned the current of feeling against Hapley.
      The very people who had most gleefully cheered on those gladiators became
      serious at the consequence. There could be no reasonable doubt the fret of
      the defeat had contributed to the death of Pawkins. There was a limit even
      to scientific controversy, said serious people. Another crushing attack
      was already in the press and appeared on the day before the funeral. I
      don''t think Hapley exerted himself to stop it. People remembered how
      Hapley had hounded down his rival, and forgot that rival''s defects.
      Scathing satire reads ill over fresh mould. The thing provoked comment in
      the daily papers. This it was that made me think that you had probably
      heard of Hapley and this controversy. But, as I have already remarked,
      scientific workers live very much in a world of their own; half the
      people, I dare say, who go along Piccadilly to the Academy every year,
      could not tell you where the learned societies abide. Many even think that
      research is a kind of happy-family cage in which all kinds of men lie down
      together in peace.

In his private thoughts Hapley could not forgive Pawkins for dying. In the
      first place, it was a mean dodge to escape the absolute pulverisation
      Hapley had in hand for him, and in the second, it left Hapley''s mind with
      a queer gap in it. For twenty years he had worked hard, sometimes far into
      the night, and seven days a week, with microscope, scalpel,
      collecting-net, and pen, and almost entirely with reference to Pawkins.
      The European reputation he had won had come as an incident in that great
      antipathy. He had gradually worked up to a climax in this last
      controversy. It had killed Pawkins, but it had also thrown Hapley out of
      gear, so to speak, and his doctor advised him to give up work for a time,
      and rest. So Hapley went down into a quiet village in Kent, and thought
      day and night of Pawkins, and good things it was now impossible to say
      about him.

At last Hapley began to realise in what direction the pre-occupation
      tended. He determined to make a fight for it, and started by trying to
      read novels. But he could not get his mind off Pawkins, white in the face
      and making his last speech—every sentence a beautiful opening for
      Hapley. He turned to fiction—and found it had no grip on him. He
      read the "Island Nights'' Entertainments" until his "sense of causation"
      was shocked beyond endurance by the Bottle Imp. Then he went to Kipling,
      and found he "proved nothing," besides being irreverent and vulgar. These
      scientific people have their limitations. Then unhappily, he tried
      Besant''s "Inner House," and the opening chapter set his mind upon learned
      societies and Pawkins at once.

So Hapley turned to chess, and found it a little more soothing. He soon
      mastered the moves and the chief gambits and commoner closing positions,
      and began to beat the Vicar. But then the cylindrical contours of the
      opposite king began to resemble Pawkins standing up and gasping
      ineffectually against check-mate, and Hapley decided to give up chess.

Perhaps the study of some new branch of science would after all be better
      diversion. The best rest is change of occupation. Hapley determined to
      plunge at diatoms, and had one of his smaller microscopes and Halibut''s
      monograph sent down from London. He thought that perhaps if he could get
      up a vigorous quarrel with Halibut, he might be able to begin life afresh
      and forget Pawkins. And very soon he was hard at work in his habitual
      strenuous fashion, at these microscopic denizens of the way-side pool.

It was on the third day of the diatoms that Hapley became aware of a novel
      addition to the local fauna. He was working late at the microscope, and
      the only light in the room was the brilliant little lamp with the special
      form of green shade. Like all experienced microscopists, he kept both eyes
      open. It is the only way to avoid excessive fatigue. One eye was over the
      instrument, and bright and distinct before that was the circular field of
      the microscope, across which a brown diatom was slowly moving. With the
      other eye Hapley saw, as it were, without seeing. He was only dimly
      conscious of the brass side of the instrument, the illuminated part of the
      table-cloth, a sheet of notepaper, the foot of the lamp, and the darkened
      room beyond.

Suddenly his attention drifted from one eye to the other. The table-cloth
      was of the material called tapestry by shopmen, and rather brightly
      coloured. The pattern was in gold, with a small amount of crimson and pale
      blue upon a greyish ground. At one point the pattern seemed displaced, and
      there was a vibrating movement of the colours at this point.

Hapley suddenly moved his head back and looked with both eyes. His mouth
      fell open with astonishment.

It was strange it should be in the room at all, for the windows were
      closed. Strange that it should not have attracted his attention when
      fluttering to its present position. Strange that it should match the
      table-cloth. Stranger far that to him, Hapley, the great entomologist, it
      was altogether unknown. There was no delusion. It was crawling slowly
      towards the foot of the lamp.

Then he suddenly thought of Pawkins. Nothing would have maddened Pawkins
      more...And Pawkins was dead!

Something about the head and body of the insect became singularly
      suggestive of Pawkins, just as the chess king had been.

"Confound Pawkins!" said Hapley. "But I must catch this." And looking
      round him for some means of capturing the moth, he rose slowly out of his
      chair. Suddenly the insect rose, struck the edge of the lampshade—Hapley
      heard the "ping"—and vanished into the shadow.

In a moment Hapley had whipped off the shade, so that the whole room was
      illuminated. The thing had disappeared, but soon his practised eye
      detected it upon the wall-paper near the door. He went towards it poising
      the lamp-shade for capture. Before he was within striking distance,
      however, it had risen and was fluttering round the room. After the fashion
      of its kind, it flew with sudden starts and turns, seeming to vanish here
      and reappear there. Once Hapley struck, and missed; then again.

The third time he hit his microscope. The instrument swayed, struck and
      overturned the lamp, and fell noisily upon the floor. The lamp turned over
      on the table and, very luckily, went out. Hapley was left in the dark.
      With a start he felt the strange moth blunder into his face.

It was maddening. He had no lights. If he opened the door of the room the
      thing would get away. In the darkness he saw Pawkins quite distinctly
      laughing at him. Pawkins had ever an oily laugh. He swore furiously and
      stamped his foot on the floor.

Then it opened, perhaps a foot, and very slowly. The alarmed face of the
      landlady appeared behind a pink candle flame; she wore a night-cap over
      her grey hair and had some purple garment over her shoulders. "What was
      that fearful smash?" she said. "Has anything——" The strange
      moth appeared fluttering about the chink of the door. "Shut that door!"
      said Hapley, and suddenly rushed at her.

The door slammed hastily. Hapley was left alone in the dark. Then in the
      pause he heard his landlady scuttle upstairs, lock her door, and drag
      something heavy across the room and put against it.

It became evident to Hapley that his conduct and appearance had been
      strange and alarming. Confound the moth! and Pawkins! However, it was a
      pity to lose the moth now. He felt his way into the hall and found the
      matches, after sending his hat down upon the floor with a noise like a
      drum. With the lighted candle he returned to the sitting-room. No moth was
      to be seen. Yet once for a moment it seemed that the thing was fluttering
      round his head. Hapley very suddenly decided to give up the moth and go to
      bed. But he was excited. All night long his sleep was broken by dreams of
      the moth, Pawkins, and his landlady. Twice in the night he turned out and
      soused his head in cold water.

One thing was very clear to him. His landlady could not possibly
      understand about the strange moth, especially as he had failed to catch
      it. No one but an entomologist would understand quite how he felt. She was
      probably frightened at his behaviour, and yet he failed to see how he
      could explain it. He decided to say nothing further about the events of
      last night. After breakfast he saw her in her garden, and decided to go
      out and talk to reassure her. He talked to her about beans and potatoes,
      bees, caterpillars, and the price of fruit. She replied in her usual
      manner, but she looked at him a little suspiciously, and kept walking as
      he walked, so that there was always a bed of flowers, or a row of beans,
      or something of the sort, between them. After a while he began to feel
      singularly irritated at this, and to conceal his vexation went indoors and
      presently went out for a walk.

The moth, or butterfly, trailing an odd flavour of Pawkins with it, kept
      coming into that walk, though he did his best to keep his mind off it.
      Once he saw it quite distinctly, with its wings flattened out, upon the
      old stone wall that runs along the west edge of the park, but going up to
      it he found it was only two lumps of grey and yellow lichen. "This," said
      Hapley, "is the reverse of mimicry. Instead of a butterfly looking like a
      stone, here is a stone looking like a butterfly!" Once something hovered
      and fluttered round his head, but by an effort of will he drove that
      impression out of his mind again.

In the afternoon Hapley called upon the Vicar, and argued with him upon
      theological questions. They sat in the little arbour covered with briar,
      and smoked as they wrangled. "Look at that moth!" said Hapley, suddenly,
      pointing to the edge of the wooden table.

Hapley was thunderstruck. He gasped. The Vicar was staring at him. Clearly
      the man saw nothing. "The eye of faith is no better than the eye of
      science," said Hapley awkwardly.

That night Hapley found the moth crawling over his counterpane. He sat on
      the edge of the bed in his shirt sleeves and reasoned with himself. Was it
      pure hallucination? He knew he was slipping, and he battled for his sanity
      with the same silent energy he had formerly displayed against Pawkins. So
      persistent is mental habit, that he felt as if it were still a struggle
      with Pawkins. He was well versed in psychology. He knew that such visual
      illusions do come as a result of mental strain. But the point was, he did
      not only see the moth, he had heard it when it touched the edge of
      the lampshade, and afterwards when it hit against the wall, and he had
      felt it strike his face in the dark.

He looked at it. It was not at all dreamlike, but perfectly clear and
      solid-looking in the candle-light. He saw the hairy body, and the short
      feathery antennae, the jointed legs, even a place where the down was
      rubbed from the wing. He suddenly felt angry with himself for being afraid
      of a little insect.

His landlady had got the servant to sleep with her that night, because she
      was afraid to be alone. In addition she had locked the door, and put the
      chest of drawers against it. They listened and talked in whispers after
      they had gone to bed, but nothing occurred to alarm them. About eleven
      they had ventured to put the candle out, and had both dozed off to sleep.
      They woke up with a start, and sat up in bed, listening in the darkness.

Then they heard slippered feet going to and fro in Hapley''s room. A chair
      was overturned, and there was a violent dab at the wall. Then a china
      mantel ornament smashed upon the fender. Suddenly the door of the room
      opened, and they heard him upon the landing. They clung to one another,
      listening. He seemed to be dancing upon the staircase. Now he would go
      down three or four steps quickly, then up again, then hurry down into the
      hall. They heard the umbrella stand go over, and the fanlight break. Then
      the bolt shot and the chain rattled. He was opening the door.

They hurried to the window. It was a dim grey night; an almost unbroken
      sheet of watery cloud was sweeping across the moon, and the hedge and
      trees in front of the house were black against the pale roadway. They saw
      Hapley, looking like a ghost in his shirt and white trousers, running to
      and fro in the road, and beating the air. Now he would stop, now he would
      dart very rapidly at something invisible, now he would move upon it with
      stealthy strides. At last he went out of sight up the road towards the
      down. Then, while they argued who should go down and lock the door, he
      returned. He was walking very fast, and he came straight into the house,
      closed the door carefully, and went quietly up to his bedroom. Then
      everything was silent.

"Mrs. Colville," said Hapley, calling down the staircase next morning, "I
      hope I did not alarm you last night."

"The fact is, I am a sleep-walker, and the last two nights I have been
      without my sleeping mixture. There is nothing to be alarmed about, really.
      I am sorry I made such an ass of myself. I will go over the down to
      Shoreham, and get some stuff to make me sleep soundly. I ought to have
      done that yesterday."

But half-way over the down, by the chalk pits, the moth came upon Hapley
      again. He went on, trying to keep his mind upon chess problems, but it was
      no good. The thing fluttered into his face, and he struck at it with his
      hat in self-defence. Then rage, the old rage—the rage he had so
      often felt against Pawkins—came upon him again. He went on, leaping
      and striking at the eddying insect. Suddenly he trod on nothing, and fell
      headlong.

There was a gap in his sensations, and Hapley found himself sitting on the
      heap of flints in front of the opening of the chalk-pits, with a leg
      twisted back under him. The strange moth was still fluttering round his
      head. He struck at it with his hand, and turning his head saw two men
      approaching him. One was the village doctor. It occurred to Hapley that
      this was lucky. Then it came into his mind with extraordinary vividness,
      that no one would ever be able to see the strange moth except himself, and
      that it behoved him to keep silent about it.

Late that night, however, after his broken leg was set, he was feverish
      and forgot his self-restraint. He was lying flat on his bed, and he began
      to run his eyes round the room to see if the moth was still about. He
      tried not to do this, but it was no good. He soon caught sight of the
      thing resting close to his hand, by the night-light, on the green
      table-cloth. The wings quivered. With a sudden wave of anger he smote at
      it with his fist, and the nurse woke up with a shriek. He had missed it.

All the time he could see quite clearly the insect going round the cornice
      and darting across the room, and he could also see that the nurse saw
      nothing of it and looked at him strangely. He must keep himself in hand.
      He knew he was a lost man if he did not keep himself in hand. But as the
      night waned the fever grew upon him, and the very dread he had of seeing
      the moth made him see it. About five, just as the dawn was grey, he tried
      to get out of bed and catch it, though his leg was afire with pain. The
      nurse had to struggle with him.

On account of this, they tied him down to the bed. At this the moth grew
      bolder, and once he felt it settle in his hair. Then, because he struck
      out violently with his arms, they tied these also. At this the moth came
      and crawled over his face, and Hapley wept, swore, screamed, prayed for
      them to take it off him, unavailingly.

The doctor was a blockhead, a just-qualified general practitioner, and
      quite ignorant of mental science. He simply said there was no moth. Had he
      possessed the wit, he might still, perhaps, have saved Hapley from his
      fate by entering into his delusion, and covering his face with gauze, as
      he prayed might be done. But, as I say, the doctor was a blockhead, and
      until the leg was healed Hapley was kept tied to his bed, and with the
      imaginary moth crawling over him. It never left him while he was awake and
      it grew to a monster in his dreams. While he was awake he longed for
      sleep, and from sleep he awoke screaming.

So now Hapley is spending the remainder of his days in a padded room,
      worried by a moth that no one else can see. The asylum doctor calls it
      hallucination; but Hapley, when he is in his easier mood, and can talk,
      says it is the ghost of Pawkins, and consequently a unique specimen and
      well worth the trouble of catching.

The canoe was now approaching the land. The bay opened out, and a gap in
      the white surf of the reef marked where the little river ran out to the
      sea; the thicker and deeper green of the virgin forest showed its course
      down the distant hill slope. The forest here came close to the beach. Far
      beyond, dim and almost cloudlike in texture, rose the mountains, like
      suddenly frozen waves. The sea was still save for an almost imperceptible
      swell. The sky blazed.

The man with the carved paddle stopped. "It should be somewhere here," he
      said. He shipped the paddle and held his arms out straight before him.

The other man had been in the fore part of the canoe, closely scrutinising
      the land. He had a sheet of yellow paper on his knee.

The man called Evans came swaying along the canoe until he could look over
      his companion''s shoulder.

The paper had the appearance of a rough map. By much folding it was
      creased and worn to the pitch of separation, and the second man held the
      discoloured fragments together where they had parted. On it one could
      dimly make out, in almost obliterated pencil, the outline of the bay.

"This curved and twisting line is the river—I could do with a drink
      now!—and this star is the place."

"You see this dotted line," said the man with the map; "it is a straight
      line, and runs from the opening of the reef to a clump of palm-trees. The
      star comes just where it cuts the river. We must mark the place as we go
      into the lagoon."

"It''s queer," said Evans, after a pause, "what these little marks down
      here are for. It looks like the plan of a house or something; but what all
      these little dashes, pointing this way and that, may mean I can''t get a
      notion. And what''s the writing?"

They both sat for some minutes staring at the land, while the canoe
      drifted slowly. Then Evans looked towards the paddle.

And his companion quietly folded up his map, put it in his pocket, passed
      Evans carefully, and began to paddle. His movements were languid, like
      those of a man whose strength was nearly exhausted.

Evans sat with his eyes half closed, watching the frothy breakwater of the
      coral creep nearer and nearer. The sky was like a furnace, for the sun was
      near the zenith. Though they were so near the Treasure he did not feel the
      exaltation he had anticipated. The intense excitement of the struggle for
      the plan, and the long night voyage from the mainland in the unprovisioned
      canoe had, to use his own expression, "taken it out of him." He tried to
      arouse himself by directing his mind to the ingots the Chinamen had spoken
      of, but it would not rest there; it came back headlong to the thought of
      sweet water rippling in the river, and to the almost unendurable dryness
      of his lips and throat. The rhythmic wash of the sea upon the reef was
      becoming audible now, and it had a pleasant sound in his ears; the water
      washed along the side of the canoe, and the paddle dripped between each
      stroke. Presently he began to doze.

He was still dimly conscious of the island, but a queer dream texture
      interwove with his sensations. Once again it was the night when he and
      Hooker had hit upon the Chinamen''s secret; he saw the moonlit trees, the
      little fire burning, and the black figures of the three Chinamen—silvered
      on one side by moonlight, and on the other glowing from the firelight—and
      heard them talking together in pigeon-English—for they came from
      different provinces. Hooker had caught the drift of their talk first, and
      had motioned to him to listen. Fragments of the conversation were
      inaudible, and fragments incomprehensible. A Spanish galleon from the
      Philippines hopelessly aground, and its treasure buried against the day of
      return, lay in the background of the story; a shipwrecked crew thinned by
      disease, a quarrel or so, and the needs of discipline, and at last taking
      to their boats never to be heard of again. Then Chang-hi, only a year
      since, wandering ashore, had happened upon the ingots hidden for two
      hundred years, had deserted his junk, and reburied them with infinite
      toil, single-handed but very safe. He laid great stress on the safety—it
      was a secret of his. Now he wanted help to return and exhume them.
      Presently the little map fluttered and the voices sank. A fine story for
      two, stranded British wastrels to hear! Evans'' dream shifted to the moment
      when he had Chang-hi''s pigtail in his hand. The life of a Chinaman is
      scarcely sacred like a European''s. The cunning little face of Chang-hi,
      first keen and furious like a startled snake, and then fearful,
      treacherous, and pitiful, became overwhelmingly prominent in the dream. At
      the end Chang-hi had grinned, a most incomprehensible and startling grin.
      Abruptly things became very unpleasant, as they will do at times in
      dreams. Chang-hi gibbered and threatened him. He saw in his dream heaps
      and heaps of gold, and Chang-hi intervening and struggling to hold him
      back from it. He took Chang-hi by the pig-tail—how big the yellow
      brute was, and how he struggled and grinned! He kept growing bigger, too.
      Then the bright heaps of gold turned to a roaring furnace, and a vast
      devil, surprisingly like Chang-hi, but with a huge black tail, began to
      feed him with coals. They burnt his mouth horribly. Another devil was
      shouting his name: "Evans, Evans, you sleepy fool!"—or was it
      Hooker?

"There are the three palm-trees. It must be in a line with that clump of
      bushes," said his companion. "Mark that. If we, go to those bushes and
      then strike into the bush in a straight line from here, we shall come to
      it when we come to the stream."

They could see now where the mouth of the stream opened out. At the sight
      of it Evans revived. "Hurry up, man," he said, "or by heaven I shall have
      to drink sea water!" He gnawed his hand and stared at the gleam of silver
      among the rocks and green tangle.

So they reached the river mouth. A little way up Hooker took some water in
      the hollow of his hand, tasted it, and spat it out. A little further he
      tried again. "This will do," he said, and they began drinking eagerly.

"Curse this!" said Evans suddenly. "It''s too slow." And, leaning
      dangerously over the fore part of the canoe, he began to suck up the water
      with his lips.

Presently they made an end of drinking, and, running the canoe into a
      little creek, were about to land among the thick growth that overhung the
      water.

"We shall have to scramble through this to the beach to find our bushes
      and get the line to the place," said Evans.

So they pushed out again into the river and paddled back down it to the
      sea, and along the shore to the place where the clump of bushes grew. Here
      they landed, pulled the light canoe far up the beach, and then went up
      towards the edge of the jungle until they could see the opening of the
      reef and the bushes in a straight line. Evans had taken a native implement
      out of the canoe. It was L-shaped, and the transverse piece was armed with
      polished stone. Hooker carried the paddle. "It is straight now in this
      direction," said he; "we must push through this till we strike the stream.
      Then we must prospect."

They pushed through a close tangle of reeds, broad fronds, and young
      trees, and at first it was toilsome going, but very speedily the trees
      became larger and the ground beneath them opened out. The blaze of the
      sunlight was replaced by insensible degrees by cool shadow. The trees
      became at last vast pillars that rose up to a canopy of greenery far
      overhead. Dim white flowers hung from their stems, and ropy creepers swung
      from tree to tree. The shadow deepened. On the ground, blotched fungi and
      a red-brown incrustation became frequent.

Presently they saw, far ahead, a gap in the sombre darkness where white
      shafts of hot sunlight smote into the forest. There also was brilliant
      green undergrowth and coloured flowers. Then they heard the rush of water.

The vegetation was thick by the river bank. Great plants, as yet unnamed,
      grew among the roots of the big trees, and spread rosettes of huge green
      fans towards the strip of sky. Many flowers and a creeper with shiny
      foliage clung to the exposed stems. On the water of the broad, quiet pool
      which the treasure-seekers now overlooked there floated big oval leaves
      and a waxen, pinkish-white flower not unlike a water-lily. Further, as the
      river bent away from them, the water suddenly frothed and became noisy in
      a rapid.

He turned and looked into the dim cool shadows of the silent forest behind
      them. "If we beat a little way up and down the stream we should come to
      something."

They advanced slowly, looking curiously about them. Suddenly Evans
      stopped. "What the devil''s that?" he said.

Hooker followed his finger. "Something blue," he said. It had come into
      view as they topped a gentle swell of the ground. Then he began to
      distinguish what it was.

He advanced suddenly with hasty steps, until the body that belonged to the
      limp hand and arm had become visible. His grip tightened on the implement
      he carried. The thing was the figure of a Chinaman lying on his face. The
      abandon of the pose was unmistakable.

The two men drew closer together, and stood staring silently at this
      ominous dead body. It lay in a clear space among the trees. Near by was a
      spade after the Chinese pattern, and further off lay a scattered heap of
      stones, close to a freshly dug hole.

Hooker turned white but said nothing. He advanced towards the prostrate
      body. He saw the neck was puffed and purple, and the hands and ankles
      swollen. "Pah!" he said, and suddenly turned away and went towards the
      excavation. He gave a cry of surprise. He shouted to Evans, who was
      following him slowly.

"You fool! It''s all right. It''s here still." Then he turned again and
      looked at the dead Chinaman, and then again at the hole.

Evans hurried to the hole. Already half exposed by the ill-fated wretch
      beside them lay a number of dull yellow bars. He bent down in the hole,
      and, clearing off the soil with his bare hands, hastily pulled one of the
      heavy masses out. As he did so a little thorn pricked his hand. He pulled
      the delicate spike out with his fingers and lifted the ingot.

"He stole a march on his friends," he said at last. "He came here alone,
      and some poisonous snake has killed him... I wonder how he found the
      place."

Evans stood with the ingot in his hands. What did a dead Chinaman signify?
      "We shall have to take this stuff to the mainland piecemeal, and bury it
      there for a while. How shall we get it to the canoe?"

He took his jacket off and spread it on the ground, and flung two or three
      ingots into it. Presently he found that another little thorn had punctured
      his skin.

"This is as much as we can carry," said he. Then suddenly, with a queer
      rush of irritation, "What are you staring at?"

Hooker looked into his face. "I''m going to bury that, anyhow,
      before I lend a hand with this stuff."

Hooker hesitated, and then his eye went carefully over the brown soil
      about them. "It scares me somehow," he said.

"The thing is," said Evans, "what to do with these ingots. Shall we
      re-bury them over here, or take them across the strait in the canoe?"

Hooker thought. His puzzled gaze wandered among the tall tree-trunks, and
      up into the remote sunlit greenery overhead. He shivered again as his eye
      rested upon the blue figure of the Chinaman. He stared searchingly among
      the grey depths between the trees.

He took the ends of the collar of the coat in his hands, and Evans took
      the opposite corners, and they lifted the mass. "Which way?" said Evans.
      "To the canoe?"

"It''s queer," said Evans, when they had advanced only a few steps, "but my
      arms ache still with that paddling."

They let the coat down, Evans'' face was white, and little drops of sweat
      stood out upon his forehead. "It''s stuffy, somehow, in this forest."

Then with an abrupt transition to unreasonable anger: "What is the good of
      waiting here all the day? Lend a hand, I say! You have done nothing but
      moon since we saw the dead Chinaman."

Hooker was looking steadfastly at his companion''s face. He helped raise
      the coat bearing the ingots, and they went forward perhaps a hundred yards
      in silence. Evans began to breathe heavily. "Can''t you speak?" he said.

Evans stumbled, and then with a sudden curse flung the coat from him. He
      stood for a moment staring at Hooker, and then with a groan clutched at
      his own throat.

"Don''t come near me," he said, and went and leant against a tree. Then in
      a steadier voice, "I''ll be better in a minute."

Presently his grip upon the trunk loosened, and he slipped slowly down the
      stem of the tree until he was a crumpled heap at its foot. His hands were
      clenched convulsively. His face became distorted with pain. Hooker
      approached him.

"Don''t touch me! Don''t touch me!" said Evans in a stifled voice. "Put the
      gold back on the coat."

As Hooker handled the ingots he felt a little prick on the ball of his
      thumb. He looked at his hand and saw a slender thorn, perhaps two inches
      in length.

Hooker''s jaw dropped. He stared at the thorn for a moment with dilated
      eyes. Then he looked at Evans, who was now crumpled together on the
      ground, his back bending and straightening spasmodically. Then he looked
      through the pillars of the trees and net-work of creeper stems, to where
      in the dim grey shadow the blue-clad body of the Chinaman was still
      indistinctly visible. He thought of the little dashes in the corner of the
      plan, and in a moment he understood.

"God help me!" he said. For the thorns were similar to those the Dyaks
      poison and use in their blowing-tubes. He understood now what Chang-hi''s
      assurance of the safety of his treasure meant. He understood that grin
      now.

But Evans was silent and motionless, save for a horrible spasmodic
      twitching of his limbs. A profound silence brooded over the forest.

Then Hooker began to suck furiously at the little pink spot on the ball of
      his thumb—sucking for dear life. Presently he felt a strange aching
      pain in his arms and shoulders, and his fingers seemed difficult to bend.
      Then he knew that sucking was no good.

Abruptly he stopped, and sitting down by the pile of ingots, and resting
      his chin upon his hands and his elbows upon his knees, stared at the
      distorted but still quivering body of his companion. Chang-hi''s grin came
      into his mind again. The dull pain spread towards his throat and grew
      slowly in intensity. Far above him a faint breeze stirred the greenery,
      and the white petals of some unknown flower came floating down through the
      gloom.

I set this story down, not expecting it will be believed, but, if
      possible, to prepare a way of escape for the next victim. He, perhaps, may
      profit by my misfortune. My own case, I know, is hopeless, and I am now in
      some measure prepared to meet my fate.

My name is Edward George Eden. I was born at Trentham, in Staffordshire,
      my father being employed in the gardens there. I lost my mother when I was
      three years old, and my father when I was five, my uncle, George Eden,
      then adopting me as his own son. He was a single man, self-educated, and
      well-known in Birmingham as an enterprising journalist; he educated me
      generously, fired my ambition to succeed in the world, and at his death,
      which happened four years ago, left me his entire fortune, a matter of
      about five hundred pounds after all outgoing charges were paid. I was then
      eighteen. He advised me in his will to expend the money in completing my
      education. I had already chosen the profession of medicine, and through
      his posthumous generosity and my good fortune in a scholarship
      competition, I became a medical student at University College, London. At
      the time of the beginning of my story I lodged at 11A University Street in
      a little upper room, very shabbily furnished and draughty, overlooking the
      back of Shoolbred''s premises. I used this little room both to live in and
      sleep in, because I was anxious to eke out my means to the very last
      shillings-worth.

I was taking a pair of shoes to be mended at a shop in the Tottenham Court
      Road when I first encountered the little old man with the yellow face,
      with whom my life has now become so inextricably entangled. He was
      standing on the kerb, and staring at the number on the door in a doubtful
      way, as I opened it. His eyes—they were dull grey eyes, and reddish
      under the rims—fell to my face, and his countenance immediately
      assumed an expression of corrugated amiability.

"You come," he said, "apt to the moment. I had forgotten the number of
      your house. How do you do, Mr. Eden?"

I was a little astonished at his familiar address, for I had never set
      eyes on the man before. I was a little annoyed, too, at his catching me
      with my boots under my arm. He noticed my lack of cordiality.

"Wonder who the deuce I am, eh? A friend, let me assure you. I have seen
      you before, though you haven''t seen me. Is there anywhere where I can talk
      to you?"

I hesitated. The shabbiness of my room upstairs was not a matter for every
      stranger. "Perhaps," said I, "we might walk down the street. I''m
      unfortunately prevented—" My gesture explained the sentence before I
      had spoken it.

"The very thing," he said, and faced this way, and then that. "The street?
      Which way shall we go?" I slipped my boots down in the passage. "Look
      here!" he said abruptly; "this business of mine is a rigmarole. Come and
      lunch with me, Mr. Eden. I''m an old man, a very old man, and not good at
      explanations, and what with my piping voice and the clatter of the traffic——"

I was not so old that an old man might not treat me to a lunch. Yet at the
      same time I was not altogether pleased by this abrupt invitation. "I had
      rather——" I began. "But I had rather," he said, catching me
      up, "and a certain civility is surely due to my grey hairs."

He took me to Blavitiski''s; I had to walk slowly to accommodate myself to
      his paces; and over such a lunch as I had never tasted before, he fended
      off my leading question, and I took a better note of his appearance. His
      clean-shaven face was lean and wrinkled, his shrivelled, lips fell over a
      set of false teeth, and his white hair was thin and rather long; he seemed
      small to me,—though indeed, most people seemed small to me,—and
      his shoulders were rounded and bent. And watching him, I could not help
      but observe that he too was taking note of me, running his eyes, with a
      curious touch of greed in them, over me, from my broad shoulders to my
      suntanned hands, and up to my freckled face again. "And now," said he, as
      we lit our cigarettes, "I must tell you of the business in hand.

"I must tell you, then, that I am an old man, a very old man." He paused
      momentarily. "And it happens that I have money that I must presently be
      leaving, and never a child have I to leave it to." I thought of the
      confidence trick, and resolved I would be on the alert for the vestiges of
      my five hundred pounds. He proceeded to enlarge on his loneliness, and the
      trouble he had to find a proper disposition of his money. "I have weighed
      this plan and that plan, charities, institutions, and scholarships, and
      libraries, and I have come to this conclusion at last,"—he fixed his
      eyes on my face,—"that I will find some young fellow, ambitious,
      pure-minded, and poor, healthy in body and healthy in mind, and, in short,
      make him my heir, give him all that I have." He repeated, "Give him all
      that I have. So that he will suddenly be lifted out of all the trouble and
      struggle in which his sympathies have been educated, to freedom and
      influence."

I tried to seem disinterested. With a transparent hypocrisy I said, "And
      you want my help, my professional services maybe, to find that person."

He smiled, and looked at me over his cigarette, and I laughed at his quiet
      exposure of my modest pretence.

"What a career such a man might have!" he said. "It fills me with envy to
      think how I have accumulated that another man may spend——

"But there are conditions, of course, burdens to be imposed. He must, for
      instance, take my name. You cannot expect everything without some return.
      And I must go into all the circumstances of his life before I can accept
      him. He must be sound. I must know his heredity, how his parents
      and grandparents died, have the strictest inquiries made into his private
      morals."

I answered never a word. My imagination was dancing wildly, my innate
      scepticism was useless to modify its transports. There was not a particle
      of gratitude in my mind—I did not know what to say nor how to say
      it. "But why me in particular?" I said at last.

He had chanced to hear of me from Professor Haslar; he said, as a
      typically sound and sane young man, and he wished, as far as possible, to
      leave his money where health and integrity were assured.

That was my first meeting with the little old man. He was mysterious about
      himself; he would not give his name yet, he said, and after I had answered
      some questions of his, he left me at the Blavitiski portal. I noticed that
      he drew a handful of gold coins from his pocket when it came to paying for
      the lunch. His insistence upon bodily health was curious. In accordance
      with an arrangement we had made I applied that day for a life policy in
      the Loyal Insurance Company for a large sum, and I was exhaustively
      overhauled by the medical advisers of that company in the subsequent week.
      Even that did not satisfy him, and he insisted I must be re-examined by
      the great Doctor Henderson.

It was Friday in Whitsun week before he came to a decision. He called me
      down, quite late in the evening,—nearly nine it was,—from
      cramming chemical equations for my Preliminary Scientific examination. He
      was standing in the passage under the feeble gas-lamp, and his face was a
      grotesque interplay of shadows. He seemed more bowed than when I had first
      seen him, and his cheeks had sunk in a little.

His voice shook with emotion. "Everything is satisfactory, Mr. Eden," he
      said. "Everything is quite, quite satisfactory. And this night of all
      nights, you must dine with me and celebrate your—accession." He was
      interrupted by a cough. "You won''t have long to wait, either," he said,
      wiping his handkerchief across his lips, and gripping my hand with his
      long bony claw that was disengaged. "Certainly not very long to wait."

We went into the street and called a cab. I remember every incident of
      that drive vividly, the swift, easy motion, the vivid contrast of gas and
      oil and electric light, the crowds of people in the streets, the place in
      Regent Street to which we went, and the sumptuous dinner we were served
      with there. I was disconcerted at first by the well-dressed waiter''s
      glances at my rough clothes, bothered by the stones of the olives, but as
      the champagne warmed my blood, my confidence revived. At first the old man
      talked of himself. He had already told me his name in the cab; he was
      Egbert Elvesham, the great philosopher, whose name I had known since I was
      a lad at school. It seemed incredible to me that this man, whose
      intelligence had so early dominated mine, this great abstraction, should
      suddenly realise itself as this decrepit, familiar figure. I daresay every
      young fellow who has suddenly fallen among celebrities has felt something
      of my disappointment. He told me now of the future that the feeble streams
      of his life would presently leave dry for me, houses, copyrights,
      investments; I had never suspected that philosophers were so rich. He
      watched me drink and eat with a touch of envy. "What a capacity for living
      you have!" he said; and then with a sigh, a sigh of relief I could have
      thought it, "it will not be long."

"Ay," said I, my head swimming now with champagne; "I have a future
      perhaps—of a passing agreeable sort, thanks to you. I shall now have
      the honour of your name. But you have a past. Such a past as is worth all
      my future."

He shook his head and smiled, as I thought, with half sad appreciation of
      my flattering admiration. "That future," he said, "would you in truth
      change it?" The waiter came with liqueurs. "You will not perhaps mind
      taking my name, taking my position, but would you indeed—willingly—take
      my years?"

He smiled again. "Kummel—both," he said to the waiter, and turned
      his attention to a little paper packet he had taken from his pocket. "This
      hour," said he, "this after-dinner hour is the hour of small things. Here
      is a scrap of my unpublished wisdom." He opened the packet with his
      shaking yellow fingers, and showed a little pinkish powder on the paper.
      "This," said he—"well, you must guess what it is. But Kummel—put
      but a dash of this powder in it—is Himmel."

It was a bit of a shock to me to find this great teacher gave his mind to
      the flavour of liqueurs. However, I feigned an interest in his weakness,
      for I was drunk enough for such small sycophancy.

He parted the powder between the little glasses, and, rising suddenly,
      with a strange unexpected dignity, held out his hand towards me. I
      imitated his action, and the glasses rang. "To a quick succession," said
      he, and raised his glass towards his lips.

"To a long life," said I. — He hesitated. "To a long life," said he,
      with a sudden bark of laughter, and with eyes fixed on one another we
      tilted the little glasses. His eyes looked straight into mine, and as I
      drained the stuff off, I felt a curiously intense sensation. The first
      touch of it set my brain in a furious tumult; I seemed to feel an actual
      physical stirring in my skull, and a seething humming filled my ears. I
      did not notice the flavour in my mouth, the aroma that filled my throat; I
      saw only the grey intensity of his gaze that burnt into mine. The draught,
      the mental confusion, the noise and stirring in my head, seemed to last an
      interminable time. Curious vague impressions of half-forgotten things
      danced and vanished on the edge of my consciousness. At last he broke the
      spell. With a sudden explosive sigh he put down his glass.

My head was spinning. I sat down. My brain was chaos. Then my perception
      grew clear and minute as though I saw things in a concave mirror. His
      manner seemed to have changed into something nervous and hasty. He pulled
      out his watch and grimaced at it. "Eleven-seven! And to-night I must—
      Seven-twenty-five. Waterloo! I must go at once." He called for the bill,
      and struggled with his coat. Officious waiters came to our assistance. In
      another moment I was wishing him good-bye, over the apron of a cab, and
      still with an absurd feeling of minute distinctness, as though—how
      can I express it?—I not only saw but felt through an inverted
      opera-glass.

"That stuff," he said. He put his hand to his forehead. "I ought not to
      have given it to you. It will make your head split to-morrow. Wait a
      minute. Here." He handed me out a little flat thing like a
      seidlitz-powder. "Take that in water as you are going to bed. The other
      thing was a drug. Not till you''re ready to go to bed, mind. It will clear
      your head. That''s all. One more shake—Futurus!"

I gripped his shrivelled claw. "Good-bye," he said, and by the droop of
      his eyelids I judged he too was a little under the influence of that
      brain-twisting cordial.

He recollected something else with a start, felt in his breast-pocket, and
      produced another packet, this time a cylinder the size and shape of a
      shaving-stick. "Here," said he. "I''d almost forgotten. Don''t open this
      until I come to-morrow—but take it now."

It was so heavy that I wellnigh dropped it. "All ri''!" said I, and he
      grinned at me through the cab window as the cabman flicked his horse into
      wakefulness. It was a white packet he had given me, with red seals at
      either end and along its edge. "If this isn''t money," said I, "it''s
      platinum or lead."

I stuck it with elaborate care into my pocket, and with a whirling brain
      walked home through the Regent Street loiterers and the dark back streets
      beyond Portland Road. I remember the sensations of that walk very vividly,
      strange as they were. I was still so far myself that I could notice my
      strange mental state, and wonder whether this stuff I had had was opium—a
      drug beyond my experience. It is hard now to describe the peculiarity of
      my mental strangeness—mental doubling vaguely expresses it. As I was
      walking up Regent Street I found in my mind a queer persuasion that it was
      Waterloo Station, and had an odd impulse to get into the Polytechnic as a
      man might get into a train. I put a knuckle in my eye, and it was Regent
      Street. How can I express it? You see a skilful actor looking quietly at
      you, he pulls a grimace, and lo!—another person. Is it too
      extravagant if I tell you that it seemed to me as if Regent Street had,
      for the moment, done that? Then, being persuaded it was Regent Street
      again, I was oddly muddled about some fantastic reminiscences that cropped
      up. "Thirty years ago," thought I, "it was here that I quarrelled with my
      brother." Then I burst out laughing, to the astonishment and encouragement
      of a group of night prowlers. Thirty years ago I did not exist, and never
      in my life had I boasted a brother. The stuff was surely liquid folly, for
      the poignant regret for that lost brother still clung to me. Along
      Portland Road the madness took another turn. I began to recall vanished
      shops, and to compare the street with what it used to be. Confused,
      troubled thinking is comprehensible enough after the drink I had taken,
      but what puzzled me were these curiously vivid phantasm memories that had
      crept into my mind, and not only the memories that had crept in, but also
      the memories that had slipped out. I stopped opposite Stevens'', the
      natural history dealer''s, and cudgelled my brains to think what he had to
      do with me. A ''bus went by, and sounded exactly like the rumbling of a
      train. I seemed to be dipping into some dark, remote pit for the
      recollection. "Of course," said I, at last, "he has promised me three
      frogs to-morrow. Odd I should have forgotten."

Do they still show children dissolving views? In those I remember one view
      would begin like a faint ghost, and grow and oust another. In just that
      way it seemed to me that a ghostly set of new sensations was struggling
      with those of my ordinary self.

I went on through Euston Road to Tottenham Court Road, puzzled, and a
      little frightened, and scarcely noticed the unusual way I was taking, for
      commonly I used to cut through the intervening network of back streets. I
      turned into University Street, to discover that I had forgotten my number.
      Only by a strong effort did I recall 11A, and even then it seemed to me
      that it was a thing some forgotten person had told me. I tried to steady
      my mind by recalling the incidents of the dinner, and for the life of me I
      could conjure up no picture of my host''s face; I saw him only as a shadowy
      outline, as one might see oneself reflected in a window through which one
      was looking. In his place, however, I had a curious exterior vision of
      myself, sitting at a table, flushed, bright-eyed, and talkative.

I tried the wrong side of the hall for my candle and the matches, and had
      a doubt of which landing my room might be on. "I''m drunk," I said, "that''s
      certain," and blundered needlessly on the staircase to sustain the
      proposition.

At the first glance my room seemed unfamiliar. "What rot!" I said, and
      stared about me. I seemed to bring myself back by the effort, and the odd
      phantasmal quality passed into the concrete familiar. There was the old
      glass still, with my notes on the albumens stuck in the corner of the
      frame, my old everyday suit of clothes pitched about the floor. And yet it
      was not so real after all. I felt an idiotic persuasion trying to creep
      into my mind, as it were, that I was in a railway carriage in a train just
      stopping, that I was peering out of the window at some unknown station. I
      gripped the bed-rail firmly to reassure myself. "It''s clairvoyance,
      perhaps," I said. "I must write to the Psychical Research Society."

I put the rouleau on my dressing-table, sat on my bed, and began to take
      off my boots. It was as if the picture of my present sensations was
      painted over some other picture that was trying to show through. "Curse
      it!" said I; "my wits are going, or am I in two places at once?"
      Half-undressed, I tossed the powder into a glass and drank it off. It
      effervesced, and became a fluorescent amber colour. Before I was in bed my
      mind was already tranquillised. I felt the pillow at my cheek, and
      thereupon I must have fallen asleep.

I awoke abruptly out of a dream of strange beasts, and found myself lying
      on my back. Probably every one knows that dismal, emotional dream from
      which one escapes, awake indeed, but strangely cowed. There was a curious
      taste in my mouth, a tired feeling in my limbs, a sense of cutaneous
      discomfort. I lay with my head motionless on my pillow, expecting that my
      feeling of strangeness and terror would pass away, and that I should then
      doze off again to sleep. But instead of that, my uncanny sensations
      increased. At first I could perceive nothing wrong about me. There was a
      faint light in the room, so faint that it was the very next thing to
      darkness, and the furniture stood out in it as vague blots of absolute
      darkness. I stared with my eyes just over the bedclothes.

It came into my mind that some one had entered the room to rob me of my
      rouleau of money, but after lying for some moments, breathing regularly to
      simulate sleep, I realised this was mere fancy. Nevertheless, the uneasy
      assurance of something wrong kept fast hold of me. With an effort I raised
      my head from the pillow, and peered about me at the dark. What it was I
      could not conceive. I looked at the dim shapes around me, the greater and
      lesser darknesses that indicated curtains, table, fireplace, bookshelves,
      and so forth. Then I began to perceive something unfamiliar in the forms
      of the darkness. Had the bed turned round? Yonder should be the
      bookshelves, and something shrouded and pallid rose there, something that
      would not answer to the bookshelves, however I looked at it. It was far
      too big to be my shirt thrown on a chair.

Overcoming a childish terror, I threw back the bedclothes and thrust my
      leg out of bed. Instead of coming out of my truckle-bed upon the floor, I
      found my foot scarcely reached the edge of the mattress. I made another
      step, as it were, and sat up on the edge of the bed. By the side of my bed
      should be the candle, and the matches upon the broken chair. I put out my
      hand and touched—nothing. I waved my hand in the darkness, and it
      came against some heavy hanging, soft and thick in texture, which gave a
      rustling noise at my touch. I grasped this and pulled it; it appeared to
      be a curtain suspended over the head of my bed.

I was now thoroughly awake, and beginning to realise that I was in a
      strange room. I was puzzled. I tried to recall the overnight
      circumstances, and I found them now, curiously enough, vivid in my memory:
      the supper, my reception of the little packages, my wonder whether I was
      intoxicated, my slow undressing, the coolness to my flushed face of my
      pillow. I felt a sudden distrust. Was that last night, or the night
      before? At any rate, this room was strange to me, and I could not imagine
      how I had got into it. The dim, pallid outline was growing paler, and I
      perceived it was a window, with the dark shape of an oval toilet-glass
      against the weak intimation of the dawn that filtered through the blind. I
      stood up, and was surprised by a curious feeling of weakness and
      unsteadiness. With trembling hands outstretched, I walked slowly towards
      the window, getting, nevertheless, a bruise on the knee from a chair by
      the way. I fumbled round the glass, which was large, with handsome brass
      sconces, to find the blind cord. I could not find any. By chance I took
      hold of the tassel, and with the click of a spring the blind ran up.

I found myself looking out upon a scene that was altogether strange to me.
      The night was overcast, and through the flocculent grey of the heaped
      clouds there filtered a faint half-light of dawn. Just at the edge of the
      sky the cloud-canopy had a blood-red rim. Below, everything was dark and
      indistinct, dim hills in the distance, a vague mass of buildings running
      up into pinnacles, trees like spilt ink, and below the window a tracery of
      black bushes and pale grey paths. It was so unfamiliar that for the moment
      I thought myself still dreaming. I felt the toilet-table; it appeared to
      be made of some polished wood, and was rather elaborately furnished—there
      were little cut-glass bottles and a brush upon it. There was also a queer
      little object, horse-shoe shape it felt, with smooth, hard projections,
      lying in a saucer. I could find no matches nor candlestick.

I turned my eyes to the room again. Now the blind was up, faint spectres
      of its furnishing came out of the darkness. There was a huge curtained
      bed, and the fireplace at its foot had a large white mantel with something
      of the shimmer of marble.

I leant against the toilet-table, shut my eyes and opened them again, and
      tried to think. The whole thing was far too real for dreaming. I was
      inclined to imagine there was still some hiatus in my memory, as a
      consequence of my draught of that strange liqueur; that I had come into my
      inheritance perhaps, and suddenly lost my recollection of everything since
      my good fortune had been announced. Perhaps if I waited a little, things
      would be clearer to me again. Yet my dinner with old Elvesham was now
      singularly vivid and recent. The champagne, the observant waiters, the
      powder, and the liqueurs—I could have staked my soul it all happened
      a few hours ago.

And then occurred a thing so trivial and yet so terrible to me that I
      shiver now to think of that moment. I spoke aloud. I said, "How the devil
      did I get here?" ... And the voice was not my own.

It was not my own, it was thin, the articulation was slurred, the
      resonance of my facial bones was different. Then, to reassure myself I ran
      one hand over the other, and felt loose folds of skin, the bony laxity of
      age. "Surely," I said, in that horrible voice that had somehow established
      itself in my throat, "surely this thing is a dream!" Almost as quickly as
      if I did it involuntarily, I thrust my fingers into my mouth. My teeth had
      gone. My finger-tips ran on the flaccid surface of an even row of
      shrivelled gums. I was sick with dismay and disgust.

I felt then a passionate desire to see myself, to realise at once in its
      full horror the ghastly change that had come upon me. I tottered to the
      mantel, and felt along it for matches. As I did so, a barking cough sprang
      up in my throat, and I clutched the thick flannel nightdress I found about
      me. There were no matches there, and I suddenly realised that my
      extremities were cold. Sniffing and coughing, whimpering a little,
      perhaps, I fumbled back to bed. "It is surely a dream," I whispered to
      myself as I clambered back, "surely a dream." It was a senile repetition.
      I pulled the bedclothes over my shoulders, over my ears, I thrust my
      withered hand under the pillow, and determined to compose myself to sleep.
      Of course it was a dream. In the morning the dream would be over, and I
      should wake up strong and vigorous again to my youth and studies. I shut
      my eyes, breathed regularly, and, finding myself wakeful, began to count
      slowly through the powers of three.

But the thing I desired would not come. I could not get to sleep. And the
      persuasion of the inexorable reality of the change that had happened to me
      grew steadily. Presently I found myself with my eyes wide open, the powers
      of three forgotten, and my skinny fingers upon my shrivelled gums, I was,
      indeed, suddenly and abruptly, an old man. I had in some unaccountable
      manner fallen through my life and come to old age, in some way I had been
      cheated of all the best of my life, of love, of struggle, of strength, and
      hope. I grovelled into the pillow and tried to persuade myself that such
      hallucination was possible. Imperceptibly, steadily, the dawn grew
      clearer.

At last, despairing of further sleep, I sat up in bed and looked about me.
      A chill twilight rendered the whole chamber visible. It was spacious and
      well-furnished, better furnished than any room I had ever slept in before.
      A candle and matches became dimly visible upon a little pedestal in a
      recess. I threw back the bedclothes, and, shivering with the rawness of
      the early morning, albeit it was summer-time, I got out and lit the
      candle. Then, trembling horribly, so that the extinguisher rattled on its
      spike, I tottered to the glass and saw—Elvesham''s face! It
      was none the less horrible because I had already dimly feared as much. He
      had already seemed physically weak and pitiful to me, but seen now,
      dressed only in a coarse flannel nightdress, that fell apart and showed
      the stringy neck, seen now as my own body, I cannot describe its desolate
      decrepitude. The hollow cheeks, the straggling tail of dirty grey hair,
      the rheumy bleared eyes, the quivering, shrivelled lips, the lower
      displaying a gleam of the pink interior lining, and those horrible dark
      gums showing. You who are mind and body together, at your natural years,
      cannot imagine what this fiendish imprisonment meant to me. To be young
      and full of the desire and energy of youth, and to be caught, and
      presently to be crushed in this tottering ruin of a body...

But I wander from the course of my story. For some time I must have been
      stunned at this change that had come upon me. It was daylight when I did
      so far gather myself together as to think. In some inexplicable way I had
      been changed, though how, short of magic, the thing had been done, I could
      not say. And as I thought, the diabolical ingenuity of Elvesham came home
      to me. It seemed plain to me that as I found myself in his, so he must be
      in possession of my body, of my strength, that is, and my future.
      But how to prove it? Then, as I thought, the thing became so incredible,
      even to me, that my mind reeled, and I had to pinch myself, to feel my
      toothless gums, to see myself in the glass, and touch the things about me,
      before I could steady myself to face the facts again. Was all life
      hallucination? Was I indeed Elvesham, and he me? Had I been dreaming of
      Eden overnight? Was there any Eden? But if I was Elvesham, I should
      remember where I was on the previous morning, the name of the town in
      which I lived, what happened before the dream began. I struggled with my
      thoughts. I recalled the queer doubleness of my memories overnight. But
      now my mind was clear. Not the ghost of any memories but those proper to
      Eden could I raise.

"This way lies insanity!" I cried in my piping voice. I staggered to my
      feet, dragged my feeble, heavy limbs to the washhand-stand, and plunged my
      grey head into a basin of cold water. Then, towelling myself, I tried
      again. It was no good. I felt beyond all question that I was indeed Eden,
      not Elvesham. But Eden in Elvesham''s body!

Had I been a man of any other age, I might have given myself up to my fate
      as one enchanted. But in these sceptical days miracles do not pass
      current. Here was some trick of psychology. What a drug and a steady stare
      could do, a drug and a steady stare, or some similar treatment, could
      surely undo. Men have lost their memories before. But to exchange memories
      as one does umbrellas! I laughed. Alas! not a healthy laugh, but a
      wheezing, senile titter. I could have fancied old Elvesham laughing at my
      plight, and a gust of petulant anger, unusual to me, swept across my
      feelings. I began dressing eagerly in the clothes I found lying about on
      the floor, and only realised when I was dressed that it was an evening
      suit I had assumed. I opened the wardrobe and found some more ordinary
      clothes, a pair of plaid trousers, and an old-fashioned dressing-gown. I
      put a venerable smoking-cap on my venerable head, and, coughing a little
      from my exertions, tottered out upon the landing.

It was then, perhaps, a quarter to six, and the blinds were closely drawn
      and the house quite silent. The landing was a spacious one, a broad,
      richly-carpeted staircase went down into the darkness of the hall below,
      and before me a door ajar showed me a writing-desk, a revolving bookcase,
      the back of a study chair, and a fine array of bound books, shelf upon
      shelf.

"My study," I mumbled, and walked across the landing. Then at the sound of
      my voice a thought struck me, and I went back to the bedroom and put in
      the set of false teeth. They slipped in with the ease of old, habit.
      "That''s better," said I, gnashing them, and so returned to the study.

The drawers of the writing-desk were locked. Its revolving top was also
      locked. I could see no indications of the keys, and there were none in the
      pockets of my trousers. I shuffled back at once to the bedroom, and went
      through the dress suit, and afterwards the pockets of all the garments I
      could find. I was very eager, and one might have imagined that burglars
      had been at work, to see my room when I had done. Not only were there no
      keys to be found, but not a coin, nor a scrap of paper—save only the
      receipted bill of the overnight dinner.

A curious weariness asserted itself. I sat down and stared at the garments
      flung here and there, their pockets turned inside out. My first frenzy had
      already flickered out. Every moment I was beginning to realise the immense
      intelligence of the plans of my enemy, to see more and more clearly the
      hopelessness of my position. With an effort I rose and hurried hobbling
      into the study again. On the staircase was a housemaid pulling up the
      blinds. She stared, I think, at the expression of my face. I shut the door
      of the study behind me, and, seizing a poker, began an attack upon the
      desk. That is how they found me. The cover of the desk was split, the lock
      smashed, the letters torn out of the pigeon-holes, and tossed about the
      room. In my senile rage I had flung about the pens and other such light
      stationery, and overturned the ink. Moreover, a large vase upon the mantel
      had got broken—I do not know how. I could find no cheque-book, no
      money, no indications of the slightest use for the recovery of my body. I
      was battering madly at the drawers, when the butler, backed by two
      women-servants, intruded upon me.

That simply is the story of my change. No one will believe my frantic
      assertions. I am treated as one demented, and even at this moment I am
      under restraint. But I am sane, absolutely sane, and to prove it I have
      sat down to write this story minutely as the things happened to me. I
      appeal to the reader, whether there is any trace of insanity in the style
      or method, of the story he has been reading. I am a young man locked away
      in an old man''s body. But the clear fact is incredible to everyone.
      Naturally I appear demented to those who will not believe this, naturally
      I do not know the names of my secretaries, of the doctors who come to see
      me, of my servants and neighbours, of this town (wherever it is) where I
      find myself. Naturally I lose myself in my own house, and suffer
      inconveniences of every sort. Naturally I ask the oddest questions.
      Naturally I weep and cry out, and have paroxysms of despair. I have no
      money and no cheque-book. The bank will not recognise my signature, for I
      suppose that, allowing for the feeble muscles I now have, my handwriting
      is still Eden''s. These people about me will not let me go to the bank
      personally. It seems, indeed, that there is no bank in this town, and that
      I have an account in some part of London. It seems that Elvesham kept the
      name of his solicitor secret from all his household. I can ascertain
      nothing. Elvesham was, of course, a profound student of mental science,
      and all my declarations of the facts of the case merely confirm the theory
      that my insanity is the outcome of overmuch brooding upon psychology.
      Dreams of the personal identity indeed! Two days ago I was a healthy
      youngster, with all life before me; now I am a furious old man, unkempt,
      and desperate, and miserable, prowling about a great, luxurious, strange
      house, watched, feared, and avoided as a lunatic by everyone about me. And
      in London is Elvesham beginning life again in a vigorous body, and with
      all the accumulated knowledge and wisdom of threescore and ten. He has
      stolen my life.

What has happened I do not clearly know. In the study are volumes of
      manuscript notes referring chiefly to the psychology of memory, and parts
      of what may be either calculations or ciphers in symbols absolutely
      strange to me. In some passages ' WHERE id = 'ee364418-59f6-4a5c-b61e-e19060e1944f';
