UPDATE stories SET original_text = original_text || ' had seen once or twice in my childhood. And when to shake off that
semi-delirium I peeped out from the hood and saw the dawn, all the
images of the past, all my misty thoughts, for some reason, blended in
me into one distinct, overpowering thought: everything was irrevocably
over for Zinaida Fyodorovna and for me. This was as certain a conviction
as though the cold blue sky contained a prophecy, but a minute later I
was already thinking of something else and believed differently.

"What am I now?" said Zinaida Fyodorovna, in a voice husky with the cold
and the damp. "Where am I to go? What am I to do? Gruzin told me to go
into a nunnery. Oh, I would! I would change my dress, my face, my name,
my thoughts ... everything—everything, and would hide myself for ever.
But they will not take me into a nunnery. I am with child."

The cabman stopped at a wooden house of two storeys, painted a dark
colour. I rang. Taking from me her small light basket—the only luggage
we had brought with us—Zinaida Fyodorovna gave a wry smile and said:

It was a long while before the door was opened. After the third or
fourth ring a light gleamed in the windows, and there was a sound of
steps, coughing and whispering; at last the key grated in the lock, and
a stout peasant woman with a frightened red face appeared at the door.
Some distance behind her stood a thin little old woman with short grey
hair, carrying a candle in her hand. Zinaida Fyodorovna ran into the
passage and flung her arms round the old woman''s neck.

I handed the basket to the peasant woman. The door was closed, but still
I heard her sobs and the cry "Nina!"

I got into the cab and told the man to drive slowly to the Nevsky
Prospect. I had to think of a night''s lodging for myself.

Next day towards evening I went to see Zinaida Fyodorovna. She was
terribly changed. There were no traces of tears on her pale, terribly
sunken face, and her expression was different. I don''t know whether it
was that I saw her now in different surroundings, far from luxurious,
and that our relations were by now different, or perhaps that intense
grief had already set its mark upon her; she did not strike me as so
elegant and well dressed as before. Her figure seemed smaller; there was
an abruptness and excessive nervousness about her as though she were in
a hurry, and there was not the same softness even in her smile. I was
dressed in an expensive suit which I had bought during the day. She
looked first of all at that suit and at the hat in my hand, then turned
an impatient, searching glance upon my face as though studying it.

"Your transformation still seems to me a sort of miracle," she said.
"Forgive me for looking at you with such curiosity. You are an
extraordinary man, you know."

I told her again who I was, and why I was living at Orlov''s, and I told
her at greater length and in more detail than the day before. She
listened with great attention, and said without letting me finish:

"Everything there is over for me. You know, I could not refrain from
writing a letter. Here is the answer."

"I am not going to justify myself. But you must own that it was your
mistake, not mine. I wish you happiness, and beg you to make haste and
forget.

The trunks and baskets despatched by Orlov were standing in the passage,
and my poor little portmanteau was there beside them.

We were silent. She took the note and held it for a couple of minutes
before her eyes, and during that time her face wore the same haughty,
contemptuous, proud, and harsh expression as the day before at the
beginning of our explanation; tears came into her eyes—not timid,
bitter tears, but proud, angry tears.

"Listen," she said, getting up abruptly and moving away to the window
that I might not see her face. "I have made up my mind to go abroad with
you tomorrow."

"Accept me as a recruit. Have you read Balzac?" she asked suddenly,
turning round. "Have you? At the end of his novel ''PÃ¨re Goriot'' the hero
looks down upon Paris from the top of a hill and threatens the town:
''Now we shall settle our account,'' and after this he begins a new life.
So when I look out of the train window at Petersburg for the last time,
I shall say, ''Now we shall settle our account!''"

At Venice I had an attack of pleurisy. Probably I had caught cold in the
evening when we were rowing from the station to the Hotel Bauer. I had
to take to my bed and stay there for a fortnight. Every morning while I
was ill Zinaida Fyodorovna came from her room to drink coffee with me,
and afterwards read aloud to me French and Russian books, of which we
had bought a number at Vienna. These books were either long, long
familiar to me or else had no interest for me, but I had the sound of a
sweet, kind voice beside me, so that the meaning of all of them was
summed up for me in the one thing—I was not alone. She would go out for
a walk, come back in her light grey dress, her light straw hat, gay,
warmed by the spring sun; and sitting by my bed, bending low down over
me, would tell me something about Venice or read me those books—and I
was happy.

At night I was cold, ill, and dreary, but by day I revelled in life—I
can find no better expression for it. The brilliant warm sunshine
beating in at the open windows and at the door upon the balcony, the
shouts below, the splash of oars, the tinkle of bells, the prolonged
boom of the cannon at midday, and the feeling of perfect, perfect
freedom, did wonders with me; I felt as though I were growing strong,
broad wings which were bearing me God knows whither. And what charm,
what joy at times at the thought that another life was so close to mine!
that I was the servant, the guardian, the friend, the indispensable
fellow-traveller of a creature, young, beautiful, wealthy, but weak,
lonely, and insulted! It is pleasant even to be ill when you know that
there are people who are looking forward to your convalescence as to a
holiday. One day I heard her whispering behind the door with my doctor,
and then she came in to me with tear-stained eyes. It was a bad sign,
but I was touched, and there was a wonderful lightness in my heart.

But at last they allowed me to go out on the balcony. The sunshine and
the breeze from the sea caressed and fondled my sick body. I looked down
at the familiar gondolas, which glide with feminine grace smoothly and
majestically as though they were alive, and felt all the luxury of this
original, fascinating civilisation. There was a smell of the sea. Some
one was playing a stringed instrument and two voices were singing. How
delightful it was! How unlike it was to that Petersburg night when the
wet snow was falling and beating so rudely on our faces. If one looks
straight across the canal, one sees the sea, and on the wide expanse
towards the horizon the sun glittered on the water so dazzlingly that it
hurt one''s eyes to look at it. My soul yearned towards that lovely sea,
which was so akin to me and to which I had given up my youth. I longed
to live—to live—and nothing more.

A fortnight later I began walking freely. I loved to sit in the sun, and
to listen to the gondoliers without understanding them, and for hours
together to gaze at the little house where, they said, Desdemona
lived—a naÃ¯ve, mournful little house with a demure expression, as light
as lace, so light that it looked as though one could lift it from its
place with one hand. I stood for a long time by the tomb of Canova, and
could not take my eyes off the melancholy lion. And in the Palace of the
Doges I was always drawn to the corner where the portrait of the unhappy
Marino Faliero was painted over with black. "It is fine to be an artist,
a poet, a dramatist," I thought, "but since that is not vouchsafed to
me, if only I could go in for mysticism! If only I had a grain of some
faith to add to the unruffled peace and serenity that fills the soul!"

In the evening we ate oysters, drank wine, and went out in a gondola. I
remember our black gondola swayed softly in the same place while the
water faintly gurgled under it. Here and there the reflection of the
stars and the lights on the bank quivered and trembled. Not far from us
in a gondola, hung with coloured lanterns which were reflected in the
water, there were people singing. The sounds of guitars, of violins, of
mandolins, of men''s and women''s voices, were audible in the dark.
Zinaida Fyodorovna, pale, with a grave, almost stern face, was sitting
beside me, compressing her lips and clenching her hands. She was
thinking about something; she did not stir an eyelash, nor hear me. Her
face, her attitude, and her fixed, expressionless gaze, and her
incredibly miserable, dreadful, and icy-cold memories, and around her
the gondolas, the lights, the music, the song with its vigorous
passionate cry of "Jam-mo! Jam-mo!"—what contrasts in life! When she
sat like that, with tightly clasped hands, stony, mournful, I used to
feel as though we were both characters in some novel in the
old-fashioned style called "The Ill-fated," "The Abandoned," or
something of the sort. Both of us: she—the ill-fated, the abandoned;
and I—the faithful, devoted friend, the dreamer, and, if you like it, a
superfluous man, a failure capable of nothing but coughing and dreaming,
and perhaps sacrificing myself.

When we came in in the evening we always drank tea in her room and
talked. We did not shrink from touching on old, unhealed wounds—on the
contrary, for some reason I felt a positive pleasure in telling her
about my life at Orlov''s, or referring openly to relations which I knew
and which could not have been concealed from me.

"At moments I hated you," I said to her. "When he was capricious,
condescending, told you lies, I marvelled how it was you did not see,
did not understand, when it was all so clear! You kissed his hands, you
knelt to him, you flattered him ..."

"Can it have been so difficult to see through him? A fine sphinx! A
sphinx indeed—a kammer-junker! I reproach you for nothing, God
forbid," I went on, feeling I was coarse, that I had not the tact, the
delicacy which are so essential when you have to do with a
fellow-creature''s soul; in early days before I knew her I had not
noticed this defect in myself. "But how could you fail to see what he
was," I went on, speaking more softly and more diffidently, however.

"You mean to say you despise my past, and you are right," she said,
deeply stirred. "You belong to a special class of men who cannot be
judged by ordinary standards; your moral requirements are exceptionally
rigorous, and I understand you can''t forgive things. I understand you,
and if sometimes I say the opposite, it doesn''t mean that I look at
things differently from you; I speak the same old nonsense simply
because I haven''t had time yet to wear out my old clothes and
prejudices. I, too, hate and despise my past, and Orlov and my love....
What was that love? It''s positively absurd now," she said, going to the
window and looking down at the canal. "All this love only clouds the
conscience and confuses the mind. The meaning of life is to be found
only in one thing—fighting. To get one''s heel on the vile head of the
serpent and to crush it! That''s the meaning of life. In that alone or in
nothing."

I told her long stories of my past, and described my really astounding
adventures. But of the change that had taken place in me I did not say
one word. She always listened to me with great attention, and at
interesting places she rubbed her hands as though vexed that it had not
yet been her lot to experience such adventures, such joys and terrors.
Then she would suddenly fall to musing and retreat into herself, and I
could see from her face that she was not attending to me.

I closed the windows that looked out on the canal and asked whether we
should not have the fire lighted.

"No, never mind. I am not cold," she said, smiling listlessly. "I only
feel weak. Do you know, I fancy I have grown much wiser lately. I have
extraordinary, original ideas now. When I think of my past, of my life
then ... people in general, in fact, it is all summed up for me in the
image of my stepmother. Coarse, insolent, soulless, false, depraved, and
a morphia maniac too. My father, who was feeble and weak-willed, married
my mother for her money and drove her into consumption; but his second
wife, my stepmother, he loved passionately, insanely.... What I had to
put up with! But what is the use of talking! And so, as I say, it is all
summed up in her image.... And it vexes me that my stepmother is dead. I
should like to meet her now!"

"I don''t know," she answered with a laugh and a graceful movement of her
head. "Good-night. You must get well. As soon as you are well, we''ll
take up our work ... It''s time to begin."

And I went off to my room. So we spent a whole month. One grey morning
when we both stood at my window, looking at the clouds which were moving
up from the sea, and at the darkening canal, expecting every minute that
it would pour with rain, and when a thick, narrow streak of rain covered
the sea as though with a muslin veil, we both felt suddenly dreary. The
same day we both set off for Florence.

It was autumn, at Nice. One morning when I went into her room she was
sitting on a low chair, bent together and huddled up, with her legs
crossed and her face hidden in her hands. She was weeping bitterly, with
sobs, and her long, unbrushed hair fell on her knees. The impression of
the exquisite marvellous sea which I had only just seen and of which I
wanted to tell her, left me all at once, and my heart ached.

"What is it?" I asked; she took one hand from her face and motioned me
to go away. "What is it?" I repeated, and for the first time during our
acquaintance I kissed her hand.

"No, it''s nothing, nothing," she said quickly. "Oh, it''s nothing,
nothing.... Go away.... You see, I am not dressed."

I went out overwhelmed. The calm and serene mood in which I had been for
so long was poisoned by compassion. I had a passionate longing to fall
at her feet, to entreat her not to weep in solitude, but to share her
grief with me, and the monotonous murmur of the sea already sounded a
gloomy prophecy in my ears, and I foresaw fresh tears, fresh troubles,
and fresh losses in the future. "What is she crying about? What is it?"
I wondered, recalling her face and her agonised look. I remembered she
was with child. She tried to conceal her condition from other people,
and also from herself. At home she went about in a loose wrapper or in a
blouse with extremely full folds over the bosom, and when she went out
anywhere she laced herself in so tightly that on two occasions she
fainted when we were out. She never spoke to me of her condition, and
when I hinted that it might be as well to see a doctor, she flushed
crimson and said not a word.

"There, there," I said, seeing that she was ready to cry again. "We had
better go to the sea and have a talk."

"I can''t talk. Forgive me, I am in the mood now when one wants to be
alone. And, if you please, Vladimir Ivanitch, another time you want to
come into my room, be so good as to give a knock at the door."

That "be so good" had a peculiar, unfeminine sound. I went away. My
accursed Petersburg mood came back, and all my dreams were crushed and
crumpled up like leaves by the heat. I felt I was alone again and there
was no nearness between us. I was no more to her than that cobweb to
that palm-tree, which hangs on it by chance and which will be torn off
and carried away by the wind. I walked about the square where the band
was playing, went into the Casino; there I looked at overdressed and
heavily perfumed women, and every one of them glanced at me as though
she would say: "You are alone; that''s all right." Then I went out on the
terrace and looked for a long time at the sea. There was not one sail on
the horizon. On the left bank, in the lilac-coloured mist, there were
mountains, gardens, towers, and houses, the sun was sparkling over it
all, but it was all alien, indifferent, an incomprehensible tangle.

She used as before to come into my room in the morning to coffee, but we
no longer dined together, as she said she was not hungry; and she lived
only on coffee, tea, and various trifles such as oranges and caramels.

And we no longer had conversations in the evening. I don''t know why it
was like this. Ever since the day when I had found her in tears she had
treated me somehow lightly, at times casually, even ironically, and for
some reason called me "My good sir." What had before seemed to her
terrible, heroic, marvellous, and had stirred her envy and enthusiasm,
did not touch her now at all, and usually after listening to me, she
stretched and said:

It sometimes happened even that I did not see her for days together. I
would knock timidly and guiltily at her door and get no answer; I would
knock again—still silence.... I would stand near the door and listen;
then the chambermaid would pass and say coldly, "Madame est partie."
Then I would walk about the passages of the hotel, walk and walk....
English people, full-bosomed ladies, waiters in swallow-tails.... And as
I keep gazing at the long striped rug that stretches the whole length of
the corridor, the idea occurs to me that I am playing in the life of
this woman a strange, probably false part, and that it is beyond my
power to alter that part. I run to my room and fall on my bed, and think
and think, and can come to no conclusion; and all that is clear to me is
that I want to live, and that the plainer and the colder and the harder
her face grows, the nearer she is to me, and the more intensely and
painfully I feel our kinship. Never mind "My good sir," never mind her
light careless tone, never mind anything you like, only don''t leave me,
my treasure. I am afraid to be alone.

Then I go out into the corridor again, listen in a tremor.... I have no
dinner; I don''t notice the approach of evening. At last about eleven I
hear the familiar footstep, and at the turn near the stairs Zinaida
Fyodorovna comes into sight.

"Are you taking a walk?" she would ask as she passes me. "You had better
go out into the air.... Good-night!"

"Where? To Monte Carlo." She took ten gold coins out of her pocket and
said: "Look, my good sir; I have won. That''s at roulette."

I imagined her with a sick and morbid face, in her condition, tightly
laced, standing near the gaming-table in a crowd of cocottes, of old
women in their dotage who swarm round the gold like flies round the
honey. I remembered she had gone off to Monte Carlo for some reason in
secret from me.

"It''s not the question of what you lose," I said with annoyance. "Has it
never occurred to you while you were playing there that the glitter of
gold, all these women, young and old, the croupiers, all the
surroundings—that it is all a vile, loathsome mockery at the toiler''s
labour, at his bloody sweat?"

"If one doesn''t play, what is one to do here?" she asked. "The toiler''s
labour and his bloody sweat—all that eloquence you can put off till
another time; but now, since you have begun, let me go on. Let me ask
you bluntly, what is there for me to do here, and what am I to do?"

"What are you to do?" I said, shrugging my shoulders. "That''s a question
that can''t be answered straight off."

"I beg you to answer me honestly, Vladimir Ivanitch," she said, and her
face looked angry. "Once I have brought myself to ask you this question,
I am not going to listen to stock phrases. I am asking you," she went
on, beating her hand on the table, as though marking time, "what ought I
to do here? And not only here at Nice, but in general?"

"Vladimir Ivanitch," she said softly and breathlessly; it was hard for
her to speak—"Vladimir Ivanitch, if you do not believe in the cause
yourself, if you no longer think of going back to it, why ... why did
you drag me out of Petersburg? Why did you make me promises, why did you
rouse mad hopes? Your convictions have changed; you have become a
different man, and nobody blames you for it—our convictions are not
always in our power. But ... but, Vladimir Ivanitch, for God''s sake, why
are you not sincere?" she went on softly, coming up to me. "All these
months when I have been dreaming aloud, raving, going into raptures over
my plans, remodelling my life on a new pattern, why didn''t you tell me
the truth? Why were you silent or encouraged me by your stories, and
behaved as though you were in complete sympathy with me? Why was it? Why
was it necessary?"

"It''s difficult to acknowledge one''s bankruptcy," I said, turning round,
but not looking at her. "Yes, I have no faith; I am worn out. I have
lost heart.... It is difficult to be truthful—very difficult, and I
held my tongue. God forbid that any one should have to go through what I
have been through."

"Vladimir Ivanitch," she said, and took me by both hands, "you have been
through so much and seen so much of life, you know more than I do; think
seriously, and tell me, what am I to do? Teach me! If you haven''t the
strength to go forward yourself and take others with you, at least show
me where to go. After all, I am a living, feeling, thinking being. To
sink into a false position ... to play an absurd part ... is painful to
me. I don''t reproach you, I don''t blame you; I only ask you."

"There is more light in the world than you see through your window," I
answered. "And there are other people besides me, Zinaida Fyodorovna."

"And I want to say, too," I went on, "one can serve an idea in more than
one calling. If one has made a mistake and lost faith in one, one may
find another. The world of ideas is large and cannot be exhausted."

"The world of ideas!" she said, and she looked into my face
sarcastically. "Then we had better leave off talking. What''s the
use?..."

"The world of ideas!" she repeated. She threw her dinner-napkin aside,
and an expression of indignation and contempt came into her face. "All
your fine ideas, I see, lead up to one inevitable, essential step: I
ought to become your mistress. That''s what''s wanted. To be taken up with
ideas without being the mistress of an honourable, progressive man, is
as good as not understanding the ideas. One has to begin with that ...
that is, with being your mistress, and the rest will come of itself."

"I am in error?" she laughed. "Any one else might say that, but not you,
my dear sir! I may seem to you indelicate, cruel, but I don''t care: you
love me? You love me, don''t you?"

"Yes, shrug your shoulders!" she went on sarcastically. "When you were
ill I heard you in your delirium, and ever since these adoring eyes,
these sighs, and edifying conversations about friendship, about
spiritual kinship.... But the point is, why haven''t you been sincere?
Why have you concealed what is and talked about what isn''t? Had you said
from the beginning what ideas exactly led you to drag me from
Petersburg, I should have known. I should have poisoned myself then as I
meant to, and there would have been none of this tedious farce.... But
what''s the use of talking!"

"Oh, very well. What''s the use of talking! I don''t suspect you of
intentions, but of having no intentions. If you had any, I should have
known them by now. You had nothing but ideas and love. For the
present—ideas and love, and in prospect—me as your mistress. That''s in
the order of things both in life and in novels.... Here you abused him,"
she said, and she slapped the table with her hand, "but one can''t help
agreeing with him. He has good reasons for despising these ideas."

"Oh, very well. He is a coward and a liar, and deceived me. And you?
Excuse my frankness; what are you? He deceived me and left me to take my
chance in Petersburg, and you have deceived me and abandoned me here.
But he did not mix up ideas with his deceit, and you ..."

"For goodness'' sake, why are you saying this?" I cried in horror,
wringing my hands and going up to her quickly. "No, Zinaida Fyodorovna,
this is cynicism. You must not be so despairing; listen to me," I went
on, catching at a thought which flashed dimly upon me, and which seemed
to me might still save us both. "Listen. I have passed through so many
experiences in my time that my head goes round at the thought of them,
and I have realised with my mind, with my racked soul, that man finds
his true destiny in nothing if not in self-sacrificing love for his
neighbour. It is towards that we must strive, and that is our
destination! That is my faith!"

I wanted to go on to speak of mercy, of forgiveness, but there was an
insincere note in my voice, and I was embarrassed.

"I want to live!" I said genuinely. "To live, to live! I want peace,
tranquillity; I want warmth—this sea here—to have you near. Oh, how I
wish I could rouse in you the same thirst for life! You spoke just now
of love, but it would be enough for me to have you near, to hear your
voice, to watch the look in your face ...!"

"I imagine it is better to cut short this conversation," she said to me
from within. "Everything is over for me, and I want nothing.... What
more is there to say?"

I got up, took a turn from one end of the room to the other, and went
out into the corridor. When late at night I went to her door and
listened, I distinctly heard her crying.

Next morning the waiter, handing me my clothes, informed me, with a
smile, that the lady in number thirteen was confined. I dressed somehow,
and almost fainting with terror ran to Zinaida Fyodorovna. In her room I
found a doctor, a midwife, and an elderly Russian lady from Harkov,
called Darya Milhailovna. There was a smell of ether. I had scarcely
crossed the threshold when from the room where she was lying I heard a
low, plaintive moan, and, as though it had been wafted me by the wind
from Russia, I thought of Orlov, his irony, Polya, the Neva, the
drifting snow, then the cab without an apron, the prediction I had read
in the cold morning sky, and the despairing cry "Nina! Nina!"

I went in to see Zinaida Fyodorovna, feeling as though I were the father
of the child. She was lying with her eyes closed, looking thin and pale,
wearing a white cap edged with lace. I remember there were two
expressions on her face: one—cold, indifferent, apathetic; the other—a
look of childish helplessness given her by the white cap. She did not
hear me come in, or heard, perhaps, but did not pay attention. I stood,
looked at her, and waited.

But her face was contorted with pain; she opened her eyes and gazed at
the ceiling, as though wondering what was happening to her.... There was
a look of loathing on her face.

"Zinaida Fyodorovna." I spoke her name softly. She looked at me
indifferently, listlessly, and closed her eyes. I stood there a little
while, then went away.

At night, Darya Mihailovna informed me that the child, a girl, was born,
but that the mother was in a dangerous condition. Then I heard noise and
bustle in the passage. Darya Mihailovna came to me again and with a face
of despair, wringing her hands, said:

"Oh, this is awful! The doctor suspects that she has taken poison! Oh,
how badly Russians do behave here!"

Two years had passed. Circumstances had changed; I had come to
Petersburg again and could live here openly. I was no longer afraid of
being and seeming sentimental, and gave myself up entirely to the
fatherly, or rather idolatrous feeling roused in me by Sonya, Zinaida
Fyodorovna''s child. I fed her with my own hands, gave her her bath, put
her to bed, never took my eyes off her for nights together, and screamed
when it seemed to me that the nurse was just going to drop her. My
thirst for normal ordinary life became stronger and more acute as time
went on, but wider visions stopped short at Sonya, as though I had found
in her at last just what I needed. I loved the child madly. In her I saw
the continuation of my life, and it was not exactly that I fancied, but
I felt, I almost believed, that when I had cast off at last my long,
bony, bearded frame, I should go on living in those little blue eyes,
that silky flaxen hair, those dimpled pink hands which stroked my face
so lovingly and were clasped round my neck.

Sonya''s future made me anxious. Orlov was her father; in her birth
certificate she was called Krasnovsky, and the only person who knew of
her existence, and took interest in her—that is, I—was at death''s
door. I had to think about her seriously.

The day after I arrived in Petersburg I went to see Orlov. The door was
opened to me by a stout old fellow with red whiskers and no moustache,
who looked like a German. Polya, who was tidying the drawing-room, did
not recognise me, but Orlov knew me at once.

"Ah, Mr. Revolutionist!" he said, looking at me with curiosity, and
laughing. "What fate has brought you?"

He was not changed in the least: the same well-groomed, unpleasant face,
the same irony. And a new book was lying on the table just as of old,
with an ivory paper-knife thrust in it. He had evidently been reading
before I came in. He made me sit down, offered me a cigar, and with a
delicacy only found in well-bred people, concealing the unpleasant
feeling aroused by my face and my wasted figure, observed casually that
I was not in the least changed, and that he would have known me anywhere
in spite of my having grown a beard. We talked of the weather, of Paris.
To dispose as quickly as possible of the oppressive, inevitable
question, which weighed upon him and me, he asked:

"Yes, in childbirth. The doctor suspected another cause of death, but
... it is more comforting for you and for me to think that she died in
childbirth."

"Yes. And here everything is as it used to be—no changes," he said
briskly, seeing that I was looking about the room. "My father, as you
know, has left the service and is living in retirement; I am still in
the same department. Do you remember Pekarsky? He is just the same as
ever. Gruzin died of diphtheria a year ago.... Kukushkin is alive, and
often speaks of you. By the way," said Orlov, dropping his eyes with an
air of reserve, "when Kukushkin heard who you were, he began telling
every one you had attacked him and tried to murder him ... and that he
only just escaped with his life."

"Old servants do not forget their masters.... It''s very nice of you,"
said Orlov jocosely. "Will you have some wine and some coffee, though? I
will tell them to make some."

"I am not very fond of important matters, but I shall be glad to be of
service to you. What do you want?"

"You see," I began, growing agitated, "I have here with me Zinaida
Fyodorovna''s daughter.... Hitherto I have brought her up, but, as you
see, before many days I shall be an empty sound. I should like to die
with the thought that she is provided for."

Orlov coloured a little, frowned a little, and took a cursory and sullen
glance at me. He was unpleasantly affected, not so much by the
"important matter" as by my words about death, about becoming an empty
sound.

"Yes, it must be thought about," he said, screening his eyes as though
from the sun. "Thank you. You say it''s a girl?"

"Yes. Of course, it''s not a lap-dog, but a human being. I understand we
must consider it seriously. I am prepared to do my part, and am very
grateful to you."

"We must think about it," he said in a hollow voice, standing with his
back to me. "I shall go to Pekarsky''s to-day and will ask him to go to
Krasnovsky''s. I don''t think he will make much ado about consenting to
take the child."

"But, excuse me, I don''t see what Krasnovsky has got to do with it," I
said, also getting up and walking to a picture at the other end of the
room.

"Yes, he may be legally obliged to accept the child—I don''t know; but I
came to you, Georgy Ivanitch, not to discuss the legal aspect."

"Yes, yes, you are right," he agreed briskly. "I believe I am talking
nonsense. But don''t excite yourself. We will decide the matter to our
mutual satisfaction. If one thing won''t do, we''ll try another; and if
that won''t do, we''ll try a third—one way or another this delicate
question shall be settled. Pekarsky will arrange it all. Be so good as
to leave me your address and I will let you know at once what we decide.
Where are you living?"

"Oh, Lord, what a job it is to be the father of a little daughter! But
Pekarsky will arrange it all. He is a sensible man. Did you stay long in
Paris?"

We were silent. Orlov was evidently afraid I should begin talking of the
child again, and to turn my attention in another direction, said:

"You have probably forgotten your letter by now. But I have kept it. I
understand your mood at the time, and, I must own, I respect that
letter. ''Damnable cold blood,'' ''Asiatic,'' ''coarse laugh''—that was
charming and characteristic," he went on with an ironical smile. "And
the fundamental thought is perhaps near the truth, though one might
dispute the question endlessly. That is," he hesitated, "not dispute the
thought itself, but your attitude to the question—your temperament, so
to say. Yes, my life is abnormal, corrupted, of no use to any one, and
what prevents me from beginning a new life is cowardice—there you are
quite right. But that you take it so much to heart, are troubled, and
reduced to despair by it—that''s irrational; there you are quite wrong."

"A living man cannot help being troubled and reduced to despair when he
sees that he himself is going to ruin and others are going to ruin round
him."

"Who doubts it! I am not advocating indifference; all I ask for is an
objective attitude to life. The more objective, the less danger of
falling into error. One must look into the root of things, and try to
see in every phenomenon a cause of all the other causes. We have grown
feeble, slack—degraded, in fact. Our generation is entirely composed of
neurasthenics and whimperers; we do nothing but talk of fatigue and
exhaustion. But the fault is neither yours nor mine; we are of too
little consequence to affect the destiny of a whole generation. We must
suppose for that larger, more general causes with a solid raison
d''Ãªtre from the biological point of view. We are neurasthenics, flabby,
renegades, but perhaps it''s necessary and of service for generations
that will come after us. Not one hair falls from the head without the
will of the Heavenly Father—in other words, nothing happens by chance
in Nature and in human environment. Everything has its cause and is
inevitable. And if so, why should we worry and write despairing
letters?"

"That''s all very well," I said, thinking a little. "I believe it will be
easier and clearer for the generations to come; our experience will be
at their service. But one wants to live apart from future generations
and not only for their sake. Life is only given us once, and one wants
to live it boldly, with full consciousness and beauty. One wants to play
a striking, independent, noble part; one wants to make history so that
those generations may not have the right to say of each of us that we
were nonentities or worse.... I believe what is going on about us is
inevitable and not without a purpose, but what have I to do with that
inevitability? Why should my ego be lost?"

"Well, there''s no help for it," sighed Orlov, getting up and, as it
were, giving me to understand that our conversation was over.

"We''ve only been sitting here half an hour, and how many questions we
have settled, when you come to think of it!" said Orlov, seeing me into
the hall. "So I will see to that matter.... I will see Pekarsky
to-day.... Don''t be uneasy."

He stood waiting while I put on my coat, and was obviously relieved at
the feeling that I was going away.

The next day I got a letter from him. He congratulated me on the
satisfactory settlement of the question. Pekarsky knew a lady, he wrote,
who kept a school, something like a kindergarten, where she took quite
little children. The lady could be entirely depended upon, but before
concluding anything with her it would be as well to discuss the matter
with Krasnovsky—it was a matter of form. He advised me to see Pekarsky
at once and to take the birth certificate with me, if I had it. "Rest
assured of the sincere respect and devotion of your humble servant...."

I read this letter, and Sonya sat on the table and gazed at me
attentively without blinking, as though she knew her fate was being
decided.

IN the course of the manoeuvres the N—— cavalry regiment halted for a
night at the district town of K——. Such an event as the visit of
officers always has the most exciting and inspiring effect on the
inhabitants of provincial towns. The shopkeepers dream of getting rid of
the rusty sausages and "best brand" sardines that have been lying for
ten years on their shelves; the inns and restaurants keep open all
night; the Military Commandant, his secretary, and the local garrison
put on their best uniforms; the police flit to and fro like mad, while
the effect on the ladies is beyond all description.

The ladies of K——, hearing the regiment approaching, forsook their
pans of boiling jam and ran into the street. Forgetting their morning
deshabille and general untidiness, they rushed breathless with
excitement to meet the regiment, and listened greedily to the band
playing the march. Looking at their pale, ecstatic faces, one might have
thought those strains came from some heavenly choir rather than from a
military brass band.

What could this unknown regiment that came by chance to-day and would
depart at dawn to-morrow mean to them?

Afterwards, when the officers were standing in the middle of the square,
and, with their hands behind them, discussing the question of billets,
all the ladies were gathered together at the examining magistrate''s and
vying with one another in their criticisms of the regiment. They already
knew, goodness knows how, that the colonel was married, but not living
with his wife; that the senior officer''s wife had a baby born dead every
year; that the adjutant was hopelessly in love with some countess, and
had even once attempted suicide. They knew everything. When a
pock-marked soldier in a red shirt darted past the windows, they knew
for certain that it was Lieutenant Rymzov''s orderly running about the
town, trying to get some English bitter ale on tick for his master. They
had only caught a passing glimpse of the officers'' backs, but had
already decided that there was not one handsome or interesting man among
them.... Having talked to their hearts'' content, they sent for the
Military Commandant and the committee of the club, and instructed them
at all costs to make arrangements for a dance.

Their wishes were carried out. At nine o''clock in the evening the
military band was playing in the street before the club, while in the
club itself the officers were dancing with the ladies of K——. The
ladies felt as though they were on wings. Intoxicated by the dancing,
the music, and the clank of spurs, they threw themselves heart and soul
into making the acquaintance of their new partners, and quite forgot
their old civilian friends. Their fathers and husbands, forced
temporarily into the background, crowded round the meagre refreshment
table in the entrance hall. All these government cashiers, secretaries,
clerks, and superintendents—stale, sickly-looking, clumsy figures—were
perfectly well aware of their inferiority. They did not even enter the
ball-room, but contented themselves with watching their wives and
daughters in the distance dancing with the accomplished and graceful
officers.

Among the husbands was Shalikov, the tax-collector—a narrow, spiteful
soul, given to drink, with a big, closely cropped head, and thick,
protruding lips. He had had a university education; there had been a
time when he used to read progressive literature and sing students''
songs, but now, as he said of himself, he was a tax-collector and
nothing more.

He stood leaning against the doorpost, his eyes fixed on his wife, Anna
Pavlovna, a little brunette of thirty, with a long nose and a pointed
chin. Tightly laced, with her face carefully powdered, she danced
without pausing for breath—danced till she was ready to drop exhausted.
But though she was exhausted in body, her spirit was inexhaustible....
One could see as she danced that her thoughts were with the past, that
faraway past when she used to dance at the "College for Young Ladies,"
dreaming of a life of luxury and gaiety, and never doubting that her
husband was to be a prince or, at the worst, a baron.

It was not jealousy he was feeling. He was ill-humoured—first, because
the room was taken up with dancing and there was nowhere he could play a
game of cards; secondly, because he could not endure the sound of wind
instruments; and, thirdly, because he fancied the officers treated the
civilians somewhat too casually and disdainfully. But what above
everything revolted him and moved him to indignation was the expression
of happiness on his wife''s face.

"It makes me sick to look at her!" he muttered. "Going on for forty, and
nothing to boast of at any time, and she must powder her face and lace
herself up! And frizzing her hair! Flirting and making faces, and
fancying she''s doing the thing in style! Ugh! you''re a pretty figure,
upon my soul!"

"We are at a discount now.... We''re clumsy seals, unpolished provincial
bears, and she''s the queen of the ball! She has kept enough of her looks
to please even officers ... They''d not object to making love to her, I
dare say!"

During the mazurka the tax-collector''s face twitched with spite. A
black-haired officer with prominent eyes and Tartar cheekbones danced
the mazurka with Anna Pavlovna. Assuming a stern expression, he worked
his legs with gravity and feeling, and so crooked his knees that he
looked like a jack-a-dandy pulled by strings, while Anna Pavlovna, pale
and thrilled, bending her figure languidly and turning her eyes up,
tried to look as though she scarcely touched the floor, and evidently
felt herself that she was not on earth, not at the local club, but
somewhere far, far away—in the clouds. Not only her face but her whole
figure was expressive of beatitude.... The tax-collector could endure it
no longer; he felt a desire to jeer at that beatitude, to make Anna
Pavlovna feel that she had forgotten herself, that life was by no means
so delightful as she fancied now in her excitement....

"You wait; I''ll teach you to smile so blissfully," he muttered. "You are
not a boarding-school miss, you are not a girl. An old fright ought to
realise she is a fright!"

Petty feelings of envy, vexation, wounded vanity, of that small,
provincial misanthropy engendered in petty officials by vodka and a
sedentary life, swarmed in his heart like mice. Waiting for the end of
the mazurka, he went into the hall and walked up to his wife. Anna
Pavlovna was sitting with her partner, and, flirting her fan and
coquettishly dropping her eyelids, was describing how she used to dance
in Petersburg (her lips were pursed up like a rosebud, and she
pronounced "at home in PÃ¼tÃ¼rsburg").

Seeing her husband standing before her, Anna Pavlovna started as though
recalling the fact that she had a husband; then she flushed all over:
she felt ashamed that she had such a sickly-looking, ill-humoured,
ordinary husband.

"Nothing has happened, but I wish you to go home at once.... I wish it;
that''s enough, and without further talk, please."

Anna Pavlovna was not afraid of her husband, but she felt ashamed on
account of her partner, who was looking at her husband with surprise and
amusement. She got up and moved a little apart with her husband.

The tax-collector saw the look of beatitude gradually vanish from his
wife''s face, saw how ashamed and miserable she was—and he felt a little
happier.

At first Anna Pavlovna refused to hear of it, then she began entreating
her husband to let her stay just another half-hour; then, without
knowing why, she began to apologise, to protest—and all in a whisper,
with a smile, that the spectators might not suspect that she was having
a tiff with her husband. She began assuring him she would not stay long,
only another ten minutes, only five minutes; but the tax-collector stuck
obstinately to his point.

And as she talked to her husband Anna Pavlovna looked thinner, older,
plainer. Pale, biting her lips, and almost crying, she went out to the
entry and began putting on her things.

Coming out of the club, the husband and wife walked all the way home in
silence. The tax-collector walked behind his wife, and watching her
downcast, sorrowful, humiliated little figure, he recalled the look of
beatitude which had so irritated him at the club, and the consciousness
that the beatitude was gone filled his soul with triumph. He was pleased
and satisfied, and at the same time he felt the lack of something; he
would have liked to go back to the club and make every one feel dreary
and miserable, so that all might know how stale and worthless life is
when you walk along the streets in the dark and hear the slush of the
mud under your feet, and when you know that you will wake up next
morning with nothing to look forward to but vodka and cards. Oh, how
awful it is!

And Anna Pavlovna could scarcely walk.... She was still under the
influence of the dancing, the music, the talk, the lights, and the
noise; she asked herself as she walked along why God had thus afflicted
her. She felt miserable, insulted, and choking with hate as she listened
to her husband''s heavy footsteps. She was silent, trying to think of the
most offensive, biting, and venomous word she could hurl at her husband,
and at the same time she was fully aware that no word could penetrate
her tax-collector''s hide. What did he care for words? Her bitterest
enemy could not have contrived for her a more helpless position.

And meanwhile the band was playing and the darkness was full of the most
rousing, intoxicating dance-tunes.' WHERE id = 'cbd83e9f-3d67-42b4-b9b7-2f43b116e644';
