"I have noticed it for a long time ... and father has noticed it," she
said, trying to suppress her sobs. "You talk to yourself, smile somehow
strangely ... and can''t sleep. Oh, my God, my God, save us!" she said in
terror. "But don''t be frightened, Andryusha; for God''s sake don''t be
frightened...."

She began dressing, too. Only now, looking at her, Kovrin realised the
danger of his position—realised the meaning of the black monk and his
conversations with him. It was clear to him now that he was mad.

Neither of them knew why they dressed and went into the dining-room: she
in front and he following her. There they found Yegor Semyonitch
standing in his dressing-gown and with a candle in his hand. He was
staying with them, and had been awakened by Tanya''s sobs.

"Don''t be frightened, Andryusha," Tanya was saying, shivering as though
in a fever; "don''t be frightened.... Father, it will all pass over ...
it will all pass over...."

Kovrin was too much agitated to speak. He wanted to say to his
father-in-law in a playful tone: "Congratulate me; it appears I have
gone out of my mind"; but he could only move his lips and smile
bitterly.

At nine o''clock in the morning they put on his jacket and fur coat,
wrapped him up in a shawl, and took him in a carriage to a doctor.

Summer had come again, and the doctor advised their going into the
country. Kovrin had recovered; he had left off seeing the black monk,
and he had only to get up his strength. Staying at his father-in-law''s,
he drank a great deal of milk, worked for only two hours out of the
twenty-four, and neither smoked nor drank wine.

On the evening before Elijah''s Day they had an evening service in the
house. When the deacon was handing the priest the censer the immense old
room smelt like a graveyard, and Kovrin felt bored. He went out into the
garden. Without noticing the gorgeous flowers, he walked about the
garden, sat down on a seat, then strolled about the park; reaching the
river, he went down and then stood lost in thought, looking at the
water. The sullen pines with their shaggy roots, which had seen him a
year before so young, so joyful and confident, were not whispering now,
but standing mute and motionless, as though they did not recognise him.
And, indeed, his head was closely cropped, his beautiful long hair was
gone, his step was lagging, his face was fuller and paler than last
summer.

He crossed by the footbridge to the other side. Where the year before
there had been rye the oats stood, reaped, and lay in rows. The sun had
set and there was a broad stretch of glowing red on the horizon, a sign
of windy weather next day. It was still. Looking in the direction from
which the year before the black monk had first appeared, Kovrin stood
for twenty minutes, till the evening glow had begun to fade....

When, listless and dissatisfied, he returned home the service was over.
Yegor Semyonitch and Tanya were sitting on the steps of the verandah,
drinking tea. They were talking of something, but, seeing Kovrin, ceased
at once, and he concluded from their faces that their talk had been
about him.

"No, it is not time yet ..." he said, sitting down on the bottom step.
"Drink it yourself; I don''t want it."

"Yes, a great deal of good!" Kovrin laughed. "I congratulate you: I have
gained a pound in weight since Friday." He pressed his head tightly in
his hands and said miserably: "Why, why have you cured me? Preparations
of bromide, idleness, hot baths, supervision, cowardly consternation at
every mouthful, at every step—all this will reduce me at last to
idiocy. I went out of my mind, I had megalomania; but then I was
cheerful, confident, and even happy; I was interesting and original. Now
I have become more sensible and stolid, but I am just like every one
else: I am—mediocrity; I am weary of life.... Oh, how cruelly you have
treated me!... I saw hallucinations, but what harm did that do to any
one? I ask, what harm did that do any one?"

"Goodness knows what you are saying!" sighed Yegor Semyonitch. "It''s
positively wearisome to listen to it."

The presence of other people, especially Yegor Semyonitch, irritated
Kovrin now; he answered him drily, coldly, and even rudely, never looked
at him but with irony and hatred, while Yegor Semyonitch was overcome
with confusion and cleared his throat guiltily, though he was not
conscious of any fault in himself. At a loss to understand why their
charming and affectionate relations had changed so abruptly, Tanya
huddled up to her father and looked anxiously in his face; she wanted to
understand and could not understand, and all that was clear to her was
that their relations were growing worse and worse every day, that of
late her father had begun to look much older, and her husband had grown
irritable, capricious, quarrelsome and uninteresting. She could not
laugh or sing; at dinner she ate nothing; did not sleep for nights
together, expecting something awful, and was so worn out that on one
occasion she lay in a dead faint from dinner-time till evening. During
the service she thought her father was crying, and now while the three
of them were sitting together on the terrace she made an effort not to
think of it.

"How fortunate Buddha, Mahomed, and Shakespeare were that their kind
relations and doctors did not cure them of their ecstasy and their
inspiration," said Kovrin. "If Mahomed had taken bromide for his nerves,
had worked only two hours out of the twenty-four, and had drunk milk,
that remarkable man would have left no more trace after him than his
dog. Doctors and kind relations will succeed in stupefying mankind, in
making mediocrity pass for genius and in bringing civilisation to ruin.
If only you knew," Kovrin said with annoyance, "how grateful I am to
you."

He felt intense irritation, and to avoid saying too much, he got up
quickly and went into the house. It was still, and the fragrance of the
tobacco plant and the marvel of Peru floated in at the open window. The
moonlight lay in green patches on the floor and on the piano in the big
dark dining-room. Kovrin remembered the raptures of the previous summer
when there had been the same scent of the marvel of Peru and the moon
had shone in at the window. To bring back the mood of last year he went
quickly to his study, lighted a strong cigar, and told the footman to
bring him some wine. But the cigar left a bitter and disgusting taste in
his mouth, and the wine had not the same flavour as it had the year
before. And so great is the effect of giving up a habit, the cigar and
the two gulps of wine made him giddy, and brought on palpitations of the
heart, so that he was obliged to take bromide.

"Father adores you. You are cross with him about something, and it is
killing him. Look at him; he is ageing, not from day to day, but from
hour to hour. I entreat you, Andryusha, for God''s sake, for the sake of
your dead father, for the sake of my peace of mind, be affectionate to
him."

"Because he is antipathetic to me, that''s all," said Kovrin carelessly;
and he shrugged his shoulders. "But we won''t talk about him: he is your
father."

"I can''t understand, I can''t," said Tanya, pressing her hands to her
temples and staring at a fixed point. "Something incomprehensible,
awful, is going on in the house. You have changed, grown unlike
yourself.... You, clever, extraordinary man as you are, are irritated
over trifles, meddle in paltry nonsense.... Such trivial things excite
you, that sometimes one is simply amazed and can''t believe that it is
you. Come, come, don''t be angry, don''t be angry," she went on, kissing
his hands, frightened of her own words. "You are clever, kind, noble.
You will be just to father. He is so good."

"He is not good; he is just good-natured. Burlesque old uncles like your
father, with well-fed, good-natured faces, extraordinarily hospitable
and queer, at one time used to touch me and amuse me in novels and in
farces and in life; now I dislike them. They are egoists to the marrow
of their bones. What disgusts me most of all is their being so well-fed,
and that purely bovine, purely hoggish optimism of a full stomach."

"This is torture," she said, and from her voice it was evident that she
was utterly exhausted, and that it was hard for her to speak. "Not one
moment of peace since the winter.... Why, it''s awful! My God! I am
wretched."

His face seemed to Tanya ugly and unpleasant. Hatred and an ironical
expression did not suit him. And, indeed, she had noticed before that
there was something lacking in his face, as though ever since his hair
had been cut his face had changed, too. She wanted to say something
wounding to him, but immediately she caught herself in this antagonistic
feeling, she was frightened and went out of the bedroom.

Kovrin received a professorship at the University. The inaugural address
was fixed for the second of December, and a notice to that effect was
hung up in the corridor at the University. But on the day appointed he
informed the students'' inspector, by telegram, that he was prevented by
illness from giving the lecture.

He had hÃ¦morrhage from the throat. He was often spitting blood, but it
happened two or three times a month that there was a considerable loss
of blood, and then he grew extremely weak and sank into a drowsy
condition. This illness did not particularly frighten him, as he knew
that his mother had lived for ten years or longer suffering from the
same disease, and the doctors assured him that there was no danger, and
had only advised him to avoid excitement, to lead a regular life, and to
speak as little as possible.

In January again his lecture did not take place owing to the same
reason, and in February it was too late to begin the course. It had to
be postponed to the following year.

By now he was living not with Tanya, but with another woman, who was two
years older than he was, and who looked after him as though he were a
baby. He was in a calm and tranquil state of mind; he readily gave in to
her, and when Varvara Nikolaevna—that was the name of his
friend—decided to take him to the Crimea, he agreed, though he had a
presentiment that no good would come of the trip.

They reached Sevastopol in the evening and stopped at an hotel to rest
and go on the next day to Yalta. They were both exhausted by the
journey. Varvara Nikolaevna had some tea, went to bed and was soon
asleep. But Kovrin did not go to bed. An hour before starting for the
station, he had received a letter from Tanya, and had not brought
himself to open it, and now it was lying in his coat pocket, and the
thought of it excited him disagreeably. At the bottom of his heart he
genuinely considered now that his marriage to Tanya had been a mistake.
He was glad that their separation was final, and the thought of that
woman who in the end had turned into a living relic, still walking about
though everything seemed dead in her except her big, staring,
intelligent eyes—the thought of her roused in him nothing but pity and
disgust with himself. The handwriting on the envelope reminded him how
cruel and unjust he had been two years before, how he had worked off his
anger at his spiritual emptiness, his boredom, his loneliness, and his
dissatisfaction with life by revenging himself on people in no way to
blame. He remembered, also, how he had torn up his dissertation and all
the articles he had written during his illness, and how he had thrown
them out of window, and the bits of paper had fluttered in the wind and
caught on the trees and flowers. In every line of them he saw strange,
utterly groundless pretension, shallow defiance, arrogance, megalomania;
and they made him feel as though he were reading a description of his
vices. But when the last manuscript had been torn up and sent flying out
of window, he felt, for some reason, suddenly bitter and angry; he went
to his wife and said a great many unpleasant things to her. My God, how
he had tormented her! One day, wanting to cause her pain, he told her
that her father had played a very unattractive part in their romance,
that he had asked him to marry her. Yegor Semyonitch accidentally
overheard this, ran into the room, and, in his despair, could not utter
a word, could only stamp and make a strange, bellowing sound as though
he had lost the power of speech, and Tanya, looking at her father, had
uttered a heart-rending shriek and had fallen into a swoon. It was
hideous.

All this came back into his memory as he looked at the familiar writing.
Kovrin went out on to the balcony; it was still warm weather and there
was a smell of the sea. The wonderful bay reflected the moonshine and
the lights, and was of a colour for which it was difficult to find a
name. It was a soft and tender blending of dark blue and green; in
places the water was like blue vitriol, and in places it seemed as
though the moonlight were liquefied and filling the bay instead of
water. And what harmony of colours, what an atmosphere of peace, calm,
and sublimity!

In the lower storey under the balcony the windows were probably open,
for women''s voices and laughter could be heard distinctly. Apparently
there was an evening party.

"My father is just dead. I owe that to you, for you have killed him. Our
garden is being ruined; strangers are managing it already—that is, the
very thing is happening that poor father dreaded. That, too, I owe to
you. I hate you with my whole soul, and I hope you may soon perish. Oh,
how wretched I am! Insufferable anguish is burning my soul.... My curses
on you. I took you for an extraordinary man, a genius; I loved you, and
you have turned out a madman...."

Kovrin could read no more, he tore up the letter and threw it away. He
was overcome by an uneasiness that was akin to terror. Varvara
Nikolaevna was asleep behind the screen, and he could hear her
breathing. From the lower storey came the sounds of laughter and women''s
voices, but he felt as though in the whole hotel there were no living
soul but him. Because Tanya, unhappy, broken by sorrow, had cursed him
in her letter and hoped for his perdition, he felt eerie and kept
glancing hurriedly at the door, as though he were afraid that the
uncomprehended force which two years before had wrought such havoc in
his life and in the life of those near him might come into the room and
master him once more.

He knew by experience that when his nerves were out of hand the best
thing for him to do was to work. He must sit down to the table and force
himself, at all costs, to concentrate his mind on some one thought. He
took from his red portfolio a manuscript containing a sketch of a small
work of the nature of a compilation, which he had planned in case he
should find it dull in the Crimea without work. He sat down to the table
and began working at this plan, and it seemed to him that his calm,
peaceful, indifferent mood was coming back. The manuscript with the
sketch even led him to meditation on the vanity of the world. He thought
how much life exacts for the worthless or very commonplace blessings it
can give a man. For instance, to gain, before forty, a university chair,
to be an ordinary professor, to expound ordinary and second-hand
thoughts in dull, heavy, insipid language—in fact, to gain the position
of a mediocre learned man, he, Kovrin, had had to study for fifteen
years, to work day and night, to endure a terrible mental illness, to
experience an unhappy marriage, and to do a great number of stupid and
unjust things which it would have been pleasant not to remember. Kovrin
recognised clearly, now, that he was a mediocrity, and readily resigned
himself to it, as he considered that every man ought to be satisfied
with what he is.

The plan of the volume would have soothed him completely, but the torn
letter showed white on the floor and prevented him from concentrating
his attention. He got up from the table, picked up the pieces of the
letter and threw them out of window, but there was a light wind blowing
from the sea, and the bits of paper were scattered on the windowsill.
Again he was overcome by uneasiness akin to terror, and he felt as
though in the whole hotel there were no living soul but himself.... He
went out on the balcony. The bay, like a living thing, looked at him
with its multitude of light blue, dark blue, turquoise and fiery eyes,
and seemed beckoning to him. And it really was hot and oppressive, and
it would not have been amiss to have a bathe.

Suddenly in the lower storey under the balcony a violin began playing,
and two soft feminine voices began singing. It was something familiar.
The song was about a maiden, full of sick fancies, who heard one night
in her garden mysterious sounds, so strange and lovely that she was
obliged to recognise them as a holy harmony which is unintelligible to
us mortals, and so flies back to heaven.... Kovrin caught his breath and
there was a pang of sadness at his heart, and a thrill of the sweet,
exquisite delight he had so long forgotten began to stir in his breast.

A tall black column, like a whirlwind or a waterspout, appeared on the
further side of the bay. It moved with fearful rapidity across the bay,
towards the hotel, growing smaller and darker as it came, and Kovrin
only just had time to get out of the way to let it pass.... The monk
with bare grey head, black eyebrows, barefoot, his arms crossed over his
breast, floated by him, and stood still in the middle of the room.

"Why did you not believe me?" he asked reproachfully, looking
affectionately at Kovrin. "If you had believed me then, that you were a
genius, you would not have spent these two years so gloomily and so
wretchedly."

Kovrin already believed that he was one of God''s chosen and a genius; he
vividly recalled his conversations with the monk in the past and tried
to speak, but the blood flowed from his throat on to his breast, and not
knowing what he was doing, he passed his hands over his breast, and his
cuffs were soaked with blood. He tried to call Varvara Nikolaevna, who
was asleep behind the screen; he made an effort and said:

He called Tanya, called to the great garden with the gorgeous flowers
sprinkled with dew, called to the park, the pines with their shaggy
roots, the rye-field, his marvellous learning, his youth, courage,
joy—called to life, which was so lovely. He saw on the floor near his
face a great pool of blood, and was too weak to utter a word, but an
unspeakable, infinite happiness flooded his whole being. Below, under
the balcony, they were playing the serenade, and the black monk
whispered to him that he was a genius, and that he was dying only
because his frail human body had lost its balance and could no longer
serve as the mortal garb of genius.

When Varvara Nikolaevna woke up and came out from behind the screen,
Kovrin was dead, and a blissful smile was set upon his face.

AT five o''clock one Sunday afternoon in summer, Volodya, a plain, shy,
sickly-looking lad of seventeen, was sitting in the arbour of the
Shumihins'' country villa, feeling dreary. His despondent thought flowed
in three directions. In the first place, he had next day, Monday, an
examination in mathematics; he knew that if he did not get through the
written examination on the morrow, he would be expelled, for he had
already been two years in the sixth form and had two and three-quarter
marks for algebra in his annual report. In the second place, his
presence at the villa of the Shumihins, a wealthy family with
aristocratic pretensions, was a continual source of mortification to his
amour-propre. It seemed to him that Madame Shumihin looked upon him
and his maman as poor relations and dependents, that they laughed at his
maman and did not respect her. He had on one occasion accidently
overheard Madame Shumihin, in the verandah, telling her cousin Anna
Fyodorovna that his maman still tried to look young and got herself
up, that she never paid her losses at cards, and had a partiality for
other people''s shoes and tobacco. Every day Volodya besought his maman
not to go to the Shumihins'', and drew a picture of the humiliating part
she played with these gentlefolk. He tried to persuade her, said rude
things, but she—a frivolous, pampered woman, who had run through two
fortunes, her own and her husband''s, in her time, and always gravitated
towards acquaintances of high rank—did not understand him, and twice a
week Volodya had to accompany her to the villa he hated.

In the third place, the youth could not for one instant get rid of a
strange, unpleasant feeling which was absolutely new to him.... It
seemed to him that he was in love with Anna Fyodorovna, the Shumihins''
cousin, who was staying with them. She was a vivacious, loud-voiced,
laughter-loving, healthy, and vigorous lady of thirty, with rosy cheeks,
plump shoulders, a plump round chin and a continual smile on her thin
lips. She was neither young nor beautiful—Volodya knew that perfectly
well; but for some reason he could not help thinking of her, looking at
her while she shrugged her plump shoulders and moved her flat back as
she played croquet, or after prolonged laughter and running up and down
stairs, sank into a low chair, and, half closing her eyes and gasping
for breath, pretended that she was stifling and could not breathe. She
was married. Her husband, a staid and dignified architect, came once a
week to the villa, slept soundly, and returned to town. Volodya''s
strange feeling had begun with his conceiving an unaccountable hatred
for the architect, and feeling relieved every time he went back to town.

Now, sitting in the arbour, thinking of his examination next day, and of
his maman, at whom they laughed, he felt an intense desire to see
Nyuta (that was what the Shumihins called Anna Fyodorovna), to hear her
laughter and the rustle of her dress.... This desire was not like the
pure, poetic love of which he read in novels and about which he dreamed
every night when he went to bed; it was strange, incomprehensible; he
was ashamed of it, and afraid of it as of something very wrong and
impure, something which it was disagreeable to confess even to himself.

"It''s not love," he said to himself. "One can''t fall in love with women
of thirty who are married. It is only a little intrigue.... Yes, an
intrigue...."

Pondering on the "intrigue," he thought of his uncontrollable shyness,
his lack of moustache, his freckles, his narrow eyes, and put himself in
his imagination side by side with Nyuta, and the juxtaposition seemed to
him impossible; then he made haste to imagine himself bold, handsome,
witty, dressed in the latest fashion.

When his dreams were at their height, as he sat huddled together and
looking at the ground in a dark corner of the arbour, he heard the sound
of light footsteps. Some one was coming slowly along the avenue. Soon
the steps stopped and something white gleamed in the entrance.

"Who is here?" asked Nyuta, going into the arbour. "Ah, it is you,
Volodya? What are you doing here? Thinking? And how can you go on
thinking, thinking, thinking?... That''s the way to go out of your mind!"

Volodya got up and looked in a dazed way at Nyuta. She had only just
come back from bathing. Over her shoulder there was hanging a sheet and
a rough towel, and from under the white silk kerchief on her head he
could see the wet hair sticking to her forehead. There was the cool damp
smell of the bath-house and of almond soap still hanging about her. She
was out of breath from running quickly. The top button of her blouse was
undone, so that the boy saw her throat and bosom.

"Why don''t you say something?" said Nyuta, looking Volodya up and down.
"It''s not polite to be silent when a lady talks to you. What a clumsy
seal you are though, Volodya! You always sit, saying nothing, thinking
like some philosopher. There''s not a spark of life or fire in you! You
are really horrid!... At your age you ought to be living, skipping, and
jumping, chattering, flirting, falling in love."

"He''s mute," said Nyuta, with wonder; "it is strange, really.... Listen!
Be a man! Come, you might smile at least! Phew, the horrid philosopher!"
she laughed. "But do you know, Volodya, why you are such a clumsy seal?
Because you don''t devote yourself to the ladies. Why don''t you? It''s
true there are no girls here, but there is nothing to prevent your
flirting with the married ladies! Why don''t you flirt with me, for
instance?"

"It''s only very proud people who are silent and love solitude," Nyuta
went on, pulling his hand away from his forehead. "You are proud,
Volodya. Why do you look at me like that from under your brows? Look me
straight in the face, if you please! Yes, now then, clumsy seal!"

Volodya made up his mind to speak. Wanting to smile, he twitched his
lower lip, blinked, and again put his hand to his forehead.

"What do I hear?" she sang, as prima-donnas sing at the opera when they
hear something awful. "What? What did you say? Say it again, say it
again...."

And without his will''s having any part in his action, without reflection
or understanding, he took half a step towards Nyuta and clutched her by
the arm. Everything was dark before his eyes, and tears came into them.
The whole world was turned into one big, rough towel which smelt of the
bathhouse.

Seeing that he was not prevented from holding her arm, Volodya glanced
at Nyuta''s laughing face, and clumsily, awkwardly, put both arms round
her waist, his hands meeting behind her back. He held her round the
waist with both arms, while, putting her hands up to her head, showing
the dimples in her elbows, she set her hair straight under the kerchief
and said in a calm voice:

"You must be tactful, polite, charming, and you can only become that
under feminine influence. But what a wicked, angry face you have! You
must talk, laugh.... Yes, Volodya, don''t be surly; you are young and
will have plenty of time for philosophising. Come, let go of me; I am
going. Let go."

Without effort she released her waist, and, humming something, walked
out of the arbour. Volodya was left alone. He smoothed his hair, smiled,
and walked three times to and fro across the arbour, then he sat down on
the bench and smiled again. He felt insufferably ashamed, so much so
that he wondered that human shame could reach such a pitch of acuteness
and intensity. Shame made him smile, gesticulate, and whisper some
disconnected words.

He was ashamed that he had been treated like a small boy, ashamed of his
shyness, and, most of all, that he had had the audacity to put his arms
round the waist of a respectable married woman, though, as it seemed to
him, he had neither through age nor by external quality, nor by social
position any right to do so.

He jumped up, went out of the arbour, and, without looking round, walked
into the recesses of the garden furthest from the house.

"Ah! only to get away from here as soon as possible," he thought,
clutching his head. "My God! as soon as possible."

The train by which Volodya was to go back with his maman was at
eight-forty. There were three hours before the train started, but he
would with pleasure have gone to the station at once without waiting for
his maman.

At eight o''clock he went to the house. His whole figure was expressive
of determination: what would be, would be! He made up his mind to go in
boldly, to look them straight in the face, to speak in a loud voice,
regardless of everything.

He crossed the terrace, the big hall and the drawing-room, and there
stopped to take breath. He could hear them in the dining-room, drinking
tea. Madame Shumihin, maman, and Nyuta were talking and laughing about
something.

"I assure you!" said Nyuta. "I could not believe my eyes! When he began
declaring his passion and—just imagine!—put his arms round my waist, I
should not have recognised him. And you know he has a way with him! When
he told me he was in love with me, there was something brutal in his
face, like a Circassian."

"Really!" gasped maman, going off into a peal of laughter. "Really!
How he does remind me of his father!"

"How could they talk of it aloud!" he wondered in agony, clasping his
hands and looking up to the sky in horror. "They talk aloud in cold
blood ... and maman laughed!... Maman! My God, why didst Thou give
me such a mother? Why?"

But he had to go to the house, come what might. He walked three times up
and down the avenue, grew a little calmer, and went into the house.

"I am sorry, it''s ... it''s time for me to go," he muttered, not raising
his eyes. "Maman, it''s eight o''clock!"

"You go alone, my dear," said his maman languidly. "I am staying the
night with Lili. Goodbye, my dear.... Let me make the sign of the cross
over you."

Saying good-bye after a fashion, without looking any one in the face,
Volodya went out of the dining-room. Ten minutes later he was walking
along the road to the station, and was glad of it. Now he felt neither
frightened nor ashamed; he breathed freely and easily.

About half a mile from the station, he sat down on a stone by the side
of the road, and gazed at the sun, which was half hidden behind a
barrow. There were lights already here and there at the station, and one
green light glimmered dimly, but the train was not yet in sight. It was
pleasant to Volodya to sit still without moving, and to watch the
evening coming little by little. The darkness of the arbour, the
footsteps, the smell of the bath-house, the laughter, and the waist—all
these rose with amazing vividness before his imagination, and all this
was no longer so terrible and important as before.

"It''s of no consequence.... She did not pull her hand away, and laughed
when I held her by the waist," he thought. "So she must have liked it.
If she had disliked it she would have been angry...."

And now Volodya felt sorry that he had not had more boldness there in
the arbour. He felt sorry that he was so stupidly going away, and he was
by now persuaded that if the same thing happened again he would be
bolder and look at it more simply.

And it would not be difficult for the opportunity to occur again. They
used to stroll about for a long time after supper at the Shumihins''. If
Volodya went for a walk with Nyuta in the dark garden, there would be an
opportunity!

"I will go back," he thought, "and will go by the morning train
to-morrow.... I will say I have missed the train."

And he turned back.... Madame Shumihin, Maman, Nyuta, and one of the
nieces were sitting on the verandah, playing vint. When Volodya told
them the lie that he had missed the train, they were uneasy that he
might be late for the examination day, and advised him to get up early.
All the while they were playing he sat on one side, greedily watching
Nyuta and waiting.... He already had a plan prepared in his mind: he
would go up to Nyuta in the dark, would take her by the hand, then would
embrace her; there would be no need to say anything, as both of them
would understand without words.

But after supper the ladies did not go for a walk in the garden, but
went on playing cards. They played till one o''clock at night, and then
broke up to go to bed.

"How stupid it all is!" Volodya thought with vexation as he got into
bed. "But never mind; I''ll wait till to-morrow ... to-morrow in the
arbour. It doesn''t matter...."

He did not attempt to go to sleep, but sat in bed, hugging his knees and
thinking. All thought of the examination was hateful to him. He had
already made up his mind that they would expel him, and that there was
nothing terrible about his being expelled. On the contrary, it was a
good thing—a very good thing, in fact. Next day he would be as free as
a bird; he would put on ordinary clothes instead of his school uniform,
would smoke openly, come out here, and make love to Nyuta when he liked;
and he would not be a schoolboy but "a young man." And as for the rest
of it, what is called a career, a future, that was clear; Volodya would
go into the army or the telegraph service, or he would go into a
chemist''s shop and work his way up till he was a dispenser.... There
were lots of callings. An hour or two passed, and he was still sitting
and thinking....

Towards three o''clock, when it was beginning to get light, the door
creaked cautiously and his maman came into the room.

"Aren''t you asleep?" she asked, yawning. "Go to sleep; I have only come
in for a minute.... I am only fetching the drops...."

She took a bottle of something out of the cupboard, went to the window,
read the label, and went away.

"Marya Leontyevna, those are not the drops!" Volodya heard a woman''s
voice, a minute later. "That''s convallaria, and Lili wants morphine. Is
your son asleep? Ask him to look for it...."

It was Nyuta''s voice. Volodya turned cold. He hurriedly put on his
trousers, flung his coat over his shoulders, and went to the door.

"Do you understand? Morphine," Nyuta explained in a whisper. "There must
be a label in Latin. Wake Volodya; he will find it."

Maman opened the door and Volodya caught sight of Nyuta. She was
wearing the same loose wrapper in which she had gone to bathe. Her hair
hung loose and disordered on her shoulders, her face looked sleepy and
dark in the half-light....

"Why, Volodya is not asleep," she said. "Volodya, look in the cupboard
for the morphine, there''s a dear! What a nuisance Lili is! She has
always something the matter."

Volodya went to the cupboard, knelt down, and began looking through the
bottles and boxes of medicine. His hands were trembling, and he had a
feeling in his chest and stomach as though cold waves were running all
over his inside. He felt suffocated and giddy from the smell of ether,
carbolic acid, and various drugs, which he quite unnecessarily snatched
up with his trembling fingers and spilled in so doing.

"In a minute.... Here, I believe this is morphine," said Volodya,
reading on one of the labels the word "morph...." "Here it is!"

Nyuta was standing in the doorway in such a way that one foot was in his
room and one was in the passage. She was tidying her hair, which was
difficult to put in order because it was so thick and long, and looked
absent-mindedly at Volodya. In her loose wrap, with her sleepy face and
her hair down, in the dim light that came into the white sky not yet lit
by the sun, she seemed to Volodya captivating, magnificent....
Fascinated, trembling all over, and remembering with relish how he had
held that exquisite body in his arms in the arbour, he handed her the
bottle and said:

He was silent and looked at her, then, just as in the arbour, he took
her hand, and she looked at him with a smile and waited for what would
happen next.

"Wait a little; I think somebody is coming. Oh, these schoolboys!" she
said in an undertone, going to the door and peeping out into the
passage. "No, there is no one to be seen...."

Then it seemed to Volodya that the room, Nyuta, the sunrise and
himself—all melted together in one sensation of acute, extraordinary,
incredible bliss, for which one might give up one''s whole life and face
eternal torments.... But half a minute passed and all that vanished.
Volodya saw only a fat, plain face, distorted by an expression of
repulsion, and he himself suddenly felt a loathing for what had
happened.

"I must go away, though," said Nyuta, looking at Volodya with disgust.
"What a wretched, ugly ... fie, ugly duckling!"

"''Ugly duckling'' ..." he thought after she had gone away. "I really am
ugly ... everything is ugly."

The sun was rising, the birds were singing loudly; he could hear the
gardener walking in the garden and the creaking of his wheelbarrow ...
and soon afterwards he heard the lowing of the cows and the sounds of
the shepherd''s pipe. The sunlight and the sounds told him that somewhere
in this world there is a pure, refined, poetical life. But where was it?
Volodya had never heard a word of it from his maman or any of the
people round about him.

Combing his hair before the looking-glass, and looking at his ugly face,
pale from his sleepless night, he thought:

Madame Shumihin and Nyuta waked up at one o''clock. Volodya heard Madame
Shumihin open her window with a bang, heard Nyuta go off into a peal of
laughter in reply to her coarse voice. He saw the door open and a string
of nieces and other toadies (among the latter was his maman) file into
lunch, caught a glimpse of Nyuta''s freshly washed laughing face, and,
beside her, the black brows and beard of her husband the architect, who
had just arrived.

Nyuta was wearing a Little Russian dress which did not suit her at all,
and made her look clumsy; the architect was making dull and vulgar
jokes. The rissoles served at lunch had too much onion in them—so it
seemed to Volodya. It also seemed to him that Nyuta laughed loudly on
purpose, and kept glancing in his direction to give him to understand
that the memory of the night did not trouble her in the least, and that
she was not aware of the presence at table of the "ugly duckling."

At four o''clock Volodya drove to the station with his maman. Foul
memories, the sleepless night, the prospect of expulsion from school,
the stings of conscience—all roused in him now an oppressive, gloomy
anger. He looked at maman''s sharp profile, at her little nose, and at
the raincoat which was a present from Nyuta, and muttered:

"Why do you powder? It''s not becoming at your age! You make yourself up,
don''t pay your debts at cards, smoke other people''s tobacco.... It''s
hateful! I don''t love you ... I don''t love you!"

He was insulting her, and she moved her little eyes about in alarm,
flung up her hands, and whispered in horror:

"What are you saying, my dear! Good gracious! the coachman will hear! Be
quiet or the coachman will hear! He can overhear everything."

"I don''t love you ... I don''t love you!" he went on breathlessly.
"You''ve no soul and no morals.... Don''t dare to wear that raincoat! Do
you hear? Or else I will tear it into rags...."

"And where is my father''s fortune? Where is your money? You have wasted
it all. I am not ashamed of being poor, but I am ashamed of having such
a mother.... When my schoolfellows ask questions about you, I always
blush."

In the train they had to pass two stations before they reached the town.
Volodya spent all the time on the little platform between two carriages
and shivered all over. He did not want to go into the compartment
because there the mother he hated was sitting. He hated himself, hated
the ticket collectors, the smoke from the engine, the cold to which he
attributed his shivering. And the heavier the weight on his heart, the
more strongly he felt that somewhere in the world, among some people,
there was a pure, honourable, warm, refined life, full of love,
affection, gaiety, and serenity.... He felt this and was so intensely
miserable that one of the passengers, after looking in his face
attentively, actually asked:

In the town maman and Volodya lived with Marya Petrovna, a lady of
noble rank, who had a large flat and let rooms to boarders. Maman had
two rooms, one with windows and two pictures in gold frames hanging on
the walls, in which her bed stood and in which she lived, and a little
dark room opening out of it in which Volodya lived. Here there was a
sofa on which he slept, and, except that sofa, there was no other
furniture; the rest of the room was entirely filled up with wicker
baskets full of clothes, cardboard hat-boxes, and all sorts of rubbish,
which maman preserved for some reason or other. Volodya prepared his
lessons either in his mother''s room or in the "general room," as the
large room in which the boarders assembled at dinner-time and in the
evening was called.

On reaching home he lay down on his sofa and put the quilt over him to
stop his shivering. The cardboard hat-boxes, the wicker baskets, and the
other rubbish, reminded him that he had not a room of his own, that he
had no refuge in which he could get away from his mother, from her
visitors, and from the voices that were floating up from the "general
room." The satchel and the books lying about in the corners reminded him
of the examination he had missed.... For some reason there came into his
mind, quite inappropriately, Mentone, where he had lived with his father
when he was seven years old; he thought of Biarritz and two little
English girls with whom he ran about on the sand.... He tried to recall
to his memory the colour of the sky, the sea, the height of the waves,
and his mood at the time, but he could not succeed. The English girls
flitted before his imagination as though they were living; all the rest
was a medley of images that floated away in confusion....

"No; it''s cold here," thought Volodya. He got up, put on his overcoat,
and went into the "general room."

There they were drinking tea. There were three people at the samovar:
maman; an old lady with tortoiseshell pince-nez, who gave music
lessons; and Avgustin Mihalitch, an elderly and very stout Frenchman,
who was employed at a perfumery factory.

"Oh, that''s of no consequence," said the Frenchman, with a broad smile.
"I will go for some bread myself at once. Oh, it''s nothing."

He laid his strong, pungent cigar in a conspicuous place, put on his hat
and went out. After he had gone away maman began telling the music
teacher how she had been staying at the Shumihins'', and how warmly they
welcomed her.

"Lili Shumihin is a relation of mine, you know," she said. "Her late
husband, General Shumihin, was a cousin of my husband. And she was a
Baroness Kolb by birth...."

He knew perfectly well that what his mother said was true; in what she
was saying about General Shumihin and about Baroness Kolb there was not
a word of lying, but nevertheless he felt that she was lying. There was
a suggestion of falsehood in her manner of speaking, in the expression
of her face, in her eyes, in everything.

"You are lying," repeated Volodya; and he brought his fist down on the
table with such force that all the crockery shook and maman''s tea was
spilt over. "Why do you talk about generals and baronesses? It''s all
lies!"

The music teacher was disconcerted, and coughed into her handkerchief,
affecting to sneeze, and maman began to cry.

He had been in the street already; he was ashamed to go to his
schoolfellows. Again, quite incongruously, he remembered the two little
English girls.... He paced up and down the "general room," and went into
Avgustin Mihalitch''s room. Here there was a strong smell of ethereal
oils and glycerine soap. On the table, in the window, and even on the
chairs, there were a number of bottles, glasses, and wineglasses
containing fluids of various colours. Volodya took up from the table a
newspaper, opened it and read the title Figaro ... There was a strong
and pleasant scent about the paper. Then he took a revolver from the
table....

"There, there! Don''t take any notice of it." The music teacher was
comforting maman in the next room. "He is young! Young people of his
age never restrain themselves. One must resign oneself to that."

"No, Yevgenya Andreyevna; he''s too spoilt," said maman in a singsong
voice. "He has no one in authority over him, and I am weak and can do
nothing. Oh, I am unhappy!"

Volodya put the muzzle of the revolver to his mouth, felt something like
a trigger or spring, and pressed it with his finger.... Then felt
something else projecting, and once more pressed it. Taking the muzzle
out of his mouth, he wiped it with the lapel of his coat, looked at the
lock. He had never in his life taken a weapon in his hand before....

Avgustin Mihalitch went into the "general room," and with a laugh began
telling them about something. Volodya put the muzzle in his mouth again,
pressed it with his teeth, and pressed something with his fingers. There
was a sound of a shot.... Something hit Volodya in the back of his head
with terrible violence, and he fell on the table with his face downwards
among the bottles and glasses. Then he saw his father, as in Mentone, in
a top-hat with a wide black band on it, wearing mourning for some lady,
suddenly seize him by both hands, and they fell headlong into a very
deep, dark pit.

THROUGH causes which it is not the time to go into in detail, I had to
enter the service of a Petersburg official called Orlov, in the capacity
of a footman. He was about five and thirty, and was called Georgy*
Ivanitch.

I entered this Orlov''s service on account of his father, a prominent
political man, whom I looked upon as a serious enemy of my cause. I
reckoned that, living with the son, I should—from the conversations I
should hear, and from the letters and papers I should find on the
table—learn every detail of the father''s plans and intentions.

As a rule at eleven o''clock in the morning the electric bell rang in my
footman''s quarters to let me know that my master was awake. When I went
into the bedroom with his polished shoes and brushed clothes, Georgy
Ivanitch would be sitting in his bed with a face that looked, not
drowsy, but rather exhausted by sleep, and he would gaze off in one
direction without any sign of satisfaction at having waked. I helped him
to dress, and he let me do it with an air of reluctance without speaking
or noticing my presence; then with his head wet with washing, smelling
of fresh scent, he used to go into the dining-room to drink his coffee.
He used to sit at the table, sipping his coffee and glancing through the
newspapers, while the maid Polya and I stood respectfully at the door
gazing at him. Two grown-up persons had to stand watching with the
gravest attention a third drinking coffee and munching rusks. It was
probably ludicrous and grotesque, but I saw nothing humiliating in
having to stand near the door, though I was quite as well born and well
educated as Orlov himself.

I was in the first stage of consumption, and was suffering from
something else, possibly even more serious than consumption. I don''t
know whether it was the effect of my illness or of an incipient change
in my philosophy of life of which I was not conscious at the time, but I
was, day by day, more possessed by a passionate, irritating longing for
ordinary everyday life. I yearned for mental tranquillity, health, fresh
air, good food. I was becoming a dreamer, and, like a dreamer, I did not
know exactly what I wanted. Sometimes I felt inclined to go into a
monastery, to sit there for days together by the window and gaze at the
trees and the fields; sometimes I fancied I would buy fifteen acres of
land and settle down as a country gentleman; sometimes I inwardly vowed
to take up science and become a professor at some provincial university.
I was a retired navy lieutenant; I dreamed of the sea, of our squadron,
and of the corvette in which I had made the cruise round the world. I
longed to experience again the indescribable feeling when, walking in
the tropical forest or looking at the sunset in the Bay of Bengal, one
is thrilled with ecstasy and at the same time homesick. I dreamed of
mountains, women, music, and, with the curiosity of a child, I looked
into people''s faces, listened to their voices. And when I stood at the
door and watched Orlov sipping his coffee, I felt not a footman, but a
man interested in everything in the world, even in Orlov.

In appearance Orlov was a typical Petersburger, with narrow shoulders, a
long waist, sunken temples, eyes of an indefinite colour, and scanty,
dingy-coloured hair, beard and moustaches. His face had a stale,
unpleasant look, though it was studiously cared for. It was particularly
unpleasant when he was asleep or lost in thought. It is not worth while
describing a quite ordinary appearance; besides, Petersburg is not
Spain, and a man''s appearance is not of much consequence even in love
affairs, and is only of value to a handsome footman or coachman. I have
spoken of Orlov''s face and hair only because there was something in his
appearance worth mentioning. When Orlov took a newspaper or book,
whatever it might be, or met people, whoever they be, an ironical smile
began to come into his eyes, and his whole countenance assumed an
expression of light mockery in which there was no malice. Before reading
or hearing anything he always had his irony in readiness, as a savage
has his shield. It was an habitual irony, like some old liquor brewed
years ago, and now it came into his face probably without any
participation of his will, as it were by reflex action. But of that
later.

Soon after midday he took his portfolio, full of papers, and drove to
his office. He dined away from home and returned after eight o''clock. I
used to light the lamp and candles in his study, and he would sit down
in a low chair with his legs stretched out on another chair, and,
reclining in that position, would begin reading. Almost every day he
brought in new books with him or received parcels of them from the
shops, and there were heaps of books in three languages, to say nothing
of Russian, which he had read and thrown away, in the corners of my room
and under my bed. He read with extraordinary rapidity. They say: "Tell
me what you read, and I''ll tell you who you are." That may be true, but
it was absolutely impossible to judge of Orlov by what he read. It was a
regular hotchpotch. Philosophy, French novels, political economy,
finance, new poets, and publications of the firm Posrednik*—and he
read it all with the same rapidity and with the same ironical expression
in his eyes.

* I.e., Tchertkov and others, publishers of Tolstoy, who issued good
literature for peasants'' reading.

After ten o''clock he carefully dressed, often in evening dress, very
rarely in his kammer-junker''s uniform, and went out, returning in the
morning.

Our relations were quiet and peaceful, and we never had any
misunderstanding. As a rule he did not notice my presence, and when he
talked to me there was no expression of irony on his face—he evidently
did not look upon me as a human being.

I only once saw him angry. One day—it was a week after I had entered
his service—he came back from some dinner at nine o''clock; his face
looked ill-humoured and exhausted. When I followed him into his study to
light the candles, he said to me:

I was offended, and was on the point of answering, and goodness knows
how it would have ended if Polya, who knew her master better than I did,
had not intervened.

"There really is a disagreeable smell," she said, raising her eyebrows.
"What can it be from? Stepan, open the pane in the drawing-room, and
light the fire."

With much bustle and many exclamations, she went through all the rooms,
rustling her skirts and squeezing the sprayer with a hissing sound. And
Orlov was still out of humour; he was obviously restraining himself not
to vent his ill-temper aloud. He was sitting at the table and rapidly
writing a letter. After writing a few lines he snorted angrily and tore
it up, then he began writing again.

"Go to Znamensky Street and deliver this letter to Zinaida Fyodorovna
Krasnovsky in person. But first ask the porter whether her husband
—that is, Mr. Krasnovsky—has returned yet. If he has returned, don''t
deliver the letter, but come back. Wait a minute!... If she asks whether
I have any one here, tell her that there have been two gentlemen here
since eight o''clock, writing something."

I drove to Znamensky Street. The porter told me that Mr. Krasnovsky had
not yet come in, and I made my way up to the third storey. The door was
opened by a tall, stout, drab-coloured flunkey with black whiskers, who
in a sleepy, churlish, and apathetic voice, such as only flunkeys use in
addressing other flunkeys, asked me what I wanted. Before I had time to
answer, a lady dressed in black came hurriedly into the hall. She
screwed up her eyes and looked at me.

She tore the letter open impatiently, and holding it in both hands, so
that I saw her sparkling diamond rings, she began reading. I made out a
pale face with soft lines, a prominent chin, and long dark lashes. From
her appearance I should not have judged the lady to be more than five
and twenty.

"Give him my thanks and my greetings," she said when she had finished
the letter. "Is there any one with Georgy Ivanitch?" she asked softly,
joyfully, and as though ashamed of her mistrust.

"Give him my greetings and thanks," she repeated, bending her head
sideways, and, reading the letter as she walked, she went noiselessly
out. I saw few women at that time, and this lady of whom I had a passing
glimpse made an impression on me. As I walked home I recalled her face
and the delicate fragrance about her, and fell to dreaming. By the time
I got home Orlov had gone out.

And so my relations with my employer were quiet and peaceful, but still
the unclean and degrading element which I so dreaded on becoming a
footman was conspicuous and made itself felt every day. I did not get on
with Polya. She was a well-fed and pampered hussy who adored Orlov
because he was a gentleman and despised me because I was a footman.
Probably, from the point of view of a real flunkey or cook, she was
fascinating, with her red cheeks, her turned-up nose, her coquettish
glances, and the plumpness, one might almost say fatness, of her person.
She powdered her face, coloured her lips and eyebrows, laced herself in,
and wore a bustle, and a bangle made of coins. She walked with little
ripping steps; as she walked she swayed, or, as they say, wriggled her
shoulders and back. The rustle of her skirts, the creaking of her stays,
the jingle her bangle and the vulgar smell of lip salve, toilet vinegar,
and scent stolen from her master, aroused in me whilst I was doing the
rooms with her in the morning a sensation as though I were taking part
with her in some abomination.

Either because I did not steal as she did, or because I displayed no
desire to become her lover, which she probably looked upon as an insult,
or perhaps because she felt that I was a man of a different order, she
hated me from the first day. My inexperience, my appearance—so unlike
a flunkey—and my illness, seemed to her pitiful and excited her
disgust. I had a bad cough at that time, and sometimes at night I
prevented her from sleeping, as our rooms were only divided by a wooden
partition, and every morning she said to me:

She so genuinely believed that I was hardly a human being, but something
infinitely below her, that, like the Roman matrons who were not ashamed
to bathe before their slaves, she sometimes went about in my presence in
nothing but her chemise.

Once when I was in a happy, dreamy mood, I asked her at dinner (we had
soup and roast meat sent in from a restaurant every day):

"Then," I went on, "you believe there will be a day of judgment, and
that we shall have to answer to God for every evil action?"

She gave me no reply, but simply made a contemptuous grimace, and,
looking that time at her cold eyes and over-fed expression, I realised
that for her complete and finished personality no God, no conscience, no
laws existed, and that if I had had to set fire to the house, to murder
or to rob, I could not have hired a better accomplice.

In my novel surroundings I felt very uncomfortable for the first week at
Orlov''s before I got used to being addressed as "thou," and being
constantly obliged to tell lies (saying "My master is not at home" when
he was). In my flunkey''s swallow-tail I felt as though I were in armour.
But I grew accustomed to it in time. Like a genuine footman, I waited at
table, tidied the rooms, ran and drove about on errands of all sorts.
When Orlov did not want to keep an appointment with Zinaida Fyodorovna,
or when he forgot that he had promised to go and see her, I drove to
Znamensky Street, put a letter into her hands and told a lie. And the
result of it all was quite different from what I had expected when I
became a footman. Every day of this new life of mine was wasted for me
and my cause, as Orlov never spoke of his father, nor did his visitors,
and all I could learn of the stateman''s doings was, as before, what I
could glean from the newspapers or from correspondence with my comrades.
The hundreds of notes and papers I used to find in the study and read
had not the remotest connection with what I was looking for. Orlov was
absolutely uninterested in his father''s political work, and looked as
though he had never heard of it, or as though his father had long been
dead.

I ordered a piece of roast beef from the restaurant and telephoned to
Eliseyev''s to send us caviare, cheese, oysters, and so on. I bought
playing-cards. Polya was busy all day getting ready the tea-things and
the dinner service. To tell the truth, this spurt of activity came as a
pleasant change in our idle life, and Thursdays were for us the most
interesting days.

Only three visitors used to come. The most important and perhaps the
most interesting was the one called Pekarsky—a tall, lean man of five
and forty, with a long hooked nose, with a big black beard, and a bald
patch on his head. His eyes were large and prominent, and his expression
was grave and thoughtful like that of a Greek philosopher. He was on the
board of management of some railway, and also had some post in a bank;
he was a consulting lawyer in some important Government institution, and
had business relations with a large number of private persons as a
trustee, chairman of committees, and so on. He was of quite a low grade
in the service, and modestly spoke of himself as a lawyer, but he had a
vast influence. A note or card from him was enough to make a celebrated
doctor, a director of a railway, or a great dignitary see any one
without waiting; and it was said that through his protection one might
obtain even a post of the Fourth Class, and get any sort of unpleasant
business hushed up. He was looked upon as a very intelligent man, but
his was a strange, peculiar intelligence. He was able to multiply 213 by
373 in his head instantaneously, or turn English pounds into German
marks without help of pencil or paper; he understood finance and railway
business thoroughly, and the machinery of Russian administration had no
secrets for him; he was a most skilful pleader in civil suits, and it
was not easy to get the better of him at law. But that exceptional
intelligence could not grasp many things which are understood even by
some stupid people. For instance, he was absolutely unable to understand
why people are depressed, why they weep, shoot themselves, and even kill
others; why they fret about things that do not affect them personally,
and why they laugh when they read Gogol or Shtchedrin.... Everything
abstract, everything belonging to the domain of thought and feeling, was
to him boring and incomprehensible, like music to one who has no ear. He
looked at people simply from the business point of view, and divided
them into competent and incompetent. No other classification existed for
him. Honesty and rectitude were only signs of competence. Drinking,
gambling, and debauchery were permissible, but must not be allowed to
interfere with business. Believing in God was rather stupid, but
religion ought be safeguarded, as the common people must have some
principle to restrain them, otherwise they would not work. Punishment is
only necessary as deterrent. There was no need to go away for holidays,
as it was just as nice in town. And so on. He was a widower and had no
children, but lived on a large scale, as though he had a family, and
paid three thousand roubles a year for his flat.

The second visitor, Kukushkin, an actual civil councillor though a young
man, was short, and was conspicuous for his extremely unpleasant
appearance, which was due to the disproportion between his fat, puffy
body and his lean little face. His lips were puckered up suavely, and
his little trimmed moustaches looked as though they had been fixed on
with glue. He was a man with the manners of a lizard. He did not walk,
but, as it were, crept along with tiny steps, squirming and sniggering,
and when he laughed he showed his teeth. He was a clerk on special
commissions, and did nothing, though he received a good salary,
especially in the summer, when special and lucrative jobs were found for
him. He was a man of personal ambition, not only to the marrow of his
bones, but more fundamentally—to the last drop of his blood; but even
in his ambitions he was petty and did not rely on himself, but was
building his career on the chance favour flung him by his superiors. For
the sake of obtaining some foreign decoration, or for the sake of having
his name mentioned in the newspapers as having been present at some
special service in the company of other great personages, he was ready
to submit to any kind of humiliation, to beg, to flatter, to promise. He
flattered Orlov and Pekarsky from cowardice, because he thought they
were powerful; he flattered Polya and me because we were in the service
of a powerful man. Whenever I took off his fur coat he tittered and
asked me: "Stepan, are you married?" and then unseemly vulgarities
followed—by way of showing me special attention. Kukushkin flattered
Orlov''s weaknesses, humoured his corrupted and blasÃ© ways; to please him
he affected malicious raillery and atheism, in his company criticised
persons before whom in other places he would slavishly grovel. When at
supper they talked of love and women, he pretended to be a subtle and
perverse voluptuary. As a rule, one may say, Petersburg rakes are fond
of talking of their abnormal tastes. Some young actual civil councillor
is perfectly satisfied with the embraces of his cook or of some unhappy
street-walker on the Nevsky Prospect, but to listen to him you would
think he was contaminated by all the vices of East and West combined,
that he was an honourary member of a dozen iniquitous secret societies
and was already marked by the police. Kukushkin lied about himself in an
unconscionable way, and they did not exactly disbelieve him, but paid
little heed to his incredible stories.

The third guest was Gruzin, the son of a worthy and learned general; a
man of Orlov''s age, with long hair, short-sighted eyes, and gold
spectacles. I remember his long white fingers, that looked like a
pianist''s; and, indeed, there was something of a musician, of a
virtuoso, about his whole figure. The first violins in orchestras look
just like that. He used to cough, suffered from migraine, and seemed
invalidish and delicate. Probably at home he was dressed and undressed
like a baby. He had finished at the College of Jurisprudence, and had at
first served in the Department of Justice, then he was transferred to
the Senate; he left that, and through patronage had received a post in
the Department of Crown Estates, and had soon afterwards given that up.
In my time he was serving in Orlov''s department; he was his head-clerk,
but he said that he should soon exchange into the Department of Justice
again. He took his duties and his shifting about from one post to
another with exceptional levity, and when people talked before him
seriously of grades in the service, decorations, salaries, he smiled
good-naturedly and repeated Prutkov''s aphorism: "It''s only in the
Government service you learn the truth." He had a little wife with a
wrinkled face, who was very jealous of him, and five weedy-looking
children. He was unfaithful to his wife, he was only fond of his
children when he saw them, and on the whole was rather indifferent to
his family, and made fun of them. He and his family existed on credit,
borrowing wherever they could at every opportunity, even from his
superiors in the office and porters in people''s houses. His was a flabby
nature; he was so lazy that he did not care what became of himself, and
drifted along heedless where or why he was going. He went where he was
taken. If he was taken to some low haunt, he went; if wine was set
before him, he drank—if it were not put before him, he abstained; if
wives were abused in his presence, he abused his wife, declaring she had
ruined his life—when wives were praised, he praised his and said quite
sincerely: "I am very fond of her, poor thing!" He had no fur coat and
always wore a rug which smelt of the nursery. When at supper he rolled
balls of bread and drank a great deal of red wine, absorbed in thought,
strange to say, I used to feel almost certain that there was something
in him of which perhaps he had a vague sense, though in the bustle and
vulgarity of his daily life he had not time to understand and appreciate
it. He played a little on the piano. Sometimes he would sit down at the
piano, play a chord or two, and begin singing softly:

The visitors usually arrived about ten o''clock. They played cards in
Orlov''s study, and Polya and I handed them tea. It was only on these
occasions that I could gauge the full sweetness of a flunkey''s life.
Standing for four or five hours at the door, watching that no one''s
glass should be empty, changing the ash-trays, running to the table to
pick up the chalk or a card when it was dropped, and, above all,
standing, waiting, being attentive without venturing to speak, to cough,
to smile—is harder, I assure you, is harder than the hardest of field
labour. I have stood on watch at sea for four hours at a stretch on
stormy winter nights, and to my thinking it is an infinitely easier
duty.

They used to play cards till two, sometimes till three o''clock at night,
and then, stretching, they would go into the dining-room to supper, or,
as Orlov said, for a snack of something. At supper there was
conversation. It usually began by Orlov''s speaking with laughing eyes of
some acquaintance, of some book he had lately been reading, of a new
appointment or Government scheme. Kukushkin, always ingratiating, would
fall into his tone, and what followed was to me, in my mood at that
time, a revolting exhibition. The irony of Orlov and his friends knew no
bounds, and spared no one and nothing. If they spoke of religion, it was
with irony; they spoke of philosophy, of the significance and object of
life—irony again, if any one began about the peasantry, it was with
irony.

There is in Petersburg a species of men whose specialty it is to jeer at
every aspect of life; they cannot even pass by a starving man or a
suicide without saying something vulgar. But Orlov and his friends did
not jeer or make jokes, they talked ironically. They used to say that
there was no God, and personality was completely lost at death; the
immortals only existed in the French Academy. Real good did not and
could not possibly exist, as its existence was conditional upon human
perfection, which was a logical absurdity. Russia was a country as poor
and dull as Persia. The intellectual class was hopeless; in Pekarsky''s
opinion the overwhelming majority in it were incompetent persons, good
for nothing. The people were drunken, lazy, thievish, and degenerate. We
had no science, our literature was uncouth, our commerce rested on
swindling—"No selling without cheating." And everything was in that
style, and everything was a subject for laughter.

Towards the end of supper the wine made them more good-humoured, and
they passed to more lively conversation. They laughed over Gruzin''s
family life, over Kukushkin''s conquests, or at Pekarsky, who had, they
said, in his account book one page headed Charity and another
Physiological Necessities. They said that no wife was faithful; that
there was no wife from whom one could not, with practice, obtain
caresses without leaving her drawing-room while her husband was sitting
in his study close by; that girls in their teens were perverted and knew
everything. Orlov had preserved a letter of a schoolgirl of fourteen: on
her way home from school she had "hooked an officer on the Nevsky," who
had, it appears, taken her home with him, and had only let her go late
in the evening; and she hastened to write about this to her school
friend to share her joy with her. They maintained that there was not and
never had been such a thing as moral purity, and that evidently it was
unnecessary; mankind had so far done very well without it. The harm done
by so-called vice was undoubtedly exaggerated. Vices which are punished
by our legal code had not prevented Diogenes from being a philosopher
and a teacher. CÃ¦sar and Cicero were profligates and at the same time
great men. Cato in his old age married a young girl, and yet he was
regarded as a great ascetic and a pillar of morality.

At three or four o''clock the party broke up or they went off together
out of town, or to Officers'' Street, to the house of a certain Varvara
Ossipovna, while I retired to my quarters, and was kept awake a long
while by coughing and headache.

Three weeks after I entered Orlov''s service—it was Sunday morning, I
remember—somebody rang the bell. It was not yet eleven, and Orlov was
still asleep. I went to open the door. You can imagine my astonishment
when I found a lady in a veil standing at the door on the landing.

From her voice I recognised Zinaida Fyodorovna, to whom I had taken
letters in Znamensky Street. I don''t remember whether I had time or
self-possession to answer her—I was taken aback at seeing her. And,
indeed, she did not need my answer. In a flash she had darted by me,
and, filling the hall with the fragrance of her perfume, which I
remember to this day, she went on, and her footsteps died away. For at
least half an hour afterwards I heard nothing. But again some one rang.
This time it was a smartly dressed girl, who looked like a maid in a
wealthy family, accompanied by our house porter. Both were out of
breath, carrying two trunks and a dress-basket.

And she went down without saying another word. All this was mysterious,
and made Polya, who had a deep admiration for the pranks of her betters,
smile slyly to herself; she looked as though she would like to say, "So
that''s what we''re up to," and she walked about the whole time on tiptoe.
At last we heard footsteps; Zinaida Fyodorovna came quickly into the
hall, and seeing me at the door of my room, said:

When I went in to Orlov with his clothes and his boots, he was sitting
on the bed with his feet on the bearskin rug. There was an air of
embarrassment about his whole figure. He did not notice me, and my
menial opinion did not interest him; he was evidently perturbed and
embarrassed before himself, before his inner eye. He dressed, washed,
and used his combs and brushes silently and deliberately, as though
allowing himself time to think over his position and to reflect, and
even from his back one could see he was troubled and dissatisfied with
himself.

They drank coffee together. Zinaida Fyodorovna poured out coffee for
herself and for Orlov, then she put her elbows on the table and laughed.

"I still can''t believe it," she said. "When one has been a long while on
one''s travels and reaches a hotel at last, it''s difficult to believe
that one hasn''t to go on. It is pleasant to breathe freely."

With the expression of a child who very much wants to be mischievous,
she sighed with relief and laughed again.

"You will excuse me," said Orlov, nodding towards the coffee. "Reading
at breakfast is a habit I can''t get over. But I can do two things at
once—read and listen."

"Read away.... You shall keep your habits and your freedom. But why do
you look so solemn? Are you always like that in the morning, or is it
only to-day? Aren''t you glad?"

"Why? You had plenty of time to prepare yourself for my descent upon
you. I''ve been threatening to come every day."

"I didn''t expect it myself, but that''s all the better. It''s all the
better, my dear. It''s best to have an aching tooth out and have done
with it."

"Oh, my dear," she said, closing her eyes, "all is well that ends well;
but before this happy ending, what suffering there has been! My laughing
means nothing; I am glad, I am happy, but I feel more like crying than
laughing. Yesterday I had to fight a regular battle," she went on in
French. "God alone knows how wretched I was. But I laugh because I can''t
believe in it. I keep fancying that my sitting here drinking coffee with
you is not real, but a dream."

Then, still speaking French, she described how she had broken with her
husband the day before and her eyes were alternately full of tears and
of laughter while she gazed with rapture at Orlov. She told him her
husband had long suspected her, but had avoided explanations; they had
frequent quarrels, and usually at the most heated moment he would
suddenly subside into silence and depart to his study for fear that in
his exasperation he might give utterance to his suspicions or she might
herself begin to speak openly. And she had felt guilty, worthless,
incapable of taking a bold and serious step, and that had made her hate
herself and her husband more every day, and she had suffered the
torments of hell. But the day before, when during a quarrel he had cried
out in a tearful voice, "My God, when will it end?" and had walked off
to his study, she had run after him like a cat after a mouse, and,
preventing him from shutting the door, she had cried that she hated him
with her whole soul. Then he let her come into the study and she had
told him everything, had confessed that she loved some one else, that
that some one else was her real, most lawful husband, and that she
thought it her true duty to go away to him that very day, whatever might
happen, if she were to be shot for it.

"There''s a very romantic streak in you," Orlov interrupted, keeping his
eyes fixed on the newspaper.

She laughed and went on talking without touching her coffee. Her cheeks
glowed and she was a little embarrassed by it, and she looked in
confusion at Polya and me. From what she went on to say I learnt that
her husband had answered her with threats, reproaches, and finally
tears, and that it would have been more accurate to say that she, and
not he, had been the attacking party.

"Yes, my dear, so long as I was worked up, everything went all right,"
she told Orlov; "but as night came on, my spirits sank. You don''t
believe in God, George, but I do believe a little, and I fear
retribution. God requires of us patience, magnanimity, self-sacrifice,
and here I am refusing to be patient and want to remodel my life to suit
myself. Is that right? What if from the point of view of God it''s wrong?
At two o''clock in the night my husband came to me and said: ''You dare
not go away. I''ll fetch you back through the police and make a scandal.''
And soon afterwards I saw him like a shadow at my door. ''Have mercy on
me! Your elopement may injure me in the service.'' Those words had a
coarse effect upon me and made me feel stiff all over. I felt as though
the retribution were beginning already; I began crying and trembling
with terror. I felt as though the ceiling would fall upon me, that I
should be dragged off to the police-station at once, that you would grow
cold to me—all sorts of things, in fact! I thought I would go into a
nunnery or become a nurse, and give up all thought of happiness, but
then I remembered that you loved me, and that I had no right to dispose
of myself without your knowledge; and everything in my mind was in a
tangle—I was in despair and did not know what to do or think. But the
sun rose and I grew happier. As soon as it was morning I dashed off to
you. Ah, what I''ve been through, dear one! I haven''t slept for two
nights!"

She was tired out and excited. She was sleepy, and at the same time she
wanted to talk endlessly, to laugh and to cry, and to go to a restaurant
to lunch that she might feel her freedom.

"You have a cosy flat, but I am afraid it may be small for the two of
us," she said, walking rapidly through all the rooms when they had
finished breakfast. "What room will you give me? I like this one because
it is next to your study."

At one o''clock she changed her dress in the room next to the study,
which from that time she called hers, and she went off with Orlov to
lunch. They dined, too, at a restaurant, and spent the long interval
between lunch and dinner in shopping. Till late at night I was opening
the door to messengers and errand-boys from the shops. They bought,
among other things, a splendid pier-glass, a dressing-table, a bedstead,
and a gorgeous tea service which we did not need. They bought a regular
collection of copper saucepans, which we set in a row on the shelf in
our cold, empty kitchen. As we were unpacking the tea service Polya''s
eyes gleamed, and she looked at me two or three times with hatred and
fear that I, not she, would be the first to steal one of these charming
cups. A lady''s writing-table, very expensive and inconvenient, came too.
It was evident that Zinaida Fyodorovna contemplated settling with us for
good, and meant to make the flat her home.

She came back with Orlov between nine and ten. Full of proud
consciousness that she had done something bold and out of the common,
passionately in love, and, as she imagined, passionately loved,
exhausted, looking forward to a sweet sound sleep, Zinaida Fyodorovna
was revelling in her new life. She squeezed her hands together in the
excess of her joy, declared that everything was delightful, and swore
that she would love Orlov for ever; and these vows, and the naÃ¯ve,
almost childish confidence that she too was deeply loved and would be
loved forever, made her at least five years younger. She talked charming
nonsense and laughed at herself.

"There''s no other blessing greater than freedom!" she said, forcing
herself to say something serious and edifying. "How absurd it is when
you think of it! We attach no value to our own opinion even when it is
wise, but tremble before the opinion of all sorts of stupid people. Up
to the last minute I was afraid of what other people would say, but as
soon as I followed my own instinct and made up my mind to go my own way,
my eyes were opened, I overcame my silly fears, and now I am happy and
wish every one could be as happy!"

But her thoughts immediately took another turn, and she began talking of
another flat, of wallpapers, horses, a trip to Switzerland and Italy.
Orlov was tired by the restaurants and the shops, and was still
suffering from the same uneasiness that I had noticed in the morning. He
smiled, but more from politeness than pleasure, and when she spoke of
anything seriously, he agreed ironically: "Oh, yes."

"There''s no need to be in a hurry over the kitchen arrangements," said
Orlov, looking at me coldly. "We must first move into another flat."

We had never had cooking done at home nor kept horses, because, as he
said, "he did not like disorder about him," and only put up with having
Polya and me in his flat from necessity. The so-called domestic hearth
with its everyday joys and its petty cares offended his taste as
vulgarity; to be with child, or to have children and talk about them,
was bad form, like a petty bourgeois. And I began to feel very curious
to see how these two creatures would get on together in one flat—she,
domestic and home-loving with her copper saucepans and her dreams of a
good cook and horses; and he, fond of saying to his friends that a
decent and orderly man''s flat ought, like a warship, to have nothing in
it superfluous—no women, no children, no rags, no kitchen utensils.

Then I will tell you what happened the following Thursday. That day
Zinaida Fyodorovna dined at Content''s or Donon''s. Orlov returned home
alone, and Zinaida Fyodorovna, as I learnt afterwards, went to the
Petersburg Side to spend with her old governess the time visitors were
with us. Orlov did not care to show her to his friends. I realised that
at breakfast, when he began assuring her that for the sake of her peace
of mind it was essential to give up his Thursday evenings.

He went in with a sly, oily look in his eyes, smiling mysteriously,
rubbing his hands, which were cold from the frost.

"I have the honour to congratulate you," he said to Orlov, shaking all
over with ingratiating, obsequious laughter. "May you increase ' WHERE id = 'cbd83e9f-3d67-42b4-b9b7-2f43b116e644';
