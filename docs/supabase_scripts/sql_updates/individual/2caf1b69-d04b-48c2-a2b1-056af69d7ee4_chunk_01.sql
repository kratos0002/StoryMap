UPDATE stories SET original_text = 'One hot June afternoon, a group of ponies with
their foals and yearlings stood on the edge of a
tableland or âplainâ in the New Forest. The
ground about them was covered with stunted
heather and fern, with here and there patches of
moss and bare white gravel showing the poverty
of the soil.

Beyond the company was a great expanse of
blue sky flecked with pinkish cloudlets, and, on
the horizon, blue and violet wooded heights, a
crinkly contour denoting oak and beech and an
evenly serrated line, plantations of firs. As
everyone who has journeyed from Southampton
to Bournemouth by road or rail knows, a great
part of the forest is open heath or moorland; but,
unlike the barren wilds of the Highlands, the New
Forest has also extensive woods full of gigantic
oaks and beeches, while the open ground in
many places is becoming choked with self-sown
firs.

Therefore, looking into the distance, the masses
of woodland largely concealed the open spaces.
Emery Down showed on the horizon, the sun fell
on the spire of Lyndhurst Church, and in the
middle distance a white curving ribbon showed
itself as a forest road, before it was lost among the
trees.

Below the ponies was a wide valley, covered
with coarse grass, and dotted with hollies, gorse
and stunted firs. The mares had chosen the
hill for their afternoon siesta because up there
were fewer flies and biting torments than down
below in the swampy bottoms, where, earlier in
the day, the ponies had been feeding. They stood
mostly in pairs, head to tail, so that the swish of
the latter drove the flies from their noses and
flanks. Once in a while, a yearlingâthat is, one
born the previous yearâfinding the sun too hot,
butted in between the mares.

The foals or âsuckersâ lay half-hidden in the
heather, wandered here and there nibbling at the
herbage, or drew nourishment from their mothers.
These varied greatly in colour and size. The
tallest was a black mare with the graceful lines of
the racehorse, as well there might be, seeing she
had some of the blood of that breed in her veins.
Next her stood an old white mare, bleached with
age, for, while the forest ponies exhibit the usual
equine diversity of hues, there are none all white.
In her prime she had been a grey, perhaps a
beautiful pearl grey with a few darker dapplings,
like her neighbour, a young mare with her first
foal, black of coat except for a white forehead
blaze and fore-foot. Close by stood, and dozed, a
chestnut mare with a mane and tail of pure gold,
or so it seemed in the sunshine. There were also
bays, with black manes and tails, but the commonest
colour in the group was a dark brown. It
was noticeable that most of the foals were darker
in colour than their mothers.

Standing by themselves were two dingy brown
ponies, a mare and a two-year-old, shorter of leg
than the other adults. Their necks showed little
of the arch of a well-shaped animalâindeed, both
ponies were almost donkey-like in shape, with
hollow backs, drooping bellies, and âcow-hockedâ
hind-legs. The mare had a beard hanging below
her chin.

Almost their exact counterpart, even to the
beard, had been set down, ages before, in the wall-paintings
and drawings scratched on bone of the
old Stone Age. These two, one might suppose,
were throw-backs to the old forest pony, which
was hunted, or possibly domesticated, by the men
whose remains were interred in the mounds dotted
over the forest. Indeed, close by stood a great
tumulus, and some way off was a group of nine
mounds, big and little, like parents and children.

Of the other ponies, several showed the
attempts at improving the breed practised of late
years. One had the short leg of the Exmoor
pony, another the tiny ear of the Shetland, others
the shapely line of the polo and even of the Arab,
for at one time or another all these, and others,
have been used as sires. In some cases the importation
threatened to improve the race off the
forest altogether. It is no land of milk and
honey, for the green pastures and lush spots are
not in themselves extensive enough to support
the stock of ponies, and only those which can
exist on the coarse tussock grass, the sweet but
prickly shoots of gorse, and the astringent
heather tufts, are sure of surviving. Also a good
proportion of the ponies stay out in the forest all
the winter; and though snow does not fall frequently
or lie long in this locality, yet the
weather is often colder than in the Shetlands,
where the little pony of the far North, his ears
buried in his shaggy mane, and a doormat-like
thatch on his back, winters without difficulty.

But here, at the other extreme of Britain, if
there come a long spell of bleak wet weather, and
especially if sharp frosts intervene, the younger
ponies are likely to suffer, and a man, seeing his
neighbourâs yearling looking âseedy,â will think
it his duty to inform the owner, who, unless careless
and improvident, will have the creature
âcaught in,â and give it shelter and food.

Perhaps the most striking in colour of the
group on the hill was a chestnut mare, of that
rich hue known as âliverâ chestnut. In the sun
her coat flashed bright orange-red, while by contrast
it appeared deep purple in the shade. Her
foal at the moment was lying in the heather, out
of sight. When at length he arose, one saw why
he could lie hidden so completely, for he was so
small and evidently had not long been born.
Compared with the other foals, which were now
well grown, though still leggy, the colt seemed
absurdly disproportioned, and with his big head,
long ears, and bent hind-legs looked, apart from
his colour, more like a fawn than a pony in the
making. His body was so meagre that it seemed
merely a connecting-link between his fore and
hind quarters. As he stood up he swayed to and
fro. His little napping tail looked exactly like
the strip of goatskin nailed on to form the tail of
those wooden steeds which were being made, not
so far away from where the ponies stood, in the
toy factory at Brockenhurst.

But the interesting thing about him was his
colour, for he was a âskewbald,â patterned
boldly in chestnut and white. Nearly all the
other foals were dark, and it was as yet almost
impossible to foretell their exact adult colour.
Alone among the youngsters, the skewbald foal
showed what his coat would be like when he was
full grown. Although so young, he possessed the
agility of young creatures which have no period
of sheltered repose, unlike fledglings in the nest,
or the young fawn hardly able to stand, and
hidden by its mother while it gathers strength.
In his way the foal was as nimble and alive as
young partridge or lapwing chicks. He trotted
to his mother, took nourishment with the curious
twisted neck characteristic of the attitude of a
foal when feeding, and relapsed from sight among
the heather.

Nearly all the mares had shaggy manes and
tails, and the hair hung down over their foreheads
so as almost to conceal their eyes. The
foals had manes standing up along their necks as
if they had been âhogged,â and their fore hair
rose in a curious tuft between their ears.

The ponies, to all appearance, were as tame
as any stable animal, and they would not have
retreated if a man had quietly approached them
or gone past at a distance of a few yards; unless,
of course, he had used a binocular or camera,
when the flash of light from glass or metal would
have caused them to start and make off. A horseman,
however, would be a different matter, and
they would have been on the move long before he
reached them.

At a nearer view the branding marks on the
mares and yearlings could be seen, mostly on the
back where a saddle would cover it, but sometimes
on the shoulder. These marks indicated the
initials or devices of their owners, commoners of
the forest, or Crown tenants, who have the right
of pasturing their ponies, the Crown demanding
a small annual sum for each animal put out in the
forest.

These marked ponies had the hair of their tails
cut curiously. This had been done by the
agisters, forest officers with numerous and complicated
duties. The forest is divided into three
districts, each served by an agister, and each
district has its own way of marking the tails of
the ponies registered by him. In one district the
lower third of the hair is cut away, leaving a
centre tassel; in the other two half the lower
third is cut off on the right and left respectively.
Thus an agister can tell at a glance whether a
pony belongs to his district or not. The cut tail
is, in effect, a receipt, testifying that the ponyâs
owner has registered it and paid the dues.

The lord and master of the herd on the hill, the
stallion, was not, for the moment, in sight. He
might have been cooling his heels in a stream,
dozing among the gnarled, ingrown hollies,
which, with their twisted branches, look fully as
grotesque as any of Mr. Rackhamâs picturing,
or have gone off to turn back a mare wandering
away down the valley.

Presently a shrill whistling call was heard, and
the mares showed signs of animation; ears were
pricked up and heads flung round. Up the hill
came the stallion with a pounding step. He was
a bright bay with a big white blotch on his back.
His forelock covered his white forehead blaze,
and his eyes also, for all one could see. The black
hair of his mane and tail was crimped or waved,
unlike the lank locks of the mares. He moved
with a vigorous action, lifting his feet high, and
with a long stride. He carried his tail with a
finer sweep than the mares, while his mane rose
and fell with the energetic movement of his neck.
His coat was glossy, and the high lights rippling
to and fro on the bright sienna surface were
golden in the sun and blue in the shade. When
he reached the summit he stopped, looking back
with twitching ears. He snorted and hurried to
the group of ponies, and past them, then stopped,
and the herd, understanding, prepared to follow
their leader, the mares calling to their recumbent
foals, which rose to their feet and stretched before
cantering to their mothers. The cavalcade moved
off, only the dappled grey remaining motionless.
She was wilful or lazy. The stallion took a few
quick paces back and touched her with his nose
as a hint to move on. She whinnied crossly and
tried to strike him with a fore-foot. He lowered
his head, bared his teeth and snorted, whereupon
she thought better of it, and moved off. The
stallion trotted to the head of the column, and
looked round to see that all were following.

As they went down the hill, two riders showed
on the ridge to the right, a man on a tall white
horse and a boy on a forest pony.

âLook, sonny,â said the horseman, âthat
was the stallion walking before us up the hill.
He has warned his mares and set them all going.
How fine they look in a bunch with their varying
colours! Seems a pity,â he continued, âthat
these fine creatures should have to go down into
the coal-mines.â

âNot a bit of it,â his father answered. âWe
should want a good reason to disturb mares with
young foals. The forest people would think us
very inconsiderate. Remember,â with a smile,
âyou may be a verderer yourself some day, and
sit in the court hall at Lyndhurst, where the big
stirrup hangs on the wall. Weâll make off to the
right and watch them as we go.â

As the ponies saw their supposed pursuers
getting further from them, they relaxed their
pace, stopped, and fell to grazing.

Only the stallion, still suspicious, kept his head
up, and trotted a little way towards the receding
figures, watching the intruders until they disappeared
behind a rise.

Then he turned and walked to the little stream
in which some of the ponies were standing,
fetlock-deep, or drinking.

During July the herd wandered over moor and
âplainâ or in the woods, keeping to their unmarked,
though to them fairly well-defined,
territory of several square miles. Outside those
limits were other herds, with their leaders ready
to take offence at the presence of strange
males.

The little skewbald foal kept away from the
other youngsters, for they were too big and
strong for him to play with; but by good fortune
a brown mare with a colt of the same colour, and
about the same age as Skewbald, joined the party.
What with milk and nibblings of heather and the
lush grass of the bottoms, the little foals grew
apace and became playmates.

In the late afternoons before the long evening
feed, the pair would gambol with all the abandon
of youth, while their mothers stood head to tail,
jerking manes, waving tails, shaking fore-legs,
and ever and anon changing the weight from one
hind-leg to another. The colts would race across
the meadow where the herd was pasturing, then
stop dead, and stand nose to nose, watching for
the otherâs next move; one would rear up suddenly,
startling his playfellow, and race away in
glee. Then followed a biting of manes and
nibbling of shoulders like any old couple. At
times they grew rougher in their play. They ran
shoulder to shoulder, trying to bite, or, rearing
up on hind-legs like veterans, indulged in an orgy
of make-believe biting and kicking.

But, for the greater part of the day, life went
quietly with the little foal. His mane, half white
and chestnut with a streak of black, was growing
fast. His barrel was filling out, and his legs growing
straight and strong. His slender muzzle poked
about everywhere, and his tail flapped continually.

In the hot July days, the colt and his mother
wandered over the hills, and by the little streams
meandering along the bottoms except where the
gurgling water was checked, and collected to
form a bog. Sometimes the stream was bordered
with birch and alder, growing in a soggy bed,
littered with dead wood, and choked with undergrowth.
Tracks ran in and out among the trees,
worn by the hoofs of generations of ponies.
Here, the deeper water flowed more slowly. One
afternoon, as Skewbald paused at the edge to
nibble at a bed of watercress, his mother snorted
at two curious objects moving on the surface of
the water, two bristling cat-like heads with small
ears and a swirling of water behind. They were
otters, steering themselves with their thick tails.

Once he nearly stepped on a snipe, her head so
far immersed in a muddy pool that she was not
aware of an intruder until the hoof was almost
upon her, and then what a fluttering and zig-zagging
and crying of âscape-scape!â Another
time, but this was next year, in spring, as he
dawdled around the edge of the wood among the
dead bracken, he nosed against a brown stem. It
moved, and suddenly became part of the barred
head and widely opened eyes of a sitting woodcock,
her buff, grey and white back matching the
dead leaves and bracken, and her long beak indistinguishable
from the stalks of the fern.

At one point the stream opened out into a wide
shallow with a pebbly bottom where the little
trout played. Tracks led into the stream and out
on the other side, for this was a forest ford.

How pleasant the colts found the water, enjoying
the splashing of their hoofs as they walked
in the stream, the while their elders stood fetlock-deep!
How refreshing to take a deep drink, head
and neck inclined at just the right angle so that
the nostrils were clear of the water, followed by a
snort of content!

After whiling away the hotter hours thus, the
ponies would take the tracks towards the hill.
As they got higher, the white stones showed in
the thin crust of soil, and the heather grew more
sparsely. One August afternoon, while rounding
a gorsebush which shaded a patch of bare blackish
soil, strewn with dead sticks and gravel, the colt
almost touched with his nose what looked like a
piece of dead wood covered with grey lichen and
spots of orange fungus, when, on the moment, the
thing came to life. The lichen and fungus
became grey-tipped and barred feathers, the
stalk-like projection opened in half, disclosing a
great, rose-pink, frog-like mouthâa mouth so
enormous and menacing, that Skewbald shrunk
back. Then the mother nightjar appeared from
nowhere, and croaking and spluttering she
fluttered right before the foalâs nose, so that his
attention was distracted from her young one. If
he had looked again he would have found the
gaping mouth and widely spread wings gone, and
the young chick again reduced to the semblance
of an unattractive lump.

Sometimes the ponies would take the open
moor with its coarse grass, scanty tufts of heather,
and sweet-scented bog myrtle. Much of it was
swamp, and the mare watched her offspring
to see that he did not venture into one of the deep
bogs known only to the forest men, and to the
ponies and deer. If he were rash, she called him
on to safety, while if he were obstinate, she butted
him with her forehead on to drier ground.

In places the moor was curiously patterned,
like a chessboard, a tuft of heather next a patch
of bare soil. This was owing to the peat-cutting,
a right possessed by the commoners, who, however,
are required âto cut one and leave two,â
so that the soil should not be deprived altogether
of vegetable growth.

In early September the colt may have seen the
forest gentian, a single blossom of a beautiful
violet-blue on an erect stalk, while the seed-pods
of the bog asphodel close by, of a vivid orange-yellow,
formed a perfect colour complementary.
But do ponies see colours? They apparently see
well by night, which would seem to show that a
large part of their retina consists of structures
adapted for nocturnal vision, just as the outer
part of the human retina only is used at dusk, the
inner being practically blind at this time, and
therefore green foliage and grass turn grey, and
red flowers appear black, red and green being
seen only with that part of the retina concerned
with diurnal vision.

About this time, too, as he crossed a sandy
forest path, he may have seen the brilliantly green
caterpillar of the emperor moth, its sides spotted
with pink, full fed, and wandering about seeking
a site for its cocoon. Was he able to detect the
same creature on its natural resting-place, the
heather, practically invisible to human eyes, when
motionless; its green merged into the leafage,
and the pink spots simulating heather buds?

Certainly the heather the year of Skewbaldâs
birth was of a brilliance such that the oldest forest
man declared he had never seen equalled.
Especially was this the case on the most barren
gravelly spots, where instead of the usual
magenta, clumps of the brightest crimson blazed
in the sun.

In the warm September days life passed
pleasantly. Through the cold, clear nights,
while Vega blazed above, he paced on with his
mother, ever nibbling, for, like his kind, he did
not spend the long nights in sleep, but towards
dawn lay down for an hour or so. His coat, fast
thickening, kept him warm, even when just after
sunrise a white frost covered every blade of grass,
heather tuft, and fern frond. As the sun rose
higher, the frost turned to a heavy dew in which
the colt wandered, the wet bog myrtle washing
him to the shoulder, while the rays, shining
through the mist, enveloped him with a golden
aura.

Later in the day he plodded up the hill on to
the âplain,â and while his mother dozed in the
shade of a clump of holly, he would roll in a patch
of brilliantly white or golden sand. Once as he
bent his knees to lie down, a grey-brown thing
like a dead furze branch suddenly galvanized into
life with a hiss. As the viper moved, the colt,
with a snort of astonishment, jumped all four feet
in the air at once, and the mother rushed towards
him. She saw the reptile gliding along the
path, and turned sharply away, calling the colt
to her.

So Skewbald learned to avoid a snake, and incidentally
that he could jump. He practised this
on occasion, leaping over fallen stumps, across
streamlets and shallow pits, not knowing how
useful an accomplishment it might prove to him
in after-life.

The waning of September, with its sunny days,
cold nights, and morning mists, made little difference
to the poniesâ daily routine. Apparently
they were as free to go where they listed as any
wild Western herd. But their owners kept an
eye on them, and left them there or had them
âcaught in,â as they pleased.

Later in the year strings of ponies would
wend their way to the Brockenhurst sales, but it
chanced that the owner of the bay leader of the
herd in which Skewbald ran, decided to have him
in before he got busy catching other peopleâs
ponies, which was always the case towards the
end of the year, as he was an adept at the game.

The shadows of a golden afternoon were
lengthening, and the herd, scattered over a mile
of valley bottom, was getting to work after the
midday siesta, when a horseman appeared on the
skyline at the head of the valley. It was the colt-hunter
seeking his property. A moment later
another rider came down one of the slopes, and a
third emerged from the woods bordering the
ridge on the other side of the valley. This last
was Mollie, a girl of fifteen, and the other a lad
of thirteen, her brother Tom. They had come to
help their father to capture the pony. This was
not the first time they had taken part in the chase.

The mares heard the thud of hoofs, threw up
their heads, and whinnied to their foals and yearlings.
Then a call came from their leader a good
way down the valley, and at once the ponies made
off towards the summons, increasing their pace
as the boy and girl riders came down upon them,
shouting and waving, in the hope of driving them
back, so that the stallion could be dealt with
alone. But the girl had to check, as she came to
a boggy patch, and they swept on to join their
leader. âGet along, Tom,â called the father,
following behind. âUp the hill, Mollie, and
head them off.â Tom, on a rough pony, and
riding like a centaur, raced after the fugitives,
which with one accord stretched into a gallop,
stringing out along the valley, according to their
ability; the stallion at the head, and putting his
best foot forward, as if he knew that out of all
the lot he was the one wanted. The ground
resounded with the thud of hoofs, manes and tails
waved in the air, and mares called to their foals,
the youngsters responding gallantly.

The stallion was making for a wood, and to
reach this the ponies had to skirt a swamp. As
the leader rounded the wet land, and made for the
upland shelter, Mollie came directly towards him,
screeching and waving. It was too much for the
ponyâs nerves; he turned and fled up the valley,
making for the higher ground, and followed by
the herd, somewhat confused and bunched together
by the check. Some of the foals began
to tire, and, with their mothers, slackened and
fell out. Among them was the chestnut mare,
who retired with her foal to the shelter of a clump
of hollies, whence, with twitching ears and distended
nostrils, they watched the pursuit. The
stallion, with some faithful companions, now encountered
Tom, who turned him again, and then
the man took up the running. Their aim was to
tire out the stallion, âto run him off his legs,â
for in this waste was no friendly farmyard or
paddock into which he could be driven. Grass
and heather fed, as he was, he was not likely to
have the staying power of stable-fed ponies. On
the other hand, he had no weight to carry, and,
if allowed to get into the woods, might elude his
pursuers until nightfall made it impossible to
continue the chase.

The mares, yearlings, and two-year-olds
dropped out one by one. In little groups they
watched the chase, pursued and pursuers rapidly
dwindling in size as they raced down the valley,
then thundering back along the ridge, black
against the evening sky. The bay had no rest,
and was turned time after time. Now and then
one rider slowed down, but the others kept inexorably
on the heels of their prey.

The chase was not without its dangers, for the
hillsides were dry and slippery. Once the stallion
fell, and rolled clean over, but was up and away in
a moment. The girlâs pony slipped twice, but
she stuck to him like a burr. The ridden ponies
had been on the business before, and were as keen
as their riders. They were quick to see the signs
of deflection on the part of their quarry, and
would of their own accord cut off corners to where
the stallion was heading. More than once the
boyâs pony, going straight for his objective, went
under a gnarled holly, and the rider had to flatten
himself, with his head buried in the ponyâs mane,
or he would have been swept off by the lower
branches, and hung aloft. But it was all in the
dayâs work. Perhaps the man took it the most
quietly. He was there to secure his ponyâhis
children were out for a good run.

The end came when the bay visibly tired, and
could no longer keep ahead. He was alone, for
all his companions had deserted him. The man
forged alongside, and the two ran almost touching,
when suddenly the rider, a halter in his hand,
jumped from his mount, and flung himself on the
stallionâs neck, bearing him to the ground. In a
trice the halter was slipped on, and the man was
up and on his pony, before the shaken bay knew
what had happened. It was a feat of strength
and agility of which few of the forest men were
capable.

The others rode up exulting in their fatherâs
prowess. âKeep clear of his heels, Tom,â was
the caution. As the stallion turned to make off,
the manâs mount leaned against the rope, bracing
herself against the coming jerk, which brought
the would-be fugitive up short, pulling him off
his feet. He was up in a twinkling, and lashed
out with his heels, but all were prepared, and
stinging whips warned him against these tactics.
When he hung back the two behind chivied him
on. Once he lay down and was dragged along
the turf a few paces, but the whips again drove
him up. Then, with ears depressed, the red of
his eyes showing, and bared teeth, he tried
biting, but a slash across the face intimated that
such an assault would not pay.

Finally, the stallion, dead tired as he was, lost
heart, dropped his ears dejectedly, and trudged
along, while his captors, almost as weary, went
homewards across the moors, now and then
breaking into speech, as they recalled the more
exciting moments of the hunt.

Of the stallionâs life in the coal-pits there is not
much to tell. This was a good mine, and the
ponies were well looked after. Their stalls were
lit with electricity, and they were properly fed
and groomed. When at work they wore leather
hats, so that in the low places a bump would not
injure them.

Once at least the stallion, who gained the
good-will of the drivers by his willingness and
activity, had a good rest, beside his weekly one,
for when the great strike was decreed and the
pony-men were called out, the ponies had to be
brought to the surface. The bay was among the
first batch, no longer bright of coat, and his eyes
dazzled by the light of day. But when he reached
the field of dingy grass, so unlike the clean
heather of his native soil, he lay down, and rolled
to his heartâs content, then got up and whinnied
long and loud, as if calling across the great open
spaces of the forest.

The ponies were changing pasture one bright
September day. They had eaten the grass from
a bottom sward, and the old white mare was leading
the party to another, a mile to the south.
Up the hill they went, in single file, the mares
with drooping heads, looking neither to left nor
right, the yearlings nearly as soberly, and the
colts wandering on either side to examine things,
like scouts on the flanks of a column. The ridge
attained, they followed the turf by the road. The
Isle of Wight, mostly cerulean blue with touches
of pink and gold where the sun caught it, lay
along the southern horizon; its hilltops alone
showed, the sea being out of sight, so that the
island seemed merely the last folds of mainland
hill country.

The old mare took the road, and the long string
of ponies, as they came on the hard, gritty
surface, suddenly became audible, the pounding
of their hoofs contrasting with their noiseless
progress on the turf. The road was straight, and
behind them a green-covered lorry approached
rapidly. It lurched somewhat, as if the driverâs
hand was none too steady. He had met an old
acquaintance in Hythe, and they had celebrated
the occasion. He held to his speed, being in a
foolhardy mood. Why should he make way for
ponies when they had all the forest on both sides
of the road? They must get out of his way, or all
the worse for them. But the ways of ponies were
fixed long before motor-lorries or any other of
manâs contrivances were in being, and the pace
of a car was beyond their calculation. Skewbald
was ambling behind his little brown friend on the
left hand of the road. The man kept to his side,
grinning in anticipation of the poniesâ sudden
dart to safety.

Some quickness of perception beyond the
ordinary, some electric rapidity of movement,
alone saved Skewbald. The increasing noise
and vibration warned him, and without stopping
to bend his hind-legs for a leap, he jumped with
all four feet sideways. The lorry, rushing on and
missing him by inches, caught the poor little
brown foal and hurled it into the ditch, its mother
in front escaping with a severe bruise on her
flank. The man involuntarily put on his brakes,
and the other ponies had time to get off the road.
He leaned out, and looked back. There was no
car, nor anyone in sight. âBetter get out of
this,â he muttered, and set off, cursing, accelerating
to top speed.

But he had looked only along the road. Tom,
on pony-back, was going shopping for his mother,
and, with his empty bags hanging from his saddle,
had taken a short cut across the moor, and by a
path through the trees on the hill. As he came to
the top the swaying lorry caught his eye. He saw
its check and the scattering of the ponies, then
its hurried departure. He cantered along until
he reached the spot where the brown mare stood,
and shrank in horror from the foalâs injuries, far
beyond his help, then with a hot urge within him
to bring the culprit to justice, he set off along the
road as fast as his pony could go.

A little later, a car with two officers and a
chauffeur came tearing along in the same direction.
As they neared the spot where the foal was
struck, the brown mare was seen standing in the
road. âSlow down,â ordered the senior officer
peremptorily, remarking to his companion that
there had been too many accidents to ponies that
summer. âPony hurt, sir,â said the chauffeur,
stopping the car of his own accord. One glance
at the foal showed that nothing could be done for
it, save freeing it from pain. The younger officer
got a revolver from the car, while the elder and
his man examined the tracks of the lorry before its
stoppage, and the pattern of the tyre impressions.
Then a shot rang out, and the mare moved away in
fright, but returned to the body as the car started.

When Tom reached the town he saw the lorry
outside a public-house. He looked up the street;
the policeman strolling along was an old acquaintance
of his fatherâs, and the lad went up to him.
âPlease, Mr. Jones, that lorry ran over a foal
back on the road.â âOh!â exclaimed the
constable; âsure? Whereâs the driver? In
there, I suppose. What happened?â At that
moment the man emerged, wiping his mouth on
his sleeve, and went to the lorry. âWhatâs this
about a foal?â asked the policeman. âYou
ran into it.â The boy burst in with, âYou
ran it down! You know you did!â âYouâre
a lying little rascal,â retorted the man surlily;
âI never went within a mile of a pony.â âI
know this boy well,â said the constable, âand
he wouldnât make trouble for nothing. I want
your name and address.â A few idlers strolled
up, and the man began to bluff; he was in
Government employ, and if his lorry with its load
wasnât in Ringwood by midday, someone would
have to answer for it. Just then the car with the
two officers came up. They jumped out and
looked at the lorry tyres. âThis is the car,â
said the senior officer. âWhereâs the chauffeur?â
Tom, the policeman, and the bystanders all
nodded accusingly at the driver. The officer
turned on him. âYouâre an inhuman brute,
running down harmless creatures. No, sir; donât
bluster,â as the driver opened his mouth. âWe
came up after you, marked your tyre tracks, put
the foal out of its misery, and we shall certainly
attend to give evidence against you. Take my
name, constableâGeneral ââ,â mentioning a
famous name, which made the crowd gape and
the miserable driver shiver in his shoes.

And later when he appeared in court, the
General, his subordinate officer, and the chauffeur
attended, as well as Tom, who was complimented
on the way in which he gave his evidence; and
the driver was severely punished, as a warning to
other brutal or careless people.

Wandering over moor and heath, and through
the deep woods, Skewbald while yet a foal got to
know the wild life of the forest, for, as with all
young things, life to him was more than mere
eating, and he was full of curiosity about everything
that went on around him.

In the evenings he would see the rabbits, first
little and then big, come out of their holes, their
white scuts flashing as they gambolled. If they
âfroze,â their quiet umber tint assimilated with
the surrounding hues, so that their outline was
lost, and sometimes the colt, going towards a
patch of herbage, saw nothing but a great black
eye gazing at him, until, on a nearer approach, a
young rabbit materialized, and loped away. On
summer mornings when the dew was heavy, the
bunnies looked almost black because of their
drenched fur. They would have all day to comb
and smooth it out underground. Early one
morning he saw a doe rabbit with a mouthful of
grass, sticking out on both sides of her muzzle,
like a great green moustache; she went below
with it, her two little ones following.

Hares he did not see so often, and they sat so
quietly in their âforms,â that he was not aware
of their presence until he nosed up against them.
But he once saw a hare anything but quiet. On
a bare patch of gravel near the railway, where
hares were in the habit of crossing, a big jack hare
was writhing and squirming without moving from
the spot, and Skewbald went up to see this
strange sight. The creature, of course, was in a
gin, though the foal was not to know that. Not
being afraid of hares, he got quite close, and, as
the entrapped one did not move off, but still
strained and struggled, he gave a mischievous
little stamp to drive him away. Now, the poor
hare was caught by a fore toenail only, and
Skewbald happening to press with his hoof on the
spring the jaw opened, and the prisoner was set
free; but his fore-leg was so strained by the
tension, that when he put weight on it, he fell
over, and squirmed as before.

Skewbald, very interested, touched him, and
the hare made off on to the track, where again
he fell and writhed, Skewbald watching through
the railings, until the noise of an oncoming train
reminded the stricken one that he still had three
legs to run on. The following spring Skewbald
again witnessed the hare in motion, and this time
there were two. The pair were on a level stretch,
and indulging in an orgy of violent movement.
They chased one another, turning and doubling,
taking turns to be pursued and pursuer, till one
stopped and crouched, the other jumping over its
back. Then they ran apart in tangential circles
which brought them face to face, whereupon they
stood up on their hind-legs, and thumped one
another with their forepaws like boxers. They
acted as madly as any other pair of March hares.

Instinct and his mother taught Skewbald to
notice all that was going on, to keep his eyes
âskinned.â When they were in the woods, the
harsh notes of the jays made him start, and from
his motherâs movements, he learned that someone
was about. Once in spring, browsing on the
young shoots of a hawthorn-bush, he almost
nosed against two dormice fresh from their long
rest, sleek and tawny bright, among the green
tufts.

The squirrels he could not help seeing, and
when he stopped, and looked at them sitting on
the low boughs of a fir, making short work of the
cones, they stamped peevishly with their hind-feet,
making quite a noise, as the rabbits did on
the ground. Once he witnessed a curious and
beautiful sight which lasted but a moment. A
squirrel pursued another, going round and round
a tree-trunk as they descended, so quickly that
they left on the eye the impression of a reddish
streak, drawn spirally round the trunk. This
again was in spring, and, like the mad antics of
the hares, a love chase.

Sometimes a fox trotted by, or sat up and
looked at him impudently, and, as it happened,
he got tolerably familiar with a family of foxes.
The lair was in a bank between the roots of an
old oak. Skewbaldâs mother, as she went by,
snuffed the air, and indeed, the smell, whether of
fox or high viands, was perceptible even to human
nostrils. So Skewbald snuffed too, and whenever
he passed the hole, the odour reminded him
of what dwelt there. One fine evening, as he
idled at a little distance, he perceived movement
outside the hole. It was not rabbits, so he went
closer, and saw the little fox cubs, lithe and furry.
One lay on its back gnawing at a moorhenâs wing,
two were engaged in a tussle, and one curled into
a ball with his tail over his nose, pretending to be
asleep; but when the vixen came up, and, after
looking round, sat down calmly amidst her
family, the mischievous cub got up, came behind
her and worried her tail, until she turned, and
seized him in her jaws, so that he yelped.

After this, Skewbald, when his company came
that way, looked out for the cubs, but he saw
little more of them, for the older they grew, the
later they came out, until it was night before they
emerged, and then it was not for play but work,
learning to hunt for their living.

Skewbald and his mother sometimes sunned
themselves by a bank crowned with lichened
thorns. It was quite a badger fortress, being
honeycombed with passages. A certain family
which camped by it one August must have occasioned
the badger some inconvenience, for they
used the great holes as dustbins, stuffing down
newspapers, tins, tea-leaves and coffee grounds,
and other rubbish. But they never set eyes on
him, not even on moonlight nights. Probably he
used an exit on the other side of the bank while
the campers were about. But Skewbald sometimes
saw him after dusk, coming or going with
his rolling gait, or appearing at the mouth of his
den with sniffing snout and uplifted paw. Once
the foal came upon him in broad day, and sunny
at that. He was fast asleep, nearly hidden in a
great nest of dried grass and bracken in a
sheltered corner.

Sometimes, though probably he was unaware
of it, the colt walked over little sharply pitted
tracks which were the slots of the deer. Only
once did he see that rare and shy British mammal,
the roedeer. Skewbald was strolling in a forest
ride, when, all at once, a delicate fawn-coloured
shape with two uplifted sharp horn spikes
emerged from a fern brake, and paused with
raised fore-foot and twitching ears before venturing
across the grassy space, and like a shadow his
mate followed him.

In the thick woods, he sometimes saw the other
deer, mostly fallow, the buck with widely branching
palmate antlers, but occasionally a great red
deer.

One September midday, mother and foal were
wandering down a wide drive in the woods, when
strange noises came to the foalâs ears, people
shouting, baying of hounds and blowing of horns.
He ran close to his mother, who, though not
alarmed, raised her head and snuffed the air with
interest. People with horns no longer hunted
ponies, and she had no apprehensions of capture.

Presently a buck topped the bank, and shot
across the drive, a mere rusty brown streak, gone
as soon as seen. The noise of the hounds wavered,
and grew fainter. The buck had eluded them.
Then in the distance a huntsman appeared
coming up the drive on a tall white horse. He
was a fine sight in his black velvet cap, dark green
coat with brass buttons, and his horn ready to
hand. He stopped by a gate watching the drive,
not knowing he was too late. On the hill out of
sight were the three men in brown velveteen, each
holding a team of the leashed hounds; young and
swift these, waiting to be put on the track of the
quarry when the slow old hounds, or âtufters,â
had got the scent, and mounted hunting folk waiting
or patrolling the forest glades. But the noise
and the sight of the buck was all that Skewbald
experienced, that day, of a forest buck-hunt.

After being warned by his mother, Skewbald
kept as respectful a distance from harmless grass-snakes
and slow-worms as from vipers. He even
jumped when the little brown lizard ran across
the path in front of him. And doubtless he sometimes
found the open door of the home of the
underground wasp, and quickly removed his nose
and himself from its proximity. More rarely he
saw the brown paperish globe of the wood-wasp
hung from a low branch, with a hovering swarm
of wasps like a yellow halo round it.

As for âstoats,â heathflies, and the tickling,
crawling New Forest fly, they are, in hot
weather, the torment of a forest ponyâs life, and
the less said about them the better.

Of birds, he knew most familiarly the stonechat,
always on the topmost spray of a gorsebush, both
in summer and in winter, with his little jerking
tail and monotonous âtick-tackâ note. Sometimes
he would see the stonechatâs relative, the
wheatear, standing on a stone or clod of earth,
with the same flirting of the tail; the attitude alert
and vigilant, his black eye-streak emphasizing his
suspicious glance.

In the evening he heard the âhoo-hooâ of the
tawny owl, and might have seen him sitting upright
on the low branch of a willow, close to the
trunk; and once in broad daylight, as he was
nibbling at the bark of the branches of a stubby
hollow holly, a blotched form appeared at the
opening as if in response to the noise he made
before her door; then with a couple of wing-beats,
the little owl flew up into the higher branches and
looked at him with fierce gold-rimmed eyes, and
irritable movements of her head.

Now and then he came across a small covey of
partridges dusting themselves in a sandy patch,
or sunning on a bank. Once in May, as he put his
nose to a tussock, a sitting partridge gave it a sharp
peck. All that season he looked into tussocks
warily, and one day he came upon what looked like
two partridges sitting together; but the one outside
the nest was a cock-bird, as could be seen by
his red ear-lobes and absence of cross-bars on his
wings. As Skewbald looked, a little head peeped
out from under his fatherâs wing and piped. Then
there was more chirping, and from under the
mother emerged a tiny chick, and in a moment
was lost in his male parentâs feathery recesses.
That faithful husband and father was on duty,
receiving each little chick as it hatched, and âdrying
them off.â

One of Skewbaldâs most interesting glimpses
of his bird neighbours concerned another family
party. He was standing one evening in June by
a great brake of gorse on a bank, near a little
stream, when he heard a flutter of wings, and a
great bird alighted, a shelduck, glorious in her
black, white, and chestnut plumage, crimson neb,
and coral legsâa bird which one associates with
the sandy shores of North Wales or the dunes of
Norfolk. Yet here she was, and after looking
round, she walked towards a rabbit-hole at the foot
of a gorsebush, put her head in, and vanished.

A little later the foal and his mother were drinking
at the stream very early in the morning, when
a subdued but anxious croaking was heard, accompanied
by a âcheepingâ from tiny throats, and
the shelduck came into view marshalling a long
line of the prettiest, fluffy, pied little ducklings,
negotiating all sorts of obstacles. And not one
parent only, for the father, larger and still more
resplendent than his mate, and quite as concerned
and anxious, brought up the rear of the procession.
Once or twice he whistled shrilly, as he
intercepted an errant ball of down, and sent it
into the right path. When they tumbled into the
tiny stream, at once the youngsters were at home
and self-confident. The drake saw them all afloat,
and again the procession re-formed to paddle
down-stream to the sea. What adventures were
they to meet with, and how many would the
parents bring safely to the seashore, to run along
the margin of the tide, in their pied down indistinguishable
from the foamy froth washing over
the seaweed? It was perhaps ten miles to their
destination, with many enemies in waitâhawks,
foxes, badgers, pike, and man.

Later in the season a naturalist, not a sportsman
or collector, armed only with his monocular prismatic,
passed the shelduckâs burrow, and a feather
caught his eye. He stooped, and picking it up,
scrutinized it closely. By its white, black and
chestnut, he knew at once from what bird it had
fallen and that doubtless this was her nesting site.

But perhaps one of the most thrilling sights to
be seen in the forest by a lover of birds was what
Skewbald first beheld one cold April morning. A
rough untidy yearling after his winter outdoors,
he wandered down to the brook, where on a
muddy patch broad three-toed footprints had been
freshly impressed. Loose feathers, white, black,
and brown, caught his eye, and as he sniffed at
them he heard a strange musical phrase, with a
humming vibratory timbreâ

Skewbald looked around, and on a little rise
crowned by a grove of birches were several birds
about the size of pheasants. Two were a deep
blue-black, and there were several smaller,
mottled grey and brown. The black grouse still
lives in the New Forest, though sadly depleted
in numbers, and what the yearling saw was
the spring assembly, or âlekking.â The two
cock-birds were going through some strange
manÅuvres. One which had been sitting in the
fork of a tree, with his beautiful lyre-shaped tail
showing to advantage, flew to the ground. He
drooped his wings, lowered his outstretched neck,
which, with every feather on end, looked twice its
usual size, then brought up his middle tail vertically
with the curved extremities hanging down,
so that from the front it looked somewhat like an
admiralâs cocked hat. His silvery-white undertail
coverts were raised, and expanded like a fan.
It was this view he displayed to the presumably
admiring hens, though as far as one could see,
they took not the least notice of their admirers.
Meanwhile he hummed the song already indicated.
Then the other bird came forward, got up
like the first, and the real business commenced.
With outstretched necks and distended crimson
eyebrows, they fenced with each other, until one,
taking courage, flew at his rival, and there was a
rough-and-tumble struggle, only ended when one
had had enough. Then the victor strutted about,
and renewed his song.

It was midwinter and âbad pony weatherââthat
is, the atmospheric conditions were likely to
upset the less hardy and the younger members of
the herds. For a month there had been a succession
of torrential gales from the south-west blotting
out the âWight,â so that the thickest pony
thatch was drenched, and when, as had happened
several times, a hard frost followed a heavy downpour,
the ponies suffered severely from cold, and
the youngstersâ constitutions were sorely tried.

Skewbaldâs mother sheltered herself and him
all ways that an old forest pony knew. In the
heaviest storms she took him to the shelter of
thick hollies or dense spruce groves, but even a
forest pony must eat, and in spite of wet, they had
to leave the protection of the woods for the open
ground, where most of their provender was
to be obtained. Skewbald, from some inherited
strength of fibre, suffered less than other
youngsters, many of whom were âcaught inâ
with their mothers by the more careful owners,
and given food and shelter.

The chestnut and her foal were among those
left out all the winter. Continued frost meant
little to them, protected as they were by their
thick coats. Skewbald, especially, had done his
best to keep himself warm. A great shock of hair
came over his eyes, his mane hung in a thick mass
on his neck, his tail nearly reached the ground and
kept his thighs warm, while his body and legs
looked half as thick again, from the growth of long
hair which covered him right down to the hoofs.
Only his nose was soft and velvety much as in
summer.

After a heavy fall of snow, the mare showed her
son how to kick and scrape away until the herbage
was reached. She taught him to nibble at the
gorse, hard and prickly though nutritious; with
retracted lips nipping off the spikes full of
aromatic buds, and grinding the prickles to shreds
before swallowing. When the foresters cut down
hollies, she was soon on the spot, showing the
youngster how to tear off the sweet bark of the
branches hacked from the poles.

On sunny mornings after sharp frost, he would
lie down in the bracken, tuck his legs under him,
and doze, warm and comfortable, for hours. If it
rained, he followed his mother, and learned the
trick of keeping his back to the wind, thus lessening
the surface exposed.

The agister riding across the moorland heard a
mare neighing, and when she repeated her call
several times, trotted his mount towards her. She
was a bay roan, and after another plaint ran a
little way, and stopped. As the rider came to a
clump of high gorse, he saw a foal lying in a
sheltered nook. One glance showed him it was
dead, a poor thin âsuckerâ with legs outstretched
stiffly. âShould have been taken in before,â he
muttered to himself; âthatâs the youngster I told
Sam Evett about a week ago. Some people arenât
to be trusted with animals.â On his way back he
came across first one and then another young pony
looking âseedy,â and these with their mothers
were gently guided to the nearest farmyard, where
they would be taken care of until their owners
fetched them away.

That night the weather became worse than
ever. The storm raged through the woods,
roaring in the pines and swaying the birches
and beeches, while dead branches snapped off
with cracks like rifle-fire. Skewbald and his
mother were sheltering on the lee side of a
giant beech. If it had been day, the trail of dead
oyster fungus up its trunk would have told its tale
of inner decay. The mare became uneasy, and
moved away from the shelter of the vast column.
She called to Skewbald, who followed, but feeling
the bite of the freezing wind, backed behind the
trunk again. There was a tremendous crack, a
tearing and rending, and the great bole snapped
off above the coltâs head, and crashed to the
ground, the trunk still poised at its line of fracture,
held by bark and sound wood, so that Skewbald
was untouched and unhurt.

A cold north-easter blew across the moor. The
old thorns were budding, the daffodils were peeping
from the turf, and the yellow of the gorse was
beginning to show, so spring was at hand, but
there were few other signs of it, for the season was
late. If the chiffchaff had come, he had no time
to make his presence known by song, his food was
all too rare.

The chestnut mare and her son wandered on
the sheltered side of holly and tall gorse, picking
up what they could. Skewbald, now termed a
yearling though not yet a year old, showed conspicuously
in the landscape in his chestnut and
white. But he was ragged and untidy to the last
degree. His doormat-like coat was torn and
tangled by conflict with the thorns. His face and
neck had the same patchy appearance. But for
the coarseness of his covering, his ribs would have
shown, for, apart from his not yet having filled
out, the severe weather had kept him âlight.â
His legs were still bony and ungainly, and he was
plainly in the hobbledehoy stage. But he had a
good gait, the bones of his shoulders and hind-quarters
were of great strength, with plenty of
room for muscular attachments, and when he
walked, he covered plenty of ground.

The ponies wanderedâwandered because they
had not time to stand back to the wind as do stall-fed
cattle, for both day and night was wanted for
finding sustenance.

The mare had joined a herd led by a small but
energetic stallion, whose shade of blackish-brown,
and âmealyâ or light-coloured nose, proclaimed
his streak of Exmoor blood. Unlike Skewbald and
other ponies, he had been looked after during the
winter, and having only lately been turned out
into the forest, was in splendid condition. He was
full of spirit, alert, and mistrustful of the unusual,
while as master of the herd he brooked no disobedience.
One day after the herd had drunk at
a favourite shallow, they were moving to another
feeding-ground, and the stallion, looking over his
company, noted the chestnut mare still standing
motionless. Either she had not fully slaked her
thirst or some old association made her reluctant
to leave. The leader walked to her and snorted.
She turned her head, but made no other sign of
acquiescence, whereupon he lost patience, bared
his teeth, depressed his ears, and made a little run
at her as if to bite, when she at once made haste
to comply with his command.

On the way, the party was joined by a young
stallion of a blue roan hue, with white forehead
blaze and pink nose, accompanied by an old bay
mare with her yearling. For a time, the three
having fallen in at the rear, all went well, but
presently the grey left his place, and went forward
as if for the express purpose of creating trouble
for himself, for the leader, by his depressed ears
and backward glance, showed that he considered
he had a rival in the field, and was ready to take up
the implied challenge. The grey was taller, but
not in such good condition, having been left out
during the winter.

The mealy-nosed stallion took to making little
rushes at the interloper with extended neck and
bared teeth. The younger at first contented himself
by retreating or swerving, but at last the touch
of teeth on his neck aroused his resentment and
combativeness. He turned sharply, and flinging
out his heels, kicked the leader on the shoulder.
It was the first real blow, and as if by signal, the
two reared up, and with fore-feet striking vigorously,
tried to bite one another on the face and
neck, until they had to come down to rest. Then
the little stallion in his turn reversed, and let out a
kick which took effect on his opponentâs hind-quarter.
The grey screamed with pain and fury.
Rearing, he threw himself at his enemy, knocked
him down, and, unable to keep his balance, rolled
right over him. The leader was up first, and
standing on his prostrate opponent, belaboured
him with his hoofs. The grey cried out under this
treatment, and when he succeeded in getting to
his feet, his adversary rushed at him with jaws
agape and bristling mane, so that he fairly turned
tail. Then the mealy-nosed one trumpeted shrilly,
shook himself, pushed past the waiting herd to
the head, and resumed the journey.

They crossed a road, and went down a rutted
path, and this for a few yards became a causeway
across an obviously boggy patch. The road had
been made by dumping gravel into the swamp,
its sides being strengthened by balks of timber.
Near the edges of the bog, patches of lush grass,
emerald of hue, were beginning to sprout. Skewbald
strolled down to sample this luxury, but was
recalled to her side by his motherâs sharp whinny.
She knew the temptation this verdant growth had
for youngsters, and its danger. A moment later,
a tragedy occurred. A poor-looking, black yearling,
motherless for some reason, strayed from the
path, to nibble at a tempting patch, a yard or so
from the edge. He walked confidently to it, but
after a mouthful, sank below his knees, and a cry
of fright broke from him. The herd showed signs
of distress, and shrill whinnyings came from the
mares as they plunged to and fro along the
margin; but the coltâs efforts to reach his companions
only involved him the more surely in the
morass.

A few bubbles rising to the surface of what was
now a muddy pool told of the disaster which had
occurred. The bog keeps its secrets, and no one
knows how many ponies have been engulfed in it.

Spring had come at last. The cold east winds had
been followed by warm south-westerly gales with
soft rain, making the grass grow and filling the
bogs also. The golden-yellow of the marsh-marigold
at the streamâs edge was repeated in a
lighter key by the stunted wild daffodils in the
forest meadows, and again in higher but more
diluted tone by the primroses on the banks outside
the woods. The blackthorn was past its prime,
but the bushes were still covered with blossom now
looking like soiled snow. The oaks and beeches
were still in bud only. The thorns had put out
tufts of vivid green, drowning the grey-green of
their lichened branches. In the swampy spots the
catkins of the bog myrtle shone in the sun with
extraordinary brilliance, presenting great patches
of that rare colour in wild floral natureâdeep
orange and orange-scarlet.

Of course, the birds were here. Not only the
residents, the stonechat and the little hedge and
field birds, and the rook, crow, kestrel, and heron,
but the migrants also. The chiffchaff uttered his
name continually as he hunted in the scraggy
budding oaks, the willow-warbler repeated his
wavering refrain, crescendo and diminuendo, very
like the bends in the âtailâ in âAlice in Wonderland;â
and the whitethroat was beginning to
throw himself in ecstasy above the bushes. The
blackcap flew from bough to bough, as he shrilled
his wild, inconsequent, yet melodious and captivating
song, while the garden-warbler skulked in the
bushes, chuckling and fluting throatily at great
length; the nightingale began to âjug,â while
his shorter but more richly coloured mate industriously
collected oak-leaves for her nest. In the
beechwoods the woodwren flitted from bough to
bough, repeating his clear call, followed by a
twittering cadence like ice tinkling in a glass,
while his wings quivered in time with his tune.

Above the moor the cock lapwing made occasional
flights to amuse his sitting partner, flapping
his rounded wings vigorously as he flew all ways,
curving downwards to the ground without alighting
and up again in another sweep, then âreversingâ
in his characteristic way. Meanwhile
the redshank stood on the bog bobbing his head
nervously, or whistled shrilly to his mate, if a crow
or a man appeared on the horizon. The redshank
likes to nest near the lapwing, which is as brave as
the other is timid, dashing threateningly down on
an intruder, especially its ancient enemiesâcrow,
jackdaw, and harrier.

Out on the moor lawns of green grass showed
amongst the heather, and in the bogs, amidst the
bleached tussock grass, were patches of new grass
of the most vivid emerald, looking, and most deceptively
so, like firm sward.

There are many bogs in the forest, varying from
patches a few yards square to huge ones covering
many acres. In Denny Bog still lie the
remains of an aeroplane which landed on the
smooth and, to an eye looking from above, apparently
firm surface. The pilot, on getting out
of the fuselage, was soon up to his waist; and
in spite of repeated efforts, it was found impossible
to extricate the plane, and the salvers
had to content themselves with removing the
engine.

To the human visitor the bog has no terrors, for
its dead yellowish grass with green patches and
occasional pools proclaim its nature. Moreover,
causeways of gravel have been made across
narrower parts where necessary.

Skewbald and his mother were wandering as
usual on the moor, the rest of the herd strung out
over a square mile of forest, hillside, and grass
bottom, too intent on making up for their scanty
winter fare to desire the close companionship of
their fellows.

Skewbald was much the same as a month before,
perhaps a little more ragged, as his loosening
winter dress got carded out by the thorns.

The two were on the outskirts of a great bog,
to the south of which extensive woods filled the
horizon. They were not alone. A little distance
away two gipsies, a man and a boy, were following
the edge of the bog, striding from tussock to
tussock and probing with their sticks for bad
places which might let them in.

There was no difficulty in divining what they
wanted. The lapwings screaming overhead, the
redshanks wailing as they flew right away, knew
also that their eggs were in danger. Ploversâ eggs
are part of the gipsyâs livelihoodâto sell, because
they are too precious for him to eat. He would
say that he found far more in a henâs egg.

As the egg-hunters quartered the ground, they
approached the ponies, which, judging from their
movements that they themselves were not likely
to be molested, ignored their proximity. The
boy, when abreast of Skewbald, suddenly raised
his stick, and from pure mischief or rather fun,
ran at the yearling, which, startled, bounded off,
but in the direction of the bog. He plunged about
and sank deeply, while his strenuous efforts to
extricate himself only caused him to become more
firmly embedded. Soon he could no longer move
his legs, the mud reached his flanks, and he was
still sinking, though now more slowly.

The man stormed at the boy standing open-mouthed
in dismay, then looking round began to
run, calling to the other to follow. He was
making for a promontory of firm ground stretching
into the bog. Here stood a few stunted pines
which a fire had caught, for they were black and
dead, some already lying on the ground. Both
loaded themselves with the fallen logs, staggered
back to the yearling, and began to throw the wood
on the bog towards him. Skewbald, incapable of
motion save for frenzied movements of his head
and neck, was aghast at his plight, and called
piteously to his mother, who plunged backwards
and forwards along the edge of the bog, whinnying
distractedly.

The man waded out and pushed log after log
under the yearlingâs belly. Then he got a pole
under him behind the fore-legs. His next action
was to bend down and feel in the mud to ascertain
if the ponyâs legs were straight. A forcible pull
on a bent leg might cause a fracture. His preparations
made, he put all his strength into levering
up the pole, calling: âNow, Jarge, let âun have
what for;â and the boy, with a stick, belaboured
the yearlingâs hind-quarters. Skewbald felt himself
moved by the manâs force, and, under the
added stimulus of pain, made tremendous exertions.
The man made another effort, and a fore-leg
came up. âAt âun again, lad;â and the
harassed yearling, with a great heave and an explosive
âsuck,â came out of the mud and began to
flounder towards the firm ground, leaving the two
half-bogged themselves. The man reached out
and pulled the boy towards him, and they worked
their way out.

They were covered with mud from head to foot,
and regarded each other doubtfully, until the
man laughed (a smile would not have been perceived),
whereupon the boy exploded in peals of
merriment. Their hearts were warm within
them, with the pleasure of success, for horseflesh
or ponyflesh is dear to the gipsy. Then, picking
up the eggs they had collected, which, being
gipsies, they had carefully deposited in a tussock,
they departed.

But Skewbald carried a long scar on his belly,
caused by a sharp pine knot, to the day of his
death.

It was full spring. For nearly a month May had
flooded the forest with sunlight. The gold of the
gorse was blinding to the eye, and almost intoxicating
with its strong scent of burnt almonds. The
powdery snow of the blackthorn had been followed
by the ropy, pinkish bloom of the hawthorn. The
foliage of the scraggy oaks was Italian pink (which
is a greenish yellow), while the silver birches and
the beeches had burst into leaf and emerald
tassels had succeeded the crimson buds of the
larches. The brambles had two distinct sets of
leafage, those of last year, old and tattered,
but magnificently blotched with crimson and
orange, and edged with sienna, while from
their axils sprays of tender green unfolded
themselves.

This is the month of song, and everywhere the
larks and meadow-pipits rose in the air, the former
to go up out of sight still trilling, while the latter
ceased singing, and came floating down silently
like parachutes of brown paper.

The lapwing chicks peeped from their motherâs
wings, or crawled over her back like the young of
the domestic hen. If an enemy flew over, the
male bird rose in the air in a frenzy of militant
defence, while at the parentsâ warning call, the
chicks crouched and became, to the casual glance,
invisible.

As for the pony population of the forest, it
seemed to have doubled in numbers all at once, for
everywhere the young foals followed the mares,
or lay basking among the heather. The early foals
were now tall and long-legged, though here and
there a late arrival stood unsteadily with bent
hind-legs, or trotted a few paces with a stiff-legged
gait. It might even essay a gallop, a curiously
mechanical action, reminding one of a rocking-horse.

One mare, at least, had two little suckers, and
here and there quite a family procession passed,
of mare, two-year-old, yearling, and foal, the
property of someone who had not troubled to sell
the youngsters, preferring to leave them in
the forest to breed. Parties of threeâmare,
yearling, and suckerâwere quite common, the
two youngsters on the best of terms.

The hues of the new-comers were sometimes
exactly those of their mothers, but often quite
different. An old mare, once a grey but now dirty
white, was followed by a black foal; if the latter
were closely scrutinized its eyebrows might be
seen to be grey, and that would mean the foal
would turn grey like its mother, and again white
in old ageâfrom black to white. But if the eyebrows
were black like the rest of the body, then
probably the hue would remain black or very dark,
for black is rare in the forest, and as some think
due to importation of alien blood. In the case of
one chestnut foal, its darker eyebrows showed
that when adult its coat would be of a rich liver
colour.

The majority of the foals bid fair to be like their
parents, a dark brown with blackish mane and tail,
and the same similarity existed with bays and
chestnuts, though generally the foals were darker
in hue than their mothers.

But there were exceptions to this. A dappled
grey mare, for instance, instead of the more usual
black-coated offspring, might be accompanied by
a foal, light fawn as to ground tint, with black
markings round its eyes and muzzle; or a dark
mare be seen with a light-coloured youngster.

The yearlings, among whom Skewbald was one,
had shed their winter coat by dint of rubbing
against bushes below and overhanging branches
above. The bay and chestnut showed clearly, and
the lights began to appear on their coats, golden
in the sun, blue in the shade, though they could
scarcely be said to âripple,â for the youngsters
were still bony, with unfilled barrels.

Young Skewbald was not amongst the dullest
hued of his fellows. There were few whose chestnut
was brighter than his, while his white could
not be matched anywhere among the ponies
except for an occasional âsockâ or forehead blaze
too small in area to tell at a distance.

Like the others of his year, he walked sedately,
for his hours of coltish play were over. Never
again would he gambol on the lawns with a playmate
in the golden evenings, though occasionally
he would lie down and roll, a pleasure every horse
and pony indulges in till the end of its days.
Sufficient for the day was the labour of filling his
belly, although the forest fare increased daily in
bulk and sweetness.

Three ponies were grazing on a long level stretch
of moorland one perfect evening in early September.
To the north were low hills, their sides
covered with purple heather and fern, the latter
already showing orange amongst the green. Here
and there an old thorn or holly dotted the hillside,
the ridge itself serrated by groups of firs. Along
the southern border of the moor flowed a tiny
stream, a few feet across, which, a few miles
farther down, would expand into a wide estuary
dotted with yachts.

As the sun declined, the moor fell into shade,
but on the hill the red trunks of the firs and the
orange of the fern glowed with richer hues, while
the heather added a ruddy tone to its purple. The
foliage took on that rich golden-green which landscape
painters love, while the shadows, deriving
their colour from the blue of the eastern sky, were
glaucous green.

Skewbald, still a yearling although some sixteen
months old, was with his mother, who had also by
her side her last foal, a brown filly. She was well
grown, for she had been born early in April.

As they grazed, Tom and Molly, followed by
their father, rode through the gate which led to
the little farm beyond the river. âThere they
are,â said the boyââmare, yearling, and colt.â
(New Forest folk have a way of referring to a foal
as a colt, even speaking of âhorse coltsâ and
âfilly colts.â) âYes, close at hand,â said his
father; âpush the gate wide open. I hope,â he
continued, âas we havenât all day to catch the
yearling in, that youâll just get quickly to work,
and remember catching ponies is one thing, and
running races with them quite another.â Tom
grinned, but in his heart hoped the ponies would
not let themselves be driven in without a run.

The father sent his boy along by the river, while
he himself made a detour to get behind the ponies.
Molly was to go up the moor to be in readiness
in case of a break-away. The ponies were to be
driven through the gate over the wooden bridge
into the paddock, and, if it could be managed that
evening, right into the stable yard. The boy and
girl were to watch them, while the father drove
them towards the gate. All went well at first.
As the man emerged from the trees in view of the
ponies, the mare stopped feeding, looked at the
intruder, snorted, and trotted away with her offspring.
The rider followed, gently shepherding
them towards the gate, his assistants closing in on
either side. Unfortunately, the youngest boy of
the family, who, with a small sister, was fishing in
the stream, had succeeded in bringing a minnow
to land, and signalized his triumph with a yell of
delight, just as the ponies came towards the opening.
The mare pricked up her ears, swerved
sharply, and, followed by her youngsters, made
off at full speed across the moor in spite of all that
the hunters could do. The man laughed ruefully,
calling, âYouâll get your run, Tom; we must
try and get them in before night.â Tom went
like the wind, in shirt and trousers, and barebacked,
on a little rough pony, which knew every
foot of the ground. The fugitives got to a boggy
place, and had to pick their way, so Tom, running
wide, got behind a patch of firs, and came upon
the ponies suddenlyâtoo suddenly, for they went
away up the moor, the mare shaking her mane
and tail, Skewbald keeping pace easily, and the
foal doing wonderfully well. They went right
past the girl, though she tore off her hat, whirled
it above her head, and let off blood-curdling
shrieks. âAfter them, Molly,â called her father,
and the thunder of hoofs resounded, while the
setting sun gilded the heather, firs, and fern with
a deeper glory than before, and enhanced Skewbald,
as he emerged with the mare and foal on the
hilltop, then disappeared behind clumps of hollies,
or, a moment in shade, told dark on the skyline.
The wide, open situation, the sense of space, as
the retreating ponies diminished rapidly to mere
dots, the sweet scent of bruised bog myrtle, and
the clear light, made a scene less like rural England
than the setting of some cowboy story of
vast upland country in, say, Idaho or Arizona.
Only the great sierra background was lacking.

Molly managed to drive the ponies off the
moor, up the hill, along the ridge, and then turning
them, drove them down the steep forest road
across the moor towards the farm, Tom and her
father on either side, waving and shouting to
prevent a break-away. There was no trouble this
time at the gate, for with man and boy to right
and left, and the girl thundering behind, the ponies
were glad to dash through. âGot âem,â chuckled
Tom as he closed the gate. The others followed
at the poniesâ heels over the bridge. The gates
leading to the yard were open, and all was quiet,
for Mother had looked out to see how things were
going, and had taken charge of her two small
children. As it happened, the fugitives, instead
of turning off into the meadow, as they might
have done, went up the road, dashed through the
opening, and found themselves in the stable yard.
Molly closed the great sliding-door, while Tom
and his father, jumping from their mounts,
attended to Skewbald. As he was a lusty
youngster, and with his shaking mane and depressed
ears looked mischievous, they paid him
the compliment of treating him like a full-grown
stallion, and Tom was given the job of haltering
him, for practice. The halter was hung on the
end of a six-foot rod, and while his father drove
the yearling into a corner, distracting his attention,
Tom quietly slipped the loop over his head
and fastened the rope to a ring in the wall, before
Skewbald had time to show resentment at being
tied up.

âFetch the branding-iron, Tom,â said his
father. Mother had it on the kitchen fire in readiness.
Meanwhile the man got a sack from the
shed, and watching his opportunity, dropped it
over Skewbaldâs head, who, while objecting to it
very much, was so puzzled by the darkness, that
he ceased his straining and backing, and was
reduced to quietude. This bandaging the eyes is
not often done, only when it is feared a pony may
become obstreperous. Sometimes the yearlings
are driven into a stable with no space to kick in,
when the brander will reach over one pony to
brand the next.

Tom brought out the iron, which was like a
poker with a ring handle for hanging up, and the
branding device or letters welded to the other end,
and of course in reverse. Several such irons were
hanging in the stable.

There need be no shuddering at visions of red-hot
iron and sizzling flesh, for the iron when it
reached the yard was black, and to all appearance
cold. Yet it was hotâhot enough to destroy hair
growth where it was pressed, and leave a permanent
mark.

The man took the iron and held it for a moment
an inch from his cheek to test its heat. âJust
right,â he said; âhold him, Tom;â then firmly
pressed the iron against the shoulderâthe
shoulder, not the saddle, for Skewbald was one
day to go to the mines, where appearances do not
count for much, hard pulling and quick turning
being more highly rated. Skewbald did nothing
out of the way when the iron bit into his skin, did
not kick or try to rear; he just winced, and that
was all.

Then the yearling was released and turned out
into the paddock, where his mother and her foal
were awaiting him. The agister would be along
shortly, and Skewbald would be on hand for the
tail-cutting. This is also a delicate operation,
as a pony may launch an unexpected kick.
Generally, a large pair of scissors in hand, the
cutter quietly draws the lower tail hair towards
him with the crook of a stick. In a stable into
which a dozen ponies may have been driven,
perhaps for the first time in their lives, the agister
will venture fearlessly, and cut tail after tail without
mishap, trusting to the good sense of the
ponies, which will not kick in the confined space,
for fear of hurting their fellow-prisoners.

Occasionally, half a dozen commoners will agree
to meet on a Saturday afternoon, for the purpose
of collecting their ponies. The harness of the
ridden ponies varies in style, and is often more
homely than elegant. A man may be riding a
horse or pony whose accoutrements consist of
mere scraps of leather held together by string
and rope. The boys of the party ride barebacked,
or make an old rug serve as saddle.

Some time may be spent in rounding up the
ponies, which, after much hard riding and shouting,
are driven into a convenient farmyard, in a
bunch of twenty or thirty.

The quiet enclosure, tenanted only by a few
pigs and poultry, becomes a place of tumult as
the hunted ponies surge in, snorting, neighing,
and tossing manes, the pursuers close on their
heels to prevent a break-away. In a moment all
is life and movement. The poultry and pigs dash
hither and thither from beneath the trampling
hoofs. The riders jump from their mounts, which
with drooping heads stand passive as if glad to
rest, strangely contrasting with the restless movements
of the wild ponies, which, cowed and bewildered,
crowd into a corner, penned up so
closely that they have no room to kick, even if
they have the inclination; foals wander about,
seeking their dams; men and boys, leaning against
their steeds, chat with the daughters of the farm,
while dogs and children appear as if by magic, the
tiniest tot seeming to bear a charmed life. The
unwanted ponies are now sorted out, an operation
somewhat troublesome and delicate, and given
their liberty; the unbranded ones are tied up and
marked with their respective ownersâ branding-irons.

Then the company takes the farm road, leading
the freshly caught ponies. Most of the captives,
after a few skirmishes, submit to their fate, and go
quietly, but some, more resentful of their treatment
and unwelcome bondage, give much trouble,
both to their captors and to themselves. They
put down their fore-feet stubbornly, refusing to
budge, and when prodded by those behind, may
fling themselves down, to be dragged along the
stony road. An obstinate pony will try sorely the
patience of those in charge of it, and instances
have occurred of an animal causing its own death
by its violent resistance; but, generally, after half
a mile of rough treatment, the pony realizes that
further opposition is useless, and follows more or
less submissively.

October had been wet. Rain in the forest is, at
all times of the year, depressing. When the sun
shines on purple heather, emerald fern, and the
ruddy stems of fir-trees, moorland and hillside are
gay enough, but in wet and stormy weather the
landscape is the more gloomy by contrast; the
lowering clouds, the black sobbing pines, the
pools of water, the soggy tussocks squelching
underfoot, make up a dull and cheerless scene,
although in the eyes of the forest lover it is
perhaps then at its best. The damp atmosphere
intensifies the local colour, and gives a sense of
vastness and distance to the perspectives.

The forest ponies dislike rain. They have to
seek food most of their day, and cannot afford to
stand idly in shelter like their more favoured
relations. Also the boggy ground gets still more
shaky and uncertain, and the wary creature is cut
off from the areas which might supply him with
food. In long continued rain the ponies leave the
open moor or hillside, and betake themselves to
the woods, where, under the umbrellas formed by
the great oaks, beeches, and firs, they find shelter,
especially from what most living creatures detestâa
cold driving rain.

Skewbald, therefore, was with his companions
in the woods, nosing round for clumps of sweet
grass, or, in the wettest spells, taking shelter
under overhanging trunks. His coat had grown
thick during the autumn, and with his dense mane
and tail he was as well protected as a pony
could be.

The colt-hunter also disliked rain, for apart from
the discomforts of the chase in wet weather, rounding
up the ponies is' WHERE id = '2caf1b69-d04b-48c2-a2b1-056af69d7ee4';
