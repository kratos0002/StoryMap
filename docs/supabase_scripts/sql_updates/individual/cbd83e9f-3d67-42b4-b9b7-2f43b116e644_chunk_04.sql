The visitors went into the bedroom, and were extremely jocose on the
subject of a pair of feminine slippers, the rug that had been put down
between the two beds, and a grey dressing-jacket that hung at the foot
of the bedstead. They were amused that the obstinate man who despised
all the common place details of love had been caught in feminine snares
in such a simple and ordinary way.

"He who pointed the finger of scorn is bowing the knee in homage,"
Kukushkin repeated several times. He had, I may say in parenthesis, an
unpleasant habit of adorning his conversation with texts in Church
Slavonic. "Sh-sh!" he said as they went from the bedroom into the room
next to the study. "Sh-sh! Here Gretchen is dreaming of her Faust."

He went off into a peal of laughter as though he had said something very
amusing. I watched Gruzin, expecting that his musical soul would not
endure this laughter, but I was mistaken. His thin, good-natured face
beamed with pleasure. When they sat down to play cards, he, lisping and
choking with laughter, said that all that "dear George" wanted to
complete his domestic felicity was a cherry-wood pipe and a guitar.
Pekarsky laughed sedately, but from his serious expression one could see
that Orlov''s new love affair was distasteful to him. He did not
understand what had happened exactly.

Pekarsky combed his big beard with his fingers and sank into thought,
and he did not speak again till supper-time. When they were seated at
supper, he began deliberately, drawling every word:

"Altogether, excuse my saying so, I don''t understand either of you. You
might love each other and break the seventh commandment to your heart''s
content—that I understand. Yes, that''s comprehensible. But why make the
husband a party to your secrets? Was there any need for that?"

"Hm!...." Pekarsky mused. "Well, then, let me tell you this, my friend,"
he went on, evidently thinking hard: "if I ever marry again and you take
it into your head to seduce my wife, please do it so that I don''t notice
it. It''s much more honest to deceive a man than to break up his family
life and injure his reputation. I understand. You both imagine that in
living together openly you are doing something exceptionally honourable
and advanced, but I can''t agree with that ... what shall I call it?...
romantic attitude?"

Orlov made no reply. He was out of humour and disinclined to talk.
Pekarsky, still perplexed, drummed on the table with his fingers,
thought a little, and said:

"I don''t understand you, all the same. You are not a student and she is
not a dressmaker. You are both of you people with means. I should have
thought you might have arranged a separate flat for her."

"Turgenev teaches us in his novels that every exalted, noble-minded girl
should follow the man she loves to the ends of the earth, and should
serve his idea," said Orlov, screwing up his eyes ironically. "The ends
of the earth are poetic license; the earth and all its ends can be
reduced to the flat of the man she loves.... And so not to live in the
same flat with the woman who loves you is to deny her her exalted
vocation and to refuse to share her ideals. Yes, my dear fellow,
Turgenev wrote, and I have to suffer for it."

"What Turgenev has got to do with it I don''t understand," said Gruzin
softly, and he shrugged his shoulders. "Do you remember, George, how
in ''Three Meetings'' he is walking late in the evening somewhere in
Italy, and suddenly hears, ''Vieni pensando a me segretamente,''" Gruzin
hummed. "It''s fine."

"What next! Far from wishing it, I never imagined that this would ever
happen. When she said she was coming to live with me, I thought it was a
charming joke on her part."

"I couldn''t have wished for such a thing," said Orlov in the tone of a
man compelled to justify himself. "I am not a Turgenev hero, and if I
ever wanted to free Bulgaria I shouldn''t need a lady''s company. I look
upon love primarily as a necessity of my physical nature, degrading and
antagonistic to my spirit; it must either be satisfied with discretion
or renounced altogether, otherwise it will bring into one''s life
elements as unclean as itself. For it to be an enjoyment and not a
torment, I will try to make it beautiful and to surround it with a mass
of illusions. I should never go and see a woman unless I were sure
beforehand that she would be beautiful and fascinating; and I should
never go unless I were in the mood. And it is only in that way that we
succeed in deceiving one another, and fancying that we are in love and
happy. But can I wish for copper saucepans and untidy hair, or like to
be seen myself when I am unwashed or out of humour? Zinaida Fyodorovna
in the simplicity of her heart wants me to love what I have been
shunning all my life. She wants my flat to smell of cooking and washing
up; she wants all the fuss of moving into another flat, of driving about
with her own horses; she wants to count over my linen and to look after
my health; she wants to meddle in my personal life at every instant, and
to watch over every step; and at the same time she assures me genuinely
that my habits and my freedom will be untouched. She is persuaded that,
like a young couple, we shall very soon go for a honeymoon—that is,
she wants to be with me all the time in trains and hotels, while I like
to read on the journey and cannot endure talking in trains."

"What! Do you suppose she would understand me? Why, we think so
differently. In her opinion, to leave one''s papa and mamma or one''s
husband for the sake of the man one loves is the height of civic virtue,
while I look upon it as childish. To fall in love and run away with a
man to her means beginning a new life, while to my mind it means nothing
at all. Love and man constitute the chief interest of her life, and
possibly it is the philosophy of the unconscious at work in her. Try and
make her believe that love is only a simple physical need, like the need
of food or clothes; that it doesn''t mean the end of the world if wives
and husbands are unsatisfactory; that a man may be a profligate and a
libertine, and yet a man of honour and a genius; and that, on the other
hand, one may abstain from the pleasures of love and at the same time be
a stupid, vicious animal! The civilised man of to-day, even among the
lower classes—for instance, the French workman—spends ten sous on
dinner, five sous on his wine, and five or ten sous on woman, and
devotes his brain and nerves entirely to his work. But Zinaida
Fyodorovna assigns to love not so many sous, but her whole soul. I
might give her a talking to, but she would raise a wail in answer, and
declare in all sincerity that I had ruined her, that she had nothing
left to live for."

"But she is charming," said Kukushkin. "She is exquisite. Such women
imagine that they will be in love for ever, and abandon themselves with
tragic intensity."

"But one must keep a head on one''s shoulders," said Orlov; "one must be
reasonable. All experience gained from everyday life and handed down in
innumerable novels and plays, uniformly confirms the fact that adultery
and cohabitation of any sort between decent people never lasts longer
than two or at most three years, however great the love may have been at
the beginning. That she ought to know. And so all this business of
moving, of saucepans, hopes of eternal love and harmony, are nothing but
a desire to delude herself and me. She is charming and exquisite—who
denies it? But she has turned my life upside down; what I have regarded
as trivial and nonsensical till now she has forced me to raise to the
level of a serious problem; I serve an idol whom I have never looked
upon as God. She is charming—exquisite, but for some reason now when I
am going home, I feel uneasy, as though I expected to meet with
something inconvenient at home, such as workmen pulling the stove to
pieces and blocking up the place with heaps of bricks. In fact, I am no
longer giving up to love a sous, but part of my peace of mind and my
nerves. And that''s bad."

"And she doesn''t hear this villain!" sighed Kukushkin. "My dear sir," he
said theatrically, "I will relieve you from the burdensome obligation to
love that adorable creature! I will wrest Zinaida Fyodorovna from you!"

They all began talking of Kukushkin''s indefatigable energy in love
affairs, how irresistible he was to women, and what a danger he was to
husbands; and how the devil would roast him in the other world for his
immorality in this. He screwed up his eyes and remained silent, and when
the names of ladies of their acquaintance were mentioned, he held up his
little finger—as though to say they mustn''t give away other people''s
secrets.

His friends understood, and began to take their leave. I remember that
Gruzin, who was a little drunk, was wearisomely long in getting off. He
put on his coat, which was cut like children''s coats in poor families,
pulled up the collar, and began telling some long-winded story; then,
seeing he was not listened to, he flung the rug that smelt of the
nursery over one shoulder, and with a guilty and imploring face begged
me to find his hat.

"She is a dear, she won''t be angry. My dear chief, come along! It''s
glorious weather; there''s snow and frost.... Upon my word, you want
shaking up a bit; you are out of humour. I don''t know what the devil is
the matter with you...."

"Shall I get drunk? All right, I''ll come," said Orlov after some
hesitation. "Wait a minute; I''ll get some money."

He went into the study, and Gruzin slouched in, too, dragging his rug
after him. A minute later both came back into the hall. Gruzin, a little
drunk and very pleased, was crumpling a ten-rouble note in his hands.

"We''ll settle up to-morrow," he said. "And she is kind, she won''t be
cross.... She is my Lisotchka''s godmother; I am fond of her, poor thing!
Ah, my dear fellow!" he laughed joyfully, and pressing his forehead on
Pekarsky''s back. "Ah, Pekarsky, my dear soul! Advocatissimus—as dry as
a biscuit, but you bet he is fond of women...."

"Fat ones," said Orlov, putting on his fur coat. "But let us get off, or
we shall be meeting her on the doorstep."

Zinaida Fyodorovna had lost her gold watch, a present from her father.
This loss surprised and alarmed her. She spent half a day going through
the rooms, looking helplessly on all the tables and on all the windows.
But the watch had disappeared completely.

Only three days afterwards Zinaida Fyodorovna, on coming in, left her
purse in the hall. Luckily for me, on that occasion it was not I but
Polya who helped her off with her coat. When the purse was missed, it
could not be found in the hall.

"Strange," said Zinaida Fyodorovna in bewilderment. "I distinctly
remember taking it out of my pocket to pay the cabman ... and then I put
it here near the looking-glass. It''s very odd!"

I had not stolen it, but I felt as though I had stolen it and had been
caught in the theft. Tears actually came into my eyes. When they were
seated at dinner, Zinaida Fyodorovna said to Orlov in French:

"There seem to be spirits in the flat. I lost my purse in the hall
to-day, and now, lo and behold, it is on my table. But it''s not quite a
disinterested trick of the spirits. They took out a gold coin and twenty
roubles in notes."

"You are always losing something; first it''s your watch and then it''s
your money ..." said Orlov. "Why is it nothing of the sort ever happens
to me?"

A minute later Zinaida Fyodorovna had forgotten the trick played by the
spirits, and was telling with a laugh how the week before she had
ordered some notepaper and had forgotten to give her new address, and
the shop had sent the paper to her old home at her husband''s, who had to
pay twelve roubles for it. And suddenly she turned her eyes on Polya and
looked at her intently. She blushed as she did so, and was so confused
that she began talking of something else.

When I took in the coffee to the study, Orlov was standing with his back
to the fire and she was sitting in an arm-chair facing him.

"I am not in a bad temper at all," she was saying in French. "But I have
been putting things together, and now I see it clearly. I can give you
the day and the hour when she stole my watch. And the purse? There can
be no doubt about it. Oh!" she laughed as she took the coffee from me.
"Now I understand why I am always losing my handkerchiefs and gloves.
Whatever you say, I shall dismiss the magpie to-morrow and send Stepan
for my Sofya. She is not a thief and has not got such a repulsive
appearance."

"You are out of humour. To-morrow you will feel differently, and will
realise that you can''t discharge people simply because you suspect
them."

"It''s not suspicion; it''s certainty," said Zinaida Fyodorovna. "So long
as I suspected that unhappy-faced, poor-looking valet of yours, I said
nothing. It''s too bad of you not to believe me, George."

"If we think differently about anything, it doesn''t follow that I don''t
believe you. You may be right," said Orlov, turning round and flinging
his cigarette-end into the fire, "but there is no need to be excited
about it, anyway. In fact, I must say, I never expected my humble
establishment would cause you so much serious worry and agitation.
You''ve lost a gold coin: never mind—you may have a hundred of mine; but
to change my habits, to pick up a new housemaid, to wait till she is
used to the place—all that''s a tedious, tiring business and does not
suit me. Our present maid certainly is fat, and has, perhaps, a weakness
for gloves and handkerchiefs, but she is perfectly well behaved, well
trained, and does not shriek when Kukushkin pinches her."

"Yes, I am jealous," she repeated, and tears glistened in her eyes. "No,
it''s something worse ... which I find it difficult to find a name for."
She pressed her hands on her temples, and went on impulsively. "You men
are so disgusting! It''s horrible!"

"I''ve not seen it; I don''t know; but they say that you men begin with
housemaids as boys, and get so used to it that you feel no repugnance. I
don''t know, I don''t know, but I have actually read.... George, of
course you are right," she said, going up to Orlov and changing to a
caressing and imploring tone. "I really am out of humour to-day. But,
you must understand, I can''t help it. She disgusts me and I am afraid of
her. It makes me miserable to see her."

"Surely you can rise above such paltriness?" said Orlov, shrugging his
shoulders in perplexity, and walking away from the fire. "Nothing could
be simpler: take no notice of her, and then she won''t disgust you, and
you won''t need to make a regular tragedy out of a trifle."

I went out of the study, and I don''t know what answer Orlov received.
Whatever it was, Polya remained. After that Zinaida Fyodorovna never
applied to her for anything, and evidently tried to dispense with her
services. When Polya handed her anything or even passed by her, jingling
her bangle and rustling her skirts, she shuddered.

I believe that if Gruzin or Pekarsky had asked Orlov to dismiss Polya he
would have done so without the slightest hesitation, without troubling
about any explanations. He was easily persuaded, like all indifferent
people. But in his relations with Zinaida Fyodorovna he displayed for
some reason, even in trifles, an obstinacy which sometimes was almost
irrational. I knew beforehand that if Zinaida Fyodorovna liked anything,
it would be certain not to please Orlov. When on coming in from shopping
she made haste to show him with pride some new purchase, he would glance
at it and say coldly that the more unnecessary objects they had in the
flat, the less airy it would be. It sometimes happened that after
putting on his dress clothes to go out somewhere, and after saying
good-bye to Zinaida Fyodorovna, he would suddenly change his mind and
remain at home from sheer perversity. I used to think that he remained
at home then simply in order to feel injured.

"Why are you staying?" said Zinaida Fyodorovna, with a show of vexation,
though at the same time she was radiant with delight. "Why do you? You
are not accustomed to spending your evenings at home, and I don''t want
you to alter your habits on my account. Do go out as usual, if you don''t
want me to feel guilty."

With the air of a victim he stretched himself in his easy-chair in the
study, and shading his eyes with his hand, took up a book. But soon the
book dropped from his hand, he turned heavily in his chair, and again
screened his eyes as though from the sun. Now he felt annoyed that he
had not gone out.

"May I come in?" Zinaida Fyodorovna would say, coming irresolutely into
the study. "Are you reading? I felt dull by myself, and have come just
for a minute ... to have a peep at you."

I remember one evening she went in like that, irresolutely and
inappropriately, and sank on the rug at Orlov''s feet, and from her soft,
timid movements one could see that she did not understand his mood and
was afraid.

"You are always reading ..." she said cajolingly, evidently wishing to
flatter him. "Do you know, George, what is one of the secrets of your
success? You are very clever and well-read. What book have you there?"

Orlov answered. A silence followed for some minutes which seemed to me
very long. I was standing in the drawing-room, from which I could watch
them, and was afraid of coughing.

"There is something I wanted to tell you," said Zinaida Fyodorovna, and
she laughed; "shall I? Very likely you''ll laugh and say that I flatter
myself. You know I want, I want horribly to believe that you are staying
at home to-night for my sake ... that we might spend the evening
together. Yes? May I think so?"

"Do," he said, screening his eyes. "The really happy man is he who
thinks not only of what is, but of what is not."

"That was a long sentence which I did not quite understand. You mean
happy people live in their imagination. Yes, that''s true. I love to sit
in your study in the evening and let my thoughts carry me far, far
away.... It''s pleasant sometimes to dream. Let us dream aloud,
George."

"You are out of humour?" said Zinaida Fyodorovna, taking Orlov''s hand.
"Tell me why. When you are like that, I''m afraid. I don''t know whether
your head aches or whether you are angry with me...."

"Why have you changed?" she said softly. "Why are you never so tender or
so gay as you used to be at Znamensky Street? I''ve been with you almost
a month, but it seems to me as though we had not yet begun to live, and
have not yet talked of anything as we ought to. You always answer me
with jokes or else with a long cold lecture like a teacher. And there is
something cold in your jokes.... Why have you given up talking to me
seriously?"

"Let us talk of our life, of our future," said Zinaida Fyodorovna
dreamily. "I keep making plans for our life, plans and plans—and I
enjoy doing it so! George, I''ll begin with the question, when are you
going to give up your post?"

"My views?" Orlov repeated. "My views? In conviction and temperament I
am an ordinary official, one of Shtchedrin''s heroes. You take me for
something different, I venture to assure you."

"Not in the least. The service does not satisfy me, perhaps; but,
anyway, it is better for me than anything else. I am used to it, and in
it I meet men of my own sort; I am in my place there and find it
tolerable."

"Indeed? If I resign my post, take to dreaming aloud and letting myself
be carried away into another world, do you suppose that that world would
be less hateful to me than the service?"

"You are ready to libel yourself in order to contradict me." Zinaida
Fyodorovna was offended and got up. "I am sorry I began this talk."

"Why are you angry? I am not angry with you for not being an official.
Every one lives as he likes best."

"Why, do you live as you like best? Are you free? To spend your life
writing documents that are opposed to your own ideas," Zinaida
Fyodorovna went on, clasping her hands in despair: "to submit to
authority, congratulate your superiors at the New Year, and then cards
and nothing but cards: worst of all, to be working for a system which
must be distasteful to you—no, George, no! You should not make such
horrid jokes. It''s dreadful. You are a man of ideas, and you ought to be
working for your ideas and nothing else."

"Say simply that you don''t want to talk to me. You dislike me, that''s
all," said Zinaida Fyodorovna through her tears.

"Look here, my dear," said Orlov admonishingly, sitting up in his chair.
"You were pleased to observe yourself that I am a clever, well-read man,
and to teach one who knows does nothing but harm. I know very well all
the ideas, great and small, which you mean when you call me a man of
ideas. So if I prefer the service and cards to those ideas, you may be
sure I have good grounds for it. That''s one thing. Secondly, you have,
so far as I know, never been in the service, and can only have drawn
your ideas of Government service from anecdotes and indifferent novels.
So it would not be amiss for us to make a compact, once for all, not to
talk of things we know already or of things about which we are not
competent to speak."

"Why do you speak to me like that?" said Zinaida Fyodorovna, stepping
back as though in horror. "What for? George, for God''s sake, think
what you are saying!"

Her voice quivered and broke; she was evidently trying to restrain her
tears, but she suddenly broke into sobs.

"George, my darling, I am perishing!" she said in French, dropping
down before Orlov, and laying her head on his knees. "I am miserable, I
am exhausted. I can''t bear it, I can''t bear it.... In my childhood my
hateful, depraved stepmother, then my husband, now you ... you!... You
meet my mad love with coldness and irony.... And that horrible, insolent
servant," she went on, sobbing. "Yes, yes, I see: I am not your wife nor
your friend, but a woman you don''t respect because she has become your
mistress.... I shall kill myself!"

I had not expected that her words and her tears would make such an
impression on Orlov. He flushed, moved uneasily in his chair, and
instead of irony, his face wore a look of stupid, schoolboyish dismay.

"My darling, you misunderstood me," he muttered helplessly, touching her
hair and her shoulders. "Forgive me, I entreat you. I was unjust and I
hate myself."

"I insult you with my whining and complaints. You are a true, generous
... rare man—I am conscious of it every minute; but I''ve been horribly
depressed for the last few days ..."

"No, she must stay, George! Do you hear? I am not afraid of her
now.... One must rise above trifles and not imagine silly things. You
are right! You are a wonderful, rare person!"

She soon left off crying. With tears glistening on her eyelashes,
sitting on Orlov''s knee, she told him in a low voice something touching,
something like a reminiscence of childhood and youth. She stroked his
face, kissed him, and carefully examined his hands with the rings on
them and the charms on his watch-chain. She was carried away by what she
was saying, and by being near the man she loved, and probably because
her tears had cleared and refreshed her soul, there was a note of
wonderful candour and sincerity in her voice. And Orlov played with her
chestnut hair and kissed her hands, noiselessly pressing them to his
lips.

Then they had tea in the study, and Zinaida Fyodorovna read aloud some
letters. Soon after midnight they went to bed. I had a fearful pain in
my side that night, and I could not get warm or go to sleep till
morning. I could hear Orlov go from the bedroom into his study. After
sitting there about an hour, he rang the bell. In my pain and exhaustion
I forgot all the rules and conventions, and went to his study in my
night attire, barefooted. Orlov, in his dressing-gown and cap, was
standing in the doorway, waiting for me.

I was about to apologise, but suddenly broke into a violent cough, and
clutched at the side of the door to save myself from falling.

I believe it was the first time of our acquaintance that he addressed me
not in the singular—goodness knows why. Most likely, in my night
clothes and with my face distorted by coughing, I played my part poorly,
and was very little like a flunkey.

While hurriedly getting into my coat, I put up and lighted fresh
candles. He was sitting at the table, with feet stretched out on a low
chair, cutting a book.

I left him deeply engrossed, and the book did not drop out of his hands
as it had done in the evening.

Now that I am writing these lines I am restrained by that dread of
appearing sentimental and ridiculous, in which I have been trained from
childhood; when I want to be affectionate or to say anything tender, I
don''t know how to be natural. And it is that dread, together with lack
of practice, that prevents me from being able to express with perfect
clearness what was passing in my soul at that time.

I was not in love with Zinaida Fyodorovna, but in the ordinary human
feeling I had for her, there was far more youth, freshness, and
joyousness than in Orlov''s love.

As I worked in the morning, cleaning boots or sweeping the rooms, I
waited with a thrill at my heart for the moment when I should hear her
voice and her footsteps. To stand watching her as she drank her coffee
in the morning or ate her lunch, to hold her fur coat for her in the
hall, and to put the goloshes on her little feet while she rested her
hand on my shoulder; then to wait till the hall porter rang up for me,
to meet her at the door, cold, and rosy, powdered with the snow, to
listen to her brief exclamations about the frost or the cabman—if only
you knew how much all that meant to me! I longed to be in love, to have
a wife and child of my own. I wanted my future wife to have just such a
face, such a voice. I dreamed of it at dinner, and in the street when I
was sent on some errand, and when I lay awake at night. Orlov rejected
with disgust children, cooking, copper saucepans, and feminine
knicknacks and I gathered them all up, tenderly cherished them in my
dreams, loved them, and begged them of destiny. I had visions of a wife,
a nursery, a little house with garden paths....

I knew that if I did love her I could never dare hope for the miracle of
her returning my love, but that reflection did not worry me. In my
quiet, modest feeling akin to ordinary affection, there was no jealousy
of Orlov or even envy of him, since I realised that for a wreck like me
happiness was only to be found in dreams.

When Zinaida Fyodorovna sat up night after night for her George,
looking immovably at a book of which she never turned a page, or when
she shuddered and turned pale at Polya''s crossing the room, I suffered
with her, and the idea occurred to me to lance this festering wound as
quickly as possible by letting her know what was said here at supper on
Thursdays; but—how was it to be done? More and more often I saw her
tears. For the first weeks she laughed and sang to herself, even when
Orlov was not at home, but by the second month there was a mournful
stillness in our flat broken only on Thursday evenings.

She flattered Orlov, and to wring from him a counterfeit smile or kiss,
was ready to go on her knees to him, to fawn on him like a dog. Even
when her heart was heaviest, she could not resist glancing into a
looking-glass if she passed one and straightening her hair. It seemed
strange to me that she could still take an interest in clothes and go
into ecstasies over her purchases. It did not seem in keeping with her
genuine grief. She paid attention to the fashions and ordered expensive
dresses. What for? On whose account? I particularly remember one dress
which cost four hundred roubles. To give four hundred roubles for an
unnecessary, useless dress while women for their hard day''s work get
only twenty kopecks a day without food, and the makers of Venice and
Brussels lace are only paid half a franc a day on the supposition that
they can earn the rest by immorality! And it seemed strange to me that
Zinaida Fyodorovna was not conscious of it; it vexed me. But she had
only to go out of the house for me to find excuses and explanations for
everything, and to be waiting eagerly for the hall porter to ring for
me.

She treated me as a flunkey, a being of a lower order. One may pat a
dog, and yet not notice it; I was given orders and asked questions, but
my presence was not observed. My master and mistress thought it unseemly
to say more to me than is usually said to servants; if when waiting at
dinner I had laughed or put in my word in the conversation, they would
certainly have thought I was mad and have dismissed me. Zinaida
Fyodorovna was favourably disposed to me, all the same. When she was
sending me on some errand or explaining to me the working of a new lamp
or anything of that sort, her face was extraordinarily kind, frank, and
cordial, and her eyes looked me straight in the face. At such moments I
always fancied she remembered with gratitude how I used to bring her
letters to Znamensky Street. When she rang the bell, Polya, who
considered me her favourite and hated me for it, used to say with a
jeering smile:

Zinaida Fyodorovna considered me as a being of a lower order, and did
not suspect that if any one in the house were in a humiliating position
it was she. She did not know that I, a footman, was unhappy on her
account, and used to ask myself twenty times a day what was in store for
her and how it would all end. Things were growing visibly worse day by
day. After the evening on which they had talked of his official work,
Orlov, who could not endure tears, unmistakably began to avoid
conversation with her; whenever Zinaida Fyodorovna began to argue, or to
beseech him, or seemed on the point of crying, he seized some plausible
excuse for retreating to his study or going out. He more and more rarely
slept at home, and still more rarely dined there: on Thursdays he was
the one to suggest some expedition to his friends. Zinaida Fyodorovna
was still dreaming of having the cooking done at home, of moving to a
new flat, of travelling abroad, but her dreams remained dreams. Dinner
was sent in from the restaurant. Orlov asked her not to broach the
question of moving until after they had come back from abroad, and
apropos of their foreign tour, declared that they could not go till his
hair had grown long, as one could not go trailing from hotel to hotel
and serving the idea without long hair.

To crown it all, in Orlov''s absence, Kukushkin began calling at the flat
in the evening. There was nothing exceptional in his behaviour, but I
could never forget the conversation in which he had offered to cut Orlov
out. He was regaled with tea and red wine, and he used to titter and,
anxious to say something pleasant, would declare that a free union was
superior in every respect to legal marriage, and that all decent people
ought really to come to Zinaida Fyodorovna and fall at her feet.

Christmas was spent drearily in vague anticipations of calamity. On New
Year''s Eve Orlov unexpectedly announced at breakfast that he was being
sent to assist a senator who was on a revising commission in a certain
province.

"I don''t want to go, but I can''t find an excuse to get off," he said
with vexation. "I must go; there''s nothing for it."

"I am glad, really, you are going," she said after a moment''s thought.
"It will be a change for you. You will fall in love with some one on the
way, and tell me about it afterwards."

At every opportunity she tried to make Orlov feel that she did not
restrict his liberty in any way, and that he could do exactly as he
liked, and this artless, transparent strategy deceived no one, and only
unnecessarily reminded Orlov that he was not free.

Zinaida Fyodorovna wanted to see him off at the station, but he
dissuaded her, saying that he was not going to America, and not going to
be away five years, but only five days—possibly less.

The parting took place between seven and eight. He put one arm round
her, and kissed her on the lips and on the forehead.

"Be a good girl, and don''t be depressed while I am away," he said in a
warm, affectionate tone which touched even me. "God keep you!"

She looked greedily into his face, to stamp his dear features on her
memory, then she put her arms gracefully round his neck and laid her
head on his breast.

"Forgive me our misunderstandings," she said in French. "Husband and
wife cannot help quarrelling if they love each other, and I love you
madly. Don''t forget me.... Wire to me often and fully."

Orlov kissed her once more, and, without saying a word, went out in
confusion. When he heard the click of the lock as the door closed, he
stood still in the middle of the staircase in hesitation and glanced
upwards. It seemed to me that if a sound had reached him at that moment
from above, he would have turned back. But all was quiet. He
straightened his coat and went downstairs irresolutely.

The sledges had been waiting a long while at the door. Orlov got into
one, I got into the other with two portmanteaus. It was a hard frost and
there were fires smoking at the cross-roads. The cold wind nipped my
face and hands, and took my breath away as we drove rapidly along; and,
closing my eyes, I thought what a splendid woman she was. How she loved
him! Even useless rubbish is collected in the courtyards nowadays and
used for some purpose, even broken glass is considered a useful
commodity, but something so precious, so rare, as the love of a refined,
young, intelligent, and good woman is utterly thrown away and wasted.
One of the early sociologists regarded every evil passion as a force
which might by judicious management be turned to good, while among us
even a fine, noble passion springs up and dies away in impotence, turned
to no account, misunderstood or vulgarised. Why is it?

The sledges stopped unexpectedly. I opened my eyes and I saw that we had
come to a standstill in Sergievsky Street, near a big house where
Pekarsky lived. Orlov got out of the sledge and vanished into the entry.
Five minutes later Pekarsky''s footman came out, bareheaded, and, angry
with the frost, shouted to me:

At a complete loss, I went to the first storey. I had been to Pekarsky''s
flat before—that is, I had stood in the hall and looked into the
drawing-room, and, after the damp, gloomy street, it always struck me by
the brilliance of its picture-frames, its bronzes and expensive
furniture. To-day in the midst of this splendour I saw Gruzin,
Kukushkin, and, after a minute, Orlov.

"Look here, Stepan," he said, coming up to me. "I shall be staying here
till Friday or Saturday. If any letters or telegrams come, you must
bring them here every day. At home, of course you will say that I have
gone, and send my greetings. Now you can go."

When I reached home Zinaida Fyodorovna was lying on the sofa in the
drawing-room, eating a pear. There was only one candle burning in the
candelabra.

I went into my room and I, too, lay down. I had nothing to do, and I did
not want to read. I was not surprised and I was not indignant. I only
racked my brains to think why this deception was necessary. It is only
boys in their teens who deceive their mistresses like that. How was it
that a man who had thought and read so much could not imagine anything
more sensible? I must confess I had by no means a poor opinion of his
intelligence. I believe if he had had to deceive his minister or any
other influential person he would have put a great deal of skill and
energy into doing so; but to deceive a woman, the first idea that
occurred to him was evidently good enough. If it succeeded—well and
good; if it did not, there would be no harm done—he could tell some
other lie just as quickly and simply, with no mental effort.

At midnight when the people on the floor overhead were moving their
chairs and shouting hurrah to welcome the New Year, Zinaida Fyodorovna
rang for me from the room next to the study. Languid from lying down so
long, she was sitting at the table, writing something on a scrap of
paper.

"I must send a telegram," she said, with a smile. "Go to the station as
quick as you can and ask them to send it after him."

"May the New Year bring new happiness. Make haste and telegraph; I miss
you dreadfully. It seems an eternity. I am only sorry I can''t send a
thousand kisses and my very heart by telegraph. Enjoy yourself, my
darling.—ZINA."

The worst of it was that Orlov had thoughtlessly let Polya, too, into
the secret of his deception, telling her to bring his shirts to
Sergievsky Street. After that, she looked at Zinaida Fyodorovna with a
malignant joy and hatred I could not understand, and was never tired of
snorting with delight to herself in her own room and in the hall.

"She''s outstayed her welcome; it''s time she took herself off!" she would
say with zest. "She ought to realise that herself...."

She already divined by instinct that Zinaida Fyodorovna would not be
with us much longer, and, not to let the chance slip, carried off
everything she set her eyes on—smelling-bottles, tortoise-shell
hairpins, handkerchiefs, shoes! On the day after New Year''s Day, Zinaida
Fyodorovna summoned me to her room and told me in a low voice that she
missed her black dress. And then she walked through all the rooms, with
a pale, frightened, and indignant face, talking to herself:

At dinner she tried to help herself to soup, but could not—her hands
were trembling. Her lips were trembling, too. She looked helplessly at
the soup and at the little pies, waiting for the trembling to pass off,
and suddenly she could not resist looking at Polya.

"There''s no need for you to stay. You go away altogether," Zinaida
Fyodorovna went on, getting up in great agitation. "You may look out for
another place. You can go at once."

"You can take orders from me, too! I am mistress here!" said Zinaida
Fyodorovna, and she flushed crimson.

"You dare not stay here another minute!" cried Zinaida Fyodorovna, and
she struck the plate with her knife. "You are a thief! Do you hear?"

Zinaida Fyodorovna flung her dinner-napkin on the table, and with a
pitiful, suffering face, went quickly out of the room. Loudly sobbing
and wailing something indistinct, Polya, too, went away. The soup and
the grouse got cold. And for some reason all the restaurant dainties on
the table struck me as poor, thievish, like Polya. Two pies on a plate
had a particularly miserable and guilty air. "We shall be taken back to
the restaurant to-day," they seemed to be saying, "and to-morrow we
shall be put on the table again for some official or celebrated singer."

"She is a fine lady, indeed," I heard uttered in Polya''s room. "I could
have been a lady like that long ago, but I have some self-respect! We''ll
see which of us will be the first to go!"

Zinaida Fyodorovna rang the bell. She was sitting in her room, in the
corner, looking as though she had been put in the corner as a
punishment.

"Ask the porter; perhaps there is a telegram. And don''t leave the
house," she called after me. "I am afraid to be left alone."

After that I had to run down almost every hour to ask the porter whether
a telegram had come. I must own it was a dreadful time! To avoid seeing
Polya, Zinaida Fyodorovna dined and had tea in her own room; it was here
that she slept, too, on a short sofa like a half-moon, and she made her
own bed. For the first days I took the telegrams; but, getting no
answer, she lost her faith in me and began telegraphing herself. Looking
at her, I, too, began impatiently hoping for a telegram. I hoped he
would contrive some deception, would make arrangements, for instance,
that a telegram should be sent to her from some station. If he were too
much engrossed with cards or had been attracted by some other woman, I
thought that both Gruzin and Kukushkin would remind him of us. But our
expectations were vain. Five times a day I would go in to Zinaida
Fyodorovna, intending to tell her the truth. But her eyes looked piteous
as a fawn''s, her shoulders seemed to droop, her lips were moving, and I
went away again without saying a word. Pity and sympathy seemed to rob
me of all manliness. Polya, as cheerful and well satisfied with herself
as though nothing had happened, was tidying the master''s study and the
bedroom, rummaging in the cupboards, and making the crockery jingle, and
when she passed Zinaida Fyodorovna''s door, she hummed something and
coughed. She was pleased that her mistress was hiding from her. In the
evening she would go out somewhere, and rang at two or three o''clock in
the morning, and I had to open the door to her and listen to remarks
about my cough. Immediately afterwards I would hear another ring; I
would run to the room next to the study, and Zinaida Fyodorovna, putting
her head out of the door, would ask, "Who was it rung?" while she looked
at my hands to see whether I had a telegram.

When at last on Saturday the bell rang below and she heard the familiar
voice on the stairs, she was so delighted that she broke into sobs. She
rushed to meet him, embraced him, kissed him on the breast and sleeves,
said something one could not understand. The hall porter brought up the
portmanteaus; Polya''s cheerful voice was heard. It was as though some
one had come home for the holidays.

"Why didn''t you wire?" asked Zinaida Fyodorovna, breathless with joy.
"Why was it? I have been in misery; I don''t know how I''ve lived through
it.... Oh, my God!"

"It was very simple! I returned with the senator to Moscow the very
first day, and didn''t get your telegrams," said Orlov. "After dinner, my
love, I''ll give you a full account of my doings, but now I must sleep
and sleep.... I am worn out with the journey."

It was evident that he had not slept all night; he had probably been
playing cards and drinking freely. Zinaida Fyodorovna put him to bed,
and we all walked about on tiptoe all that day. The dinner went off
quite satisfactorily, but when they went into the study and had coffee
the explanation began. Zinaida Fyodorovna began talking of something
rapidly in a low voice; she spoke in French, and her words flowed like a
stream. Then I heard a loud sigh from Orlov, and his voice.

"My God!" he said in French. "Have you really nothing fresher to tell me
than this everlasting tale of your servant''s misdeeds?"

"But why is it she doesn''t rob me or say insulting things to me? Why is
it I never notice the maids nor the porters nor the footmen? My dear,
you are simply capricious and refuse to know your own mind.... I really
begin to suspect that you must be in a certain condition. When I offered
to let her go, you insisted on her remaining, and now you want me to
turn her away. I can be obstinate, too, in such cases. You want her to
go, but I want her to remain. That''s the only way to cure you of your
nerves."

"Oh, very well, very well," said Zinaida Fyodorovna in alarm. "Let us
say no more about that.... Let us put it off till to-morrow.... Now tell
me about Moscow.... What is going on in Moscow?"

After lunch next day—it was the seventh of January, St. John the
Baptist''s Day—Orlov put on his black dress coat and his decoration to
go to visit his father and congratulate him on his name day. He had to
go at two o''clock, and it was only half-past one when he had finished
dressing. What was he to do for that half-hour? He walked about the
drawing-room, declaiming some congratulatory verses which he had recited
as a child to his father and mother.

Zinaida Fyodorovna, who was just going out to a dressmaker''s or to the
shops, was sitting, listening to him with a smile. I don''t know how
their conversation began, but when I took Orlov his gloves, he was
standing before her with a capricious, beseeching face, saying:

"For God''s sake, in the name of everything that''s holy, don''t talk of
things that everybody knows! What an unfortunate gift our intellectual
thoughtful ladies have for talking with enthusiasm and an air of
profundity of things that every schoolboy is sick to death of! Ah, if
only you would exclude from our conjugal programme all these serious
questions! How grateful I should be to you!"

"I give you full liberty to be as liberal as you like, and quote from
any authors you choose, but make me one concession: don''t hold forth in
my presence on either of two subjects: the corruption of the upper
classes and the evils of the marriage system. Do understand me, at last.
The upper class is always abused in contrast with the world of
tradesmen, priests, workmen and peasants, Sidors and Nikitas of all
sorts. I detest both classes, but if I had honestly to choose between
the two, I should without hesitation, prefer the upper class, and there
would be no falsity or affectation about it, since all my tastes are in
that direction. Our world is trivial and empty, but at any rate we speak
French decently, read something, and don''t punch each other in the ribs
even in our most violent quarrels, while the Sidors and the Nikitas and
their worships in trade talk about ''being quite agreeable,'' ''in a
jiffy,'' ''blast your eyes,'' and display the utmost license of pothouse
manners and the most degrading superstition."

"Yes, but what of it? That''s not only to my discredit, but to theirs
too. They feed me and take off their caps to me, so it seems they have
not the intelligence and honesty to do otherwise. I don''t blame or
praise any one: I only mean that the upper class and the lower are as
bad as one another. My feelings and my intelligence are opposed to both,
but my tastes lie more in the direction of the former. Well, now for the
evils of marriage," Orlov went on, glancing at his watch. "It''s high
time for you to understand that there are no evils in the system itself;
what is the matter is that you don''t know yourselves what you want from
marriage. What is it you want? In legal and illegal cohabitation, in
every sort of union and cohabitation, good or bad, the underlying
reality is the same. You ladies live for that underlying reality alone:
for you it''s everything; your existence would have no meaning for you
without it. You want nothing but that, and you get it; but since you''ve
taken to reading novels you are ashamed of it: you rush from pillar to
post, you recklessly change your men, and to justify this turmoil you
have begun talking of the evils of marriage. So long as you can''t and
won''t renounce what underlies it all, your chief foe, your devil—so
long as you serve that slavishly, what use is there in discussing the
matter seriously? Everything you may say to me will be falsity and
affectation. I shall not believe you."

I went to find out from the hall porter whether the sledge was at the
door, and when I came back I found it had become a quarrel. As sailors
say, a squall had blown up.

"I see you want to shock me by your cynicism today," said Zinaida
Fyodorovna, walking about the drawing-room in great emotion. "It revolts
me to listen to you. I am pure before God and man, and have nothing to
repent of. I left my husband and came to you, and am proud of it. I
swear, on my honour, I am proud of it!"

"If you are a decent, honest man, you, too, ought to be proud of what I
did. It raises you and me above thousands of people who would like to do
as we have done, but do not venture through cowardice or petty prudence.
But you are not a decent man. You are afraid of freedom, and you mock
the promptings of genuine feeling, from fear that some ignoramus may
suspect you of being sincere. You are afraid to show me to your friends;
there''s no greater infliction for you than to go about with me in the
street.... Isn''t that true? Why haven''t you introduced me to your father
or your cousin all this time? Why is it? No, I am sick of it at last,"
cried Zinaida Fyodorovna, stamping. "I demand what is mine by right. You
must present me to your father."

"If you want to know him, go and present yourself. He receives visitors
every morning from ten till half-past."

"How base you are!" said Zinaida Fyodorovna, wringing her hands in
despair. "Even if you are not sincere, and are not saying what you
think, I might hate you for your cruelty. Oh, how base you are!"

"We keep going round and round and never reach the real point. The real
point is that you made a mistake, and you won''t acknowledge it aloud.
You imagined that I was a hero, and that I had some extraordinary ideas
and ideals, and it has turned out that I am a most ordinary official, a
cardplayer, and have no partiality for ideas of any sort. I am a worthy
representative of the rotten world from which you have run away because
you were revolted with its triviality and emptiness. Recognise it and be
just: don''t be indignant with me, but with yourself, as it is your
mistake, and not mine."

"Well, that''s all right, then. We''ve reached that point at last, thank
God. Now hear something more, if you please: I can''t rise to your
level—I am too depraved; you can''t descend to my level, either, for you
are too exalted. So there is only one thing left to do...."

"What?" Zinaida Fyodorovna asked quickly, holding her breath and turning
suddenly as white as a sheet of paper.

"Georgy, why are you torturing me?" Zinaida Fyodorovna said suddenly in
Russian in a breaking voice. "What is it for? Think of my misery...."

Orlov, afraid of tears, went quickly into his study, and I don''t know
why—whether it was that he wished to cause her extra pain, or whether
he remembered it was usually done in such cases—he locked the door
after him. She cried out and ran after him with a rustle of her skirt.

"What does this mean?" she cried, knocking at his door. "What ... what
does this mean?" she repeated in a shrill voice breaking with
indignation. "Ah, so this is what you do! Then let me tell you I hate
you, I despise you! Everything is over between us now."

I heard hysterical weeping mingled with laughter. Something small in the
drawing-room fell off the table and was broken. Orlov went out into the
hall by another door, and, looking round him nervously, he hurriedly put
on his great-coat and went out.

Half an hour passed, an hour, and she was still weeping. I remembered
that she had no father or mother, no relations, and here she was living
between a man who hated her and Polya, who robbed her—and how desolate
her life seemed to me! I do not know why, but I went into the
drawing-room to her. Weak and helpless, looking with her lovely hair
like an embodiment of tenderness and grace, she was in anguish, as
though she were ill; she was lying on a couch, hiding her face, and
quivering all over.

"No, there''s no need ... it''s nothing," she said, and she looked at me
with her tear-stained eyes. "I have a little headache.... Thank you."

I went out, and in the evening she was writing letter after letter, and
sent me out first to Pekarsky, then to Gruzin, then to Kukushkin, and
finally anywhere I chose, if only I could find Orlov and give him the
letter. Every time I came back with the letter she scolded me, entreated
me, thrust money into my hand—as though she were in a fever. And all
the night she did not sleep, but sat in the drawing-room, talking to
herself.

The first Thursday afterwards Orlov complained to his friends of the
intolerable life he led; he smoked a great deal, and said with
irritation:

"It is no life at all; it''s the rack. Tears, wailing, intellectual
conversations, begging for forgiveness, again tears and wailing; and the
long and the short of it is that I have no flat of my own now. I am
wretched, and I make her wretched. Surely I haven''t to live another
month or two like this? How can I? But yet I may have to."

"I''ve tried, but I can''t. One can boldly tell the truth, whatever it may
be, to an independent, rational man; but in this case one has to do with
a creature who has no will, no strength of character, and no logic. I
cannot endure tears; they disarm me. When she cries, I am ready to swear
eternal love and cry myself."

"She wants me, not the flat. But what''s the good of talking?" sighed
Orlov. "I only hear endless conversations, but no way out of my
position. It certainly is a case of ''being guilty without guilt.'' I
don''t claim to be a mushroom, but it seems I''ve got to go into the
basket. The last thing I''ve ever set out to be is a hero. I never could
endure Turgenev''s novels; and now, all of a sudden, as though to spite
me, I''ve heroism forced upon me. I assure her on my honour that I''m not
a hero at all, I adduce irrefutable proofs of the same, but she doesn''t
believe me. Why doesn''t she believe me? I suppose I really must have
something of the appearance of a hero."

A week after this conversation Orlov announced that he was again ordered
to attend the senator, and the same evening he went off with his
portmanteaus to Pekarsky.

An old man of sixty, in a long fur coat reaching to the ground, and a
beaver cap, was standing at the door.

At first I thought it was one of the moneylenders, Gruzin''s creditors,
who sometimes used to come to Orlov for small payments on account; but
when he came into the hall and flung open his coat, I saw the thick
brows and the characteristically compressed lips which I knew so well
from the photographs, and two rows of stars on the uniform. I recognised
him: it was Orlov''s father, the distinguished statesman.

I answered that Georgy Ivanitch was not at home. The old man pursed up
his lips tightly and looked into space, reflecting, showing me his
dried-up, toothless profile.

He left his goloshes in the hall, and, without taking off his long,
heavy fur coat, went into the study. There he sat down before the table,
and, before taking up the pen, for three minutes he pondered, shading
his eyes with his hand as though from the sun—exactly as his son did
when he was out of humour. His face was sad, thoughtful, with that look
of resignation which I have only seen on the faces of the old and
religious. I stood behind him, gazed at his bald head and at the hollow
at the nape of his neck, and it was clear as daylight to me that this
weak old man was now in my power. There was not a soul in the flat
except my enemy and me. I had only to use a little physical violence,
then snatch his watch to disguise the object of the crime, and to get
off by the back way, and I should have gained infinitely more than I
could have imagined possible when I took up the part of a footman. I
thought that I could hardly get a better opportunity. But instead of
acting, I looked quite unconcernedly, first at his bald patch and then
at his fur, and calmly meditated on this man''s relation to his only son,
and on the fact that people spoiled by power and wealth probably don''t
want to die....

He finished the letter and stood up. I still had time. I urged myself on
and clenched my fists, trying to wring out of my soul some trace of my
former hatred; I recalled what a passionate, implacable, obstinate hate
I had felt for him only a little while before.... But it is difficult to
strike a match against a crumbling stone. The sad old face and the cold
glitter of his stars roused in me nothing but petty, cheap, unnecessary
thoughts of the transitoriness of everything earthly, of the nearness of
death....

There could be no doubt about it: I had undergone a change; I had become
different. To convince myself, I began to recall the past, but at once I
felt uneasy, as though I had accidentally peeped into a dark, damp
corner. I remembered my comrades and friends, and my first thought was
how I should blush in confusion if ever I met any of them. What was I
now? What had I to think of and to do? Where was I to go? What was I
living for?

I could make nothing of it. I only knew one thing—that I must make
haste to pack my things and be off. Before the old man''s visit my
position as a flunkey had a meaning; now it was absurd. Tears dropped
into my open portmanteau; I felt insufferably sad; but how I longed to
live! I was ready to embrace and include in my short life every
possibility open to man. I wanted to speak, to read, and to hammer in
some big factory, and to stand on watch, and to plough. I yearned for
the Nevsky Prospect, for the sea and the fields—for every place to
which my imagination travelled. When Zinaida Fyodorovna came in, I
rushed to open the door for her, and with peculiar tenderness took off
her fur coat. The last time!

We had two other visitors that day besides the old man. In the evening
when it was quite dark, Gruzin came to fetch some papers for Orlov. He
opened the table-drawer, took the necessary papers, and, rolling them
up, told me to put them in the hall beside his cap while he went in to
see Zinaida Fyodorovna. She was lying on the sofa in the drawing-room,
with her arms behind her head. Five or six days had already passed since
Orlov went on his tour of inspection, and no one knew when he would be
back, but this time she did not send telegrams and did not expect them.
She did not seem to notice the presence of Polya, who was still living
with us. "So be it, then," was what I read on her passionless and very
pale face. Like Orlov, she wanted to be unhappy out of obstinacy. To
spite herself and everything in the world, she lay for days together on
the sofa, desiring and expecting nothing but evil for herself. Probably
she was picturing to herself Orlov''s return and the inevitable quarrels
with him; then his growing indifference to her, his infidelities; then
how they would separate; and perhaps these agonising thoughts gave her
satisfaction. But what would she have said if she found out the actual
truth?

"I love you, Godmother," said Gruzin, greeting her and kissing her hand.
"You are so kind! And so dear George has gone away," he lied. "He has
gone away, the rascal!"

"Let me spend an hour with you, my dear," he said. "I don''t want to go
home, and it''s too early to go to the Birshovs''. The Birshovs are
keeping their Katya''s birthday to-day. She is a nice child!"

I brought him a glass of tea and a decanter of brandy. He slowly and
with obvious reluctance drank the tea, and returning the glass to me,
asked timidly:

"To your health, my dear," he said to Zinaida Fyodorovna, and he tossed
off a glass of vodka. "My little girl, your godchild, sends you her
love. Poor child! she''s rickety. Ah, children, children!" he sighed.
"Whatever you may say, Godmother, it is nice to be a father. Dear
George can''t understand that feeling."

He drank some more. Pale and lean, with his dinner-napkin over his chest
like a little pinafore, he ate greedily, and raising his eyebrows, kept
looking guiltily, like a little boy, first at Zinaida Fyodorovna and
then at me. It seemed as though he would have begun crying if I had not
given him the grouse or the jelly. When he had satisfied his hunger he
grew more lively, and began laughingly telling some story about the
Birshov household, but perceiving that it was tiresome and that Zinaida
Fyodorovna was not laughing, he ceased. And there was a sudden feeling
of dreariness. After he had finished his dinner they sat in the
drawing-room by the light of a single lamp, and did not speak; it was
painful to him to lie to her, and she wanted to ask him something, but
could not make up her mind to. So passed half an hour. Gruzin glanced at
his watch.

Again they were silent. He sat down to the piano, struck one chord, then
began playing, and sang softly, "What does the coming day bring me?" but
as usual he got up suddenly and tossed his head.

"What shall I play?" he asked, shrugging his shoulders. "I have
forgotten everything. I''ve given it up long ago."

Looking at the ceiling as though trying to remember, he played two
pieces of Tchaikovsky with exquisite expression, with such warmth, such
insight! His face was just as usual—neither stupid nor intelligent—and
it seemed to me a perfect marvel that a man whom I was accustomed to see
in the midst of the most degrading, impure surroundings, was capable of
such purity, of rising to a feeling so lofty, so far beyond my reach.
Zinaida Fyodorovna''s face glowed, and she walked about the drawing-room
in emotion.

"Wait a bit, Godmother; if I can remember it, I will play you
something," he said; "I heard it played on the violoncello."

Beginning timidly and picking out the notes, and then gathering
confidence, he played Saint-SaÃ«ns''s "Swan Song." He played it through,
and then played it a second time.

"What am I to say?" he said, raising his eyebrows. "I love you and think
nothing but good of you. But if you wish that I should speak generally
about the question that interests you," he went on, rubbing his sleeve
near the elbow and frowning, "then, my dear, you know.... To follow
freely the promptings of the heart does not always give good people
happiness. To feel free and at the same time to be happy, it seems to
me, one must not conceal from oneself that life is coarse, cruel, and
merciless in its conservatism, and one must retaliate with what it
deserves—that is, be as coarse and as merciless in one''s striving for
freedom. That''s what I think."

"That''s beyond me," said Zinaida Fyodorovna, with a mournful smile. "I
am exhausted already. I am so exhausted that I wouldn''t stir a finger
for my own salvation."

He said this in jest, but after he had said it, tears glistened in
Zinaida Fyodorovna''s eyes and then in his.

"Well," he said, "we''ve been sitting and sitting, and now we must go.
Good-bye, dear Godmother. God give you health."

He kissed both her hands, and stroking them tenderly, said that he
should certainly come to see her again in a day or two. In the hall, as
he was putting on his overcoat, that was so like a child''s pelisse, he
fumbled long in his pockets to find a tip for me, but found nothing
there.

Zinaida Fyodorovna still walked about the room in her excitement. That
she was walking about and not still lying down was so much to the good.
I wanted to take advantage of this mood to speak to her openly and then
to go away, but I had hardly seen Gruzin out when I heard a ring. It was
Kukushkin.

"Is Georgy Ivanitch at home?" he said. "Has he come back? You say no?
What a pity! In that case, I''ll go in and kiss your mistress''s hand, and
so away. Zinaida Fyodorovna, may I come in?" he cried. "I want to kiss
your hand. Excuse my being so late."

He was not long in the drawing-room, not more than ten minutes, but I
felt as though he were staying a long while and would never go away. I
bit my lips from indignation and annoyance, and already hated Zinaida
Fyodorovna. "Why does she not turn him out?" I thought indignantly,
though it was evident that she was bored by his company.

When I held his fur coat for him he asked me, as a mark of special
good-will, how I managed to get on without a wife.

"But I don''t suppose you waste your time," he said, laughingly. "I''ve no
doubt Polya and you are as thick as thieves.... You rascal!"

In spite of my experience of life, I knew very little of mankind at that
time, and it is very likely that I often exaggerated what was of little
consequence and failed to observe what was important. It seemed to me it
was not without motive that Kukushkin tittered and flattered me. Could
it be that he was hoping that I, like a flunkey, would gossip in other
kitchens and servants'' quarters of his coming to see us in the evenings
when Orlov was away, and staying with Zinaida Fyodorovna till late at
night? And when my tittle-tattle came to the ears of his acquaintance,
he would drop his eyes in confusion and shake his little finger. And
would not he, I thought, looking at his little honeyed face, this very
evening at cards pretend and perhaps declare that he had already won
Zinaida Fyodorovna from Orlov?

That hatred which failed me at midday when the old father had come, took
possession of me now. Kukushkin went away at last, and as I listened to
the shuffle of his leather goloshes, I felt greatly tempted to fling
after him, as a parting shot, some coarse word of abuse, but I
restrained myself. And when the steps had died away on the stairs, I
went back to the hall, and, hardly conscious of what I was doing, took
up the roll of papers that Gruzin had left behind, and ran headlong
downstairs. Without cap or overcoat, I ran down into the street. It was
not cold, but big flakes of snow were falling and it was windy.

He stopped under a lamp-post and looked round with surprise. "Your
Excellency!" I said breathless, "your Excellency!"

And not able to think of anything to say, I hit him two or three times
on the face with the roll of paper. Completely at a loss, and hardly
wondering—I had so completely taken him by surprise—he leaned his back
against the lamp-post and put up his hands to protect his face. At that
moment an army doctor passed, and saw how I was beating the man, but he
merely looked at us in astonishment and went on. I felt ashamed and I
ran back to the house.

With my head wet from the snow, and gasping for breath, I ran to my
room, and immediately flung off my swallow-tails, put on a reefer jacket
and an overcoat, and carried my portmanteau out into the passage; I must
get away! But before going I hurriedly sat down and began writing to
Orlov:

"I leave you my false passport," I began. "I beg you to keep it as a
memento, you false man, you Petersburg official!

"To steal into another man''s house under a false name, to watch under
the mask of a flunkey this person''s intimate life, to hear everything,
to see everything in order later on, unasked, to accuse a man of
lying—all this, you will say, is on a level with theft. Yes, but I care
nothing for fine feelings now. I have endured dozens of your dinners and
suppers when you said and did what you liked, and I had to hear, to look
on, and be silent. I don''t want to make you a present of my silence.
Besides, if there is not a living soul at hand who dares to tell you the
truth without flattery, let your flunkey Stepan wash your magnificent
countenance for you."

The big windows with their dark curtains, the bed, the crumpled dress
coat on the floor, and my wet footprints, looked gloomy and forbidding.
And there was a peculiar stillness.

Possibly because I had run out into the street without my cap and
goloshes I was in a high fever. My face burned, my legs ached.... My
heavy head drooped over the table, and there was that kind of division
in my thought when every idea in the brain seemed dogged by its shadow.

"I am ill, weak, morally cast down," I went on; "I cannot write to you
as I should like to. From the first moment I desired to insult and
humiliate you, but now I do not feel that I have the right to do so. You
and I have both fallen, and neither of us will ever rise up again; and
even if my letter were eloquent, terrible, and passionate, it would
still seem like beating on the lid of a coffin: however one knocks upon
it, one will not wake up the dead! No efforts could warm your accursed
cold blood, and you know that better than I do. Why write? But my mind
and heart are burning, and I go on writing; for some reason I am moved
as though this letter still might save you and me. I am so feverish that
my thoughts are disconnected, and my pen scratches the paper without
meaning; but the question I want to put to you stands before me as clear
as though in letters of flame.

"Why I am prematurely weak and fallen is not hard to explain. Like
Samson of old, I have taken the gates of Gaza on my shoulders to carry
them to the top of the mountain, and only when I was exhausted, when
youth and health were quenched in me forever, I noticed that that burden
was not for my shoulders, and that I had deceived myself. I have been,
moreover, in cruel and continual pain. I have endured cold, hunger,
illness, and loss of liberty. Of personal happiness I know and have
known nothing. I have no home; my memories are bitter, and my conscience
is often in dread of them. But why have you fallen—you? What fatal,
diabolical causes hindered your life from blossoming into full flower?
Why, almost before beginning life, were you in such haste to cast off
the image and likeness of God, and to become a cowardly beast who backs
and scares others because he is afraid himself? You are afraid of
life—as afraid of it as an Oriental who sits all day on a cushion
smoking his hookah. Yes, you read a great deal, and a European coat fits
you well, but yet with what tender, purely Oriental, pasha-like care you
protect yourself from hunger, cold, physical effort, from pain and
uneasiness! How early your soul has taken to its dressing-gown! What a
cowardly part you have played towards real life and nature, with which
every healthy and normal man struggles! How soft, how snug, how warm,
how comfortable—and how bored you are! Yes, it is deathly boredom,
unrelieved by one ray of light, as in solitary confinement; but you try
to hide from that enemy, too, you play cards eight hours out of
twenty-four.

"And your irony? Oh, but how well I understand it! Free, bold, living
thought is searching and dominating; for an indolent, sluggish mind it
is intolerable. That it may not disturb your peace, like thousands of
your contemporaries, you made haste in youth to put it under bar and
bolt. Your ironical attitude to life, or whatever you like to call it,
is your armour; and your thought, fettered and frightened, dare not leap
over the fence you have put round it; and when you jeer at ideas which
you pretend to know all about, you are like the deserter fleeing from
the field of battle, and, to stifle his shame, sneering at war and at
valour. Cynicism stifles pain. In some novel of Dostoevsky''s an old man
tramples underfoot the portrait of his dearly loved daughter because he
had been unjust to her, and you vent your foul and vulgar jeers upon the
ideas of goodness and truth because you have not the strength to follow
them. You are frightened of every honest and truthful hint at your
degradation, and you purposely surround yourself with people who do
nothing but flatter your weaknesses. And you may well, you may well
dread the sight of tears!

"By the way, your attitude to women. Shamelessness has been handed down
to us in our flesh and blood, and we are trained to shamelessness; but
that is what we are men for—to subdue the beast in us. When you reached
manhood and all ideas became known to you, you could not have failed
to see the truth; you knew it, but you did not follow it; you were
afraid of it, and to deceive your conscience you began loudly assuring
yourself that it was not you but woman that was to blame, that she was
as degraded as your attitude to her. Your cold, scabrous anecdotes, your
coarse laughter, all your innumerable theories concerning the underlying
reality of marriage and the definite demands made upon it, concerning
the ten sous the French workman pays his woman; your everlasting
attacks on female logic, lying, weakness and so on—doesn''t it all look
like a desire at all costs to force woman down into the mud that she may
be on the same level as your attitude to her? You are a weak, unhappy,
unpleasant person!"

Zinaida Fyodorovna began playing the piano in the drawing-room, trying
to recall the song of Saint SaÃ«ns that Gruzin had played. I went and lay
on my bed, but remembering that it was time for me to go, I got up with
an effort and with a heavy, burning head went to the table again.

"But this is the question," I went on. "Why are we worn out? Why are we,
at first so passionate, so bold, so noble, and so full of faith, complete
bankrupts at thirty or thirty-five? Why does one waste in consumption,
another put a bullet through his brains, a third seeks forgetfulness in
vodka and cards, while the fourth tries to stifle his fear and misery by
cynically trampling underfoot the pure image of his fair youth? Why is
it that, having once fallen, we do not try to rise up again, and, losing
one thing, do not seek something else? Why is it?

"The thief hanging on the Cross could bring back the joy of life and the
courage of confident hope, though perhaps he had not more than an hour
to live. You have long years before you, and I shall probably not die so
soon as one might suppose. What if by a miracle the present turned out
to be a dream, a horrible nightmare, and we should wake up renewed,
pure, strong, proud of our righteousness? Sweet visions fire me, and I
am almost breathless with emotion. I have a terrible longing to live. I
long for our life to be holy, lofty, and majestic as the heavens above.
Let us live! The sun doesn''t rise twice a day, and life is not given us
again—clutch at what is left of your life and save it...."

I did not write another word. I had a multitude of thoughts in my mind,
but I could not connect them and get them on to paper. Without finishing
the letter, I signed it with my name and rank, and went into the study.
It was dark. I felt for the table and put the letter on it. I must have
stumbled against the furniture in the dark and made a noise.

For at least half a minute I fumbled at the door in the dark, feeling
for the handle; then I slowly opened it and walked into the
drawing-room. Zinaida Fyodorovna was lying on the couch, and raising
herself on her elbow, she looked towards me. Unable to bring myself to
speak, I walked slowly by, and she followed me with her eyes. I stood
for a little time in the dining-room and then walked by her again, and
she looked at me intently and with perplexity, even with alarm. At last
I stood still and said with an effort:

"He is not coming back," I repeated, and my heart beat violently. "He
will not come back, for he has not left Petersburg. He is staying at
Pekarsky''s."

She understood and believed me—I saw that from her sudden pallor, and
from the way she laid her arms upon her bosom in terror and entreaty. In
one instant all that had happened of late flashed through her mind; she
reflected, and with pitiless clarity she saw the whole truth. But at the
same time she remembered that I was a flunkey, a being of a lower
order.... A casual stranger, with hair ruffled, with face flushed with
fever, perhaps drunk, in a common overcoat, was coarsely intruding into
her intimate life, and that offended her. She said to me sternly:

"Oh, believe me!" I cried impetuously, holding out my hands to her. "I
am not a footman; I am as free as you."

I mentioned my name, and, speaking very rapidly that she might not
interrupt me or go away, explained to her who I was and why I was living
there. This new discovery struck her more than the first. Till then she
had hoped that her footman had lied or made a mistake or been silly, but
now after my confession she had no doubts left. From the expression of
her unhappy eyes and face, which suddenly lost its softness and beauty
and looked old, I saw that she was insufferably miserable, and that the
conversation would lead to no good; but I went on impetuously:

"The senator and the tour of inspection were invented to deceive you. In
January, just as now, he did not go away, but stayed at Pekarsky''s, and
I saw him every day and took part in the deception. He was weary of you,
he hated your presence here, he mocked at you.... If you could have
heard how he and his friends here jeered at you and your love, you would
not have remained here one minute! Go away from here! Go away."

Her eyes were full of tears, her lips were quivering, and her whole face
was strikingly pale and distorted with anger. Orlov''s coarse, petty
lying revolted her and seemed to her contemptible, ridiculous: she
smiled and I did not like that smile.

"Well," she repeated, passing her hand over her hair again, "so be it.
He imagines that I shall die of humiliation, and instead of that I am
... amused by it. There''s no need for him to hide." She walked away from
the piano and said, shrugging her shoulders: "There''s no need.... It
would have been simpler to have it out with me instead of keeping in
hiding in other people''s flats. I have eyes; I saw it myself long
ago.... I was only waiting for him to come back to have things out once
for all."

Then she sat down on a low chair by the table, and, leaning her head on
the arm of the sofa, wept bitterly. In the drawing-room there was only
one candle burning in the candelabra, and the chair where she was
sitting was in darkness; but I saw how her head and shoulders were
quivering, and how her hair, escaping from her combs, covered her neck,
her face, her arms.... Her quiet, steady weeping, which was not
hysterical but a woman''s ordinary weeping, expressed a sense of insult,
of wounded pride, of injury, and of something helpless, hopeless, which
one could not set right and to which one could not get used. Her tears
stirred an echo in my troubled and suffering heart; I forgot my illness
and everything else in the world; I walked about the drawing-room and
muttered distractedly:

"Is this life?... Oh, one can''t go on living like this, one can''t....
Oh, it''s madness, wickedness, not life."

"What humiliation!" she said through her tears. "To live together, to
smile at me at the very time when I was burdensome to him, ridiculous in
his eyes! Oh, how humiliating!"

She lifted up her head, and looking at me with tear-stained eyes through
her hair, wet with her tears, and pushing it back as it prevented her
seeing me, she asked:

"To these men you were laughable—you and your love and Turgenev; they
said your head was full of him. And if we both die at once in despair,
that will amuse them, too; they will make a funny anecdote of it and
tell it at your requiem service. But why talk of them?" I said
impatiently. "We must get away from here—I cannot stay here one minute
longer."

"Why do you talk like that? We had better consider together what we are
to do. Neither you nor I can stay here. Where do you intend to go?"

Suddenly there was a ring at the bell. My heart stood still. Could it be
Orlov, to whom perhaps Kukushkin had complained of me? How should we
meet? I went to open the door. It was Polya. She came in shaking the
snow off her pelisse, and went into her room without saying a word to
me. When I went back to the drawing-room, Zinaida Fyodorovna, pale as
death, was standing in the middle of the room, looking towards me with
big eyes.

"I will go away at once," she said. "Will you be kind and take me to the
Petersburg Side? What time is it now?"

When, a little afterwards, we went out of the house, it was dark and
deserted in the street. Wet snow was falling and a damp wind lashed in
one''s face. I remember it was the beginning of March; a thaw had set in,
and for some days past the cabmen had been driving on wheels. Under the
impression of the back stairs, of the cold, of the midnight darkness,
and the porter in his sheepskin who had questioned us before letting us
out of the gate, Zinaida Fyodorovna was utterly cast down and
dispirited. When we got into the cab and the hood was put up, trembling
all over, she began hurriedly saying how grateful she was to me.

"I do not doubt your good-will, but I am ashamed that you should be
troubled," she muttered. "Oh, I understand, I understand.... When Gruzin
was here to-day, I felt that he was lying and concealing something.
Well, so be it. But I am ashamed, anyway, that you should be troubled."

She still had her doubts. To dispel them finally, I asked the cabman to
drive through Sergievsky Street; stopping him at Pekarsky''s door, I got
out of the cab and rang. When the porter came to the door, I asked
aloud, that Zinaida Fyodorovna might hear, whether Georgy Ivanitch was
at home.

Then we drove on. The cab had no apron, the snow fell on us in big
flakes, and the wind, especially on the Neva, pierced us through and
through. I began to feel as though we had been driving for a long time,
that for ages we had been suffering, and that for ages I had been
listening to Zinaida Fyodorovna''s shuddering breath. In semi-delirium,
as though half asleep, I looked back upon my strange, incoherent life,
and for some reason recalled a melodrama, "The Parisian Beggars," which
