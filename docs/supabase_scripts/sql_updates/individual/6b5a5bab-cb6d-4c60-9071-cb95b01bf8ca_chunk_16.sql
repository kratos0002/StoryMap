UPDATE stories SET original_text = original_text || ' heart and a high step, looking in at the shop windows with the vague
      interest of an idler. All at once I noticed in the shop of a dealer in
      antiques a piece of Italian furniture of the seventeenth century. It was
      very handsome, very rare. I set it down as being the work of a Venetian
      artist named Vitelli, who was celebrated in his day.

“Why did the remembrance of that piece of furniture haunt me with
      such insistence that I retraced my steps? I again stopped before the shop,
      in order to take another look at it, and I felt that it tempted me.

“What a singular thing temptation is! One gazes at an object, and,
      little by little, it charms you, it disturbs you, it fills your thoughts
      as a woman''s face might do. The enchantment of it penetrates your being, a
      strange enchantment of form, color and appearance of an inanimate object.
      And one loves it, one desires it, one wishes to have it. A longing to own
      it takes possession of you, gently at first, as though it were timid, but
      growing, becoming intense, irresistible.

“Oh, I am sorry for those who do not know the honeymoon of the
      collector with the antique he has just purchased. One looks at it tenderly
      and passes one''s hand over it as if it were human flesh; one comes back to
      it every moment, one is always thinking of it, wherever one goes, whatever
      one does. The dear recollection of it pursues you in the street, in
      society, everywhere; and when you return home at night, before taking off
      your gloves or your hat; you go and look at it with the tenderness of a
      lover.

“Truly, for eight days I worshipped this piece of furniture. I
      opened its doors and pulled out the drawers every few moments. I handled
      it with rapture, with all the intense joy of possession.

“But one evening I surmised, while I was feeling the thickness of
      one of the panels, that there must be a secret drawer in it: My heart
      began to beat, and I spent the night trying to discover this secret
      cavity.

“I succeeded on the following day by driving a knife into a slit in
      the wood. A panel slid back and I saw, spread out on a piece of black
      velvet, a magnificent tress of hair.

“Yes, a woman''s hair, an immense coil of fair hair, almost red,
      which must have been cut off close to the head, tied with a golden cord.

“I stood amazed, trembling, confused. An almost imperceptible
      perfume, so ancient that it seemed to be the spirit of a perfume, issued
      from this mysterious drawer and this remarkable relic.

“I lifted it gently, almost reverently, and took it out of its
      hiding place. It at once unwound in a golden shower that reached to the
      floor, dense but light; soft and gleaming like the tail of a comet.

“A strange emotion filled me. What was this? When, how, why had this
      hair been shut up in this drawer? What adventure, what tragedy did this
      souvenir conceal? Who had cut it off? A lover on a day of farewell, a
      husband on a day of revenge, or the one whose head it had graced on the
      day of despair?

“Was it as she was about to take the veil that they had cast thither
      that love dowry as a pledge to the world of the living? Was it when they
      were going to nail down the coffin of the beautiful young corpse that the
      one who had adored her had cut off her tresses, the only thing that he
      could retain of her, the only living part of her body that would not
      suffer decay, the only thing he could still love, and caress, and kiss in
      his paroxysms of grief?

“Was it not strange that this tress should have remained as it was
      in life, when not an atom of the body on which it grew was in existence?

“It fell over my fingers, tickled the skin with a singular caress,
      the caress of a dead woman. It affected me so that I felt as though I
      should weep.

“I held it in my hands for a long time, then it seemed as if it
      disturbed me, as though something of the soul had remained in it. And I
      put it back on the velvet, rusty from age, and pushed in the drawer,
      closed the doors of the antique cabinet and went out for a walk to
      meditate.

“I walked along, filled with sadness and also with unrest, that
      unrest that one feels when in love. I felt as though I must have lived
      before, as though I must have known this woman.

“When I got home again I felt an irresistible longing to see my
      singular treasure, and I took it out and, as I touched it, I felt a shiver
      go all through me.

“For some days, however, I was in my ordinary condition, although
      the thought of that tress of hair was always present to my mind.

“Whenever I came into the house I had to see it and take it in my,
      hands. I turned the key of the cabinet with the same hesitation that one
      opens the door leading to one''s beloved, for in my hands and my heart I
      felt a confused, singular, constant sensual longing to plunge my hands in
      the enchanting golden flood of those dead tresses.

“Then, after I had finished caressing it and had locked the cabinet
      I felt as if it were a living thing, shut up in there, imprisoned; and I
      longed to see it again. I felt again the imperious desire to take it in my
      hands, to touch it, to even feel uncomfortable at the cold, slippery,
      irritating, bewildering contact.

“I lived thus for a month or two, I forget how long. It obsessed me,
      haunted me. I was happy and tormented by turns, as when one falls in love,
      and after the first vows have been exchanged.

“I shut myself in the room with it to feel it on my skin, to bury my
      lips in it, to kiss it. I wound it round my face, covered my eyes with the
      golden flood so as to see the day gleam through its gold.

“I loved it! Yes, I loved it. I could not be without it nor pass an
      hour without looking at it.

“I was alone, nevertheless, but I could not go to sleep again, and,
      as I was tossing about feverishly, I got up to look at the golden tress.
      It seemed softer than usual, more life-like. Do the dead come back? I
      almost lost consciousness as I kissed it. I took it back with me to bed
      and pressed it to my lips as if it were my sweetheart.

“Do the dead come back? She came back. Yes, I saw her; I held her in
      my arms, just as she was in life, tall, fair and round. She came back
      every evening—the dead woman, the beautiful, adorable, mysterious
      unknown.

“My happiness was so great that I could not conceal it. No lover
      ever tasted such intense, terrible enjoyment. I loved her so well that I
      could not be separated from her. I took her with me always and everywhere.
      I walked about the town with her as if she were my wife, and took her to
      the theatre, always to a private box. But they saw her—they guessed—they
      arrested me. They put me in prison like a criminal. They took her. Oh,
      misery!”

Here the manuscript stopped. And as I suddenly raised my astonished eyes
      to the doctor a terrific cry, a howl of impotent rage and of exasperated
      longing resounded through the asylum.

“Listen,” said the doctor. “We have to douse the obscene
      madman with water five times a day. Sergeant Bertrand was the only one who
      was in love with the dead.”

The doctor rose, opened a cabinet full of phials and instruments and
      tossed over a long tress of fair hair which flew toward me like a golden
      bird.

I shivered at feeling its soft, light touch on my hands. And I sat there,
      my heart beating with disgust and desire, disgust as at the contact of
      anything accessory to a crime and desire as at the temptation of some
      infamous and mysterious thing.

I rented a little country house last summer on the banks of the Seine,
      several leagues from Paris, and went out there to sleep every evening.
      After a few days I made the acquaintance of one of my neighbors, a man
      between thirty and forty, who certainly was the most curious specimen I
      ever met. He was an old boating man, and crazy about boating. He was
      always beside the water, on the water, or in the water. He must have been
      born in a boat, and he will certainly die in a boat at the last.

One evening as we were walking along the banks of the Seine I asked him to
      tell me some stories about his life on the water. The good man at once
      became animated, his whole expression changed, he became eloquent, almost
      poetical. There was in his heart one great passion, an absorbing,
      irresistible passion-the river.

Ah, he said to me, how many memories I have, connected with that river
      that you see flowing beside us! You people who live in streets know
      nothing about the river. But listen to a fisherman as he mentions the
      word. To him it is a mysterious thing, profound, unknown, a land of
      mirages and phantasmagoria, where one sees by night things that do not
      exist, hears sounds that one does not recognize, trembles without knowing
      why, as in passing through a cemetery—and it is, in fact, the most
      sinister of cemeteries, one in which one has no tomb.

The land seems limited to the river boatman, and on dark nights, when
      there is no moon, the river seems limitless. A sailor has not the same
      feeling for the sea. It is often remorseless and cruel, it is true; but it
      shrieks, it roars, it is honest, the great sea; while the river is silent
      and perfidious. It does not speak, it flows along without a sound; and
      this eternal motion of flowing water is more terrible to me than the high
      waves of the ocean.

Dreamers maintain that the sea hides in its bosom vast tracts of blue
      where those who are drowned roam among the big fishes, amid strange
      forests and crystal grottoes. The river has only black depths where one
      rots in the slime. It is beautiful, however, when it sparkles in the light
      of the rising sun and gently laps its banks covered with whispering reeds.

Well, I think that the stories whispered by the slender reeds, with their
      little soft voices, must be more sinister than the lugubrious tragedies
      told by the roaring of the waves.

But as you have asked for some of my recollections, I will tell you of a
      singular adventure that happened to me ten years ago.

I was living, as I am now, in Mother Lafon''s house, and one of my closest
      friends, Louis Bernet who has now given up boating, his low shoes and his
      bare neck, to go into the Supreme Court, was living in the village of C.,
      two leagues further down the river. We dined together every day, sometimes
      at his house, sometimes at mine.

One evening as I was coming home along and was pretty tired, rowing with
      difficulty my big boat, a twelve-footer, which I always took out at night,
      I stopped a few moments to draw breath near the reed-covered point yonder,
      about two hundred metres from the railway bridge.

It was a magnificent night, the moon shone brightly, the river gleamed,
      the air was calm and soft. This peacefulness tempted me. I thought to
      myself that it would be pleasant to smoke a pipe in this spot. I took up
      my anchor and cast it into the river.

The boat floated downstream with the current, to the end of the chain, and
      then stopped, and I seated myself in the stern on my sheepskin and made
      myself as comfortable as possible. There was not a sound to be heard,
      except that I occasionally thought I could perceive an almost
      imperceptible lapping of the water against the bank, and I noticed taller
      groups of reeds which assumed strange shapes and seemed, at times, to
      move.

The river was perfectly calm, but I felt myself affected by the unusual
      silence that surrounded me. All the creatures, frogs and toads, those
      nocturnal singers of the marsh, were silent.

Suddenly a frog croaked to my right, and close beside me. I shuddered. It
      ceased, and I heard nothing more, and resolved to smoke, to soothe my
      mind. But, although I was a noted colorer of pipes, I could not smoke; at
      the second draw I was nauseated, and gave up trying. I began to sing. The
      sound of my voice was distressing to me. So I lay still, but presently the
      slight motion of the boat disturbed me. It seemed to me as if she were
      making huge lurches, from bank to bank of the river, touching each bank
      alternately. Then I felt as though an invisible force, or being, were
      drawing her to the surface of the water and lifting her out, to let her
      fall again. I was tossed about as in a tempest. I heard noises around me.
      I sprang to my feet with a single bound. The water was glistening, all was
      calm.

I saw that my nerves were somewhat shaky, and I resolved to leave the
      spot. I pulled the anchor chain, the boat began to move; then I felt a
      resistance. I pulled harder, the anchor did not come up; it had caught on
      something at the bottom of the river and I could not raise it. I began
      pulling again, but all in vain. Then, with my oars, I turned the boat with
      its head up stream to change the position of the anchor. It was no use, it
      was still caught. I flew into a rage and shook the chain furiously.
      Nothing budged. I sat down, disheartened, and began to reflect on my
      situation. I could not dream of breaking this chain, or detaching it from
      the boat, for it was massive and was riveted at the bows to a piece of
      wood as thick as my arm. However, as the weather was so fine I thought
      that it probably would not be long before some fisherman came to my aid.
      My ill-luck had quieted me. I sat down and was able, at length, to smoke
      my pipe. I had a bottle of rum; I drank two or three glasses, and was able
      to laugh at the situation. It was very warm; so that, if need be, I could
      sleep out under the stars without any great harm.

All at once there was a little knock at the side of the boat. I gave a
      start, and a cold sweat broke out all over me. The noise was, doubtless,
      caused by some piece of wood borne along by the current, but that was
      enough, and I again became a prey to a strange nervous agitation. I seized
      the chain and tensed my muscles in a desperate effort. The anchor held
      firm. I sat down again, exhausted.

The river had slowly become enveloped in a thick white fog which lay close
      to the water, so that when I stood up I could see neither the river, nor
      my feet, nor my boat; but could perceive only the tops of the reeds, and
      farther off in the distance the plain, lying white in the moonlight, with
      big black patches rising up from it towards the sky, which were formed by
      groups of Italian poplars. I was as if buried to the waist in a cloud of
      cotton of singular whiteness, and all sorts of strange fancies came into
      my mind. I thought that someone was trying to climb into my boat which I
      could no longer distinguish, and that the river, hidden by the thick fog,
      was full of strange creatures which were swimming all around me. I felt
      horribly uncomfortable, my forehead felt as if it had a tight band round
      it, my heart beat so that it almost suffocated me, and, almost beside
      myself, I thought of swimming away from the place. But then, again, the
      very idea made me tremble with fear. I saw myself, lost, going by
      guesswork in this heavy fog, struggling about amid the grasses and reeds
      which I could not escape, my breath rattling with fear, neither seeing the
      bank, nor finding my boat; and it seemed as if I would feel myself dragged
      down by the feet to the bottom of these black waters.

In fact, as I should have had to ascend the stream at least five hundred
      metres before finding a spot free from grasses and rushes where I could
      land, there were nine chances to one that I could not find my way in the
      fog and that I should drown, no matter how well I could swim.

I tried to reason with myself. My will made me resolve not to be afraid,
      but there was something in me besides my will, and that other thing was
      afraid. I asked myself what there was to be afraid of. My brave “ego”
      ridiculed my coward “ego,” and never did I realize, as on that
      day, the existence in us of two rival personalities, one desiring a thing,
      the other resisting, and each winning the day in turn.

This stupid, inexplicable fear increased, and became terror. I remained
      motionless, my eyes staring, my ears on the stretch with expectation. Of
      what? I did not know, but it must be something terrible. I believe if it
      had occurred to a fish to jump out of the water, as often happens, nothing
      more would have been required to make me fall over, stiff and unconscious.

However, by a violent effort I succeeded in becoming almost rational
      again. I took up my bottle of rum and took several pulls. Then an idea
      came to me, and I began to shout with all my might towards all the points
      of the compass in succession. When my throat was absolutely paralyzed I
      listened. A dog was howling, at a great distance.

I drank some more rum and stretched myself out at the bottom of the boat.
      I remained there about an hour, perhaps two, not sleeping, my eyes wide
      open, with nightmares all about me. I did not dare to rise, and yet I
      intensely longed to do so. I delayed it from moment to moment. I said to
      myself: “Come, get up!” and I was afraid to move. At last I
      raised myself with infinite caution as though my life depended on the
      slightest sound that I might make; and looked over the edge of the boat. I
      was dazzled by the most marvellous, the most astonishing sight that it is
      possible to see. It was one of those phantasmagoria of fairyland, one of
      those sights described by travellers on their return from distant lands,
      whom we listen to without believing.

The fog which, two hours before, had floated on the water, had gradually
      cleared off and massed on the banks, leaving the river absolutely clear;
      while it formed on either bank an uninterrupted wall six or seven metres
      high, which shone in the moonlight with the dazzling brilliance of snow.
      One saw nothing but the river gleaming with light between these two white
      mountains; and high above my head sailed the great full moon, in the midst
      of a bluish, milky sky.

All the creatures in the water were awake. The frogs croaked furiously,
      while every few moments I heard, first to the right and then to the left,
      the abrupt, monotonous and mournful metallic note of the bullfrogs.
      Strange to say, I was no longer afraid. I was in the midst of such an
      unusual landscape that the most remarkable things would not have
      astonished me.

How long this lasted I do not know, for I ended by falling asleep. When I
      opened my eyes the moon had gone down and the sky was full of clouds. The
      water lapped mournfully, the wind was blowing, it was pitch dark. I drank
      the rest of the rum, then listened, while I trembled, to the rustling of
      the reeds and the foreboding sound of the river. I tried to see, but could
      not distinguish my boat, nor even my hands, which I held up close to my
      eyes.

Little by little, however, the blackness became less intense. All at once
      I thought I noticed a shadow gliding past, quite near me. I shouted, a
      voice replied; it was a fisherman. I called him; he came near and I told
      him of my ill-luck. He rowed his boat alongside of mine and, together, we
      pulled at the anchor chain. The anchor did not move. Day came, gloomy
      gray, rainy and cold, one of those days that bring one sorrows and
      misfortunes. I saw another boat. We hailed it. The man on board of her
      joined his efforts to ours, and gradually the anchor yielded. It rose, but
      slowly, slowly, loaded down by a considerable weight. At length we
      perceived a black mass and we drew it on board. It was the corpse of an
      old women with a big stone round her neck.

The following adventure happened to me about 1882. I had just taken the
      train and settled down in a corner, hoping that I should be left alone,
      when the door suddenly opened again and I heard a voice say: “Take
      care, monsieur, we are just at a crossing; the step is very high.”

Then a head appeared, and two hands seized the leather straps hanging on
      either side of the door and slowly pulled up an enormous body, whose feet
      striking on the step, sounded like two canes. When the man had hoisted his
      torso into the compartment I noticed, at the loose edge of his trousers,
      the end of a wooden leg, which was soon followed by its mate. A head
      appeared behind this traveller and asked; “Are you all right,
      monsieur?”

And a servant, who looked like an old soldier, climbed in, carrying in his
      arms a stack of bundles wrapped in black and yellow papers and carefully
      tied; he placed one after the other in the net over his master''s head.
      Then he said: “There, monsieur, that is all. There are five of them—the
      candy, the doll the drum, the gun, and the pate de foies gras.”

The man closed the door and walked away, and I looked at my neighbor. He
      was about thirty-five, although his hair was almost white; he wore the
      ribbon of the Legion of Honor; he had a heavy mustache and was quite
      stout, with the stoutness of a strong and active man who is kept
      motionless on account of some infirmity. He wiped his brow, sighed, and,
      looking me full in the face, he asked: “Does smoking annoy you,
      monsieur?”

Surely I knew that eye, that voice, that face. But when and where had I
      seen them? I had certainly met that man, spoken to him, shaken his hand.
      That was a long, long time ago. It was lost in the haze wherein the mind
      seems to feel around blindly for memories and pursues them like fleeing
      phantoms without being able to seize them. He, too, was observing me,
      staring me out of countenance, with the persistence of a man who remembers
      slightly but not completely. Our eyes, embarrassed by this persistent
      contact, turned away; then, after a few minutes, drawn together again by
      the obscure and tenacious will of working memory, they met once more, and
      I said: “Monsieur, instead of staring at each other for an hour or
      so, would it not be better to try to discover where we have known each
      other?”

He hesitated for a few minutes; then, with the vague look and voice which
      accompany great mental tension, he said: “Oh, I remember perfectly.
      I met you twelve years ago, before the war, at the Poincels!”

“Yes. I was Captain Revaliere even up to the time when I lost my
      feet —both of them together from one cannon ball.”

Now that we knew each other''s identity we looked at each other again. I
      remembered perfectly the handsome, slender youth who led the cotillons
      with such frenzied agility and gracefulness that he had been nicknamed
      “the fury.” Going back into the dim, distant past, I recalled
      a story which I had heard and forgotten, one of those stories to which one
      listens but forgets, and which leave but a faint impression upon the
      memory.

There was something about love in it. Little by little the shadows cleared
      up, and the face of a young girl appeared before my eyes. Then her name
      struck me with the force of an explosion: Mademoiselle de Mandel. I
      remembered everything now. It was indeed a love story, but quite
      commonplace. The young girl loved this young man, and when I had met them
      there was already talk of the approaching wedding. The youth seemed to be
      very much in love, very happy.

I raised my eye to the net, where all the packages which had been brought
      in by the servant were trembling from the motion of the train, and the
      voice of the servant came back to me, as if he had just finished speaking.
      He had said: “There, monsieur, that is all. There are five of them:
      the candy, the doll, the drum, the gun, and the pate de foies gras.”

Then, in a second, a whole romance unfolded itself in my head. It was like
      all those which I had already read, where the young lady married
      notwithstanding the catastrophe, whether physical or financial; therefore,
      this officer who had been maimed in the war had returned, after the
      campaign, to the young girl who had given him her promise, and she had
      kept her word.

I considered that very beautiful, but simple, just as one, considers
      simple all devotions and climaxes in books or in plays. It always seems,
      when one reads or listens to these stories of magnanimity, that one could
      sacrifice one''s self with enthusiastic pleasure and overwhelming joy. But
      the following day, when an unfortunate friend comes to borrow some money,
      there is a strange revulsion of feeling.

But, suddenly, another supposition, less poetic and more realistic,
      replaced the first one. Perhaps he had married before the war, before this
      frightful accident, and she, in despair and resignation, had been forced
      to receive, care for, cheer, and support this husband, who had departed, a
      handsome man, and had returned without his feet, a frightful wreck, forced
      into immobility, powerless anger, and fatal obesity.

Was he happy or in torture? I was seized with an irresistible desire to
      know his story, or, at least, the principal points, which would permit me
      to guess that which he could not or would not tell me. Still thinking the
      matter over, I began talking to him. We had exchanged a few commonplace
      words; and I raised my eyes to the net, and thought: “He must have
      three children: the bonbons are for his wife, the doll for his little
      girl, the drum and the gun for his sons, and this pate de foies gras for
      himself.”

I suddenly felt confused, as if I had been guilty of some breach of
      etiquette, and I continued: “I beg your pardon. I had thought that
      you were when I heard your servant speaking about the toys. One listens
      and draws conclusions unconsciously.”

He smiled and then murmured: “No, I am not even married. I am still
      at the preliminary stage.”

I grew very bold and added: “I also seem to remember hearing that
      Mademoiselle de Mandel married Monsieur—Monsieur—”

I looked him full in the face, and he blushed. His full face, which was
      already red from the oversupply of blood, turned crimson. He answered
      quickly, with a sudden ardor of a man who is pleading a cause which is
      lost in his mind and in his heart, but which he does not wish to admit.

“It is wrong, monsieur, to couple my name with that of Madame de
      Fleurel. When I returned from the war-without my feet, alas! I never would
      have permitted her to become my wife. Was it possible? When one marries,
      monsieur, it is not in order to parade one''s generosity; it is in order to
      live every day, every hour, every minute, every second beside a man; and
      if this man is disfigured, as I am, it is a death sentence to marry him!
      Oh, I understand, I admire all sacrifices and devotions when they have a
      limit, but I do not admit that a woman should give up her whole life, all
      joy, all her dreams, in order to satisfy the admiration of the gallery.
      When I hear, on the floor of my room, the tapping of my wooden legs and of
      my crutches, I grow angry enough to strangle my servant. Do you think that
      I would permit a woman to do what I myself am unable to tolerate? And,
      then, do you think that my stumps are pretty?”

He was silent. What could I say? He certainly was right. Could I blame
      her, hold her in contempt, even say that she was wrong? No. However, the
      end which conformed to the rule, to the truth, did not satisfy my poetic
      appetite. These heroic deeds demand a beautiful sacrifice, which seemed to
      be lacking, and I felt a certain disappointment. I suddenly asked: “Has
      Madame de Fleurel any children?”

“Yes, one girl and two boys. It is for them that I am bringing these
      toys. She and her husband are very kind to me.”

The train was going up the incline to Saint-Germain. It passed through the
      tunnels, entered the station, and stopped. I was about to offer my arm to
      the wounded officer, in order to help him descend, when two hands were
      stretched up to him through the open door.

Standing behind the man, the woman, still beautiful, was smiling and
      waving her hands to him. A little girl, standing beside her, was jumping
      for joy, and two young boys were eagerly watching the drum and the gun,
      which were passing from the car into their father''s hands.

When the cripple was on the ground, all the children kissed him. Then they
      set off, the little girl holding in her hand the small varnished rung of a
      crutch, just as she might walk beside her big friend and hold his thumb.

When Old Man Leras, bookkeeper for Messieurs Labuze and Company, left the
      store, he stood for a minute bewildered at the glory of the setting sun.
      He had worked all day in the yellow light of a small jet of gas, far in
      the back of the store, on a narrow court, as deep as a well. The little
      room where he had been spending his days for forty years was so dark that
      even in the middle of summer one could hardly see without gaslight from
      eleven until three.

It was always damp and cold, and from this hole on which his window opened
      came the musty odor of a sewer.

For forty years Monsieur Leras had been arriving every morning in this
      prison at eight o''clock, and he would remain there until seven at night,
      bending over his books, writing with the industry of a good clerk.

He was now making three thousand francs a year, having started at fifteen
      hundred. He had remained a bachelor, as his means did not allow him the
      luxury of a wife, and as he had never enjoyed anything, he desired
      nothing. From time to time, however, tired of this continuous and
      monotonous work, he formed a platonic wish: “Gad! If I only had an
      income of fifteen thousand francs, I would take life easy.”

He had never taken life easy, as he had never had anything but his monthly
      salary. His life had been uneventful, without emotions, without hopes. The
      faculty of dreaming with which every one is blessed had never developed in
      the mediocrity of his ambitions.

When he was twenty-one he entered the employ of Messieurs Labuze and
      Company. And he had never left them.

In 1856 he had lost his father and then his mother in 1859. Since then the
      only incident in his life was when he moved, in 1868, because his landlord
      had tried to raise his rent.

Every day his alarm clock, with a frightful noise of rattling chains, made
      him spring out of bed at 6 o''clock precisely.

Twice, however, this piece of mechanism had been out of order—once
      in 1866 and again in 1874; he had never been able to find out the reason
      why. He would dress, make his bed, sweep his room, dust his chair and the
      top of his bureau. All this took him an hour and a half.

Then he would go out, buy a roll at the Lahure Bakery, in which he had
      seen eleven different owners without the name ever changing, and he would
      eat this roll on the way to the office.

His entire existence had been spent in the narrow, dark office, which was
      still decorated with the same wall paper. He had entered there as a young
      man, as assistant to Monsieur Brument, and with the desire to replace him.

The whole harvest of memories which other men reap in their span of years,
      the unexpected events, sweet or tragic loves, adventurous journeys, all
      the occurrences of a free existence, all these things had remained unknown
      to him.

Days, weeks, months, seasons, years, all were alike to him. He got up
      every day at the same hour, started out, arrived at the office, ate
      luncheon, went away, had dinner and went to bed without ever interrupting
      the regular monotony of similar actions, deeds and thoughts.

Formerly he used to look at his blond mustache and wavy hair in the little
      round mirror left by his predecessor. Now, every evening before leaving,
      he would look at his white mustache and bald head in the same mirror.
      Forty years had rolled by, long and rapid, dreary as a day of sadness and
      as similar as the hours of a sleepless night. Forty years of which nothing
      remained, not even a memory, not even a misfortune, since the death of his
      parents. Nothing.

That day Monsieur Leras stood by the door, dazzled at the brilliancy of
      the setting sun; and instead of returning home he decided to take a little
      stroll before dinner, a thing which happened to him four or five times a
      year.

He reached the boulevards, where people were streaming along under the
      green trees. It was a spring evening, one of those first warm and pleasant
      evenings which fill the heart with the joy of life.

Monsieur Leras went along with his mincing old man''s step; he was going
      along with joy in his heart, at peace with the world. He reached the
      Champs-Elysees, and he continued to walk, enlivened by the sight of the
      young people trotting along.

The whole sky was aflame; the Arc de Triomphe stood out against the
      brilliant background of the horizon, like a giant surrounded by fire. As
      he approached the immense monument, the old bookkeeper noticed that he was
      hungry, and he went into a wine dealer''s for dinner.

The meal was served in front of the store, on the sidewalk. It consisted
      of some mutton, salad and asparagus. It was the best dinner that Monsieur
      Leras had had in a long time. He washed down his cheese with a small
      bottle of burgundy, had his after-dinner cup of coffee, a thing which he
      rarely took, and finally a little pony of brandy.

When he had paid he felt quite youthful, even a little moved. And he said
      to himself: “What a fine evening! I will continue my stroll as far
      as the entrance to the Bois de Boulogne. It will do me good.” He set
      out. An old tune which one of his neighbors used to sing kept returning to
      his mind. He kept on humming it over and over again. A hot, still night
      had fallen over Paris. Monsieur Leras walked along the Avenue du Bois de
      Boulogne and watched the cabs drive by. They kept coming with their
      shining lights, one behind the other, giving him a glimpse of the couples
      inside, the women in their light dresses and the men dressed in black.

It was one long procession of lovers, riding under the warm, starlit sky.
      They kept on coming in rapid succession. They passed by in the carriages,
      silent, side by side, lost in their dreams, in the emotion of desire, in
      the anticipation of the approaching embrace. The warm shadows seemed to be
      full of floating kisses. A sensation of tenderness filled the air. All
      these carriages full of tender couples, all these people intoxicated with
      the same idea, with the same thought, seemed to give out a disturbing,
      subtle emanation.

At last Monsieur Leras grew a little tired of walking, and he sat down on
      a bench to watch these carriages pass by with their burdens of love.
      Almost immediately a woman walked up to him and sat down beside him.
      “Good-evening, papa,” she said.

He arose and walked away, with sadness in his heart. A few yards away
      another woman walked up to him and asked: “Won''t you sit down beside
      me?” He said: “What makes you take up this life?”

Monsieur Leras stood there bewildered. Other women were passing near him,
      speaking to him and calling to him. He felt as though he were enveloped in
      darkness by something disagreeable.

He sat down again on a bench. The carriages were still rolling by. He
      thought: “I should have done better not to come here; I feel all
      upset.” He began to think of all this venal or passionate love, of
      all these kisses, sold or given, which were passing by in front of him.
      Love! He scarcely knew it. In his lifetime he had only known two or three
      women, his means forcing him to live a quiet life, and he looked back at
      the life which he had led, so different from everybody else, so dreary, so
      mournful, so empty.

Some people are really unfortunate. And suddenly, as though a veil had
      been torn from his eyes, he perceived the infinite misery, the monotony of
      his existence: the past, present and future misery; his last day similar
      to his first one, with nothing before him, behind him or about him,
      nothing in his heart or any place.

The stream of carriages was still going by. In the rapid passage of the
      open carriage he still saw the two silent, loving creatures. It seemed to
      him that the whole of humanity was flowing on before him, intoxicated with
      joy, pleasure and happiness. He alone was looking on. To-morrow he would
      again be alone, always alone, more so than any one else. He stood up, took
      a few steps, and suddenly he felt as tired as though he had taken a long
      journey on foot, and he sat down on the next bench.

What was he waiting for? What was he hoping for? Nothing. He was thinking
      of how pleasant it must be in old age to return home and find the little
      children. It is pleasant to grow old when one is surrounded by those
      beings who owe their life to you, who love you, who caress you, who tell
      you charming and foolish little things which warm your heart and console
      you for everything.

And, thinking of his empty room, clean and sad, where no one but himself
      ever entered, a feeling of distress filled his soul; and the place seemed
      to him more mournful even than his little office. Nobody ever came there;
      no one ever spoke in it. It was dead, silent, without the echo of a human
      voice. It seems as though walls retain something of the people who live
      within them, something of their manner, face and voice. The very houses
      inhabited by happy families are gayer than the dwellings of the unhappy.
      His room was as barren of memories as his life. And the thought of
      returning to this place, all alone, of getting into his bed, of again
      repeating all the duties and actions of every evening, this thought
      terrified him. As though to escape farther from this sinister home, and
      from the time when he would have to return to it, he arose and walked
      along a path to a wooded corner, where he sat down on the grass.

About him, above him, everywhere, he heard a continuous, tremendous,
      confused rumble, composed of countless and different noises, a vague and
      throbbing pulsation of life: the life breath of Paris, breathing like a
      giant.

The sun was already high and shed a flood of light on the Bois de
      Boulogne. A few carriages were beginning to drive about and people were
      appearing on horseback.

Suddenly the young woman raised her eyes and saw something brown in the
      branches. Surprised and anxious, she raised her hand, exclaiming: “Look!
      what is that?”

Then she shrieked and fell into the arms of her companion, who was forced
      to lay her on the ground.

The policeman who had been called cut down an old man who had hung himself
      with his suspenders.

Examination showed that he had died the evening before. Papers found on
      him showed that he was a bookkeeper for Messieurs Labuze and Company and
      that his name was Leras.

His death was attributed to suicide, the cause of which could not be
      suspected. Perhaps a sudden access of madness!

At four o''clock that day, as on every other day, Alexandre rolled the
      three-wheeled chair for cripples up to the door of the little house; then,
      in obedience to the doctor''s orders, he would push his old and infirm
      mistress about until six o''clock.

When he had placed the light vehicle against the step, just at the place
      where the old lady could most easily enter it, he went into the house; and
      soon a furious, hoarse old soldier''s voice was heard cursing inside the
      house: it issued from the master, the retired ex-captain of infantry,
      Joseph Maramballe.

Then could be heard the noise of doors being slammed, chairs being pushed
      about, and hasty footsteps; then nothing more. After a few seconds,
      Alexandre reappeared on the threshold, supporting with all his strength
      Madame Maramballe, who was exhausted from the exertion of descending the
      stairs. When she was at last settled in the rolling chair, Alexandre
      passed behind it, grasped the handle, and set out toward the river.

Thus they crossed the little town every day amid the respectful greeting,
      of all. These bows were perhaps meant as much for the servant as for the
      mistress, for if she was loved and esteemed by all, this old trooper, with
      his long, white, patriarchal beard, was considered a model domestic.

The July sun was beating down unmercifully on the street, bathing the low
      houses in its crude and burning light. Dogs were sleeping on the sidewalk
      in the shade of the houses, and Alexandre, a little out of breath,
      hastened his footsteps in order sooner to arrive at the avenue which leads
      to the water.

Madame Maramballe was already slumbering under her white parasol, the
      point of which sometimes grazed along the man''s impassive face. As soon as
      they had reached the Allee des Tilleuls, she awoke in the shade of the
      trees, and she said in a kindly voice: “Go more slowly, my poor boy;
      you will kill yourself in this heat.”

Along this path, completely covered by arched linden trees, the Mavettek
      flowed in its winding bed bordered by willows.

The gurgling of the eddies and the splashing of the little waves against
      the rocks lent to the walk the charming music of babbling water and the
      freshness of damp air. Madame Maramballe inhaled with deep delight the
      humid charm of this spot and then murmured: “Ah! I feel better now!
      But he wasn''t in a good humor to-day.”

For thirty-five years he had been in the service of this couple, first as
      officer''s orderly, then as simple valet who did not wish to leave his
      masters; and for the last six years, every afternoon, he had been wheeling
      his mistress about through the narrow streets of the town. From this long
      and devoted service, and then from this daily tete-a-tete, a kind of
      familiarity arose between the old lady and the devoted servant,
      affectionate on her part, deferential on his.

They talked over the affairs of the house exactly as if they were equals.
      Their principal subject of conversation and of worry was the bad
      disposition of the captain, soured by a long career which had begun with
      promise, run along without promotion, end ended without glory.

Madame Maramballe continued: “He certainly was not in a good humor
      today. This happens too often since he has left the service.”

And Alexandre, with a sigh, completed his mistress''s thoughts, “Oh,
      madame might say that it happens every day and that it also happened
      before leaving the army.”

“That is true. But the poor man has been so unfortunate. He began
      with a brave deed, which obtained for him the Legion of Honor at the age
      of twenty; and then from twenty to fifty he was not able to rise higher
      than captain, whereas at the beginning he expected to retire with at least
      the rank of colonel.”

“Madame might also admit that it was his fault. If he had not always
      been as cutting as a whip, his superiors would have loved and protected
      him better. Harshness is of no use; one should try to please if one wishes
      to advance. As far as his treatment of us is concerned, it is also our
      fault, since we are willing to remain with him, but with others it''s
      different.”

Madame Maramballe was thinking. Oh, for how many years had she thus been
      thinking of the brutality of her husband, whom she had married long ago
      because he was a handsome officer, decorated quite young, and full of
      promise, so they said! What mistakes one makes in life!

It was a little worm-eaten bench, placed at a turn in the alley. Every
      time they came in this direction Alexandre was accustomed to making a
      short pause on this seat.

He sat down and with a proud and familiar gesture he took his beautiful
      white beard in his hand, and, closing his, fingers over it, ran them down
      to the point, which he held for a minute at the pit of his stomach, as if
      once more to verify the length of this growth.

Madame Maramballe continued: “I married him; it is only just and
      natural that I should bear his injustice; but what I do not understand is
      why you also should have supported it, my good Alexandre!”

She added: “Really. I have often wondered. When I married him you
      were his orderly and you could hardly do otherwise than endure him. But
      why did you remain with us, who pay you so little and who treat you so
      badly, when you could have done as every one else does, settle down,
      marry, have a family?”

Then he was silent; but he kept pulling his beard as if he were ringing a
      bell within him, as if he were trying to pull it out, and he rolled his
      eyes like a man who is greatly embarrassed.

Madame Maramballe was following her own train of thought: “You are
      not a peasant. You have an education—”

She began to laugh: “You are not going to try to tell me that
      Maramballe''s sweet disposition caused you to become attached to him for
      life.”

He was fidgeting about on his bench visibly embarrassed, and he muttered
      behind his long beard:

The old lady, who had a sweet face, with a snowy line of curly white hair
      between her forehead and her bonnet, turned around in her chair and
      observed her servant with a surprised look, exclaiming: “I, my poor
      Alexandre! How so?”

He began to look up in the air, then to one side, then toward the
      distance, turning his head as do timid people when forced to admit
      shameful secrets. At last he exclaimed, with the courage of a trooper who
      is ordered to the line of fire: “You see, it''s this way—the
      first time I brought a letter to mademoiselle from the lieutenant,
      mademoiselle gave me a franc and a smile, and that settled it.”

Then he cried out, like a malefactor who is admitting a fatal crime:
      “I had a sentiment for madame! There!”

She answered nothing, stopped looking at him, hung her head, and thought.
      She was good, full of justice, gentleness, reason, and tenderness. In a
      second she saw the immense devotion of this poor creature, who had given
      up everything in order to live beside her, without saying anything. And
      she felt as if she could cry. Then, with a sad but not angry expression,
      she said: “Let us return home.”

As they approached the village they saw Captain Maramballe coming toward
      them. As soon as he joined them he asked his wife, with a visible desire
      of getting angry: “What have we for dinner?”

He lost his temper: “Chicken! chicken! always chicken! By all that''s
      holy, I''ve had enough chicken! Have you no ideas in your head, that you
      make me eat chicken every day?”

She answered, in a resigned tone: “But, my dear, you know that the
      doctor has ordered it for you. It''s the best thing for your stomach. If
      your stomach were well, I could give you many things which I do not dare
      set before you now.”

Then, exasperated, he planted himself in front of Alexandre, exclaiming:
      “Well, if my stomach is out of order it''s the fault of that brute.
      For thirty-five years he has been poisoning me with his abominable
      cooking.”

Madame Maramballe suddenly turned about completely, in order to see the
      old domestic. Their eyes met, and in this single glance they both said
      “Thank you!” to each other.

The drawing-room was small, full of heavy draperies and discreetly
      fragrant. A large fire burned in the grate and a solitary lamp at one end
      of the mantelpiece threw a soft light on the two persons who were talking.

She, the mistress of the house, was an old lady with white hair, but one
      of those old ladies whose unwrinkled skin is as smooth as the finest
      paper, and scented, impregnated with perfume, with the delicate essences
      which she had used in her bath for so many years.

He was a very old friend, who had never married, a constant friend, a
      companion in the journey of life, but nothing more.

They had not spoken for about a minute, and were both looking at the fire,
      dreaming of no matter what, in one of those moments of friendly silence
      between people who have no need to be constantly talking in order to be
      happy together, when suddenly a large log, a stump covered with burning
      roots, fell out. It fell over the firedogs into the drawing-room and
      rolled on to the carpet, scattering great sparks around it. The old lady,
      with a little scream, sprang to her feet to run away, while he kicked the
      log back on to the hearth and stamped out all the burning sparks with his
      boots.

When the disaster was remedied, there was a strong smell of burning, and,
      sitting down opposite to his friend, the man looked at her with a smile
      and said, as he pointed to the log:

She looked at him in astonishment, with the inquisitive gaze of women who
      wish to know everything, that eye which women have who are no longer very
      young,—in which a complex, and often roguish, curiosity is
      reflected, and she asked:

“My old friends were often surprised at the coldness which suddenly
      sprang up between one of my best friends whose Christian name was Julien,
      and myself. They could not understand how two such intimate and
      inseparable friends, as we had been, could suddenly become almost
      strangers to one another, and I will tell you the reason of it.

“He and I used to live together at one time. We were never apart,
      and the friendship that united us seemed so strong that nothing could
      break it.

“One evening when he came home, he told me that he was going to get
      married, and it gave me a shock as if he had robbed me or betrayed me.
      When a man''s friend marries, it is all over between them. The jealous
      affection of a woman, that suspicious, uneasy and carnal affection, will
      not tolerate the sturdy and frank attachment, that attachment of the mind,
      of the heart, and that mutual confidence which exists between two men.

“You see, however great the love may be that unites them a man and a
      woman are always strangers in mind and intellect; they remain
      belligerents, they belong to different races. There must always be a
      conqueror and a conquered, a master and a slave; now the one, now the
      other—they are never two equals. They press each other''s hands,
      those hands trembling with amorous passion; but they never press them with
      a long, strong, loyal pressure, with that pressure which seems to open
      hearts and to lay them bare in a burst of sincere, strong, manly
      affection. Philosophers of old, instead of marrying, and procreating as a
      consolation for their old age children, who would abandon them, sought for
      a good, reliable friend, and grew old with him in that communion of
      thought which can only exist between men.

“Well, my friend Julien married. His wife was pretty, charming, a
      little, curly-haired blonde, plump and lively, who seemed to worship him.
      At first I went but rarely to their house, feeling myself de trop. But,
      somehow, they attracted me to their home; they were constantly inviting
      me, and seemed very fond of me. Consequently, by degrees, I allowed myself
      to be allured by the charm of their life. I often dined with them, and
      frequently, when I returned home at night, thought that I would do as he
      had done, and get married, as my empty house now seemed very dull.

“''My dear fellow,'' he said, ''I must go out directly afterward on
      business, and I shall not be back until eleven o''clock; but I shall be
      back at eleven precisely, and I reckon on you to keep Bertha company.''

“''You are as nice as ever, I said, and I felt a long, friendly
      pressure of my fingers, but I paid no attention to it; so we sat down to
      dinner, and at eight o''clock Julien went out.

“As soon as he had gone, a kind of strange embarrassment immediately
      seemed to arise between his wife and me. We had never been alone together
      yet, and in spite of our daily increasing intimacy, this tete-a-tete
      placed us in a new position. At first I spoke vaguely of those indifferent
      matters with which one fills up an embarrassing silence, but she did not
      reply, and remained opposite to me with her head down in an undecided
      manner, as if she were thinking over some difficult subject, and as I was
      at a loss for small talk, I held my tongue. It is surprising how hard it
      is at times to find anything to say.

“And then also I felt something in the air, something I could not
      express, one of those mysterious premonitions that warn one of another
      person''s secret intentions in regard to yourself, whether they be good or
      evil.

“So I opened the box where the wood was kept, which was placed just
      where yours is, took out the largest log and put it on top of the others,
      which were three parts burned, and then silence again reigned in the room.

“In a few minutes the log was burning so brightly that it scorched
      our faces, and the young woman raised her eyes to mine—eyes that had
      a strange look to me.

“''Upon my word,'' I replied, very much at a loss for an answer, ''I
      cannot foresee such a case; but it would depend very much upon the woman.''

“She gave a hard, nervous, vibrating laugh; one of those false
      laughs which seem as if they must break thin glass, and then she added:
      ''Men are never either venturesome or spiteful.'' And, after a moment''s
      silence, she continued: ''Have you ever been in love, Monsieur Paul?'' I was
      obliged to acknowledge that I certainly had, and she asked me to tell her
      all about it. Whereupon I made up some story or other. She listened to me
      attentively, with frequent signs of disapproval and contempt, and then
      suddenly she said:

“''No, you understand nothing about the subject. It seems to me that
      real love must unsettle the mind, upset the nerves and distract the head;
      that it must—how shall I express it?—be dangerous, even
      terrible, almost criminal and sacrilegious; that it must be a kind of
      treason; I mean to say that it is bound to break laws, fraternal bonds,
      sacred obligations; when love is tranquil, easy, lawful and without
      dangers, is it really love?''

“I did not know what answer to give her, and I made this
      philosophical reflection to myself: ''Oh! female brain, here; indeed, you
      show yourself!''

“While speaking, she had assumed a demure saintly air; and, resting
      on the cushions, she stretched herself out at full length, with her head
      on my shoulder, and her dress pulled up a little so as to show her red
      stockings, which the firelight made look still brighter. In a minute or
      two she continued:

“''I suppose I have frightened you?'' I protested against such a
      notion, and she leaned against my breast altogether, and without looking
      at me, she said: ''If I were to tell you that I love you, what would you
      do?''

“And before I could think of an answer, she had thrown her arms
      around my neck, had quickly drawn my head down, and put her lips to mine.

“Oh! My dear friend, I can tell you that I did not feel at all
      happy! What! deceive Julien? become the lover of this little, silly,
      wrong-headed, deceitful woman, who was, no doubt, terribly sensual, and
      whom her husband no longer satisfied.

“To betray him continually, to deceive him, to play at being in love
      merely because I was attracted by forbidden fruit, by the danger incurred
      and the friendship betrayed! No, that did not suit me, but what was I to
      do? To imitate Joseph would be acting a very stupid and, moreover,
      difficult part, for this woman was enchanting in her perfidy, inflamed by
      audacity, palpitating and excited. Let the man who has never felt on his
      lips the warm kiss of a woman who is ready to give herself to him throw
      the first stone at me.

“Well, a minute more—you understand what I mean? A minute
      more, and—I should have been—no, she would have been!—I
      beg your pardon, he would have been—when a loud noise made us both
      jump up. The log had fallen into the room, knocking over the fire irons
      and the fender, and on to the carpet, which it had scorched, and had
      rolled under an armchair, which it would certainly set alight.

“I jumped up like a madman, and, as I was replacing on the fire that
      log which had saved me, the door opened hastily, and Julien came in.

“''I am free,'' he said, with evident pleasure. ''The business was over
      two hours sooner than I expected!''

“Yes, my dear friend, without that log, I should have been caught in
      the very act, and you know what the consequences would have been!

“You may be sure that I took good care never to be found in a
      similar situation again, never, never. Soon afterward I saw that Julien
      was giving me the ''cold shoulder,'' as they say. His wife was evidently
      undermining our friendship. By degrees he got rid of me, and we have
      altogether ceased to meet.

Two years ago this spring I was making a walking tour along the shore of
      the Mediterranean. Is there anything more pleasant than to meditate while
      walking at a good pace along a highway? One walks in the sunlight, through
      the caressing breeze, at the foot of the mountains, along the coast of the
      sea. And one dreams! What a flood of illusions, loves, adventures pass
      through a pedestrian''s mind during a two hours'' march! What a crowd of
      confused and joyous hopes enter into you with the mild, light air! You
      drink them in with the breeze, and they awaken in your heart a longing for
      happiness which increases with the hun ger induced by walking. The
      fleeting, charming ideas fly and sing like birds.

I was following that long road which goes from Saint Raphael to Italy, or,
      rather, that long, splendid panoramic highway which seems made for the
      representation of all the love-poems of earth. And I thought that from
      Cannes, where one poses, to Monaco, where one gambles, people come to this
      spot of the earth for hardly any other purpose than to get embroiled or to
      throw away money on chance games, displaying under this delicious sky and
      in this garden of roses and oranges all base vanities and foolish
      pretensions and vile lusts, showing up the human mind such as it is,
      servile, ignorant, arrogant and full of cupidity.

Suddenly I saw some villas in one of those ravishing bays that one meets
      at every turn of the mountain; there were only four or five fronting the
      sea at the foot of the mountains, and behind them a wild fir wood slopes
      into two great valleys, that were untraversed by roads. I stopped short
      before one of these chalets, it was so pretty: a small white house with
      brown trimmings, overrun with rambler roses up to the top.

The garden was a mass of flowers, of all colors and all kinds, mixed in a
      coquettish, well-planned disorder. The lawn was full of them, big pots
      flanked each side of every step of the porch, pink or yellow clusters
      framed each window, and the terrace with the stone balustrade, which
      enclosed this pretty little dwelling, had a garland of enormous red bells,
      like drops of blood. Behind the house I saw a long avenue of orange trees
      in blossom, which went up to the foot of the mountain.

I asked myself what poet or what fairy was living there, what inspired,
      solitary being had discovered this spot and created this dream house,
      which seemed to nestle in a nosegay.

A workman was breaking stones up the street, and I went to him to ask the
      name of the proprietor of this jewel.

Julie Romain! In my childhood, long ago, I had heard them speak of this
      great actress, the rival of Rachel.

No woman ever was more applauded and more loved—especially more
      loved! What duets and suicides on her account and what sensational
      adventures! How old was this seductive woman now? Sixty, seventy,
      seventy-five! Julie Romain here, in this house! The woman who had been
      adored by the greatest musician and the most exquisite poet of our land! I
      still remember the sensation (I was then twelve years of age) which her
      flight to Sicily with the latter, after her rupture with the former,
      caused throughout France.

She had left one evening, after a premiere, where the audience had
      applauded her for a whole half hour, and had recalled her eleven times in
      succession. She had gone away with the poet, in a post-chaise, as was the
      fashion then; they had crossed the sea, to love each other in that antique
      island, the daughter of Greece, in that immense orange wood which
      surrounds Palermo, and which is called the “Shell of Gold.”

People told of their ascension of Mount Etna and how they had leaned over
      the immense crater, arm in arm, cheek to cheek, as if to throw themselves
      into the very abyss.

Now he was dead, that maker of verses so touching and so profound that
      they turned, the heads of a whole generation, so subtle and so mysterious
      that they opened a new world to the younger poets.

The other one also was dead—the deserted one, who had attained
      through her musical periods that are alive in the memories of all, periods
      of triumph and of despair, intoxicating triumph and heartrending despair.

A small servant answered, a boy of eighteen with awkward mien and clumsy
      hands. I wrote in pencil on my card a gallant compliment to the actress,
      begging her to receive me. Perhaps, if she knew my name, she would open
      her door to me.

The little valet took it in, and then came back, asking me to follow him.
      He led me to a neat and decorous salon, furnished in the Louis-Philippe
      style, with stiff and heavy furniture, from which a little maid of
      sixteen, slender but not pretty, took off the covers in my honor.

On the walls hung three portraits, that of the actress in one of her
      roles, that of the poet in his close-fitting greatcoat and the ruffled
      shirt then in style, and that of the musician seated at a piano.

She, blond, charming, but affected, according to the fashion of her day,
      was smiling, with her pretty mouth and blue eyes; the painting was
      careful, fine, elegant, but lifeless.

The whole place had the air of a bygone time, of days that were done and
      men who had vanished.

A door opened and a little woman entered, old, very old, very small, with
      white hair and white eyebrows, a veritable white mouse, and as quick and
      furtive of movement.

“Thank you, monsieur. How kind it is of the men of to-day to
      remember the women of yesterday! Sit down.”

I told her that her house had attracted me, that I had inquired for the
      proprietor''s name, and that, on learning it, I could not resist the desire
      to ring her bell.

“This gives me all the more pleasure, monsieur,” she replied,
      “as it is the first time that such a thing has happened. When I
      received your card, with the gracious note, I trembled as if an old friend
      who had disappeared for twenty years had been announced to me. I am like a
      dead body, whom no one remembers, of whom no one will think until the day
      when I shall actually die; then the newspapers will mention Julie Romain
      for three days, relating anecdotes and details of my life, reviving
      memories, and praising me greatly. Then all will be over with me.”

“And this will not be so very long now. In a few months, in a few
      days, nothing will remain but a little skeleton of this little woman who
      is now alive.”

She raised her eyes toward her portrait, which smiled down upon this
      caricature of herself; then she looked at those of the two men, the
      disdainful poet and the inspired musician, who seemed to say: “What
      does this ruin want of us?”

An indefinable, poignant, irresistible sadness overwhelmed my heart, the
      sadness of existences that have had their day, but who are still debating
      with their memories, like a person drowning in deep water.

From my seat I could see on the highroad the handsome carriages that were
      whirling from Nice to Monaco; inside them I saw young, pretty, rich and
      happy women and smiling, satisfied men. Following my eye, she understood
      my thought and murmured with a smile of resignation:

I saw that she was disposed to talk of herself, so I began to question
      her, gently and discreetly, as one might touch bruised flesh.

She spoke of her successes, her intoxications and her friends, of her
      whole triumphant existence.

“Both. I even confuse them up a little now in my old woman''s memory,
      and then I feel remorse.”

“Then, madame, your acknowledgment is not to them, but to Love
      itself. They were merely its interpreters.”

“Are you sure that you have not been, or that you might not have
      been, loved as well or better by a simple man, but not a great man, who
      would have offered to you his whole life and heart, all his thoughts, all
      his days, his whole being, while these gave you two redoubtable rivals,
      Music and Poetry?”

“No, monsieur, no!” she exclaimed emphatically, with that
      still youthful voice, which caused the soul to vibrate. “Another one
      might perhaps have loved me more, but he would not have loved me as these
      did. Ah! those two sang to me of the music of love as no one else in the
      world could have sung of it. How they intoxicated me! Could any other man
      express what they knew so well how to express in tones and in words? Is it
      enough merely to love if one cannot put all the poetry and all the music
      of heaven and earth into love? And they knew how to make a woman delirious
      with songs and with words. Yes, perhaps there was more of illusion than of
      reality in our passion; but these illusions lift you into the clouds,
      while realities always leave you trailing in the dust. If others have
      loved me more, through these two I have understood, felt and worshipped
      love.”

“You see, monsieur, with nearly every one the heart ages with the
      body. But this has not happened with me. My body is sixty-nine years old,
      while my poor heart is only twenty. And that is the reason why I live all
      alone, with my flowers and my dreams.”

“How you would laugh at me, if you knew, if you knew how I pass my
      evenings, when the weather is fine. I am ashamed and I pity myself at the
      same time.”

I accepted at once. She rang, delighted, and after giving some orders to
      the little maid she took me over her house.

A kind of glass-enclosed veranda, filled with shrubs, opened into the
      dining-room, revealing at the farther end the long avenue of orange trees
      extending to the foot of the mountain. A low seat, hidden by plants,
      indicated that the old actress often came there to sit down.

Then we went into the garden, to look at the flowers. Evening fell softly,
      one of those calm, moist evenings when the earth breathes forth all her
      perfumes. Daylight was almost gone when we sat down at table. The dinner
      was good and it lasted a long time, and we became intimate friends, she
      and I, when she understood what a profound sympathy she had aroused in my
      heart. She had taken two thimblefuls of wine, as the phrase goes, and had
      grown more confiding and expansive.

“Come, let us look at the moon,” she said. “I adore the
      good moon. She has been the witness of my most intense joys. It seems to
      me that all my memories are there, and that I need only look at her to
      bring them all back to me. And even—some times—in the evening—I
      offer to myself a pretty play—yes, pretty—if you only knew!
      But no, you would laugh at me. I cannot—I dare not—no, no—really—no.”

She hesitated. I took her hands—those poor little hands, so thin and
      so cold!—and I kissed them one after the other, several times, as
      her lovers had once kissed them. She was moved and hesitated.

She rose, and as the little domestic, awkward in his green livery, removed
      the chair behind her, she whispered quickly a few words into his ear.

The avenue of oranges was really splendid to see. The full moon made a
      narrow path of silver, a long bright line, which fell on the yellow sand,
      between the round, opaque crowns of the dark trees.

As these trees were in bloom, their strong, sweet perfume filled the
      night, and swarming among their dark foliage I saw thousands of fireflies,
      which looked like seeds fallen from the stars.

“This is what makes one long for more life. But you hardly think of
      these things, you men of to-day. You are speculators, merchants and men of
      affairs.

“You no longer even know how to talk to us. When I say ''you,'' I mean
      young men in general. Love has been turned into a liaison which very often
      begins with an unpaid dressmaker''s bill. If you think the bill is dearer
      than the woman, you disappear; but if you hold the woman more highly, you
      pay it. Nice morals—and a nice kind of love!”

I looked, astonished and delighted. Down there at the end of the avenue,
      in the moonlight, were two young people, with their arms around each
      other''s waist. They were walking along, interlaced, charming, with short,
      little steps, crossing the flakes of light; which illuminated them
      momentarily, and then sinking back into the shadow. The youth was dressed
      in a suit of white satin, such as men wore in the eighteenth century, and
      had on a hat with an ostrich plume. The girl was arrayed in a gown with
      panniers, and the high, powdered coiffure of the handsome dames of the
      time of the Regency.

They stopped a hundred paces from us, and standing in the middle of the
      avenue, they kissed each other with graceful gestures.

Suddenly I recognized the two little servants. Then one of those dreadful
      fits of laughter that convulse you made me writhe in my chair. But I did
      not laugh aloud. I resisted, convulsed and feeling almost ill, as a man
      whose leg is cut off resists the impulse to cry out.

As the young pair turned toward the farther end of the avenue they again
      became delightful. They went farther and farther away, finally
      disappearing as a dream disappears. I no longer saw them. The avenue
      seemed a sad place.

I took my leave at once, so as not to see them again, for I guessed that
      this little play would last a long time, awakening, as it did, a whole
      past of love and of stage scenery; the artificial past, deceitful and
      seductive, false but charming, which still stirred the heart of this
      amorous old comedienne.

I set out to see Italy thoroughly on two occasions, and each time I was
      stopped at the frontier and could not get any further. So I do not know
      Italy, said my friend, Charles Jouvent. And yet my two attempts gave me a
      charming idea of the manners of that beautiful country. Some time,
      however, I must visit its cities, as well as the museums and works of art
      with which it abounds. I will make another attempt to penetrate into the
      interior, which I have not yet succeeded in doing.

You don''t understand me, so I will explain: In the spring of 1874 I was
      seized with an irresistible desire to see Venice, Florence, Rome and
      Naples. I am, as you know, not a great traveller; it appears to me a
      useless and fatiguing business. Nights spent in a train, the disturbed
      slumbers of the railway carriage, with the attendant headache, and
      stiffness in every limb, the sudden waking in that rolling box, the
      unwashed feeling, with your eyes and hair full of dust, the smell of the
      coal on which one''s lungs feed, those bad dinners in the draughty
      refreshment rooms are, according to my ideas, a horrible way of beginning
      a pleasure trip.

After this introduction, we have the miseries of the hotel; of some great
      hotel full of people, and yet so empty; the strange room and the doubtful
      bed!

I am most particular about my bed; it is the sanctuary of life. We entrust
      our almost naked and fatigued bodies to it so that they may be reanimated
      by reposing between soft sheets and feathers.

There we find the most delightful hours of our existence, the hours of
      love and of sleep. The bed is sacred, and should be respected, venerated
      and loved by us as the best and most delightful of our earthly
      possessions.

I cannot lift up the sheets of a hotel bed without a shudder of disgust.
      Who has occupied it the night before? Perhaps dirty, revolting people have
      slept in it. I begin, then, to think of all the horrible people with whom
      one rubs shoulders every day, people with suspicious-looking skin which
      makes one think of the feet and all the rest! I call to mind those who
      carry about with them the sickening smell of garlic or of humanity. I
      think of those who are deformed and unhealthy, of the perspiration
      emanating from the sick, of everything that is ugly and filthy in man.

And all this, perhaps, in the bed in which I am about to sleep! The mere
      idea of it makes me feel ill as I get into it.

And then the hotel dinners—those dreary table d''hote dinners in the
      midst of all sorts of extraordinary people, or else those terrible
      solitary dinners at a small table in a restaurant, feebly lighted by a
      wretched composite candle under a shade.

Again, those terribly dull evenings in some unknown town! Do you know
      anything more wretched than the approach of dusk on such an occasion? One
      goes about as if almost in a dream, looking at faces that one never has
      seen before and never will see again; listening to people talking about
      matters which are quite indifferent to you in a language that perhaps you
      do not understand. You have a terrible feeling, almost as if you were
      lost, and you continue to walk on so as not to be obliged to return to the
      hotel, where you would feel more lost still because you are at home, in a
      home which belongs to anyone who can pay for it; and at last you sink into
      a chair of some well-lighted cafe, whose gilding and lights oppress you a
      thousand times more than the shadows in the streets. Then you feel so
      abominably lonely sitting in front of the glass of flat bock beer that a
      kind of madness seizes you, the longing to go somewhere or other, no
      matter where, as long as you need not remain in front of that marble table
      amid those dazzling lights.

And then, suddenly, you are aware that you are really alone in the world,
      always and everywhere, and that in places which we know, the familiar
      jostlings give us the illusion only of human fraternity. At such moments
      of self-abandonment and sombre isolation in distant cities one thinks
      broadly, clearly and profoundly. Then one suddenly sees the whole of life
      outside the vision of eternal hope, apart from the deceptions of our
      innate habits, and of our expectations of happiness, which we indulge in
      dreams never to be realized.

It is only by going a long distance from home that we can fully understand
      how short-lived and empty everything near at hand is; by searching for the
      unknown, we perceive how commonplace and evanescent everything is; only by
      wandering over the face of the earth can we understand how small the world
      is, and how very much alike it is everywhere.

How well I know, and how I hate and almost fear, those haphazard walks
      through unknown streets; and this was the reason why, as nothing would
      induce me to undertake a tour in Italy by myself, I made up my mind to
      accompany my friend Paul Pavilly.

You know Paul, and how he idealizes women. To him the earth is habitable
      only because they are there; the sun gives light and is warm because it
      shines upon them; the air is soft and balmy because it blows upon their
      skin and ruffles the soft hair on their temples; and the moon is charming
      because it makes them dream and imparts a languorous charm to love. Every
      act and action of Paul''s has woman for its motive; all his thoughts, all
      his efforts and hopes are centered in them.

When I mentioned Italy to Paul he at first absolutely refused to leave
      Paris. I, however, began to tell him of the adventures I had on my
      travels. I assured him that all Italian women are charming, and I made him
      hope for the most refined pleasures at Naples, thanks to certain letters
      of introduction which I had; and so at last he allowed himself to be
      persuaded.

We took the express one Thursday evening, Paul and I. Hardly anyone goes
      south at that time of the year, so that we had the carriages to ourselves,
      and both of us were in a bad temper on leaving Paris, sorry for having
      yielded to the temptation of this journey, and regretting Marly, the
      Seine, and our lazy boating excursions, and all those pleasures in and
      near Paris which are so dear to every true Parisian.

As soon as the train started Paul stuck himself in his corner, and said,
      “It is most idiotic to go all that distance,” and as it was
      too late for him to change his mind then, I said, “Well, you should
      not have come.”

He made no answer, and I felt very much inclined to laugh when I saw how
      furious he looked. He is certainly al' WHERE id = '6b5a5bab-cb6d-4c60-9071-cb95b01bf8ca';
