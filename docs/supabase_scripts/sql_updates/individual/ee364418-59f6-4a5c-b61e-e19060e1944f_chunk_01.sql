UPDATE stories SET original_text = 'The enterprise of Messrs. T. Nelson & Sons and the friendly
      accommodation of Messrs. Macmillan render possible this collection in one
      cover of all the short stories by me that I care for any one to read
      again. Except for the two series of linked incidents that make up the bulk
      of the book called Tales of Space and Time, no short story of mine
      of the slightest merit is excluded from this volume. Many of very
      questionable merit find a place; it is an inclusive and not an exclusive
      gathering. And the task of selection and revision brings home to me with
      something of the effect of discovery that I was once an industrious writer
      of short stories, and that I am no longer anything of the kind. I have not
      written one now for quite a long time, and in the past five or six years I
      have made scarcely one a year. The bulk of the fifty or sixty tales from
      which this present three-and-thirty have been chosen dates from the last
      century. This edition is more definitive than I supposed when first I
      arranged for it. In the presence of so conclusive an ebb and cessation an
      almost obituary manner seems justifiable.

I find it a little difficult to disentangle the causes that have
      restricted the flow of these inventions. It has happened, I remark, to
      others as well as to myself, and in spite of the kindliest encouragement
      to continue from editors and readers. There was a time when life bubbled
      with short stories; they were always coming to the surface of my mind, and
      it is no deliberate change of will that has thus restricted my production.
      It is rather, I think, a diversion of attention to more sustained and more
      exacting forms. It was my friend Mr. C.L. Hind who set that spring going.
      He urged me to write short stories for the Pall Mall Budget, and
      persuaded me by his simple and buoyant conviction that I could do what he
      desired. There existed at the time only the little sketch, "The Jilting of
      Jane," included in this volume—at least, that is the only tolerable
      fragment of fiction I find surviving from my pre-Lewis-Hind period. But I
      set myself, so encouraged, to the experiment of inventing moving and
      interesting things that could be given vividly in the little space of
      eight or ten such pages as this, and for a time I found it a very
      entertaining pursuit indeed. Mr. Hind''s indicating finger had shown me an
      amusing possibility of the mind. I found that, taking almost anything as a
      starting-point and letting my thoughts play about it, there would
      presently come out of the darkness, in a manner quite inexplicable, some
      absurd or vivid little incident more or less relevant to that initial
      nucleus. Little men in canoes upon sunlit oceans would come floating out
      of nothingness, incubating the eggs of prehistoric monsters unawares;
      violent conflicts would break out amidst the flower-beds of suburban
      gardens; I would discover I was peering into remote and mysterious worlds
      ruled by an order logical indeed but other than our common sanity.

The ''nineties was a good and stimulating period for a short-story writer.
      Mr. Kipling had made his astonishing advent with a series of little
      blue-grey books, whose covers opened like window-shutters to reveal the
      dusty sun-glare and blazing colours of the East; Mr. Barrie had
      demonstrated what could be done in a little space through the panes of his
      Window in Thrums. The National Observer was at the climax of
      its career of heroic insistence upon lyrical brevity and a vivid finish,
      and Mr. Frank Harris was not only printing good short stories by other
      people, but writing still better ones himself in the dignified pages of
      the Fortnightly Review. Longman''s Magazine, too, represented a clienthle
      of appreciative short-story readers that is now scattered. Then came the
      generous opportunities of the Yellow Book, and the National
      Observer died only to give birth to the New Review. No short
      story of the slightest distinction went for long unrecognised. The
      sixpenny popular magazines had still to deaden down the conception of what
      a short story might be to the imaginative limitation of the common reader—and
      a maximum length of six thousand words. Short stories broke out
      everywhere. Kipling was writing short stories; Barrie, Stevenson,
      Frank-Harris; Max Beerbohm wrote at least one perfect one, "The Happy
      Hypocrite"; Henry James pursued his wonderful and inimitable bent; and
      among other names that occur to me, like a mixed handful of jewels drawn
      from a bag, are George Street, Morley Roberts, George Gissing, Ella
      d''Arcy, Murray Gilchrist, E. Nesbit, Stephen Crane, Joseph Conrad, Edwin
      Pugh, Jerome K. Jerome, Kenneth Graham, Arthur Morrison, Marriott Watson,
      George Moore, Grant Allen, George Egerton, Henry Harland, Pett Ridge, W.
      W. Jacobs (who alone seems inexhaustible). I dare say I could recall as
      many more names with a little effort. I may be succumbing to the
      infirmities of middle age, but I do not think the present decade can
      produce any parallel to this list, or what is more remarkable, that the
      later achievements in this field of any of the survivors from that time,
      with the sole exception of Joseph Conrad, can compare with the work they
      did before 1900. It seems to me this outburst of short stories came not
      only as a phase in literary development, but also as a phase in the
      development of the individual writers concerned.

It is now quite unusual to see any adequate criticism of short stories in
      English. I do not know how far the decline in short-story writing may not
      be due to that. Every sort of artist demands human responses, and few men
      can contrive to write merely for a publisher''s cheque and silence, however
      reassuring that cheque may be. A mad millionaire who commissioned
      masterpieces to burn would find it impossible to buy them. Scarcely any
      artist will hesitate in the choice between money and attention; and it was
      primarily for that last and better sort of pay that the short stories of
      the ''nineties were written. People talked about them tremendously,
      compared them, and ranked them. That was the thing that mattered.

It was not, of course, all good talk, and we suffered then, as now, from
      the ` priori critic. Just as nowadays he goes about declaring that
      the work of such-and-such a dramatist is all very amusing and delightful,
      but "it isn''t a Play," so we'' had a great deal of talk about the
      short story, and found ourselves measured by all kinds of arbitrary
      standards. There was a tendency to treat the short story as though it was
      as definable a form as the sonnet, instead of being just exactly what any
      one of courage and imagination can get told in twenty minutes'' reading or
      so. It was either Mr. Edward Garnett or Mr. George Moore in a violently
      anti-Kipling mood who invented the distinction between the short story and
      the anecdote. The short story was Maupassant; the anecdote was damnable.
      It was a quite infernal comment in its way, because it permitted no
      defence. Fools caught it up and used it freely. Nothing is so destructive
      in a field of artistic effort as a stock term of abuse. Anyone could say
      of any short story, "A mere anecdote," just as anyone can say
      "Incoherent!" of any novel or of any sonata that isn''t studiously
      monotonous. The recession of enthusiasm for this compact, amusing form is
      closely associated in my mind with that discouraging imputation. One felt
      hopelessly open to a paralysing and unanswerable charge, and one''s ease
      and happiness in the garden of one''s fancies was more and more marred by
      the dread of it. It crept into one''s mind, a distress as vague and
      inexpugnable as a sea fog on a spring morning, and presently one shivered
      and wanted to go indoors...It is the absurd fate of the imaginative writer
      that he should be thus sensitive to atmospheric conditions.

But after one has died as a maker one may still live as a critic, and I
      will confess I am all for laxness and variety in this as in every field of
      art. Insistence upon rigid forms and austere unities seems to me the
      instinctive reaction of the sterile against the fecund. It is the tired
      man with a headache who values a work of art for what it does not contain.
      I suppose it is the lot of every critic nowadays to suffer from
      indigestion and a fatigued appreciation, and to develop a self-protective
      tendency towards rules that will reject, as it were, automatically the
      more abundant and irregular forms. But this world is not for the weary,
      and in the long-run it is the new and variant that matter. I refuse
      altogether to recognise any hard and fast type for the Short Story, any
      more than I admit any limitation upon the liberties of the Small Picture.
      The short story is a fiction that may be read in something under an hour,
      and so that it is moving and delightful, it does not matter whether it is
      as "trivial" as a Japanese print of insects seen closely between grass
      stems, or as spacious as the prospect of the plain of Italy from Monte
      Mottarone. It does not matter whether it is human or inhuman, or whether
      it leaves you thinking deeply or radiantly but superficially pleased. Some
      things are more easily done as short stories than others and more
      abundantly done, but one of the many pleasures of short-story writing is
      to achieve the impossible.

At any rate, that is the present writer''s conception of the art of the
      short story, as the jolly art of making something very bright and moving;
      it may be horrible or pathetic or funny or beautiful or profoundly
      illuminating, having only this essential, that it should take from fifteen
      to fifty minutes to read aloud. All the rest is just whatever invention
      and imagination and the mood can give—a vision of buttered slides on
      a busy day or of unprecedented worlds. In that spirit of miscellaneous
      expectation these stories should be received. Each is intended to be a
      thing by itself; and if it is not too ungrateful to kindly and
      enterprising publishers, I would confess I would much prefer to see each
      printed expensively alone, and left in a little brown-paper cover to lie
      about a room against the needs of a quite casual curiosity. And I would
      rather this volume were found in the bedrooms of convalescents and in
      dentists'' parlours and railway trains than in gentlemen''s studies. I would
      rather have it dipped in and dipped in again than read severely through.
      Essentially it is a miscellany of inventions, many of which were very
      pleasant to write; and its end is more than attained if some of them are
      refreshing and agreeable to read. I have now re-read them all, and I am
      glad to think I wrote them. I like them, but I cannot tell how much the
      associations of old happinesses gives them a flavour for me. I make no
      claims for them and no apology; they will be read as long as people read
      them. Things written either live or die; unless it be for a place of
      judgment upon Academic impostors, there is no apologetic intermediate
      state.

I may add that I have tried to set a date to most of these stories, but
      that they are not arranged in strictly chronological order.

As I sit writing in my study, I can hear our Jane bumping her way
      downstairs with a brush and dust-pan. She used in the old days to sing
      hymn tunes, or the British national song for the time being, to these
      instruments, but latterly she has been silent and even careful over her
      work. Time was when I prayed with fervour for such silence, and my wife
      with sighs for such care, but now they have come we are not so glad as we
      might have anticipated we should be. Indeed, I would rejoice secretly,
      though it may be unmanly weakness to admit it, even to hear Jane sing
      "Daisy," or, by the fracture of any plate but one of Euphemia''s best green
      ones, to learn that the period of brooding has come to an end.

Yet how we longed to hear the last of Jane''s young man before we heard the
      last of him! Jane was always very free with her conversation to my wife,
      and discoursed admirably in the kitchen on a variety of topics—so
      well, indeed, that I sometimes left my study door open—our house is
      a small one—to partake of it. But after William came, it was always
      William, nothing but William; William this and William that; and when we
      thought William was worked out and exhausted altogether, then William all
      over again. The engagement lasted altogether three years; yet how she got
      introduced to William, and so became thus saturated with him, was always a
      secret. For my part, I believe it was at the street corner where the Rev.
      Barnabas Baux used to hold an open-air service after evensong on Sundays.
      Young Cupids were wont to flit like moths round the paraffin flare of that
      centre of High Church hymn-singing. I fancy she stood singing hymns there,
      out of memory and her imagination, instead of coming home to get supper,
      and William came up beside her and said, "Hello!" "Hello yourself!" she
      said; and etiquette being satisfied, they proceeded to talk together.

As Euphemia has a reprehensible way of letting her servants talk to her,
      she soon heard of him. "He is such a respectable young man, ma''am,"
      said Jane, "you don''t know." Ignoring the slur cast on her acquaintance,
      my wife inquired further about this William.

"He is second porter at Maynard''s, the draper''s," said Jane, "and gets
      eighteen shillings—nearly a pound—a week, m''m; and when the
      head porter leaves he will be head porter. His relatives are quite
      superior people, m''m. Not labouring people at all. His father was a
      greengrosher, m''m, and had a churnor, and he was bankrup'' twice. And one
      of his sisters is in a Home for the Dying. It will be a very good match
      for me, m''m," said Jane, "me being an orphan girl."

"Well, Jane, when you are properly engaged to him you may ask him round
      here on Sunday afternoons, and have tea with him in the kitchen;" for my
      Euphemia has a motherly conception of her duty towards her maid-servants.
      And presently the amethystine ring was being worn about the house, even
      with ostentation, and Jane developed a new way of bringing in the joint so
      that this gage was evident. The elder Miss Maitland was aggrieved by it,
      and told my wife that servants ought not to wear rings. But my wife looked
      it up in Enquire Within and Mrs. Motherly''s Book of Household
      Management, and found no prohibition. So Jane remained with this
      happiness added to her love.

The treasure of Jane''s heart appeared to me to be what respectable people
      call a very deserving young man. "William, ma''am," said Jane one day
      suddenly, with ill-concealed complacency, as she counted out the beer
      bottles, "William, ma''am, is a teetotaller. Yes, m''m; and he don''t smoke.
      Smoking, ma''am," said Jane, as one who reads the heart, "do make
      such a dust about. Beside the waste of money. And the smell.
      However, I suppose they got to do it—some of them..."

William was at first a rather shabby young man of the ready-made black
      coat school of costume. He had watery gray eyes, and a complexion
      appropriate to the brother of one in a Home for the Dying. Euphemia did
      not fancy him very much, even at the beginning. His eminent respectability
      was vouched for by an alpaca umbrella, from which he never allowed himself
      to be parted.

"His papa, ma''am, was Church: but Mr. Maynard is a Plymouth Brother, and
      William thinks it Policy, ma''am, to go there too. Mr. Maynard comes and
      talks to him quite friendly when they ain''t busy, about using up all the
      ends of string, and about his soul. He takes a lot of notice, do Mr.
      Maynard, of William, and the way he saves his soul, ma''am."

Presently we heard that the head porter at Maynard''s had left, and that
      William was head porter at twenty-three shillings a week. "He is really
      kind of over the man who drives the van," said Jane, "and him married,
      with three children." And she promised in the pride of her heart to make
      interest for us with William to favour us so that we might get our parcels
      of drapery from Maynard''s with exceptional promptitude.

After this promotion a rapidly-increasing prosperity came upon Jane''s
      young man. One day we learned that Mr. Maynard had given William a book.
      "''Smiles'' ''Elp Yourself,'' it''s called," said Jane; "but it ain''t comic. It
      tells you how to get on in the world, and some what William read to me was
      lovely, ma''am."

Euphemia told me of this, laughing, and then she became suddenly grave.
      "Do you know, dear," she said, "Jane said one thing I did not like. She
      had been quiet for a minute, and then she suddenly remarked, ''William is a
      lot above me, ma''am, ain''t he?''"

One Sunday afternoon about that time I was sitting at my writing-desk—
      possibly I was reading a good book—when a something went by the
      window. I heard a startled exclamation behind me, and saw Euphemia with
      her hands clasped together and her eyes dilated. "George," she said in an
      awe-stricken whisper, "did you see?"

Then we both spoke to one another at the same moment, slowly and solemnly:
      "A silk hat! Yellow gloves! A new umbrella!"

"It may be my fancy, dear," said Euphemia; "but his tie was very like
      yours. I believe Jane keeps him in ties. She told me a little while ago,
      in a way that implied volumes about the rest of your costume, ''The master
      do wear pretty ties, ma''am.'' And he echoes all your novelties."

The young couple passed our window again on their way to their customary
      walk. They were arm in arm. Jane looked exquisitely proud, happy, and
      uncomfortable, with new white cotton gloves, and William, in the silk hat,
      singularly genteel!

That was the culmination of Jane''s happiness. When she returned, "Mr.
      Maynard has been talking to William, ma''am," she said, "and he is to serve
      customers, just like the young shop gentlemen, during the next sale. And
      if he gets on, he is to be made an assistant, ma''am, at the first
      opportunity. He has got to be as gentlemanly as he can, ma''am; and if he
      ain''t, ma''am, he says it won''t be for want of trying. Mr. Maynard has took
      a great fancy to him."

That next Sunday as I drank my tea I interrogated my wife. "How is this
      Sunday different from all other Sundays, little woman? What has happened?
      Have you altered the curtains, or re-arranged the furniture, or where is
      the indefinable difference of it? Are you wearing your hair in a new way
      without warning me? I perceive a change clearly, and I cannot for the life
      of me say what it is."

Then my wife answered in her most tragic voice, "George," she said, "that
      William has not come near the place to-day! And Jane is crying her heart
      out upstairs."

There followed a period of silence. Jane, as I have said, stopped singing
      about the house, and began to care for our brittle possessions, which
      struck my wife as being a very sad sign indeed. The next Sunday, and the
      next, Jane asked to go out, "to walk with William," and my wife, who never
      attempts to extort confidences, gave her permission, and asked no
      questions. On each occasion Jane came back looking flushed and very
      determined. At last one day she became communicative.

"William is being led away," she remarked abruptly, with a catching of the
      breath, apropos of tablecloths. "Yes, m''m. She is a milliner, and she can
      play on the piano."

"Not out with him, m''m—after him. I walked along by the side of
      them, and told her he was engaged to me."

"I wish," said Jane, "I could play the piano, ma''am. But anyhow, I don''t
      mean to let her get him away from me. She''s older than him, and her
      hair ain''t gold to the roots, ma''am."

It was on the August Bank Holiday that the crisis came. We do not clearly
      know the details of the fray, but only such fragments as poor Jane let
      fall. She came home dusty, excited, and with her heart hot within her.

The milliner''s mother, the milliner, and William had made a party to the
      Art Museum at South Kensington, I think. Anyhow, Jane had calmly but
      firmly accosted them somewhere in the streets, and asserted her right to
      what, in spite of the consensus of literature, she held to be her
      inalienable property. She did, I think, go so far as to lay hands on him.
      They dealt with her in a crushingly superior way. They "called a cab."
      There was a "scene," William being pulled away into the four-wheeler by
      his future wife and mother-in-law from the reluctant hands of our
      discarded Jane. There were threats of giving her "in charge."

"My poor Jane!" said my wife, mincing veal as though she was mincing
      William. "It''s a shame of them. I would think no more of him. He is not
      worthy of you."

"But it''s that woman has done it," said Jane. She was never known to bring
      herself to pronounce "that woman''s" name or to admit her girlishness. "I
      can''t think what minds some women must have—to try and get a girl''s
      young man away from her. But there, it only hurts to talk about it," said
      Jane.

Thereafter our house rested from William. But there was something in the
      manner of Jane''s scrubbing the front doorstep or sweeping out the rooms, a
      certain viciousness, that persuaded me that the story had not yet ended.

"My dear," said my wife, fluttering into my room about twenty minutes
      after Jane had started, "Jane has been to the boot-hole and taken all the
      left-off boots and shoes, and gone off to the wedding with them in a bag.
      Surely she cannot mean—"

Jane came back with a pale, hard face. All the boots seemed to be still in
      her bag, at which my wife heaved a premature sigh of relief. We heard her
      go upstairs and replace the boots with considerable emphasis.

"Quite a crowd at the wedding, ma''am," she said presently, in a purely
      conversational style, sitting in our little kitchen, and scrubbing the
      potatoes; "and such a lovely day for them." She proceeded to numerous
      other details, clearly avoiding some cardinal incident.

"It was all extremely respectable and nice, ma''am; but her father
      didn''t wear a black coat, and looked quite out of place, ma''am. Mr.
      Piddingquirk—"

"Mr. Piddingquirk—William that was, ma''am—had white gloves,
      and a coat like a clergyman, and a lovely chrysanthemum. He looked so
      nice, ma''am. And there was red carpet down, just like for gentlefolks. And
      they say he gave the clerk four shillings, ma''am. It was a real kerridge
      they had—not a fly. When they came out of church there was
      rice-throwing, and her two little sisters dropping dead flowers. And
      someone threw a slipper, and then I threw a boot—"

"Yes, ma''am. Aimed at her. But it hit him. Yes, ma''am, hard. Gev
      him a black eye, I should think. I only threw that one. I hadn''t the heart
      to try again. All the little boys cheered when it hit him."

Another pause. The potatoes were being scrubbed violently. "He always was
      a bit above me, you know, ma''am. And he was led away."

The potatoes were more than finished. Jane rose sharply with a sigh, and
      rapped the basin down on the table.

"I don''t care," she said. "I don''t care a rap. He will find out his
      mistake yet. It serves me right. I was stuck up about him. I ought not to
      have looked so high. And I am glad things are as things are."

My wife was in the kitchen, seeing to the higher cookery. After the
      confession of the boot-throwing, she must have watched poor Jane fuming
      with a certain dismay in those brown eyes of hers. But I imagine they
      softened again very quickly, and then Jane''s must have met them.

"Oh, ma''am," said Jane, with an astonishing change of note, "think of all
      that might have been! Oh, ma''am, I could have been so happy!
      I ought to have known, but I didn''t know...You''re very kind to let me talk
      to you, ma''am...for it''s hard on me, ma''am...it''s har-r-r-r-d—"

And I gather that Euphemia so far forgot herself as to let Jane sob out
      some of the fullness of her heart on a sympathetic shoulder. My Euphemia,
      thank Heaven, has never properly grasped the importance of "keeping up her
      position." And since that fit of weeping, much of the accent of bitterness
      has gone out of Jane''s scrubbing and brush work.

Indeed, something passed the other day with the butcher-boy—but that
      scarcely belongs to this story. However, Jane is young still, and time and
      change are at work with her. We all have our sorrows, but I do not believe
      very much in the existence of sorrows that never heal.

The night was hot and overcast, the sky red-rimmed with the lingering
      sunset of midsummer. They sat at the open window, trying to fancy the air
      was fresher there. The trees and shrubs of the garden stood stiff and
      dark; beyond in the roadway a gas-lamp burnt, bright orange against the
      hazy blue of the evening. Farther were the three lights of the railway
      signal against the lowering sky. The man and woman spoke to one another in
      low tones.

"Not he," she said peevishly, as though that too irritated her. "He thinks
      of nothing but the works and the prices of fuel. He has no imagination, no
      poetry."

"He has not," she said. She turned her discontented face towards
      the window. The distant sound of a roaring and rushing drew nearer and
      grew in volume; the house quivered; one heard the metallic rattle of the
      tender. As the train passed, there was a glare of light above the cutting
      and a driving tumult of smoke; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
      eight black oblongs—eight trucks—passed across the dim grey of
      the embankment, and were suddenly extinguished one by one in the throat of
      the tunnel, which, with the last, seemed to swallow down train, smoke, and
      sound in one abrupt gulp.

"This country was all fresh and beautiful once," he said; "and now—it
      is Gehenna. Down that way—nothing but pot-banks and chimneys
      belching fire and dust into the face of heaven...But what does it matter?
      An end comes, an end to all this cruelty...To-morrow." He spoke the
      last word in a whisper.

She turned with a start, and their eyes searched one another''s. Hers
      softened to his gaze. "My dear one!" she said, and then: "It seems so
      strange—that you should have come into my life like this—to
      open—" She paused.

"All this wonderful world"—she hesitated, and spoke still more
      softly— "this world of love to me."

Then suddenly the door clicked and closed. They turned their heads, and he
      started violently back. In the shadow of the room stood a great shadowy
      figure-silent. They saw the face dimly in the half-light, with
      unexpressive dark patches under the pent-house brows. Every muscle in
      Raut''s body suddenly became tense. When could the door have opened? What
      had he heard? Had he heard all? What had he seen? A tumult of questions.

"I was afraid I had missed you, Horrocks," said the man at the window,
      gripping the window-ledge with his hand. His voice was unsteady.

The clumsy figure of Horrocks came forward out of the shadow. He made no
      answer to Raut''s remark. For a moment he stood above them.

The woman''s heart was cold within her. "I told Mr. Raut it was just
      possible you might come back," she said in a voice that never quivered.

Horrocks, still silent, sat down abruptly in the chair by her little
      work-table. His big hands were clenched; one saw now the fire of his eyes
      under the shadow of his brows. He was trying to get his breath. His eyes
      went from the woman he had trusted to the friend he had trusted, and then
      back to the woman.

By this time and for the moment all three half understood one another. Yet
      none dared say a word to ease the pent-up things that choked them.

"I promised to show you some fine effects of moonlight and smoke,"
      repeated Horrocks in a colourless voice.

"And I thought I might catch you to-night before you went down to the
      works," proceeded Raut, "and come with you."

There was another pause. Did the man mean to take the thing coolly? Did
      he, after all, know? How long had he been in the room? Yet even at the
      moment when they heard the door, their attitudes ... Horrocks glanced at
      the profile of the woman, shadowy pallid in the half-light. Then he
      glanced at Raut, and seemed to recover himself suddenly. "Of course," he
      said, "I promised to show you the works under their proper dramatic
      conditions. It''s odd how I could have forgotten."

Horrocks started again. A new light had suddenly come into the sultry
      gloom of his eyes. "Not in the least." he said.

"Have you been telling Mr. Raut of all these contrasts of flame and shadow
      you think so splendid?" said the woman, turning now to her husband for the
      first time, her confidence creeping back again, her voice just one
      half-note too high—"that dreadful theory of yours that machinery is
      beautiful, and everything else in the world ugly. I thought he would not
      spare you, Mr. Raut. It''s his great theory, his one discovery in art."

"I am slow to make discoveries," said Horrocks grimly, damping her
      suddenly. "But what I discover ..." He stopped.

"I promised to show you the works," he said to Raut, and put his big,
      clumsy hand on his friend''s shoulder. "And you are ready to go?"

There was another pause. Each of them peered through the indistinctness of
      the dusk at the other two.

Horrocks'' hand still rested on Raut''s shoulder. Raut half fancied still
      that the incident was trivial after all. But Mrs. Horrocks knew her
      husband better, knew that grim quiet in his voice, and the confusion in
      her mind took a vague shape of physical evil. "Very well," said Horrocks,
      and, dropping his hand, turned towards the door.

"That''s my work-basket," said Mrs. Horrocks with a gust of hysterical
      laughter. Their hands came together on the back of the chair. "Here it
      is!" he said. She had an impulse to warn him in an undertone, but she
      could not frame a word. "Don''t go!" and "Beware of him!" struggled in her
      mind, and the swift moment passed.

Raut stepped towards him. "Better say goodbye to Mrs. Horrocks," said the
      ironmaster, even more grimly quiet in his tone than before.

Horrocks held the door open with a ceremonial politeness unusual in him
      towards men. Raut went out, and then, after a wordless look at her, her
      husband followed. She stood motionless while Raut''s light footfall and her
      husband''s heavy tread, like bass and treble, passed down the passage
      together. The front door slammed heavily. She went to the window, moving
      slowly, and stood watching, leaning forward. The two men appeared for a
      moment at the gateway in the road, passed under the street lamp, and were
      hidden by the black masses of the shrubbery. The lamplight fell for a
      moment on their faces, showing only unmeaning pale patches, telling
      nothing of what she still feared, and doubted, and craved vainly to know.
      Then she sank down into a crouching attitude in the big arm-chair, her
      eyes-wide open and staring out at the red lights from the furnaces that
      flickered in the sky. An hour after she was still there, her attitude
      scarcely changed.

The oppressive stillness of the evening weighed heavily upon Raut. They
      went side by side down the road in silence, and in silence turned into the
      cinder-made byway that presently opened out the prospect of the valley.

A blue haze, half dust, half mist, touched the long valley with mystery.
      Beyond were Hanley and Etruria, grey and dark masses, outlined thinly by
      the rare golden dots of the street lamps, and here and there a gas-lit
      window, or the yellow glare of some late-working factory or crowded
      public-house. Out of the masses, clear and slender against the evening
      sky, rose a multitude of tall chimneys, many of them reeking, a few
      smokeless during a season of "play." Here and there a pallid patch and
      ghostly stunted beehive shapes showed the position of a pot-bank or a
      wheel, black and sharp against the hot lower sky, marked some colliery
      where they raise the iridescent coal of the place. Nearer at hand was the
      broad stretch of railway, and half-invisible trains shunted—a steady
      puffing and rumbling, with every run a ringing concussion and a rhymthic
      series of impacts, and a passage of intermittent puffs of white steam
      across the further view. And to the left, between the railway and the dark
      mass of the low hill beyond, dominating the whole view, colossal,
      inky-black, and crowned with smoke and fitful flames, stood the great
      cylinders of the Jeddah Company Blast Furnaces, the central edifices of
      the big ironworks of which Horrocks was the manager. They stood heavy and
      threatening, full of an incessant turmoil of flames and seething molten
      iron, and about the feet of them rattled the rolling-mills, and the
      steam-hammer beat heavily and splashed the white iron sparks hither and
      thither. Even as they looked, a truckful of fuel was shot into one of the
      giants, and the red flames gleamed out, and a confusion of smoke and black
      dust came boiling upwards towards the sky.

"Certainly you get some colour with your furnaces," said Raut, breaking a
      silence that had become apprehensive.

Horrocks grunted. He stood with his hands in his pockets, frowning down at
      the dim steaming railway and the busy ironworks beyond, frowning as if he
      were thinking out some knotty problem.

Raut glanced at him and away again. "At present your moonlight effect is
      hardly ripe," he continued, looking upward; "the moon is still smothered
      by the vestiges of daylight."

Horrocks stared at him with the expression of a man who has suddenly
      awakened. "Vestiges of daylight? ... Of course, of course." He too looked
      up at the moon, pale still in the midsummer sky. "Come along," he said
      suddenly, and gripping Raut''s arm in his hand, made a move towards the
      path that dropped from them to the railway.

Raut hung back. Their eyes met and saw a thousand things in a moment that
      their lips came near to say. Horrocks''s hand tightened and then relaxed.
      He let go, and before Raut was aware of it, they were arm in arm, and
      walking, one unwillingly enough, down the path.

"You see the fine effect of the railway signals towards Burslem," said
      Horrocks, suddenly breaking into loquacity, striding fast and tightening
      the grip of his elbow the while—"little green lights and red and
      white lights, all against the haze. You have an eye for effect, Raut. It''s
      fine. And look at those furnaces of mine, how they rise upon us as we come
      down the hill. That to the right is my pet—seventy feet of him. I
      packed him myself, and he''s boiled away cheerfully with iron in his guts
      for five long years. I''ve a particular fancy for him. That line of
      red there—a lovely bit of warm orange you''d call it, Raut—that''s
      the puddlers'' furnaces, and there, in the hot light, three black figures—did
      you see the white splash of the steam-hammer then?—that''s the
      rolling mills. Come along! Clang, clatter, how it goes rattling across the
      floor! Sheet tin, Raut,—amazing stuff. Glass mirrors are not in it
      when that stuff comes from the mill. And, squelch! there goes the hammer
      again. Come along!"

He had to stop talking to catch at his breath. His arm twisted into Raut''s
      with benumbing tightness. He had come striding down the black path towards
      the railway as though he was possessed. Raut had not spoken a word, had
      simply hung back against Horrocks''s pull with all his strength.

"I say," he said now, laughing nervously, but with an undertone of snarl
      in his voice, "why on earth are you nipping my arm off, Horrocks, and
      dragging me along like this?"

At length Horrocks released him. His manner changed again. "Nipping your
      arm off?" he said. "Sorry. But it''s you taught me the trick of walking in
      that friendly way."

"You haven''t learnt the refinements of it yet then," said Raut, laughing
      artificially again. "By Jove! I''m black and blue." Horrocks offered no
      apology. They stood now near the bottom of the hill, close to the fence
      that bordered the railway. The ironworks had grown larger and spread out
      with their approach. They looked up to the blast furnaces now instead of
      down; the further view of Etruria and Hanley had dropped out of sight with
      their descent. Before them, by the stile, rose a notice-board, bearing,
      still dimly visible, the words, "BEWARE OF THE TRAINS," half hidden by
      splashes of coaly mud.

"Fine effects," said Horrocks, waving his arm. "Here comes a train. The
      puffs of smoke, the orange glare, the round eye of light in front of it,
      the melodious rattle. Fine effects! But these furnaces of mine used to be
      finer, before we shoved cones in their throats, and saved the gas."

"Cones, my man, cones. I''ll show you one nearer. The flames used to flare
      out of the open throats, great—what is it?—pillars of cloud by
      day, red and black smoke, and pillars of fire by night. Now we run it off—in
      pipes, and burn it to heat the blast, and the top is shut by a cone.
      You''ll be interested in that cone."

"The cone''s not fixed, it''s hung by a chain from a lever, and balanced by
      an equipoise. You shall see it nearer. Else, of course, there''d be no way
      of getting fuel into the thing. Every now and then the cone dips, and out
      comes the flare."

"Come along," said Horrocks abruptly, gripping his shoulder again, and
      moving him suddenly towards the railway crossing. And then came one of
      those swift incidents, vivid, but so rapid that they leave one doubtful
      and reeling. Half-way across, Horrocks''s hand suddenly clenched upon him
      like a vice, and swung him backward and through a half-turn, so that he
      looked up the line. And there a chain of lamp-lit carriage windows
      telescoped swiftly as it came towards them, and the red and yellow lights
      of an engine grew larger and larger, rushing down upon them. As he grasped
      what this meant, he turned his face to Horrocks, and pushed with all his
      strength against the arm that held him back between the rails. The
      struggle did not last a moment. Just as certain as it was that Horrocks
      held him there, so certain was it that he had been violently lugged out of
      danger.

"Out of the way," said Horrocks with a gasp, as the train came rattling
      by, and they stood panting by the gate into the ironworks.

"I did not see it coming," said Raut, still, even in spite of his own
      apprehensions, trying to keep up an appearance of ordinary intercourse.

Horrocks answered with a grunt. "The cone," he said, and then, as one who
      recovers himself, "I thought you did not hear."

Horrocks stood for half a minute, then turned abruptly towards the
      ironworks again. "See how fine these great mounds of mine, these
      clinker-heaps, look in the night! That truck yonder, up above there! Up it
      goes, and out-tilts the slag. See the palpitating red stuff go sliding
      down the slope. As we get nearer, the heap rises up and cuts the blast
      furnaces. See the quiver up above the big one. Not that way! This way,
      between the heaps. That goes to the puddling furnaces, but I want to show
      you the canal first." He came and took Raut by the elbow, and so they went
      along side by side. Raut answered Horrocks vaguely. What, he asked
      himself, had really happened on the line? Was he deluding himself with his
      own fancies, or had Horrocks actually held him back in the way of the
      train? Had he just been within an ace of being murdered?

Suppose this slouching, scowling monster did know anything? For a
      minute or two then Raut was really afraid for his life, but the mood
      passed as he reasoned with himself. After all, Horrocks might have heard
      nothing. At any rate, he had pulled him out of the way in time. His odd
      manner might be due to the mere vague jealousy he had shown once before.
      He was talking now of the ash-heaps and the canal. "Eigh?" said Horrocks.

"Our canal," said Horrocks, stopping suddenly. "Our canal by moonlight and
      firelight is immense. You''ve never seen it? Fancy that! You''ve spent too
      many of your evenings philandering up in Newcastle there. I tell you, for
      real florid quality——But you shall see. Boiling water ..."

As they came out of the labyrinth of clinker-heaps and mounds of coal and
      ore, the noises of the rolling-mill sprang upon them suddenly, loud, near,
      and distinct. Three shadowy workmen went by and touched their caps to
      Horrocks. Their faces were vague in the darkness. Raut felt a futile
      impulse to address them, and before he could frame his words they passed
      into the shadows. Horrocks pointed to the canal close before them now: a
      weird-looking place it seemed, in the blood-red reflections of the
      furnaces. The hot water that cooled the tuyhres came into it, some fifty
      yards up—a tumultuous, almost boiling affluent, and the steam rose
      up from the water in silent white wisps and streaks, wrapping damply about
      them, an incessant succession of ghosts coming up from the black and red
      eddies, a white uprising that made the head swim. The shining black tower
      of the larger blast-furnace rose overhead out of the mist, and its
      tumultuous riot filled their ears. Raut kept away from the edge of the
      water, and watched Horrocks.

"Here it is red," said Horrocks, "blood-red vapour as red and hot as sin;
      but yonder there, where the moonlight falls on it, and it drives across
      the clinker-heaps, it is as white as death."

Raut turned his head for a moment, and then came back hastily to his watch
      on Horrocks. "Come along to the rolling-mills," said Horrocks. The
      threatening hold was not so evident that time, and Raut felt a little
      reassured. But all the same, what on earth did Horrocks mean about "white
      as death" and "red as sin"? Coincidence, perhaps?

They went and stood behind the puddlers for a little while, and then
      through the rolling-mills, where amidst an incessant din the deliberate
      steam-hammer beat the juice out of the succulent iron, and black,
      half-naked Titans rushed the plastic bars, like hot sealing-wax, between
      the wheels, "Come on," said Horrocks in Raut''s ear; and they went and
      peeped through the little glass hole behind the tuyhres, and saw the
      tumbled fire writhing in the pit of the blast-furnace. It left one eye
      blinded for a while. Then, with green and blue patches dancing across the
      dark, they went to the lift by which the trucks of ore and fuel and lime
      were raised to the top of the big cylinder.

And out upon the narrow rail that overhung the furnace Raut''s doubts came
      upon him again. Was it wise to be here? If Horrocks did know—everything!
      Do what he would, he could not resist a violent trembling. Right under
      foot was a sheer depth of seventy feet. It was a dangerous place. They
      pushed by a truck of fuel to get to the railing that crowned the thing.
      The reek of the furnace, a sulphurous vapour streaked with pungent
      bitterness, seemed to make the distant hillside of Hanley quiver. The moon
      was riding out now from among a drift of clouds, half-way up the sky above
      the undulating wooded outlines of Newcastle. The steaming canal ran away
      from below them under an indistinct bridge, and vanished into the dim haze
      of the flat fields towards Burslem.

"That''s the cone I''ve been telling you of," shouted Horrocks; "and, below
      that, sixty feet of fire and molten metal, with the air of the blast
      frothing through it like gas in soda-water."

Raut gripped the hand-rail tightly, and stared down at the cone. The heat
      was intense. The boiling of the iron and the tumult of the blast made a
      thunderous accompaniment to Horrocks''s voice. But the thing had to be gone
      through now. Perhaps, after all...

"In the middle," bawled Horrocks, "temperature near a thousand degrees. If
      you were dropped into it ... flash into flame like a pinch of
      gunpowder in a candle. Put your hand out and feel the heat of his breath.
      Why, even up here I''ve seen the rain-water boiling off the trucks. And
      that cone there. It''s a damned sight too hot for roasting cakes. The top
      side of it''s three hundred degrees."

"Three hundred centigrade, mind!" said Horrocks. "It will boil the blood
      out of you in no time."

With one hand he clutched at the hand-rail, then with both. For a moment
      the two men stood swaying. Then suddenly, with a violent jerk, Horrocks
      had twisted him from his hold. He clutched at Horrocks and missed, his
      foot went back into empty air; in mid-air he twisted himself, and then
      cheek and shoulder and knee struck the hot cone together.

He clutched the chain by which the cone hung, and the thing sank an
      infinitesimal amount as he struck it. A circle of glowing red appeared
      about him, and a tongue of flame, released from the chaos within,
      flickered up towards him. An intense pain assailed him at the knees, and
      he could smell the singeing of his hands. He raised himself to his feet,
      and tried to climb up the chain, and then something struck his head. Black
      and shining with the moonlight, the throat of the furnace rose about him.

Horrocks, he saw, stood above him by one of the trucks of fuel on the
      rail. The gesticulating figure was bright and white in the moonlight, and
      shouting, "Fizzle, you fool! Fizzle, you hunter of women! You hot-blooded
      hound! Boil! boil! boil!"

Suddenly he caught up a handful of coal out of the truck, and flung it
      deliberately, lump after lump, at Raut.

He clung, crying, to the chain, pulling himself up from the burning of the
      cone. Each missile Horrocks flung hit him. His clothes charred and glowed,
      and as he struggled the cone dropped, and a rush of hot, suffocating gas
      whooped out and burned round him in a swift breath of flame.

His human likeness departed from him. When the momentary red had passed,
      Horrocks saw a charred, blackened figure, its head streaked with blood,
      still clutching and fumbling with the chain, and writhing in agony—a
      cindery animal, an inhuman, monstrous creature that began a sobbing,
      intermittent shriek.

Abruptly at the sight the ironmaster''s anger passed. A deadly sickness
      came upon him. The heavy odour of burning flesh came drifting up to his
      nostrils. His sanity returned to him.

He knew the thing below him, save that it still moved and felt, was
      already a dead man—that the blood of the poor wretch must be boiling
      in his veins. An intense realisation of that agony came to his mind, and
      overcame every other feeling. For a moment he stood irresolute, and then,
      turning to the truck, he hastily tilted its contents upon the struggling
      thing that had once been a man. The mass fell with a thud, and went
      radiating over the cone. With the thud the shriek ended, and a boiling
      confusion of smoke, dust, and flame came rushing up towards him. As it
      passed, he saw the cone clear again.

Then he staggered back, and stood trembling, clinging to the rail with
      both hands. His lips moved, but no words came to them.

Down below was the sound of voices and running steps. The clangour of
      rolling in the shed ceased abruptly.

"This again," said the Bacteriologist, slipping a glass slide under the
      microscope, "is well,—a preparation of the Bacillus of cholera—the
      cholera germ."

The pale-faced man peered down the microscope. He was evidently not
      accustomed to that kind of thing, and held a limp white hand over his
      disengaged eye. "I see very little," he said.

"Touch this screw," said the Bacteriologist; "perhaps the microscope is
      out of focus for you. Eyes vary so much. Just the fraction of a turn this
      way or that."

"Ah! now I see," said the visitor. "Not so very much to see after all.
      Little streaks and shreds of pink. And yet those little particles, those
      mere atomies, might multiply and devastate a city! Wonderful!"

He stood up, and releasing the glass slip from the microscope, held it in
      his hand towards the window. "Scarcely visible," he said, scrutinising the
      preparation. He hesitated. "Are these—alive? Are they dangerous
      now?"

"Those have been stained and killed," said the Bacteriologist. "I wish,
      for my own part, we could kill and stain every one of them in the
      universe."

"I suppose," the pale man said, with a slight smile, ''that you scarcely
      care to have such things about you in the living—in the active
      state?"

"On the contrary, we are obliged to," said the Bacteriologist. "Here, for
      instance—" He walked across the room and took up one of several
      sealed tubes. "Here is the living thing. This is a cultivation of the
      actual living disease bacteria." He hesitated. "Bottled cholera, so to
      speak."

A slight gleam of satisfaction appeared momentarily in the face of the
      pale man. "It''s a deadly thing to have in your possession," he said,
      devouring the little tube with his eyes. The Bacteriologist watched the
      morbid pleasure in his visitor''s expression. This man, who had visited him
      that afternoon with a note of introduction from an old friend, interested
      him from the very contrast of their dispositions. The lank black hair and
      deep grey eyes, the haggard expression and nervous manner, the fitful yet
      keen interest of his visitor were a novel change from the phlegmatic
      deliberations of the ordinary scientific worker with whom the
      Bacteriologist chiefly associated. It was perhaps natural, with a hearer
      evidently so impressionable to the lethal nature of; his topic, to take
      the most effective aspect of the matter.

He held the tube in his hand thoughtfully. "Yes, here is the pestilence
      imprisoned. Only break such a little tube as this into a supply of
      drinking-water, say to these minute particles of life that one must needs
      stain and examine with the highest powers of the microscope even to see,
      and that one can neither smell nor taste—say to them, ''Go forth,
      increase and multiply, and replenish the cisterns,'' and death—mysterious,
      untraceable death, death swift and terrible, death full of pain and
      indignity—would be released upon this city, and go hither and
      thither seeking his victims. Here he would take the husband from the wife,
      here the child from its mother, here the statesman from his duty, and here
      the toiler from his trouble. He would follow the water-mains, creeping
      along streets, picking out and punishing a house here and a house there
      where they did not boil their drinking-water, creeping into the wells of
      the mineral water makers, getting washed into salad, and lying dormant in
      ices. He would wait ready to be drunk in the horse-troughs, and by unwary
      children in the public fountains. He would soak into the soil, to reappear
      in springs and wells at a thousand unexpected places. Once start him at
      the water supply, and before we could ring him in, and catch him again, he
      would have decimated the metropolis."

The pale-faced man nodded. His eyes shone. He cleared his throat. "These
      Anarchist—rascals," said he, "are fools, blind fools—to use
      bombs when this kind of thing is attainable. I think——"

A gentle rap, a mere light touch of the finger-nails, was heard at the
      door. The Bacteriologist opened it. "Just a minute, dear," whispered his
      wife.

When he re-entered the laboratory his visitor was looking at his watch. "I
      had no idea I had wasted an hour of your time," he said. "Twelve minutes
      to four. I ought to have left here by half-past three. But your things
      were really too interesting. No, positively I cannot stop a moment longer.
      I have an engagement at four."

He passed out of the room reiterating his thanks, and the Bacteriologist
      accompanied him to the door, and then returned thoughtfully along the
      passage to his laboratory. He was musing on the ethnology of his visitor.
      Certainly the man was not a Teutonic type nor a common Latin one. "A
      morbid product, anyhow, I am afraid," said the Bacteriologist to himself.
      "How he gloated over those cultivations of disease germs!" A disturbing
      thought struck him. He turned to the bench by the vapour bath, and then
      very quickly to his writing-table. Then he felt hastily in his pockets and
      then rushed to the door. "I may have put it down on the hall table," he
      said.

"Blue ruin!" cried the Bacteriologist, and incontinently ran to the front
      door and down the steps of his house to the street.

Minnie, hearing the door slam violently, ran in alarm to the window. Down
      the street a slender man was getting into a cab. The Bacteriologist,
      hatless, and in his carpet slippers, was running and gesticulating wildly
      towards this group. One slipper came off, but he did not wait for it. "He
      has gone mad!" said Minnie; "it''s that horrid science of his"; and,
      opening the window, would have called after him. The slender man, suddenly
      glancing round, seemed struck with the same idea of mental disorder. He
      pointed hastily to the Bacteriologist, said something to the cabman, the
      apron of the cab slammed, the whip swished, the horse''s feet clattered,
      and in a moment cab and Bacteriologist hotly in pursuit, had receded up
      the vista of the roadway and disappeared round the corner.

Minnie remained straining out of the window for a minute. Then she drew
      her head back into the room again. She was dumbfounded. "Of course he is
      eccentric," she meditated. "But running about London—in the height
      of the season, too—in his socks!" A happy thought struck her. She
      hastily put her bonnet on, seized his shoes, went into the hall, took down
      his hat and light overcoat from the pegs, emerged upon the doorstep, and
      hailed a cab that opportunely crawled by. "Drive me up the road and round
      Havelock Crescent, and see if we can find a gentleman running about in a
      velveteen coat and no hat."

"Velveteen coat, ma''am, and no ''at. Very good, ma''am." And the cabman
      whipped up at once in the most matter-of-fact way, as if he drove to this
      address every day in his life.

Some few minutes later the little group of cabmen and loafers that
      collects round the cabman''s shelter at Haverstock Hill were startled by
      the passing of a cab with a ginger-coloured screw of a horse, driven
      furiously.

They were silent as it went by, and then as it receded—"That''s ''Arry
      ''Icks. Wot''s he got?" said the stout gentleman known as Old
      Tootles.

"Hullo!" said poor old Tommy Byles; "here''s another bloomin'' loonatic.
      Blowed if there ain''t."

"It''s old George," said Old Tootles, "and he''s drivin'' a loonatic, as
      you say. Ain''t he a-clawin'' out of the keb? Wonder if he''s after ''Arry
      ''Icks?"

The group round the cabman''s shelter became animated. Chorus: "Go it,
      George!" "It''s a race." "You''ll ketch ''em!" "Whip up!"

"Strike me giddy!" cried Old Tootles. "Here! I''m a-goin'' to begin
      in a minute. Here''s another comin''. If all the cabs in Hampstead ain''t
      gone mad this morning!"

Minnie went by in a perfect roar of applause. She did not like it, but she
      felt that she was doing her duty, and whirled on down Haverstock Hill and
      Camden Town High Street with her eyes ever intent on the animated back
      view of old George, who was driving her vagrant husband so
      incomprehensibly away from her.

The man in the foremost cab sat crouched in the corner, his arms tightly
      folded, and the little tube that contained such vast possibilities of
      destruction gripped in his hand. His mood was a singular mixture of fear
      and exultation. Chiefly he was afraid of being caught before he could
      accomplish his purpose, but behind this was a vaguer but larger fear of
      the awfulness of his crime. But his exultation far exceeded his fear. No
      Anarchist before him had ever approached this conception of his. Ravachol,
      Vaillant, all those distinguished persons whose fame he had envied
      dwindled into insignificance beside him. He had only to make sure of the
      water supply, and break the little tube into a reservoir. How brilliantly
      he had planned it, forged the letter of introduction and got into the
      laboratory, and how brilliantly he had seized his opportunity! The world
      should hear of him at last. All those people who had sneered at him,
      neglected him, preferred other people to him, found his company
      undesirable, should consider him at last. Death, death, death! They had
      always treated him as a man of no importance. All the world had been in a
      conspiracy to keep him under. He would teach them yet what it is to
      isolate a man. What was this familiar street? Great Saint Andrew''s Street,
      of course! How fared the chase? He craned out of the cab. The
      Bacteriologist was scarcely fifty yards behind. That was bad. He would be
      caught and stopped yet. He felt in his pocket for money, and found half a
      sovereign. This he thrust up through the trap in the top of the cab into
      the man''s face. "More," he shouted, "if only we get away."

The money was snatched out of his hand. "Right you are," said the cabman,
      and the trap slammed, and the lash lay along the glistening side of the
      horse. The cab swayed, and the Anarchist, half-standing under the trap,
      put the hand containing the little glass tube upon the apron to preserve
      his balance. He felt the brittle thing crack, and the broken half of it
      rang upon the floor of the cab. He fell back into the seat with a curse,
      and stared dismally at the two or three drops of moisture on the apron.

"Well, I suppose I shall be the first. Phew! Anyhow, I shall be a
      Martyr. That''s something. But it is a filthy death, nevertheless. I wonder
      if it hurts as much as they say."

Presently a thought occurred to him—he groped between his feet. A
      little drop was still in the broken end of the tube, and he drank that to
      make sure. It was better to make sure. At any rate, he would not fail.

Then it dawned upon him that there was no further need to escape the
      Bacteriologist. In Wellington Street he told the cabman to stop, and got
      out. He slipped on the step, and his head felt queer. It was rapid stuff,
      this cholera poison. He waved his cabman out of existence, so to speak,
      and stood on the pavement with his arms folded upon his breast awaiting
      the arrival of the Bacteriologist. There was something tragic in his pose.
      The sense of imminent death gave him a certain dignity. He greeted his
      pursuer with a defiant laugh.

The Bacteriologist from his cab beamed curiously at him through his
      spectacles. "You have drunk it! An Anarchist! I see now." He was about to
      say something more, and then checked himself. A smile hung in the corner
      of his mouth. He opened the apron of his cab as if to descend, at which
      the Anarchist waved him a dramatic farewell and strode off towards
      Waterloo Bridge, carefully jostling his infected body against as many
      people as possible. The Bacteriologist was so preoccupied with the vision
      of him that he scarcely manifested the slightest surprise at the
      appearance of Minnie upon the pavement with his hat and shoes and
      overcoat. "Very good of you to bring my things," he said, and remained
      lost in contemplation of the receding figure of the Anarchist.

"You had better get in," he said, still staring. Minnie felt absolutely
      convinced now that he was mad, and directed the cabman home on her own
      responsibility. "Put on my shoes? Certainly, dear," said he, as the cab
      began to turn, and hid the strutting black figure, now small in the
      distance, from his eyes. Then suddenly something grotesque struck him, and
      he laughed. Then he remarked, "It is really very serious, though.

"You see, that man came to my house to see me, and he is an Anarchist. No—don''t
      faint, or I cannot possibly tell you the rest. And I wanted to astonish
      him, not knowing he was an Anarchist, and took up a cultivation of that
      new species of Bacterium I was telling you of that infest, and I think
      cause, the blue patches upon various monkeys; and, like a fool, I said it
      was Asiatic cholera. And he ran away with it to poison the water of
      London, and he certainly might have made things look blue for this
      civilised city. And now he has swallowed it. Of course, I cannot say what
      will happen, but you know it turned that kitten blue, and the three
      puppies—in patches, and the sparrow—bright blue. But the
      bother is, I shall have all the trouble and expense of preparing some
      more.

"Put on my coat on this hot day! Why? Because we might meet Mrs. Jabber.
      My dear, Mrs. Jabber is not a draught. But why should I wear a coat on a
      hot day because of Mrs.——-. Oh! very well."

The buying of orchids always has in it a certain speculative flavour. You
      have before you the brown shrivelled lump of tissue, and for the rest you
      must trust your judgment, or the auctioneer, or your good luck, as your
      taste may incline. The plant may be moribund or dead, or it may be just a
      respectable purchase, fair value for your money, or perhaps—for the
      thing has happened again and again—there slowly unfolds before the
      delighted eyes of the happy purchaser, day after day, some new variety,
      some novel richness, a strange twist of the labellum, or some subtler
      colouration or unexpected mimicry. Pride, beauty, and profit blossom
      together on one delicate green spike, and, it may be, even immortality.
      For the new miracle of nature may stand in need of a new specific name,
      and what so convenient as that of its discoverer? "John-smithia"! There
      have been worse names.

It was perhaps the hope of some such happy discovery that made Winter
      Wedderburn such a frequent attendant at these sales—that hope, and
      also, maybe, the fact that he had nothing else of the slightest interest
      to do in the world. He was a shy, lonely, rather ineffectual man, provided
      with just enough income to keep off the spur of necessity, and not enough
      nervous energy to make him seek any exacting employments. He might have
      collected stamps or coins, or translated Horace, or bound books, or
      invented new species of diatoms. But, as it happened, he grew orchids, and
      had one ambitious little hothouse.

"I have a fancy," he said over his coffee, "that something is going to
      happen to me to-day." He spoke—as he moved and thought—slowly.

"Oh, don''t say that!" said his housekeeper—who was also his
      remote cousin. For "something happening" was a euphemism that meant only
      one thing to her.

"To-day," he continued, after a pause, "Peters'' are going to sell a batch
      of plants from the Andamans and the Indies. I shall go up and see what
      they have. It may be I shall buy something good unawares. That may be it."

"Are these the things collected by that poor young fellow you told me of
      the other day?" asked his cousin, as she filled his cup.

"Nothing ever does happen to me," he remarked presently, beginning to
      think aloud. "I wonder why? Things enough happen to other people. There is
      Harvey. Only the other week; on Monday he picked up sixpence, on Wednesday
      his chicks all had the staggers, on Friday his cousin came home from
      Australia, and on Saturday he broke his ankle. What a whirl of excitement!—compared
      to me."

"I think I would rather be without so much excitement," said his
      housekeeper. "It can''t be good for you."

"I suppose it''s troublesome. Still ... you see, nothing ever happens to
      me. When I was a little boy I never had accidents. I never fell in love as
      I grew up. Never married... I wonder how it feels to have something happen
      to you, something really remarkable.

"That orchid-collector was only thirty-six—twenty years younger than
      myself—when he died. And he had been married twice and divorced
      once; he had had malarial fever four times, and once he broke his thigh.
      He killed a Malay once, and once he was wounded by a poisoned dart. And in
      the end he was killed by jungle-leeches. It must have all been very
      troublesome, but then it must have been very interesting, you know—except,
      perhaps, the leeches."

"Perhaps not." And then Wedderburn looked at his watch. "Twenty-three
      minutes past eight. I am going up by the quarter to twelve train, so that
      there is plenty of time. I think I shall wear my alpaca jacket—it is
      quite warm enough—and my grey felt hat and brown shoes. I suppose—"

He glanced out of the window at the serene sky and sunlit garden, and then
      nervously at his cousin''s face.

"I think you had better take an umbrella if you are going to London," she
      said in a voice that admitted of no denial. "There''s all between here and
      the station coming back."

When he returned he was in a state of mild excitement. He had made a
      purchase. It was rare that he could make up his mind quickly enough to
      buy, but this time he had done so.

"There are Vandas," he said, "and a Dendrobe and some Palaeonophis." He
      surveyed his purchases lovingly as he consumed his soup. They were laid
      out on the spotless tablecloth before him, and he was telling his cousin
      all about them as he slowly meandered through his dinner. It was his
      custom to live all his visits to London over again in the evening for her
      and his own entertainment.

"I knew something would happen to-day. And I have bought all these. Some
      of them—some of them—I feel sure, do you know, that some of
      them will be remarkable. I don''t know how it is, but I feel just as sure
      as if some one had told me that some of these will turn out remarkable.

"That one "—he pointed to a shrivelled rhizome—"was not
      identified. It may be a Palaeonophis—or it may not. It may be a new
      species, or even a new genus. And it was the last that poor Batten ever
      collected."

Wedderburn smiled and surveyed the root with his head on one side. "It is
      certainly not a pretty lump of stuff. But you can never judge of these
      things from their dry appearance. It may turn out to be a very beautiful
      orchid indeed. How busy I shall be to-morrow! I must see to-night just
      exactly what to do with these things, and to-morrow I shall set to work."

"They found poor Batten lying dead, or dying, in a mangrove swamp—I
      forget which," he began again presently, "with one of these very orchids
      crushed up under his body. He had been unwell for some days with some kind
      of native fever, and I suppose he fainted. These mangrove swamps are very
      unwholesome. Every drop of blood, they say, was taken out of him by the
      jungle-leeches. It may be that very plant that cost him his life to
      obtain."

"Fancy dying away from every comfort in a nasty swamp! Fancy being ill of
      fever with nothing to take but chlorodyne and quinine—if men were
      left to themselves they would live on chlorodyne and quinine—and no
      one round you but horrible natives! They say the Andaman islanders are
      most disgusting wretches—and, anyhow, they can scarcely make good
      nurses, not having the necessary training. And just for people in England
      to have orchids!"

"I don''t suppose it was comfortable, but some men seem to enjoy that kind
      of thing," said Wedderburn. "Anyhow, the natives of his party were
      sufficiently civilised to take care of all his collection until his
      colleague, who was an ornithologist, came back again from the interior;
      though they could not tell the species of the orchid, and had let it
      wither. And it makes these things more interesting."

"It makes them disgusting. I should be afraid of some of the malaria
      clinging to them. And just think, there has been a dead body lying across
      that ugly thing! I never thought of that before. There! I declare I cannot
      eat another mouthful of dinner."

"I will take them off the table if you like, and put them in the
      window-seat. I can see them just as well there."

The next few days he was indeed singularly busy in his steamy little
      hothouse, fussing about with charcoal, lumps of teak, moss, and all the
      other mysteries of the orchid cultivator. He considered he was having a
      wonderfully eventful time. In the evening he would talk about these new
      orchids to his friends, and over and over again he reverted to his
      expectation of something strange.

Several of the Vandas and the Dendrobium died under his care, but
      presently the strange orchid began to show signs of life. He was
      delighted, and took his housekeeper right away from jam-making to see it
      at once, directly he made the discovery.

"That is a bud," he said, "and presently there will be a lot of leaves
      there, and those little things coming out here are aerial rootlets."

"They look to me like little white fingers poking out of the brown," said
      his housekeeper. "I don''t like them."

"I don''t know. They look like fingers trying to get at you. I can''t help
      my likes and dislikes."

"I don''t know for certain, but I don''t think there are any orchids
      I know that have aerial rootlets quite like that. It may be my fancy, of
      course. You see they are a little flattened at the ends."

"I don''t like ''em," said his housekeeper, suddenly shivering and turning
      away. "I know it''s very silly of me—and I''m very sorry, particularly
      as you like the thing so much. But I can''t help thinking of that corpse."

Wedderburn felt a little hurt at her dislike to the plant. But that did
      not prevent his talking to her about orchids generally, and this orchid in
      particular, whenever he felt inclined.

"There are such queer things about orchids," he said one day; "such
      possibilities of surprises. You know, Darwin studied their fertilisation,
      and showed that the whole structure of an ordinary orchid flower was
      contrived in order that moths might carry the pollen from plant to plant.
      Well, it seems that there are lots of orchids known the flower of which
      cannot possibly be used for fertilisation in that way. Some of the
      Cypripediums, for instance; there are no insects known that can possibly
      fertilise them, and some of them have never been found with seed."

"By runners and tubers, and that kind of outgrowth. That is easily
      explained. The puzzle is, what are the flowers for?

"Very likely," he added, "my orchid may be something extraordinary
      in that way. If so I shall study it. I have often thought of making
      researches as Darwin did. But hitherto I have not found the time, or
      something else has happened to prevent it. The leaves are beginning to
      unfold now. I do wish you would come and see them!"

But she said that the orchid-house was so hot it gave her the headache.
      She had seen the plant once again, and the aerial rootlets, which were now
      some of them more than a foot long, had unfortunately reminded her of
      tentacles reaching out after something; and they got into her dreams,
      growing after her with incredible rapidity. So that she had settled to her
      entire satisfaction that she would not see that plant again, and
      Wedderburn had to admire its leaves alone. They were of the ordinary broad
      form, and a deep glossy green, with splashes and dots of deep red towards
      the base He knew of no other leaves quite like them. The plant was placed
      on a low bench near the thermometer, and close by was a simple arrangement
      by which a tap dripped on the hot-water pipes and kept the air steamy. And
      he spent his afternoons now with some regularity meditating on the
      approaching flowering of this strange plant.

And at last the great thing happened. Directly he entered the little glass
      house he knew that the spike had burst out, although his great Paloeonophis
      Lowii hid the corner where his new darling stood. There was a new
      odour in the air, a rich, intensely sweet scent, that overpowered every
      other in that crowded, steaming little greenhouse.

Directly he noticed this he hurried down to the strange orchid. And,
      behold! the trailing green spikes bore now three great splashes of
      blossom, from which this overpowering sweetness proceeded. He stopped
      before them in an ecstasy of admiration.

The flowers were white, with streaks of golden orange upon the petals; the
      heavy labellum was coiled into an intricate projection, and a wonderful
      bluish purple mingled there with the gold. He could see at once that the
      genus was altogether a new one. And the insufferable scent! How hot the
      place was! The blossoms swam before his eyes.

He would see if the temperature was right. He made a step towards the
      thermometer. Suddenly everything appeared unsteady. The bricks on the
      floor were dancing up and down. Then the white blossoms, the green leaves
      behind them, the whole greenhouse, seemed to sweep sideways, and then in a
      curve upward.

At half-past four his cousin made the tea, according to their invariable
      custom. But Wedderburn did not come in for his tea.

"He is worshipping that horrid orchid," she told herself, and waited ten
      minutes. "His watch must have stopped. I will go and call him."

She went straight to the hothouse, and, opening the door, called his name.
      There was no reply. She noticed that the air was very close, and loaded
      with an intense perfume. Then she saw something lying on the bricks
      between the hot-water pipes.

He was lying, face upward, at the foot of the strange orchid. The
      tentacle-like aerial rootlets no longer swayed freely in the air, but were
      crowded together, a tangle of grey ropes, and stretched tight, with their
      ends closely applied to his chin and neck and hands.

She did not understand. Then she saw from under one of the exultant
      tentacles upon his cheek there trickled a little thread of blood.

With an inarticulate cry she ran towards him, and tried to pull him away
      from the leech-like suckers. She snapped two of these tentacles, and their
      sap dripped red.

Then the overpowering scent of the blossom began to make her head reel.
      How they clung to him! She tore at the tough ropes, and he and the white
      inflorescence swam about her. She felt she was fainting, knew she must
      not. She left him and hastily opened the nearest door, and, after she had
      panted for a moment in the fresh air, she had a brilliant inspiration. She
      caught up a flower-pot and smashed in the windows at the end of the
      greenhouse. Then she re-entered. She tugged now with renewed strength at
      Wedderburn''s motionless body, and brought the strange orchid crashing to
      the floor. It still clung with the grimmest tenacity to its victim. In a
      frenzy, she lugged it and him into the open air.

Then she thought of tearing through the sucker rootlets one by one, and in
      another minute she had released him and was dragging him away from the
      horror.

The odd-job man was coming up the garden, amazed at the smashing of glass,
      and saw her emerge, hauling the inanimate body with red-stained hands. For
      a moment he thought impossible things.

"Bring some water!" she cried, and her voice dispelled his fancies. When,
      with unnatural alacrity, he returned with the water, he found her weeping
      with excitement, and with Wedderburn''s head upon her knee, wiping the
      blood from his face.

"What''s the matter?" said Wedderburn, opening his eyes feebly, and closing
      them again at once.

"Go and tell Annie to come out here to me, and then go for Dr. Haddon at
      once," she said to the odd-job man so soon as he brought the water; and
      added, seeing he hesitated, "I will tell you all about it when you come
      back."

Presently Wedderburn opened his eyes again, and, seeing that he was
      troubled by the puzzle of his position, she explained to him, "You fainted
      in the hothouse."

Wedderburn had lost a good deal of blood, but beyond that he had suffered
      no very great injury. They gave him brandy mixed with some pink extract of
      meat, and carried him upstairs to bed. His housekeeper told her incredible
      story in fragments to Dr. Haddon. "Come to the orchid-house and see," she
      said.

The cold outer air was blowing in through the open door, and the sickly
      perfume was almost dispelled. Most of the torn aerial rootlets lay already
      withered amidst a number of dark stains upon the bricks. The stem of the
      inflorescence was broken by the fall of the plant, and the flowers were
      growing limp and brown at the edges of the petals. The doctor stooped
      towards it, t' WHERE id = 'ee364418-59f6-4a5c-b61e-e19060e1944f';
