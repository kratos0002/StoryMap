      the direction from which the initiating ray entered the crystal and the
      orientation of the picture were proved. And, by covering the crystal in a
      box perforated only with a small aperture to admit the exciting ray, and
      by substituting black holland for his buff blinds, he greatly improved the
      conditions of the observations; so that in a little while they were able
      to survey the valley in any direction they desired.

So having cleared the way, we may give a brief account of this visionary
      world within the crystal. The things were in all cases seen by Mr. Cave,
      and the method of working was invariably for him to watch the crystal and
      report what he saw, while Mr. Wace (who as a science student had learnt
      the trick of writing in the dark) wrote a brief note of his report. When
      the crystal faded, it was put into its box in the proper position and the
      electric light turned on. Mr. Wace asked questions, and suggested
      observations to clear up difficult points. Nothing, indeed, could have
      been less visionary and more matter-of-fact.

The attention of Mr. Cave had been speedily directed to the bird-like
      creatures he had seen so abundantly present in each of his earlier
      visions. His first impression was soon corrected, and he considered for a
      time that they might represent a diurnal species of bat. Then he thought,
      grotesquely enough, that they might be cherubs. Their heads were round and
      curiously human, and it was the eyes of one of them that had so startled
      him on his second observation. They had broad, silvery wings, not
      feathered, but glistening almost as brilliantly as new-killed fish and
      with the same subtle play of colour, and these wings were not built on the
      plan of bird-wing or bat, Mr. Wace learned, but supported by curved ribs
      radiating from the body. (A sort of butterfly wing with curved ribs seems
      best to express their appearance.) The body was small, but fitted with two
      bunches of prehensile organs, like long tentacles, immediately under the
      mouth. Incredible as it appeared to Mr. Wace, the persuasion at last
      became irresistible that it was these creatures which owned the great
      quasi-human buildings and the magnificent garden that made the broad
      valley so splendid. And Mr. Cave perceived that the buildings, with other
      peculiarities, had no doors, but that the great circular windows, which
      opened freely, gave the creatures egress and entrance. They would alight
      upon their tentacles, fold their wings to a smallness almost rod-like, and
      hop into the interior. But among them was a multitude of smaller-winged
      creatures, like great dragon-flies and moths and flying beetles, and
      across the greensward brilliantly-coloured gigantic ground-beetles crawled
      lazily to and fro. Moreover, on the causeways and terraces, large-headed
      creatures similar to the greater winged flies, but wingless, were visible,
      hopping busily upon their hand-like tangle of tentacles.

Allusion has already been made to the glittering objects upon masts that
      stood upon the terrace of the nearer building. It dawned upon Mr. Cave,
      after regarding one of these masts very fixedly on one particularly vivid
      day that the glittering object there was a crystal exactly like that into
      which he peered. And a still more careful scrutiny convinced him that each
      one in a vista of nearly twenty carried a similar object.

Occasionally one of the large flying creatures would flutter up to one,
      and folding its wings and coiling a number of its tentacles about the
      mast, would regard the crystal fixedly for a space,—sometimes for as
      long as fifteen minutes. And a series of observations, made at the
      suggestion of Mr. Wace, convinced both watchers that, so far as this
      visionary world was concerned, the crystal into which they peered actually
      stood at the summit of the end-most mast on the terrace, and that on one
      occasion at least one of these inhabitants of this other world had looked
      into Mr. Cave''s face while he was making these observations.

So much for the essential facts of this very singular story. Unless we
      dismiss it all as the ingenious fabrication of Mr. Wace, we have to
      believe one of two things: either that Mr. Cave''s crystal was in two
      worlds at once, and that while it was carried about in one, it remained
      stationary in the other, which seems altogether absurd; or else that it
      had some peculiar relation of sympathy with another and exactly similar
      crystal in this other world, so that what was seen in the interior of the
      one in this world was, under suitable conditions, visible to an observer
      in the corresponding crystal in the other world; and vice versa. At
      present, indeed, we do not know of any way in which two crystals could so
      come en rapport, but nowadays we know enough to understand that the
      thing is not altogether impossible. This view of the crystals as en
      rapport was the supposition that occurred to Mr. Wace, and to me at
      least it seems extremely plausible...

And where was this other world? On this, also, the alert intelligence of
      Mr. Wace speedily threw light. After sunset, the sky darkened rapidly—
      there was a very brief twilight interval indeed—and the stars shone
      out. They were recognisably the same as those we see, arranged in the same
      constellations. Mr. Cave recognised the Bear, the Pleiades, Aldebaran, and
      Sirius; so that the other world must be somewhere in the solar system,
      and, at the utmost, only a few hundreds of millions of miles from our own.
      Following up this clue, Mr. Wace learned that the midnight sky was a
      darker blue even than our midwinter sky, and that the sun seemed a little
      smaller. And there were two small moons! "like our moon but
      smaller, and quite differently marked," one of which moved so rapidly that
      its motion was clearly visible as one regarded it. These moons were never
      high in the sky, but vanished as they rose: that is, every time they
      revolved they were eclipsed because they were so near their primary
      planet. And all this answers quite completely, although Mr. Cave did not
      know it, to what must be the condition of things on Mars.

Indeed, it seems an exceedingly plausible conclusion that peering into
      this crystal Mr. Cave did actually see the planet Mars and its
      inhabitants. And if that be the case, then the evening star that shone so
      brilliantly in the sky of that distant vision was neither more nor less
      than our own familiar earth.

For a time the Martians—if they were Martians—do not seem to
      have known of Mr. Cave''s inspection. Once or twice one would come to peer,
      and go away very shortly to some other mast, as though the vision was
      unsatisfactory. During this time Mr. Cave was able to watch the
      proceedings of these winged people without being disturbed by their
      attentions, and although his report is necessarily vague and fragmentary,
      it is nevertheless very suggestive. Imagine the impression of humanity a
      Martian observer would get who, after a difficult process of preparation
      and with considerable fatigue to the eyes, was able to peer at London from
      the steeple of St. Martin''s Church for stretches, at longest, of four
      minutes at a time. Mr. Cave was unable to ascertain if the winged Martians
      were the same as the Martians who hopped about the causeways and terraces,
      and if the latter could put on wings at will. He several times saw certain
      clumsy bipeds, dimly suggestive of apes, white and partially translucent,
      feeding among certain of the lichenous trees, and once some of these fled
      before one of the hopping, round-headed Martians. The latter caught one in
      its tentacles, and then the picture faded suddenly and left Mr. Cave most
      tantalisingly in the dark. On another occasion a vast thing, that Mr. Cave
      thought at first was some gigantic insect, appeared advancing along the
      causeway beside the canal with extraordinary rapidity. As this drew nearer
      Mr. Cave perceived that it was a mechanism of shining metals and of
      extraordinary complexity. And then, when he looked again, it had passed
      out of sight.

After a time Mr. Wace aspired to attract the attention of the Martians,
      and the next time that the strange eyes of one of them appeared close to
      the crystal Mr. Cave cried out and sprang away, and they immediately
      turned on the light and began to gesticulate in a manner suggestive of
      signalling. But when at last Mr. Cave examined the crystal again the
      Martian had departed.

Thus far these observations had progressed in early November, and then Mr.
      Cave, feeling that the suspicions of his family about the crystal were
      allayed, began to take it to and fro with him in order that, as occasion
      arose in the daytime or night, he might comfort himself with what was fast
      becoming the most real thing in his existence.

In December Mr. Wace''s work in connection with a forthcoming examination
      became heavy, the sittings were reluctantly suspended for a week, and for
      ten or eleven days—he is not quite sure which—he saw nothing
      of Cave. He then grew anxious to resume these investigations, and, the
      stress of his seasonal labours being abated, he went down to Seven Dials.
      At the corner he noticed a shutter before a bird fancier''s window, and
      then another at a cobbler''s. Mr. Cave''s shop was closed.

He rapped and the door was opened by the step-son in black. He at once
      called Mrs. Cave, who was, Mr. Wace could not but observe, in cheap but
      ample widow''s weeds of the most imposing pattern. Without any very great
      surprise Mr. Wace learnt that Cave was dead and already buried. She was in
      tears, and her voice was a little thick. She had just returned from
      Highgate. Her mind seemed occupied with her own prospects and the
      honourable details of the obsequies, but Mr. Wace was at last able to
      learn the particulars of Cave''s death. He had been found dead in his shop
      in the early morning, the day after his last visit to Mr. Wace, and the
      crystal had been clasped in his stone-cold hands. His face was smiling,
      said Mrs. Cave, and the velvet cloth from the minerals lay on the floor at
      his feet. He must have been dead five or six hours when he was found.

This came as a great shock to Wace, and he began to reproach himself
      bitterly for having neglected the plain symptoms of the old man''s
      ill-health. But his chief thought was of the crystal. He approached that
      topic in a gingerly manner, because he knew Mrs. Cave''s peculiarities. He
      was dumfounded to learn that it was sold.

Mrs. Cave''s first impulse, directly Cave''s body had been taken upstairs,
      had been to write to the mad clergyman who had offered five pounds for the
      crystal, informing him of its recovery; but after a violent hunt, in which
      her daughter joined her, they were convinced of the loss of his address.
      As they were without the means required to mourn and bury Cave in the
      elaborate style the dignity of an old Seven Dials inhabitant demands, they
      had appealed to a friendly fellow-tradesman in Great Portland Street. He
      had very kindly taken over a portion of the stock at a valuation. The
      valuation was his own, and the crystal egg was included in one of the
      lots. Mr. Wace, after a few suitable condolences, a little off-handedly
      proffered perhaps, hurried at once to Great Portland Street. But there he
      learned that the crystal egg had already been sold to a tall, dark man in
      grey. And there the material facts in this curious, and to me at least
      very suggestive, story come abruptly to an end. The Great Portland Street
      dealer did not know who the tall dark man in grey was, nor had he observed
      him with sufficient attention to describe him minutely. He did not even
      know which way this person had gone after leaving the shop. For a time Mr.
      Wace remained in the shop, trying the dealer''s patience with hopeless
      questions, venting his own exasperation. And at last, realising abruptly
      that the whole thing had passed out of his hands, had vanished like a
      vision of the night, he returned to his own rooms, a little astonished to
      find the notes he had made still tangible and visible upon, his untidy
      table.

His annoyance and disappointment were naturally very great. He made a
      second call (equally ineffectual) upon the Great Portland Street dealer,
      and he resorted to advertisements in such periodicals as were lively to
      come into the hands of a bric-a-brac collector. He also wrote
      letters to The Daily Chronicle and Nature, but both those
      periodicals, suspecting a hoax, asked him to reconsider his action before
      they printed, and he was advised that such a strange story, unfortunately
      so bare of supporting evidence, might imperil his reputation as an
      investigator. Moreover, the calls of his proper work were urgent. So that
      after a month or so, save for an occasional reminder to certain dealers,
      he had reluctantly to abandon the quest for the crystal egg, and from that
      day to this it remains undiscovered. Occasionally, however, he tells me,
      and I can quite believe him, he has bursts of zeal, in which he abandons
      his more urgent occupation and resumes the search.

Whether or not it will remain lost for ever, with the material and origin
      of it, are things equally speculative at the present time. If the present
      purchaser is a collector, one would have expected the enquiries of Mr.
      Wace to have reached him through the dealers. He has been able to discover
      Mr. Cave''s clergyman and "Oriental"—no other than the Rev. James
      Parker and the young Prince of Bosso-Kuni in Java. I am obliged to them
      for certain particulars. The object of the Prince was simply curiosity—and
      extravagance. He was so eager to buy because Cave was so oddly reluctant
      to sell. It is just as possible that the buyer in the second instance was
      simply a casual purchaser and not a collector at all, and the crystal egg,
      for all I know, may at the present moment be within a mile of me,
      decorating a drawing-room or serving as a paper-weight—its
      remarkable functions all unknown. Indeed, it is partly with the idea of
      such a possibility that I have thrown this narrative into a form that will
      give it a chance of being read by the ordinary consumer of fiction.

My own ideas in the matter are practically identical with those of Mr.
      Wace. I believe the crystal on the mast in Mars and the crystal egg of Mr.
      Cave''s to be in some physical, but at present quite inexplicable, way en
      rapport, and we both believe further that the terrestrial crystal must
      have been—possibly at some remote date—sent hither from that
      planet, in order to give the Martians a near view of our affairs. Possibly
      the fellows to the crystals on the other masts are also on our globe. No
      theory of hallucination suffices for the facts.

It was on the first day of the new year that the announcement was made,
      almost simultaneously from three observatories, that the motion of the
      planet Neptune, the outermost of all the planets that wheel about the sun,
      had become very erratic. Ogilvy had already called attention to a
      suspected retardation in its velocity in December. Such a piece of news
      was scarcely calculated to interest a world the greater portion of whose
      inhabitants were unaware of the existence of the planet Neptune, nor
      outside the astronomical profession did the subsequent discovery of a
      faint remote speck of light in the region of the perturbed planet cause
      any very great excitement. Scientific people, however, found the
      intelligence remarkable enough, even before it became known that the new
      body was rapidly growing larger and brighter, that its motion was quite
      different from the orderly progress of the planets, and that the
      deflection of Neptune and its satellite was becoming now of an
      unprecedented kind.

Few people without a training in science can realise the huge isolation of
      the solar system. The sun with its specks of planets, its dust of
      planetoids, and its impalpable comets, swims in a vacant immensity that
      almost defeats the imagination. Beyond the orbit of Neptune there is
      space, vacant so far as human observation has penetrated, without warmth
      or light or sound, blank emptiness, for twenty million times a million
      miles. That is the smallest estimate of the distance to be traversed
      before the very nearest of the stars is attained. And, saving a few comets
      more unsubstantial than the thinnest flame, no matter had ever to human
      knowledge crossed this gulf of space until early in the twentieth century
      this strange wanderer appeared. A vast mass of matter it was, bulky,
      heavy, rushing without warning out of the black mystery of the sky into
      the radiance of the sun. By the second day it was clearly visible to any
      decent instrument, as a speck with a barely sensible diameter, in the
      constellation Leo near Regulus. In a little while an opera glass could
      attain it.

On the third day of the new year the newspaper readers of two hemispheres
      were made aware for the first time of the real importance of this unusual
      apparition in the heavens. "A Planetary Collision," one London paper
      headed the news, and proclaimed Duchaine''s opinion that this strange new
      planet would probably collide with Neptune. The leader-writers enlarged
      upon the topic. So that in most of the capitals of the world, on January
      3rd, there was an expectation, however vague, of some imminent phenomenon
      in the sky; and as the night followed the sunset round the globe,
      thousands of men turned their eyes skyward to see—the old familiar
      stars just as they had always been.

Until it was dawn in London and Pollux setting and the stars overhead
      grown pale. The Winter''s dawn it was, a sickly filtering accumulation of
      daylight, and the light of gas and candles shone yellow in the windows to
      show where people were astir. But the yawning policeman saw the thing, the
      busy crowds in the markets stopped agape, workmen going to their work
      betimes, milkmen, the drivers of news-carts, dissipation going home jaded
      and pale, homeless wanderers, sentinels on their beats, and, in the
      country, labourers trudging afield, poachers slinking home, all over the
      dusky quickening country it could be seen—and out at sea by seamen
      watching for the day—a great white star, come suddenly into the
      westward sky!

Brighter it was than any star in our skies; brighter than the evening star
      at its brightest. It still glowed out white and large, no mere twinkling
      spot of light, but a small, round, clear shining disc, an hour after the
      day had come. And where science has not reached, men stared and feared,
      telling one another of the wars and pestilences that are foreshadowed by
      these fiery signs in the Heavens. Sturdy Boers, dusky Hottentots, Gold
      Coast negroes, Frenchmen, Spaniards, Portuguese, stood in the warmth of
      the sunrise watching the setting of this strange new star.

And in a hundred observatories there had been suppressed excitement,
      rising almost to shouting pitch, as the two remote bodies had rushed
      together, and a hurrying to and fro, to gather photographic apparatus and
      spectroscope, and this appliance and that, to record this novel,
      astonishing sight, the destruction of a world. For it was a world, a
      sister planet of our earth, far greater than our earth indeed, that had so
      suddenly flashed into flaming death. Neptune it was had been struck,
      fairly and squarely, by the strange planet from outer space, and the heat
      of the concussion had incontinently turned two solid globes into one vast
      mass of incandescence. Round the world that day, two hours before the
      dawn, went the pallid great white star, fading only as it sank westward
      and the sun mounted above it. Everywhere men marvelled at it, but of all
      those who saw it none could have marvelled more than those sailors,
      habitual watchers of the stars, who far away at sea had heard nothing of
      its advent and saw it now rise like a pigmy moon and climb zenithward and
      hang overhead and sink westward with the passing of the night.

And when next it rose over Europe everywhere were crowds of watchers on
      hilly slopes, on house-roofs, in open spaces, staring eastward for the
      rising of the great new star. It rose with a white glow in front of it,
      like the glare of a white fire, and those who had seen it come into
      existence the night before cried out at the sight of it. "It is larger,"
      they cried. "It is brighter!" And indeed the moon, a quarter full and
      sinking in the west, was in its apparent size beyond comparison, but
      scarcely in all its breadth had it as much brightness now as the little
      circle of the strange new star.

"It is brighter!" cried the people clustering in the streets. But in the
      dim observatories the watchers held their breath and peered at one
      another. "It is nearer!" they said. "Nearer!"

And voice after voice repeated, "It is nearer," and the clicking telegraph
      took that up, and it trembled along telephone wires, and in a thousand
      cities grimy compositors fingered the type. "It is nearer." Men writing in
      offices, struck with a strange realisation, flung down their pens, men
      talking in a thousand places suddenly came upon a grotesque possibility in
      those words, "It is nearer." It hurried along awakening streets, it was
      shouted down the frost-stilled ways of quiet villages, men who had read
      these things from the throbbing tape stood in yellow-lit doorways shouting
      the news to the passers-by. "It is nearer," Pretty women, flushed and
      glittering, heard the news told jestingly between the dances, and feigned
      an intelligent interest they did not feel. "Nearer! Indeed. How curious!
      How very, very clever people must be to find out things like that!"

Lonely tramps faring through the wintry night murmured those words to
      comfort themselves—looking skyward. "It has need to be nearer, for
      the night''s as cold as charity. Don''t seem much warmth from it if it is
      nearer, all the same."

The schoolboy, rising early for his examination work, puzzled it out for
      himself—with the great white star shining broad and bright through
      the frost-flowers of his window. "Centrifugal, centripetal," he said, with
      his chin on his fist. "Stop a planet in its flight, rob it of its
      centrifugal force, what then? Centripetal has it, and down it falls into
      the sun! And this—!

The light of that day went the way of its brethren, and with the later
      watches of the frosty darkness rose the strange star again. And it was now
      so bright that the waxing moon seemed but a pale yellow ghost of itself,
      hanging huge in the sunset. In a South African city a great man had
      married, and the streets were alight to welcome his return with his bride.
      "Even the skies have illuminated," said the flatterer. Under Capricorn,
      two negro lovers, daring the wild beasts and evil spirits for love of one
      another, crouched together in a cane brake where the fire-flies hovered.
      "That is our star," they whispered, and felt strangely comforted by the
      sweet brilliance of its light.

The master mathematician sat in his private room and pushed the papers
      from him. His calculations were already finished. In a small white phial
      there still remained a little of the drug that had kept him awake and
      active for four long nights. Each day, serene, explicit, patient as ever,
      he had given his lecture to his students, and then had come back at once
      to this momentous calculation. His face was grave, a little drawn and
      hectic from his drugged activity. For some time he seemed lost in thought.
      Then he went to the window, and the blind went up with a click. Half-way
      up the sky, over the clustering roofs, chimneys, and steeples of the city,
      hung the star.

He looked at it as one might look into the eyes of a brave enemy. "You may
      kill me," he said after a silence. "But I can hold you—and all the
      universe for that matter—in the grip of this small brain. I would
      not change. Even now."

He looked at the little phial. "There will be no need of sleep again," he
      said. The next day at noon, punctual to the minute, he entered his lecture
      theatre, put his hat on the end of the table as his habit was, and
      carefully selected a large piece of chalk. It was a joke among his
      students that he could not lecture without that piece of chalk to fumble
      in his fingers, and once he had been stricken to impotence by their hiding
      his supply. He came and looked under his grey eyebrows at the rising tiers
      of young fresh faces, and spoke with his accustomed studied commonness of
      phrasing.

"Circumstances have arisen—circumstances beyond my control," he
      said, and paused, "which will debar me from completing the course I had
      designed. It would seem, gentlemen, if I may put the thing clearly and
      briefly, that—Man has lived in vain."

The students glanced at one another. Had they heard aright? Mad? Raised
      eyebrows and grinning lips there were, but one or two faces remained
      intent upon his calm grey-fringed face. "It will be interesting," he was
      saying, "to devote this morning to an exposition, so far as I can make it
      clear to you, of the calculations that have led me to this conclusion. Let
      us assume——"

He turned towards the blackboard, meditating a diagram in the way that was
      usual to him. "What was that about ''lived in vain''?" whispered one student
      to another. "Listen," said the other, nodding towards the lecturer.

That night the star rose later, for its proper eastward motion had carried
      it some way across Leo towards Virgo, and its brightness was so great that
      the sky became a luminous blue as it rose, and every star was hidden in
      its turn, save only Jupiter near the zenith, Capella, Aldebaran, Sirius,
      and the pointers of the Bear. It was very white and beautiful. In many
      parts of the world that night a pallid halo encircled it about. It was
      perceptibly larger; in the clear refractive sky of the tropics it seemed
      as if it were nearly a quarter the size of the moon. The frost was still
      on the ground in England, but the world was as brightly lit as if it were
      midsummer moonlight. One could see to read quite ordinary print by that
      cold, clear light, and in the cities the lamps burnt yellow and wan.

And everywhere the world was awake that night, and throughout Christendom
      a sombre murmur hung in the keen air over the country-side like the
      belling of bees in the heather, and this murmurous tumult grew to a
      clangour in the cities. It was the tolling of the bells in a million
      belfry towers and steeples, summoning the people to sleep no more, to sin
      no more, but to gather in their churches and pray. And overhead, growing
      larger and brighter, as the earth rolled on its way and the night passed,
      rose the dazzling star.

And the streets and houses were alight in all the cities, the shipyards
      glared, and whatever roads led to high country were lit and crowded all
      night long. And in all the seas about the civilized lands, ships with
      throbbing engines, and ships with bellying sails, crowded with men and
      living creatures, were standing out to ocean and the north. For already
      the warning of the master mathematician had been telegraphed all over the
      world and translated into a hundred tongues. The new planet and Neptune,
      locked in a fiery embrace, were whirling headlong, ever faster and faster
      towards the sun. Already every second this blazing mass flew a hundred
      miles, and every second its terrific velocity increased. As it flew now,
      indeed, it must pass a hundred million of miles, wide of the earth and
      scarcely affect it. But near its destined path, as yet only slightly
      perturbed, spun the mighty planet Jupiter and his moons sweeping splendid
      round the sun. Every moment now the attraction between the fiery star and
      the greatest of the planets grew stronger. And the result of that
      attraction? Inevitably Jupiter would be deflected from its orbit into an
      elliptical path, and the burning star, swung by his attraction wide of its
      sunward rush, would "describe a curved path," and perhaps collide with,
      and certainly pass very close to, our earth. "Earthquakes, volcanic
      outbreaks, cyclones, sea waves, floods, and a steady rise in temperature
      to I know not what limit"—so prophesied the master mathematician.

And overhead, to carry out his words, lonely and cold and livid blazed the
      star of the coming doom.

To many who stared at it that night until their eyes ached it seemed that
      it was visibly approaching. And that night, too, the weather changed, and
      the frost that had gripped all Central Europe and France and England
      softened towards a thaw.

But you must not imagine, because I have spoken of people praying through
      the night and people going aboard ships and people fleeing towards
      mountainous country, that the whole world was already in a terror because
      of the star. As a matter of fact, use and wont still ruled the world, and
      save for the talk of idle moments and the splendour of the night, nine
      human beings out of ten were still busy at their common occupations. In
      all the cities the shops, save one here and there, opened and closed at
      their proper hours, the doctor and the undertaker plied their trades, the
      workers gathered in the factories, soldiers drilled, scholars studied,
      lovers sought one another, thieves lurked and fled, politicians planned
      their schemes. The presses of the newspapers roared through the nights,
      and many a priest of this church and that would not open his holy building
      to further what he considered a foolish panic. The newspapers insisted on
      the lesson of the year 1000—for then, too, people had anticipated
      the end. The star was no star—mere gas—a comet; and were it a
      star it could not possibly strike the earth. There was no precedent for
      such a thing. Common-sense was sturdy everywhere, scornful, jesting, a
      little inclined to persecute the obdurate fearful. That night, at
      seven-fifteen by Greenwich time, the star would be at its nearest to
      Jupiter. Then the world would see the turn things would take. The master
      mathematician''s grim warnings were treated by many as so much mere
      elaborate self-advertisement. Common-sense at last, a little heated by
      argument, signified its unalterable convictions by going to bed. So, too,
      barbarism and savagery, already tired of the novelty, went about their
      nightly business, and, save for a howling dog here and there, the beast
      world left the star unheeded.

And yet, when at last the watchers in the European States saw the star
      rise, an hour later, it is true, but no larger than it had been the night
      before, there were still plenty awake to laugh at the master mathematician—to
      take the danger as if it had passed.

But hereafter the laughter ceased. The star grew—it grew with a
      terrible steadiness hour after hour, a little larger each hour, a little
      nearer the midnight zenith, and brighter and brighter, until it had turned
      night into a second day. Had it come straight to the earth instead of in a
      curved path, had it lost no velocity to Jupiter, it must have leapt the
      intervening gulf in a day; but as it was, it took five days altogether to
      come by our planet. The next night it had become a third the size of the
      moon before it set to English eyes, and the thaw was assured. It rose over
      America near the size of the moon, but blinding white to look at, and hot;
      and a breath of hot wind blew now with its rising and gathering strength,
      and in Virginia, and Brazil, and down the St. Lawrence valley, it shone
      intermittently through a driving reek of thunder-clouds, flickering violet
      lightning, and hail unprecedented. In Manitoba was a thaw and devastating
      floods. And upon all the mountains of the earth the snow and ice began to
      melt that night, and all the rivers coming out of high country flowed
      thick and turbid, and soon—in their upper reaches— with
      swirling trees and the bodies of beasts and men. They rose steadily,
      steadily in the ghostly brilliance, and came trickling over their banks at
      last, behind the flying population of their valleys.

And along the coast of Argentina and up the South Atlantic the tides were
      higher than had ever been in the memory of man, and the storms drove the
      waters in many cases scores of miles inland, drowning whole cities. And so
      great grew the heat during the night that the rising of the sun was like
      the coming of a shadow. The earthquakes began and grew until all down
      America from the Arctic Circle to Cape Horn, hillsides were sliding,
      fissures were opening, and houses and walls crumbling to destruction. The
      whole side of Cotopaxi slipped out in one vast convulsion, and a tumult of
      lava poured out so high and broad and swift and liquid that in one day it
      reached the sea.

So the star, with the wan moon in its wake, marched across the Pacific,
      trailed the thunder-storms like the hem of a robe, and the growing tidal
      wave that toiled behind it, frothing and eager, poured over island and
      island and swept them clear of men: until that wave came at last—in
      a blinding light and with the breath of a furnace, swift and terrible it
      came—a wall of water, fifty feet high, roaring hungrily, upon the
      long coasts of Asia, and swept inland across the plains of China. For a
      space the star, hotter now and larger and brighter than the sun in its
      strength, showed with pitiless brilliance the wide and populous country;
      towns and villages with their pagodas and trees, roads, wide cultivated
      fields, millions of sleepless people staring in helpless terror at the
      incandescent sky; and then, low and growing, came the murmur of the flood.
      And thus it was with millions of men that night—a flight nowhither,
      with limbs heavy with heat and breath fierce and scant, and the flood like
      a wall swift and white behind. And then death.

China was lit glowing white, but over Japan and Java and all the islands
      of Eastern Asia the great star was a ball of dull red fire because of the
      steam and smoke and ashes the volcanoes were spouting forth to salute its
      coming. Above was the lava, hot gases and ash, and below the seething
      floods, and the whole earth swayed and rumbled with the earthquake shocks.
      Soon the immemorial snows of Thibet and the Himalaya were melting and
      pouring down by ten million deepening converging channels upon the plains
      of Burmah and Hindostan. The tangled summits of the Indian jungles were
      aflame in a thousand places, and below the hurrying waters around the
      stems were dark objects that still struggled feebly and reflected the
      blood-red tongues of fire. And in a rudderless confusion a multitude of
      men and women fled down the broad river-ways to that one last hope of men—the
      open sea.

Larger grew the star, and larger, hotter, and brighter with a terrible
      swiftness now. The tropical ocean had lost its phosphorescence, and the
      whirling steam rose in ghostly wreaths from the black waves that plunged
      incessantly, speckled with storm-tossed ships.

And then came a wonder. It seemed to those who in Europe watched for the
      rising of the star that the world must have ceased its rotation. In a
      thousand open spaces of down and upland the people who had fled thither
      from the floods and the falling houses and sliding slopes of hill watched
      for that rising in vain. Hour followed hour through a terrible suspense,
      and the star rose not. Once again men set their eyes upon the old
      constellations they had counted lost to them for ever. In England it was
      hot and clear overhead, though the ground quivered perpetually, but in the
      tropics, Sirius and Capella and Aldebaran showed through a veil of steam.
      And when at last the great star rose near ten hours late, the sun rose
      close upon it, and in the centre of its white heart was a disc of black.

Over Asia it was the star had begun to fall behind the movement of the
      sky, and then suddenly, as it hung over India, its light had been veiled.
      All the plain of India from the mouth of the Indus to the mouths of the
      Ganges was a shallow waste of shining water that night, out of which rose
      temples and palaces, mounds and hills, black with people. Every minaret
      was a clustering mass of people, who fell one by one into the turbid
      waters, as heat and terror overcame them. The whole land seemed a-wailing,
      and suddenly there swept a shadow across that furnace of despair, and a
      breath of cold wind, and a gathering of clouds, out of the cooling air.
      Men looking up, near blinded, at the star, saw that a black disc was
      creeping across the light. It was the moon, coming between the star and
      the earth. And even as men cried to God at this respite, out of the East
      with a strange inexplicable swiftness sprang the sun. And then star, sun,
      and moon rushed together across the heavens.

So it was that presently to the European watchers star and sun rose close
      upon each other, drove headlong for a space and then slower, and at last
      came to rest, star and sun merged into one glare of flame at the zenith of
      the sky. The moon no longer eclipsed the star but was lost to sight in the
      brilliance of the sky. And though those who were still alive regarded it
      for the most part with that dull stupidity that hunger, fatigue, heat and
      despair engender, there were still men who could perceive the meaning of
      these signs. Star and earth had been at their nearest, had swung about one
      another, and the star had passed. Already it was receding, swifter and
      swifter, in the last stage of its headlong journey downward into the sun.

And then the clouds gathered, blotting out the vision of the sky, the
      thunder and lightning wove a garment round the world; all over the earth
      was such a downpour of rain as men had never before seen, and where the
      volcanoes flared red against the cloud canopy there descended torrents of
      mud. Everywhere the waters were pouring off the land, leaving mud-silted
      ruins, and the earth littered like a storm-worn beach with all that had
      floated, and the dead bodies of the men and brutes, its children. For days
      the water streamed off the land, sweeping away soil and trees and houses
      in the way, and piling huge dykes and scooping out Titanic gullies over
      the country-side. Those were the days of darkness that followed the star
      and the heat. All through them, and for many weeks and months, the
      earthquakes continued.

But the star had passed, and men, hunger-driven and gathering courage only
      slowly, might creep back to their ruined cities, buried granaries, and
      sodden fields. Such few ships as had escaped the storms of that time came
      stunned and shattered and sounding their way cautiously through the new
      marks and shoals of once familiar ports. And as the storms subsided men
      perceived that everywhere the days were hotter than of yore, and the sun
      larger, and the moon, shrunk to a third of its former size, took now
      fourscore days between its new and new.

But of the new brotherhood that grew presently among men, of the saving of
      laws and books and machines, of the strange change that had come over
      Iceland and Greenland and the shores of Baffin''s Bay, so that the sailors
      coming there presently found them green and gracious, and could scarce
      believe their eyes, this story does not tell. Nor of the movement of
      mankind, now that the earth was hotter, northward and southward towards
      the poles of the earth. It concerns itself only with the coming and the
      passing of the star.

The Martian astronomers—for there are astronomers on Mars, although
      they are very different beings from men—were naturally profoundly
      interested by these things. They saw them from their own standpoint of
      course. "Considering the mass and temperature of the missile that was
      flung through our solar system into the sun," one wrote, "it is
      astonishing what a little damage the earth, which it missed so narrowly,
      has sustained. All the familiar continental markings and the masses of the
      seas remain intact, and indeed the only difference seems to be a shrinkage
      of the white discolouration (supposed to be frozen water) round either
      pole." Which only shows how small the vastest of human catastrophes may
      seem at a distance of a few million miles.

It is doubtful whether the gift was innate. For my own part, I think it
      came to him suddenly. Indeed, until he was thirty he was a sceptic, and
      did not believe in miraculous powers. And here, since it is the most
      convenient place, I must mention that he was a little man, and had eyes of
      a hot brown, very erect red hair, a moustache with ends that he twisted
      up, and freckles. His name was George McWhirter Fotheringay—not the
      sort of name by any means to lead to any expectation of miracles—and
      he was clerk at Gomshott''s. He was greatly addicted to assertive argument.
      It was while he was asserting the impossibility of miracles that he had
      his first intimation of his extraordinary powers. This particular argument
      was being held in the bar of the Long Dragon, and Toddy Beamish was
      conducting the opposition by a monotonous but effective "So you
      say," that drove Mr. Fotheringay to the very limit of his patience.

There were present, besides these two, a very dusty cyclist, landlord Cox,
      and Miss Maybridge, the perfectly respectable and rather portly barmaid of
      the Dragon. Miss Maybridge was standing with her back to Mr. Fotheringay,
      washing glasses; the others were watching him, more or less amused by the
      present ineffectiveness of the assertive method. Goaded by the Torres
      Vedras tactics of Mr. Beamish, Mr. Fotheringay determined to make an
      unusual rhetorical effort. "Looky here, Mr. Beamish," said Mr.
      Fotheringay. "Let us clearly understand what a miracle is. It''s something
      contrariwise to the course of nature, done by power of will, something
      what couldn''t happen without being specially willed."

Mr. Fotheringay appealed to the cyclist, who had hitherto been a silent
      auditor, and received his assent—given with a hesitating cough and a
      glance at Mr. Beamish. The landlord would express no opinion, and Mr.
      Fotheringay, returning to Mr. Beamish, received the unexpected concession
      of a qualified assent to his definition of a miracle.

"For instance," said Mr. Fotheringay, greatly encouraged. "Here would be a
      miracle. That lamp, in the natural course of nature, couldn''t burn like
      that upsy-down, could it, Beamish?"

"Very well," said Mr. Fotheringay. "Then here comes someone, as it might
      be me, along here, and stands as it might be here, and says to that lamp,
      as I might do, collecting all my will—Turn upsy-down without
      breaking, and go on burning steady, and—Hullo!"

It was enough to make anyone say "Hullo!" The impossible, the incredible,
      was visible to them all. The lamp hung inverted in the air, burning
      quietly with its flame pointing down. It was as solid, as indisputable as
      ever a lamp was, the prosaic common lamp of the Long Dragon bar.

Mr. Fotheringay stood with an extended forefinger and the knitted brows of
      one anticipating a catastrophic smash. The cyclist, who was sitting next
      the lamp, ducked and jumped across the bar. Everybody jumped, more or
      less. Miss Maybridge turned and screamed. For nearly three seconds the
      lamp remained still. A faint cry of mental distress came from Mr.
      Fotheringay. "I can''t keep it up," he said, "any longer." He staggered
      back, and the inverted lamp suddenly flared, fell against the corner of
      the bar, bounced aside, smashed upon the floor, and went out.

It was lucky it had a metal receiver, or the whole place would have been
      in a blaze. Mr. Cox was the first to speak, and his remark, shorn of
      needless excrescences, was to the effect that Fotheringay was a fool.
      Fotheringay was beyond disputing even so fundamental a proposition as
      that! He was astonished beyond measure at the thing that had occurred. The
      subsequent conversation threw absolutely no light on the matter so far as
      Fotheringay was concerned; the general opinion not only followed Mr. Cox
      very closely but very vehemently. Everyone accused Fotheringay of a silly
      trick, and presented him to himself as a foolish destroyer of comfort and
      security. His mind was in a tornado of perplexity, he was himself inclined
      to agree with them, and he made a remarkably ineffectual opposition to the
      proposal of his departure.

He went home flushed and heated, coat-collar crumpled, eyes smarting, and
      ears red. He watched each of the ten street lamps nervously as he passed
      it. It was only when he found himself alone in his little bedroom in
      Church Row that he was able to grapple seriously with his memories of the
      occurrence, and ask, "What on earth happened?"

He had removed his coat and boots, and was sitting on the bed with his
      hands in his pockets repeating the text of his defence for the seventeenth
      time, "I didn''t want the confounded thing to upset," when it occurred to
      him that at the precise moment he had said the commanding words he had
      inadvertently willed the thing he said, and that when he had seen the lamp
      in the air he had felt that it depended on him to maintain it there
      without being clear how this was to be done. He had not a particularly
      complex mind, or he might have stuck for a time at that "inadvertently
      willed," embracing, as it does, the abstrusest problems of voluntary
      action; but as it was, the idea came to him with a quite acceptable
      haziness. And from that, following, as I must admit, no clear logical
      path, he came to the test of experiment.

He pointed resolutely to his candle and collected his mind, though he felt
      he did a foolish thing. "Be raised up," he said. But in a second that
      feeling vanished. The candle was raised, hung in the air one giddy moment,
      and as Mr. Fotheringay gasped, fell with a smash on his toilet-table,
      leaving him in darkness save for the expiring glow of its wick.

For a time Mr. Fotheringay sat in the darkness, perfectly still. "It did
      happen, after all," he said. "And ''ow I''m to explain it I don''t
      know." He sighed heavily, and began feeling in his pockets for a match. He
      could find none, and he rose and groped about the toilet-table. "I wish I
      had a match," he said. He resorted to his coat, and there was none there,
      and then it dawned upon him that miracles were possible even with matches.
      He extended a hand and scowled at it in the dark. "Let there be a match in
      that hand," he said. He felt some light object fall across his palm and
      his fingers closed upon a match.

After several ineffectual attempts to light this, he discovered it was a
      safety match. He threw it down, and then it occurred to him that he might
      have willed it lit. He did, and perceived it burning in the midst of his
      toilet-table mat. He caught it up hastily, and it went out. His perception
      of possibilities enlarged, and he felt for and replaced the candle in its
      candlestick. "Here! you be lit," said Mr. Fotheringay, and
      forthwith the candle was flaring, and he saw a little black hole in the
      toilet-cover, with a wisp of smoke rising from it. For a time he stared
      from this to the little flame and back, and then looked up and met his own
      gaze in the looking-glass. By this help he communed with himself in
      silence for a time.

The subsequent meditations of Mr. Fotheringay were of a severe but
      confused description. So far, he could see it was a case of pure willing
      with him. The nature of his experiences so far disinclined him for any
      further experiments, at least until he had reconsidered them. But he
      lifted a sheet of paper, and turned a glass of water pink and then green,
      and he created a snail, which he miraculously annihilated, and got himself
      a miraculous new tooth-brush. Somewhere in the small hours he had reached
      the fact that his will-power must be of a particularly rare and pungent
      quality, a fact of which he had indeed had inklings before, but no certain
      assurance. The scare and perplexity of his first discovery was now
      qualified by pride in this evidence of singularity and by vague
      intimations of advantage. He became aware that the church clock was
      striking one, and as it did not occur to him that his daily duties at
      Gomshott''s might be miraculously dispensed with, he resumed undressing, in
      order to get to bed without further delay. As he struggled to get his
      shirt over his head, he was struck with a brilliant idea. "Let me be in
      bed," he said, and found himself so. "Undressed," he stipulated; and,
      finding the sheets cold, added hastily, "and in my nightshirt—ho, in
      a nice soft woollen nightshirt. Ah!" he said with immense enjoyment. "And
      now let me be comfortably asleep..."

He awoke at his usual hour and was pensive all through breakfast-time,
      wondering whether his over-night experience might not be a particularly
      vivid dream. At length his mind turned again to cautious experiments. For
      instance, he had three eggs for breakfast; two his landlady had supplied,
      good, but shoppy, and one was a delicious fresh goose-egg, laid, cooked,
      and served by his extraordinary will. He hurried off to Gomshott''s in a
      state of profound but carefully concealed excitement, and only remembered
      the shell of the third egg when his landlady spoke of it that night. All
      day he could do no work because of this astonishing new self-knowledge,
      but this caused him no inconvenience, because he made up for it
      miraculously in his last ten minutes.

As the day wore on his state of mind passed from wonder to elation, albeit
      the circumstances of his dismissal from the Long Dragon were still
      disagreeable to recall, and a garbled account of the matter that had
      reached his colleagues led to some badinage. It was evident he must be
      careful how he lifted frangible articles, but in other ways his gift
      promised more and more as he turned it over in his mind. He intended among
      other things to increase his personal property by unostentatious acts of
      creation. He called into existence a pair of very splendid diamond studs,
      and hastily annihilated them again as young Gomshott came across the
      counting-house to his desk. He was afraid young Gomshott might wonder how
      he had come by them. He saw quite clearly the gift required caution and
      watchfulness in its exercise, but so far as he could judge the
      difficulties attending its mastery would be no greater than those he had
      already faced in the study of cycling. It was that analogy, perhaps, quite
      as much as the feeling that he would be unwelcome in the Long Dragon, that
      drove him out after supper into the lane beyond the gasworks, to rehearse
      a few miracles in private.

There was possibly a certain want of originality in his attempts, for,
      apart from his will-power, Mr. Fotheringay was not a very exceptional man.
      The miracle of Moses'' rod came to his mind, but the night was dark and
      unfavourable to the proper control of large miraculous snakes. Then he
      recollected the story of "Tannhduser" that he had read on the back of the
      Philharmonic programme. That seemed to him singularly attractive and
      harmless. He stuck his walking-stick—a very nice Poona-Penang lawyer—
      into the turf that edged the footpath, and commanded the dry wood to
      blossom. The air was immediately full of the scent of roses, and by means
      of a match he saw for himself that this beautiful miracle was indeed
      accomplished. His satisfaction was ended by advancing footsteps. Afraid of
      a premature discovery of his powers, he addressed the blossoming stick
      hastily: "Go back." What he meant was "Change back;" but of course he was
      confused. The stick receded at a considerable velocity, and incontinently
      came a cry of anger and a bad word from the approaching person. "Who are
      you throwing brambles at, you fool?" cried a voice. "That got me on the
      shin."

"I''m sorry, old chap," said Mr. Fotheringay, and then, realising the
      awkward nature of the explanation, caught nervously at his moustache. He
      saw Winch, one of the three Immering constables, advancing.

"What d''yer mean by it?" asked the constable. "Hullo! it''s you, is it? The
      gent that broke the lamp at the Long Dragon!"

For the moment Mr. Fotheringay could not think what he had done it for.
      His silence seemed to irritate Mr. Winch. "You''ve been assaulting the
      police, young man, this time. That''s what you done."

"Look here, Mr. Winch," said Mr. Fotheringay, annoyed and confused, "I''m
      sorry, very. The fact is——"

He could think of no way but the truth. "I was working a miracle." He
      tried to speak in an off-hand way, but try as he would he couldn''t.

"Working a—! ''Ere, don''t you talk rot. Working a miracle, indeed!
      Miracle! Well, that''s downright funny! Why, you''s the chap that don''t
      believe in miracles... Fact is, this is another of your silly conjuring
      tricks—that''s what this is. Now, I tell you—"

But Mr. Fotheringay never heard what Mr. Winch was going to tell him. He
      realised he had given himself away, flung his valuable secret to all the
      winds of heaven. A violent gust of irritation swept him to action. He
      turned on the constable swiftly and fiercely. "Here," he said, "I''ve had
      enough of this, I have! I''ll show you a silly conjuring trick, I will! Go
      to Hades! Go, now!"

Mr. Fotheringay performed no more miracles that night, nor did he trouble
      to see what had become of his flowering stick. He returned to the town,
      scared and very quiet, and went to his bedroom. "Lord!" he said, "it''s a
      powerful gift—an extremely powerful gift. I didn''t hardly mean as
      much as that. Not really... I wonder what Hades is like!"

He sat on the bed taking off his boots. Struck by a happy thought he
      transferred the constable to San Francisco, and without any more
      interference with normal causation went soberly to bed. In the night he
      dreamt of the anger of Winch.

The next day Mr. Fotheringay heard two interesting items of news. Someone
      had planted a most beautiful climbing rose against the elder Mr.
      Gomshott''s private house in the Lullaborough Road, and the river as far as
      Rawling''s Mill was to be dragged for Constable Winch.

Mr. Fotheringay was abstracted and thoughtful all that day, and performed
      no miracles except certain provisions for Winch, and the miracle of
      completing his day''s work with punctual perfection in spite of all the
      bee-swarm of thoughts that hummed through his mind. And the extraordinary
      abstraction and meekness of his manner was remarked by several people, and
      made a matter for jesting. For the most part he was thinking of Winch.

On Sunday evening he went to chapel, and oddly enough, Mr. Maydig, who
      took a certain interest in occult matters, preached about "things that are
      not lawful." Mr. Fotheringay was not a regular chapelgoer, but the system
      of assertive scepticism, to which I have already alluded, was now very
      much shaken. The tenor of the sermon threw an entirely new light on these
      novel gifts, and he suddenly decided to consult Mr. Maydig immediately
      after the service. So soon as that was determined, he found himself
      wondering why he had not done so before.

Mr. Maydig, a lean, excitable man with quite remarkably long wrists and
      neck, was gratified at a request for a private conversation from a young
      man whose carelessness in religious matters was a subject for general
      remark in the town. After a few necessary delays, he conducted him to the
      study of the manse, which was contiguous to the chapel, seated him
      comfortably, and, standing in front of a cheerful fire—his legs
      threw a Rhodian arch of shadow on the opposite wall—requested Mr.
      Fotheringay to state his business.

At first Mr. Fotheringay was a little abashed, and found some difficulty
      in opening the matter. "You will scarcely believe me, Mr. Maydig, I am
      afraid"—and so forth for some time. He tried a question at last, and
      asked Mr. Maydig his opinion of miracles.

Mr. Maydig was still saying "Well" in an extremely judicial tone, when Mr.
      Fotheringay interrupted again: "You don''t believe, I suppose, that some
      common sort of person—like myself, for instance—as it might be
      sitting here now, might have some sort of twist inside him that made him
      able to do things by his will."

"If I might make free with something here, I think I might show you by a
      sort of experiment," said Mr. Fotheringay. "Now, take that tobacco-jar on
      the table, for instance. What I want to know is whether what I am going to
      do with it is a miracle or not. Just half a minute, Mr. Maydig, please."

Mr. Maydig started violently at the change, and stood looking from the
      thaumaturgist to the bowl of flowers. He said nothing. Presently he
      ventured to lean over the table and smell the violets; they were
      fresh-picked and very fine ones. Then he stared at Mr. Fotheringay again.

Mr. Fotheringay pulled his moustache. "Just told it—and there you
      are. Is that a miracle, or is it black art, or what is it? And what do you
      think''s the matter with me? That''s what I want to ask."

"And this day last week I knew no more that I could do things like that
      than you did. It came quite sudden. It''s something odd about my will, I
      suppose, and that''s as far as I can see."

"Lord, yes!" said Mr. Fotheringay. "Just anything." He thought, and
      suddenly recalled a conjuring entertainment he had seen. "Here!" he
      pointed, "change into a bowl of fish—no, not that—change into
      a glass bowl full of water with goldfish swimming in it. That''s better!
      You see that, Mr. Maydig?"

"I could change it into anything," said Mr. Fotheringay. "Just anything.
      Here! be a pigeon, will you?"

In another moment a blue pigeon was fluttering round the room and making
      Mr. Maydig duck every time it came near him. "Stop there, will you?" said
      Mr. Fotheringay; and the pigeon hung motionless in the air. "I could
      change it back to a bowl of flowers," he said, and after replacing the
      pigeon on the table worked that miracle. "I expect you will want your pipe
      in a bit," he said, and restored the tobacco-jar.

Mr. Maydig had followed all these later changes in a sort of ejaculatory
      silence. He stared at Mr. Fotheringay and in a very gingerly manner picked
      up the tobacco-jar, examined it, replaced it on the table. "Well!"
      was the only expression of his feelings.

"Now, after that it''s easier to explain what I came about," said Mr.
      Fotheringay; and proceeded to a lengthy and involved narrative of his
      strange experiences, beginning with the affair of the lamp in the Long
      Dragon and complicated by persistent allusions to Winch. As he went on,
      the transient pride Mr. Maydig''s consternation had caused passed away; he
      became the very ordinary Mr. Fotheringay of everyday intercourse again.
      Mr. Maydig listened intently, the tobacco-jar in his hand, and his bearing
      changed also with the course of the narrative. Presently, while Mr.
      Fotheringay was dealing with the miracle of the third egg, the minister
      interrupted with a fluttering, extended hand.

"It is possible," he said. "It is credible. It is amazing, of course, but
      it reconciles a number of amazing difficulties. The power to work miracles
      is a gift—a peculiar quality like genius or second sight; hitherto
      it has come very rarely and to exceptional people. But in this case...I
      have always wondered at the miracles of Mahomet, and at Yogi''s miracles,
      and the miracles of Madame Blavatsky. But, of course—Yes, it is
      simply a gift! It carries out so beautifully the arguments of that great
      thinker"— Mr. Maydig''s voice sank—"his Grace the Duke of
      Argyll. Here we plumb some profounder law—deeper than the ordinary
      laws of nature. Yes—yes. Go on. Go on!"

Mr. Fotheringay proceeded to tell of his misadventure with Winch, and Mr.
      Maydig, no longer overawed or scared, began to jerk his limbs about and
      interject astonishment. "It''s this what troubled me most," proceeded Mr.
      Fotheringay; "it''s this I''m most mijitly in want of advice for; of course
      he''s at San Francisco—wherever San Francisco may be—but of
      course it''s awkward for both of us, as you''ll see, Mr. Maydig. I don''t see
      how he can understand what has happened, and I daresay he''s scared and
      exasperated something tremendous, and trying to get at me. I daresay he
      keeps on starting off to come here. I send him back, by a miracle, every
      few hours, when I think of it. And, of course, that''s a thing he won''t be
      able to understand, and it''s bound to annoy him; and, of course, if he
      takes a ticket every time it will cost him a lot of money. I done the best
      I could for him, but, of course, it''s difficult for him to put himself in
      my place. I thought afterwards that his clothes might have got scorched,
      you know—if Hades is all it''s supposed to be—before I shifted
      him. In that case I suppose they''d have locked him up in San Francisco. Of
      course I willed him a new suit of clothes on him directly I thought of it.
      But, you see, I''m already in a deuce of a tangle——"

Mr. Maydig looked serious. "I see you are in a tangle. Yes, it''s a
      difficult position. How you are to end it..." He became diffuse and
      inconclusive.

"However, we''ll leave Winch for a little and discuss the larger question.
      I don''t think this is a case of the black art or anything of the sort. I
      don''t think there is any taint of criminality about it at all, Mr.
      Fotheringay—none whatever, unless you are suppressing material
      facts. No, it''s miracles—pure miracles—miracles, if I may say
      so, of the very highest class."

He began to pace the hearthrug and gesticulate, while Mr. Fotheringay sat
      with his arm on the table and his head on his arm, looking worried. "I
      don''t see how I''m to manage about Winch," he said.

"A gift of working miracles—apparently a very powerful gift," said
      Mr. Maydig, "will find a way about Winch—never fear. My dear sir,
      you are a most important man—a man of the most astonishing
      possibilities. As evidence, for example! And in other ways, the things you
      may do..."

"Yes, I''ve thought of a thing or two," said Mr. Fotheringay. "But—
      some of the things came a bit twisty. You saw that fish at first? Wrong
      sort of bowl and wrong sort of fish. And I thought I''d ask someone."

"A proper course," said Mr. Maydig, "a very proper course—altogether
      the proper course." He stopped and looked at Mr. Fotheringay. "It''s
      practically an unlimited gift. Let us test your powers, for instance. If
      they really are ... If they really are all they seem to be."

And so, incredible as it may seem, in the study of the little house behind
      the Congregational Chapel, on the evening of Sunday, Nov. 10, 1896, Mr.
      Fotheringay, egged on and inspired by Mr. Maydig, began to work miracles.
      The reader''s attention is specially and definitely called to the date. He
      will object, probably has already objected, that certain points in this
      story are improbable, that if any things of the sort already described had
      indeed occurred, they would have been in all the papers at that time. The
      details immediately following he will find particularly hard to accept,
      because among other things they involve the conclusion that he or she, the
      reader in question, must have been killed in a violent and unprecedented
      manner more than a year ago. Now a miracle is nothing if not improbable,
      and as a matter of fact the reader was killed in a violent and
      unprecedented manner in 1896. In the subsequent course of this story that
      will become perfectly clear and credible, as every right-minded and
      reasonable reader will admit. But this is not the place for the end of the
      story, being but little beyond the hither side of the middle. And at first
      the miracles worked by Mr. Fotheringay were timid little miracles—little
      things with the cups and parlour fitments, as feeble as the miracles of
      Theosophists, and, feeble as they were, they were received with awe by his
      collaborator. He would have preferred to settle the Winch business out of
      hand, but Mr. Maydig would not let him. But after they had worked a dozen
      of these domestic trivialities, their sense of power grew, their
      imagination began to show signs of stimulation, and their ambition
      enlarged. Their first larger enterprise was due to hunger and the
      negligence of Mrs. Minchin, Mr. Maydig''s housekeeper. The meal to which
      the minister conducted Mr. Fotheringay was certainly ill-laid and
      uninviting as refreshment for two industrious miracle-workers; but they
      were seated, and Mr. Maydig was descanting in sorrow rather than in anger
      upon his housekeeper''s shortcomings, before it occurred to Mr. Fotheringay
      that an opportunity lay before him. "Don''t you think, Mr. Maydig," he
      said, "if it isn''t a liberty, I——"

Mr. Fotheringay waved his hand. "What shall we have?" he said, in a large,
      inclusive spirit, and, at Mr. Maydig''s order, revised the supper very
      thoroughly. "As for me," he said, eyeing Mr. Maydig''s selection, "I am
      always particularly fond of a tankard of stout and a nice Welsh rarebit,
      and I''ll order that. I ain''t much given to Burgundy," and forthwith stout
      and Welsh rarebit promptly appeared at his command. They sat long at their
      supper, talking like equals, as Mr. Fotheringay presently perceived, with
      a glow of surprise and gratification, of all the miracles they would
      presently do. "And, by-the-by, Mr. Maydig," said Mr. Fotheringay, "I might
      perhaps be able to help you—in a domestic way."

Mr. Fotheringay helped himself to a second Welsh rarebit out of vacancy,
      and took a mouthful. "I was thinking," he said, "I might be able (chum,
      chum) to work (chum, chum) a miracle with Mrs. Minchin (chum,
      chum)—make her a better woman."

"She''s——She strongly objects to interference, you know, Mr.
      Fotheringay. And—as a matter of fact—it''s well past eleven and
      she''s probably in bed and asleep. Do you think, on the whole——"

Mr. Fotheringay considered these objections. "I don''t see that it
      shouldn''t be done in her sleep."

For a time Mr. Maydig opposed the idea, and then he yielded. Mr.
      Fotheringay issued his orders, and a little less at their ease, perhaps,
      the two gentlemen proceeded with their repast. Mr. Maydig was enlarging on
      the changes he might expect in his housekeeper next day, with an optimism,
      that seemed even to Mr. Fotheringay''s supper senses a little forced and
      hectic, when a series of confused noises from upstairs began. Their eyes
      exchanged interrogations, and Mr. Maydig left the room hastily. Mr.
      Fotheringay heard him calling up to his housekeeper and then his footsteps
      going softly up to her.

In a minute or so the minister returned, his step light, his face radiant.
      "Wonderful!" he said, "and touching! Most touching!"

He began pacing the hearthrug. "A repentance—a most touching
      repentance— through the crack of the door. Poor woman! A most
      wonderful change! She had got up. She must have got up at once. She had
      got up out of her sleep to smash a private bottle of brandy in her box.
      And to confess it too!... But this gives us—it opens—a most
      amazing vista of possibilities. If we can work this miraculous change in
      her..."

"Altogether unlimited." And from the hearthrug Mr. Maydig, waving the
      Winch difficulty aside, unfolded a series of wonderful proposals—
      proposals he invented as he went along.

Now what those proposals were does not concern the essentials of this
      story. Suffice it that they were designed in a spirit of infinite
      benevolence, the sort of benevolence that used to be called post-prandial.
      Suffice it, too, that the problem of Winch remained unsolved. Nor is it
      necessary to describe how far that series got to its fulfilment. There
      were astonishing changes. The small hours found Mr. Maydig and Mr.
      Fotheringay careering across the chilly market square under the still
      moon, in a sort of ecstasy of thaumaturgy, Mr. Maydig all flap and
      gesture, Mr. Fotheringay short and bristling, and no longer abashed at his
      greatness. They had reformed every drunkard in the Parliamentary division,
      changed all the beer and alcohol to water (Mr. Maydig had overruled Mr.
      Fotheringay on this point); they had, further, greatly improved the
      railway communication of the place, drained Flinder''s swamp, improved the
      soil of One Tree Hill, and cured the vicar''s wart. And they were going to
      see what could be done with the injured pier at South Bridge. "The place,"
      gasped Mr. Maydig, "won''t be the same place to-morrow. How surprised and
      thankful everyone will be!" And just at that moment the church clock
      struck three.

"I say," said Mr. Fotheringay, "that''s three o''clock! I must be getting
      back. I''ve got to be at business by eight. And besides, Mrs. Wimms——"

"We''re only beginning," said Mr. Maydig, full of the sweetness of
      unlimited power. "We''re only beginning. Think of all the good we''re doing.
      When people wake——"

Mr. Maydig gripped his arm suddenly. His eyes were bright and wild. "My
      dear chap," he said, "there''s no hurry. Look"—he pointed to the moon
      at the zenith—"Joshua!"

"Why not?" said Mr. Maydig. "Of course it doesn''t stop. You stop the
      rotation of the earth, you know. Time stops. It isn''t as if we were doing
      harm."

He buttoned up his jacket and addressed himself to the habitable globe,
      with as good an assumption of confidence as lay in his power. "Jest stop
      rotating, will you?" said Mr. Fotheringay.

Incontinently he was flying head over heels through the air at the rate of
      dozens of miles a minute. In spite of the innumerable circles he was
      describing per second, he thought; for thought is wonderful—sometimes
      as sluggish as flowing pitch, sometimes as instantaneous as light. He
      thought in a second, and willed. "Let me come down safe and sound.
      Whatever else happens, let me down safe and sound."

He willed it only just in time, for his clothes, heated by his rapid
      flight through the air, were already beginning to singe. He came down with
      a forcible, but by no means injurious, bump in what appeared to be a mound
      of fresh-turned earth. A large mass of metal and masonry, extraordinarily
      like the clock-tower in the middle of the market square, hit the earth
      near him, ricochetted over him, and flew into stonework, bricks, and
      cement, like a bursting bomb. A hurtling cow hit one of the larger blocks
      and smashed like an egg. There was a crash that made all the most violent
      crashes of his past life seem like the sound of falling dust, and this was
      followed by a descending series of lesser crashes. A vast wind roared
      throughout earth and heaven, so that he could scarcely lift his head to
      look. For a while he was too breathless and astonished even to see where
      he was or what had happened. And his first movement was to feel his head
      and reassure himself that his streaming hair was still his own.

"Lord!" gasped Mr. Fotheringay, scarce able to speak for the gale, "I''ve
      had a squeak! What''s gone wrong? Storms and thunder. And only a minute ago
      a fine night. It''s Maydig set me on to this sort of thing. What a
      wind! If I go on fooling in this way I''m bound to have a thundering
      accident!...

He looked about him so far as his flapping jacket would permit. The
      appearance of things was really extremely strange. "The sky''s all right
      anyhow," said Mr. Fotheringay. "And that''s about all that is all right.
      And even there it looks like a terrific gale coming up. But there''s the
      moon overhead. Just as it was just now. Bright as midday. But as for the
      rest——Where''s the village? Where''s—where''s anything? And
      what on earth set this wind a-blowing? I didn''t order no wind."

Mr. Fotheringay struggled to get to his feet in vain, and after one
      failure, remained on all fours, holding on. He surveyed the moonlit world
      to leeward, with the tails of his jacket streaming over his head. "There''s
      something seriously wrong," said Mr. Fotheringay. "And what it is—
      goodness knows."

Far and wide nothing was visible in the white glare through the haze of
      dust that drove before a screaming gale but tumbled masses of earth and
      heaps of inchoate ruins, no trees, no houses, no familiar shapes, only a
      wilderness of disorder, vanishing at last into the darkness beneath the
      whirling columns and streamers, the lightnings and thunderings of a
      swiftly rising storm. Near him in the livid glare was something that might
      once have been an elm-tree, a smashed mass of splinters, shivered from
      boughs to base, and further a twisted mass of iron girders—only too
      evidently the viaduct—rose out of the piled confusion.

You see, when Mr. Fotheringay had arrested the rotation of the solid
      globe, he had made no stipulation concerning the trifling movables upon
      its surface. And the earth spins so fast that the surface at its equator
      is travelling at rather more than a thousand miles an hour, and in these
      latitudes at more than half that pace. So that the village, and Mr.
      Maydig, and Mr. Fotheringay, and everybody and everything had been jerked
      violently forward at about nine miles per second—that is to say,
      much more violently than if they had been fired out of a cannon. And every
      human being, every living creature, every house, and every tree—all
      the world as we know it—had been so jerked and smashed and utterly
      destroyed. That was all.

These things Mr. Fotheringay did not, of course, fully appreciate. But he
      perceived that his miracle had miscarried, and with that a great disgust
      of miracles came upon him. He was in darkness now, for the clouds had
      swept together and blotted out his momentary glimpse of the moon, and the
      air was full of fitful struggling tortured wraiths of hail. A great
      roaring of wind and waters filled earth and sky, and peering under his
      hand through the dust and sleet to windward, he saw by the play of the
      lightnings a vast wall of water pouring towards him.

"Just a moment," said Mr. Fotheringay to the lightnings and thunder. "Stop
      jest a moment while I collect my thoughts... And now what shall I do?" he
      said. "What shall I do? Lord! I wish Maydig was about."

"Ah!" he said. "Let nothing what I''m going to order happen until I say
      ''Off!''...Lord! I wish I''d thought of that before!"

He lifted his little voice against the whirlwind, shouting louder and
      louder in the vain desire to hear himself speak. "Now then!—here
      goes! Mind about that what I said just now. In the first place, when all
      I''ve got to say is done, let me lose my miraculous power, let my will
      become just like anybody else''s will, and all these dangerous miracles be
      stopped. I don''t like them. I''d rather I didn''t work ''em. Ever so much.
      That''s the first thing. And the second is—let me be back just before
      the miracles begin; let everything be just as it was before that blessed
      lamp turned up. It''s a big job, but it''s the last. Have you got it? No
      more miracles, everything as it was—me back in the Long Dragon just
      before I drank my half-pint. That''s it! Yes."

He opened his eyes. He was in the bar of the Long Dragon, arguing about
      miracles with Toddy Beamish. He had a vague sense of some great thing
      forgotten that instantaneously passed. You see that, except for the loss
      of his miraculous powers, everything was back as it had been, his mind and
      memory therefore were now just as they had been at the time when this
      story began. So that he knew absolutely nothing' WHERE id = 'ee364418-59f6-4a5c-b61e-e19060e1944f';
