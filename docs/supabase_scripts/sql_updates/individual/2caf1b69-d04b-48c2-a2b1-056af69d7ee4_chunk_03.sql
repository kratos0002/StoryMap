galloped to his herd, the rope trailing on the
ground.

The American groaned. He thought himself
again in the trenches, with the enemy âputting
some hot stuff over.â He was sure he had received
a wound at the back of his head, and was
lying face down in mud and blood, dying, yet no
one came to his aid. Then his nose tickled, he
sneezed, and sat up. He felt the back of his head
and looked at the blood on his fingers. He remembered
roping the pony, but rope and stallion were
both gone. What was that lying in a trampled
bush of bog myrtle? He got up and walked unsteadily
to the prostrate form. The face was
marked with cuts and bruises, while one sleeve
was torn, the arm bleeding and hanging oddly.
The American turned him over carefully, and as
he did so, his gold watch fell out of a pocket, its
glass smashed, and here was his pocket-book lying
on the ground. Then he began to understand
somewhat of what had happened to himself and to
the man, for the hoof-marks around told their
own tale. His face set hard, but this ruffian was
in a bad way, perhaps dying. He would do what
he could for him. He went to his knapsack and
took out a first-aid outfit. He bandaged the torn
and broken arm, using sticks for splints. The
pain roused the patient and he began to groan
and curse disjointedly, the phrase âââ skewbaldâ
recurring like a refrain.

The American carried the man to the shade of
a tree. He heard the chink of coin, which he
divined to be his own property, especially when
he found his pockets empty. Then he waited.
The man opened his eyes, and looked at his preserver.
âWhat?â he spluttered, having lost
some front teeth. âYes, my friend,â said the
other, âI am still here, and a good job for you.
I might have left you to bleed to death, and serve
you right. I think you took rather more risk than
you knew,â producing a revolver from a hip
pocket and replacing it. âWell, your legs and
back seem all right, and after a rest you should be
able to make the road and get help. You donât
deserve it, but I think I had better see you there.
No, donât worry,â as the manâs eyes narrowed.
âIâm not going to give you up. You seem to
have been well beaten about, without my trying
to get you more punishment.â

The man sat motionless; the double shock of
the stallionâs attack, and being confronted by the
victim of his brutal violence, for the moment
bereft him of speech and power to stir.

After a while, he attempted to rise, stammering
that it was time he made a move. His rescuer
helped him up, and the man tried to feel in his
pockets. âAll right, friend,â said the American,
âI have got my own back.â

As the injured man proceeded, his strength
failed and he began to stumble. The other had
to support him, to prevent further injury to the
shattered arm. The road reached, the man sank
by the wayside, exhausted.

A cart drawn by a forest pony came along.
The driver stopped. âWhy, who be this? Not
Bill Nokes again? Whatâs he been up to this
time?â he asked with emphasis. The American
hastily explained that he had found the man lying
injured in the forest. âPut him in. Iâll soon
have him in the hospital at Lyndhurst.â

They laid the man on the floor and made him
as comfortable as possible. âYou coming, sir?ââto
the American. âNo,â he replied. âI
cannot be of any further use, and I have to return
for my property.â

He walked back with a splitting headache, a
sore head, and a wonder in his heart that among
the kindly forest folk he should have encountered
an alien, and a black sheep at that. He found his
goods where he had left them, and seeing the
cudgel lying near, added it to his burden as a
memento. He spied also a lock of chestnut and
white hair, sawn from the skewbaldâs mane by
the rope, and put it into an envelope. Then he
said to himself: âBetter get out of this. My
scalp wants seeing to, and the people may wonder
how I came by a broken head.â

He consulted a time-table and estimated (there
were no hands to his watch) that he could catch
a train by walking across country, to Southampton.
âIâll hunt up that doctor who treated me
before, and get my head patched up.â

When the American went to the surgery two
days later for a final inspection the doctor held
out a local paper, saying, âHere are some items
which may interest you.â A pencil mark stood
against a paragraph entitled, âStrange Death of
a Forest Pony,â which related how Skewbald had
been found by a keeper. The rope had caught in
a snag near a deep pit, and in his efforts to free
himself, the pony had fallen down, and broken
his neck. âWell, doc.,â said the patient, âI
did more mischief than I expected, when I fooled
around with that rope, but I will put it right when
I get to town.â

âLook at the next page,â said the other.
This item was headed, âForest Man injured by
a Pony?â and narrated that a man picked up
grievously injured, was doing well in hospital and
pronounced out of danger. It went on to say:
âHe is a somewhat notorious character and well
known to the police. Curiously, after his injuries
had been seen to, and while in a state of delirium,
he frequently muttered imprecations on âthat ââ
skewbald.â Elsewhere we detail particulars of
the mysterious death of a fine skewbald forest
stallion belonging to a well-known forest commoner,
Mr. J. Smith. It is conjectured that the
man may have lassooed the pony (though it is not
known that he possessed any such skill with a
rope), and in some way was taken at a disadvantage
by the animal, which attacked him, and
escaped, only to meet its death shortly afterwards.
The manâs injuries are such as might have been
caused by a stallionâs teeth and hoofs. Such
aggressive behaviour on the part of a forest pony
is of the rarest.â

A few days later, Skewbaldâs owner received a
letter with a London postmark. âDang me!â
he said, turning it over; âwho be this from?â and
getting no answer from the envelope, opened it,
when out came a draft for Â£40, and a letter in
business terminology from a firm of solicitors
intimating that a client of theirs, having heard
through the Press of the death of his pony, hoped
that the owner would accept the enclosed sum
as indemnity for his loss. âWell, well!â exclaimed
the delighted but bewildered man, âthis
beats all. The thing gets stranger and stranger.
Iâm sure that varmint Bill Nokes never roped the
poor beast. Now, these people write as if someone
owed me the money. Iâd better harness the
pony and get this in the bank before anything else
happens.â And not until he had got the draft
safely to the bank, and had seen the clerk initial
it, did he really believe that the skewbaldâs loss
had been made good.
