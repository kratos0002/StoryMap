Appearance in Court.  Three changes occurred now that we
entered on the case for the defence.  Two of them I will
mention together, first.  The figure was now in Court
continually, and it never there addressed itself to me, but
always to the person who was speaking at the time.  For
instance: the throat of the murdered man had been cut straight
across.  In the opening speech for the defence, it was
suggested that the deceased might have cut his own throat. 
At that very moment, the figure, with its throat in the dreadful
condition p.
310referred to (this it had concealed before), stood at
the speaker’s elbow, motioning across and across its
windpipe, now with the right hand, now with the left, vigorously
suggesting to the speaker himself the impossibility of such a
wound having been self-inflicted by either hand.  For
another instance: a witness to character, a woman, deposed to the
prisoner’s being the most amiable of mankind.  The
figure at that instant stood on the floor before her, looking her
full in the face, and pointing out the prisoner’s evil
countenance with an extended arm and an outstretched finger.

The third change now to be added impressed me strongly as the
most marked and striking of all.  I do not theorise upon it;
I accurately state it, and there leave it.  Although the
Appearance was not itself perceived by those whom it addressed,
its coming close to such persons was invariably attended by some
trepidation or disturbance on their part.  It seemed to me
as if it were prevented, by laws to which I was not amenable,
from fully revealing itself to others, and yet as if it could
invisibly, dumbly, and darkly overshadow their minds.  When
the leading counsel for the defence suggested that hypothesis of
suicide, and the figure stood at the learned gentleman’s
elbow, frightfully sawing at its severed throat, it is undeniable
that the counsel faltered in his speech, lost for a few seconds
the thread of his ingenious discourse, wiped his forehead with
his handkerchief, and turned extremely pale.  When the
witness to character was confronted by the Appearance, her eyes
most certainly did follow the direction of its pointed finger,
and rest in great hesitation and trouble upon the
prisoner’s face.  Two additional illustrations will
suffice.  On the eighth day of the trial, after the pause
which was every day made early in the afternoon for a few
minutes’ rest and refreshment, I came back into Court with
the rest of the Jury some little time before the return of the
Judges.  Standing up in the box and looking about me, I
thought the figure was not there, until, chancing to raise my
eyes to the gallery, I saw it bending forward, and leaning over a
very decent woman, as if to assure itself whether the Judges had
resumed their seats or not.  Immediately afterwards that
woman screamed, fainted, and was carried out.  So with the
venerable, sagacious, and patient Judge who conducted the
trial.  When the case was over, and he settled himself and
his papers to sum up, the murdered man, entering by the
Judges’ door, advanced to his Lordship’s desk, and
looked eagerly over his shoulder at the pages of his notes which
he was turning.  A change came over his Lordship’s
face; his hand stopped; the peculiar shiver, that I knew so well,
passed over him; he faltered, “Excuse me, gentlemen, for a
few moments.  I am somewhat oppressed by the vitiated
air;” and did not recover until he had drunk a glass of
water.

Through all the monotony of six of those interminable ten
days,—the same Judges and others on the bench, the same
Murderer in the dock, the same lawyers at the table, the same
tones of question and p. 311answer rising to the roof of the
court, the same scratching of the Judge’s pen, the same
ushers going in and out, the same lights kindled at the same hour
when there had been any natural light of day, the same foggy
curtain outside the great windows when it was foggy, the same
rain pattering and dripping when it was rainy, the same footmarks
of turnkeys and prisoner day after day on the same sawdust, the
same keys locking and unlocking the same heavy
doors,—through all the wearisome monotony which made me
feel as if I had been Foreman of the Jury for a vast period of
time, and Piccadilly had flourished coevally with Babylon, the
murdered man never lost one trace of his distinctness in my eyes,
nor was he at any moment less distinct than anybody else.  I
must not omit, as a matter of fact, that I never once saw the
Appearance which I call by the name of the murdered man look at
the Murderer.  Again and again I wondered, “Why does
he not?”  But he never did.

Nor did he look at me, after the production of the miniature,
until the last closing minutes of the trial arrived.  We
retired to consider, at seven minutes before ten at night. 
The idiotic vestryman and his two parochial parasites gave us so
much trouble that we twice returned into Court to beg to have
certain extracts from the Judge’s notes re-read.  Nine
of us had not the smallest doubt about those passages, neither, I
believe, had any one in the Court; the dunder-headed triumvirate,
having no idea but obstruction, disputed them for that very
reason.  At length we prevailed, and finally the Jury
returned into Court at ten minutes past twelve.

The murdered man at that time stood directly opposite the
Jury-box, on the other side of the Court.  As I took my
place, his eyes rested on me with great attention; he seemed
satisfied, and slowly shook a great gray veil, which he carried
on his arm for the first time, over his head and whole
form.  As I gave in our verdict, “Guilty,” the
veil collapsed, all was gone, and his place was empty.

The Murderer, being asked by the Judge, according to usage,
whether he had anything to say before sentence of Death should be
passed upon him, indistinctly muttered something which was
described in the leading newspapers of the following day as
“a few rambling, incoherent, and half-audible words, in
which he was understood to complain that he had not had a fair
trial, because the Foreman of the Jury was prepossessed against
him.”  The remarkable declaration that he really made
was this: “My Lord, I knew I was a doomed
man, when the Foreman of my Jury came into the
box.  My Lord, I knew he would never let me
off, because, before I was taken, he somehow
got to my bedside in the night, woke me, and put a
rope round my neck.”

When he heard a voice thus calling to him, he was standing at
the door of his box, with a flag in his hand, furled round its
short pole.  One would have thought, considering the nature
of the ground, that he could not have doubted from what quarter
the voice came; but instead of looking up to where I stood on the
top of the steep cutting nearly over his head, he turned himself
about, and looked down the Line.  There was something
remarkable in his manner of doing so, though I could not have
said for my life what.  But I know it was remarkable enough
to attract my notice, even though his figure was foreshortened
and shadowed, down in the deep trench, and mine was high above
him, so steeped in the glow of an angry sunset, that I had shaded
my eyes with my hand before I saw him at all.

From looking down the Line, he turned himself about again,
and, raising his eyes, saw my figure high above him.

He looked up at me without replying, and I looked down at him
without pressing him too soon with a repetition of my idle
question.  Just then there came a vague vibration in the
earth and air, quickly changing into a violent pulsation, and an
oncoming rush that caused me to start back, as though it had
force to draw me down.  When such vapour as rose to my
height from this rapid train had passed me, and was skimming away
over the landscape, I looked down again, and saw him refurling
the flag he had shown while the train went by.

I repeated my inquiry.  After a pause, during which he
seemed to regard me with fixed attention, he motioned with his
rolled-up flag towards a point on my level, some two or three
hundred yards distant.  I called down to him, “All
right!” and made for that point.  There, by dint of
looking closely about me, I found a rough zigzag descending path
notched out, which I followed.

The cutting was extremely deep, and unusually
precipitate.  It was made through a clammy stone, that
became oozier and wetter as I went down.  For these reasons,
I found the way long enough to give me time to recall a singular
air of reluctance or compulsion with which he had pointed out the
path.

When I came down low enough upon the zigzag descent to see him
again, I saw that he was standing between the rails on the way by
p. 313which
the train had lately passed, in an attitude as if he were waiting
for me to appear.  He had his left hand at his chin, and
that left elbow rested on his right hand, crossed over his
breast.  His attitude was one of such expectation and
watchfulness that I stopped a moment, wondering at it.

I resumed my downward way, and stepping out upon the level of
the railroad, and drawing nearer to him, saw that he was a dark,
sallow man, with a dark beard and rather heavy eyebrows. 
His post was in as solitary and dismal a place as ever I
saw.  On either side, a dripping-wet wall of jagged stone,
excluding all view but a strip of sky; the perspective one way
only a crooked prolongation of this great dungeon; the shorter
perspective in the other direction terminating in a gloomy red
light, and the gloomier entrance to a black tunnel, in whose
massive architecture there was a barbarous, depressing, and
forbidding air.  So little sunlight ever found its way to
this spot, that it had an earthy, deadly smell; and so much cold
wind rushed through it, that it struck chill to me, as if I had
left the natural world.

Before he stirred, I was near enough to him to have touched
him.  Not even then removing his eyes from mine, he stepped
back one step, and lifted his hand.

This was a lonesome post to occupy (I said), and it had
riveted my attention when I looked down from up yonder.  A
visitor was a rarity, I should suppose; not an unwelcome rarity,
I hoped?  In me, he merely saw a man who had been shut up
within narrow limits all his life, and who, being at last set
free, had a newly-awakened interest in these great works. 
To such purpose I spoke to him; but I am far from sure of the
terms I used; for, besides that I am not happy in opening any
conversation, there was something in the man that daunted me.

He directed a most curious look towards the red light near the
tunnel’s mouth, and looked all about it, as if something
were missing from it, and then looked at me.

The monstrous thought came into my mind, as I perused the
fixed eyes and the saturnine face, that this was a spirit, not a
man.  I have speculated since, whether there may have been
infection in his mind.

In my turn, I stepped back.  But in making the action, I
detected in his eyes some latent fear of me.  This put the
monstrous thought to flight.

“My good fellow, what should I do there?  However,
be that as it may, I never was there, you may swear.”

His manner cleared, like my own.  He replied to my
remarks with readiness, and in well-chosen words.  Had he
much to do there?  Yes; that was to say, he had enough
responsibility to bear; but exactness and watchfulness were what
was required of him, and of actual work—manual
labour—he had next to none.  To change that signal, to
trim those lights, and to turn this iron handle now and then, was
all he had to do under that head.  Regarding those many long
and lonely hours of which I seemed to make so much, he could only
say that the routine of his life had shaped itself into that
form, and he had grown used to it.  He had taught himself a
language down here,—if only to know it by sight, and to
have formed his own crude ideas of its pronunciation, could be
called learning it.  He had also worked at fractions and
decimals, and tried a little algebra; but he was, and had been as
a boy, a poor hand at figures.  Was it necessary for him
when on duty always to remain in that channel of damp air, and
could he never rise into the sunshine from between those high
stone walls?  Why, that depended upon times and
circumstances.  Under some conditions there would be less
upon the Line than under others, and the same held good as to
certain hours of the day and night.  In bright weather, he
did choose occasions for getting a little above these lower
shadows; but, being at all times liable to be called by his
electric bell, and at such times listening for it with redoubled
anxiety, the relief was less than I would suppose.

He took me into his box, where there was a fire, a desk for an
official book in which he had to make certain entries, a
telegraphic instrument with its dial, face, and needles, and the
little bell of which he had spoken.  On my trusting that he
would excuse the remark that he had been well educated, and (I
hoped I might say without offence) perhaps educated above that
station, he observed that instances of slight incongruity in such
wise would rarely be found wanting among large bodies of men;
that he had heard it was so in workhouses, in the police force,
even in that last desperate resource, the army; and that he knew
it was so, more or less, in any great railway staff.  He had
been, when young (if I could believe it, sitting in that
hut,—he scarcely could), a student of natural philosophy,
and had attended lectures; but he had run wild, misused his
opportunities, gone down, and never risen again.  He had no
complaint to offer about that.  He had made his bed, and he
lay upon it.  It was far too late to make another.

All that I have here condensed he said in a quiet manner, with
his grave, dark regards divided between me and the fire.  He
threw in the word, “Sir,” from time to time, and
especially when he referred p. 315to his youth,—as though to
request me to understand that he claimed to be nothing but what I
found him.  He was several times interrupted by the little
bell, and had to read off messages, and send replies.  Once
he had to stand without the door, and display a flag as a train
passed, and make some verbal communication to the driver. 
In the discharge of his duties, I observed him to be remarkably
exact and vigilant, breaking off his discourse at a syllable, and
remaining silent until what he had to do was done.

In a word, I should have set this man down as one of the
safest of men to be employed in that capacity, but for the
circumstance that while he was speaking to me he twice broke off
with a fallen colour, turned his face towards the little bell
when it did NOT ring, opened the
door of the hut (which was kept shut to exclude the unhealthy
damp), and looked out towards the red light near the mouth of the
tunnel.  On both of those occasions, he came back to the
fire with the inexplicable air upon him which I had remarked,
without being able to define, when we were so far asunder.

“I believe I used to be so,” he rejoined, in the
low voice in which he had first spoken; “but I am troubled,
sir, I am troubled.”

He would have recalled the words if he could.  He had
said them, however, and I took them up quickly.

“It is very difficult to impart, sir.  It is very,
very difficult to speak of.  If ever you make me another
visit, I will try to tell you.”

He thanked me, and went out at the door with me. 
“I’ll show my white light, sir,” he said, in
his peculiar low voice, “till you have found the way
up.  When you have found it, don’t call out!  And
when you are at the top, don’t call out!”

“And when you come down to-morrow night, don’t
call out!  Let me ask you a parting question.  What
made you cry, ‘Halloa!  Below there!’
to-night?”

He wished me good-night, and held up his light.  I walked
by the side of the down Line of rails (with a very disagreeable
sensation of a train coming behind me) until I found the
path.  It was easier to mount than to descend, and I got
back to my inn without any adventure.

Punctual to my appointment, I placed my foot on the first
notch of the zigzag next night, as the distant clocks were
striking eleven.  He was waiting for me at the bottom, with
his white light on.  “I have not called out,” I
said, when we came close together; “may I speak
now?”  “By all means, sir.” 
“Good-night, then, and here’s my hand.” 
“Good-night, sir, and here’s mine.”  With
that we walked side by side to his box, entered it, closed the
door, and sat down by the fire.

“I have made up my mind, sir,” he began, bending
forward as soon as we were seated, and speaking in a tone but a
little above a whisper, “that you shall not have to ask me
twice what troubles me.  I took you for some one else
yesterday evening.  That troubles me.”

“I don’t know.  I never saw the face. 
The left arm is across the face, and the right arm is
waved,—violently waved.  This way.”

I followed his action with my eyes, and it was the action of
an arm gesticulating, with the utmost passion and vehemence,
“For God’s sake, clear the way!”

“One moonlight night,” said the man, “I was
sitting here, when I heard a voice cry, ‘Halloa! 
Below there!’  I started up, looked from that door,
and saw this Some one else standing by the red light near the
tunnel, waving as I just now showed you.  The voice seemed
hoarse with shouting, and it cried, ‘Look out!  Look
out!’  And then again, ‘Halloa!  Below
there!  Look out!’  I caught up my lamp, turned
it on red, and ran towards the figure, calling,
‘What’s wrong?  What has happened? 
Where?’  It stood just outside the blackness of the
tunnel.  I advanced so close upon it that I wondered at its
keeping the sleeve across its eyes.  I ran right up at it,
and had my hand stretched out to pull the sleeve away, when it
was gone.”

“No.  I ran on into the tunnel, five hundred
yards.  I stopped, and held my lamp above my head, and saw
the figures of the measured distance, and saw the wet stains
stealing down the walls and trickling p. 317through the arch.  I ran out
again faster than I had run in (for I had a mortal abhorrence of
the place upon me), and I looked all round the red light with my
own red light, and I went up the iron ladder to the gallery atop
of it, and I came down again, and ran back here.  I
telegraphed both ways, ‘An alarm has been given.  Is
anything wrong?’  The answer came back, both ways,
‘All well.’”

Resisting the slow touch of a frozen finger tracing out my
spine, I showed him how that this figure must be a deception of
his sense of sight; and how that figures, originating in disease
of the delicate nerves that minister to the functions of the eye,
were known to have often troubled patients, some of whom had
become conscious of the nature of their affliction, and had even
proved it by experiments upon themselves.  “As to an
imaginary cry,” said I, “do but listen for a moment
to the wind in this unnatural valley while we speak so low, and
to the wild harp it makes of the telegraph wires.”

That was all very well, he returned, after we had sat
listening for a while, and he ought to know something of the wind
and the wires,—he who so often passed long winter nights
there, alone and watching.  But he would beg to remark that
he had not finished.

“Within six hours after the Appearance, the memorable
accident on this Line happened, and within ten hours the dead and
wounded were brought along through the tunnel over the spot where
the figure had stood.”

A disagreeable shudder crept over me, but I did my best
against it.  It was not to be denied, I rejoined, that this
was a remarkable coincidence, calculated deeply to impress his
mind.  But it was unquestionable that remarkable
coincidences did continually occur, and they must be taken into
account in dealing with such a subject.  Though to be sure I
must admit, I added (for I thought I saw that he was going to
bring the objection to bear upon me), men of common sense did not
allow much for coincidences in making the ordinary calculations
of life.

“This,” he said, again laying his hand upon my
arm, and glancing over his shoulder with hollow eyes, “was
just a year ago.  Six or seven months passed, and I had
recovered from the surprise and shock, when one morning, as the
day was breaking, I, standing at the door, looked towards the red
light, and saw the spectre again.”  He stopped, with a
fixed look at me.

p. 318Once
more I followed his action with my eyes.  It was an action
of mourning.  I have seen such an attitude in stone figures
on tombs.

“I came in and sat down, partly to collect my thoughts,
partly because it had turned me faint.  When I went to the
door again, daylight was above me, and the ghost was
gone.”

“That very day, as a train came out of the tunnel, I
noticed, at a carriage window on my side, what looked like a
confusion of hands and heads, and something waved.  I saw it
just in time to signal the driver, Stop!  He shut off, and
put his brake on, but the train drifted past here a hundred and
fifty yards or more.  I ran after it, and, as I went along,
heard terrible screams and cries.  A beautiful young lady
had died instantaneously in one of the compartments, and was
brought in here, and laid down on this floor between
us.”

I could think of nothing to say, to any purpose, and my mouth
was very dry.  The wind and the wires took up the story with
a long lamenting wail.

He resumed.  “Now, sir, mark this, and judge how my
mind is troubled.  The spectre came back a week ago. 
Ever since, it has been there, now and again, by fits and
starts.”

He repeated, if possible with increased passion and vehemence,
that former gesticulation of, “For God’s sake, clear
the way!”

Then he went on.  “I have no peace or rest for
it.  It calls to me, for many minutes together, in an
agonised manner, ‘Below there!  Look out!  Look
out!’  It stands waving to me.  It rings my
little bell—”

I caught at that.  “Did it ring your bell yesterday
evening when I was here, and you went to the door?”

“Why, see,” said I, “how your imagination
misleads you.  My eyes were on the bell, and my ears were
open to the bell, and if I am a living man, it did NOT ring at those times.  No, nor at
any other time, except when it was rung in the natural course of
physical things by the station communicating with you.”

He shook his head. “I have never made a mistake as to
that yet, sir.  I have never confused the spectre’s
ring with the man’s.  The ghost’s ring is a
strange vibration in the bell that it derives from p. 319nothing
else, and I have not asserted that the bell stirs to the
eye.  I don’t wonder that you failed to hear it. 
But I heard it.”

He bit his under lip as though he were somewhat unwilling, but
arose.  I opened the door, and stood on the step, while he
stood in the doorway.  There was the Danger-light. 
There was the dismal mouth of the tunnel.  There were the
high, wet stone walls of the cutting.  There were the stars
above them.

“Do you see it?” I asked him, taking particular
note of his face.  His eyes were prominent and strained, but
not very much more so, perhaps, than my own had been when I had
directed them earnestly towards the same spot.

We went in again, shut the door, and resumed our seats. 
I was thinking how best to improve this advantage, if it might be
called one, when he took up the conversation in such a
matter-of-course way, so assuming that there could be no serious
question of fact between us, that I felt myself placed in the
weakest of positions.

“By this time you will fully understand, sir,” he
said, “that what troubles me so dreadfully is the question,
What does the spectre mean?”

“What is its warning against?” he said,
ruminating, with his eyes on the fire, and only by times turning
them on me.  “What is the danger?  Where is the
danger?  There is danger overhanging somewhere on the
Line.  Some dreadful calamity will happen.  It is not
to be doubted this third time, after what has gone before. 
But surely this is a cruel haunting of me.  What can I
do?”

“If I telegraph Danger, on either side of me, or on
both, I can give no reason for it,” he went on, wiping the
palms of his hands.  “I should get into trouble, and
do no good.  They would think I was mad.  This is the
way it would work,—Message: ‘Danger!  Take
care!’  Answer: ‘What Danger? 
Where?’  Message: ‘Don’t know.  But,
for God’s sake, take care!’  They would displace
me.  What else could they do?”

His pain of mind was most pitiable to see.  It was the
mental torture of a conscientious man, oppressed beyond endurance
by an unintelligible responsibility involving life.

“When it first stood under the Danger-light,” he
went on, putting his dark hair back from his head, and drawing
his hands outward p.
320across and across his temples in an extremity of
feverish distress, “why not tell me where that accident was
to happen,—if it must happen?  Why not tell me how it
could be averted,—if it could have been averted?  When
on its second coming it hid its face, why not tell me, instead,
‘She is going to die.  Let them keep her at
home’?  If it came, on those two occasions, only to
show me that its warnings were true, and so to prepare me for the
third, why not warn me plainly now?  And I, Lord help
me!  A mere poor signal-man on this solitary station! 
Why not go to somebody with credit to be believed, and power to
act?”

When I saw him in this state, I saw that for the poor
man’s sake, as well as for the public safety, what I had to
do for the time was to compose his mind.  Therefore, setting
aside all question of reality or unreality between us, I
represented to him that whoever thoroughly discharged his duty
must do well, and that at least it was his comfort that he
understood his duty, though he did not understand these
confounding Appearances.  In this effort I succeeded far
better than in the attempt to reason him out of his
conviction.  He became calm; the occupations incidental to
his post as the night advanced began to make larger demands on
his attention: and I left him at two in the morning.  I had
offered to stay through the night, but he would not hear of
it.

That I more than once looked back at the red light as I
ascended the pathway, that I did not like the red light, and that
I should have slept but poorly if my bed had been under it, I see
no reason to conceal.  Nor did I like the two sequences of
the accident and the dead girl.  I see no reason to conceal
that either.

But what ran most in my thoughts was the consideration how
ought I to act, having become the recipient of this
disclosure?  I had proved the man to be intelligent,
vigilant, painstaking, and exact; but how long might he remain
so, in his state of mind?  Though in a subordinate position,
still he held a most important trust, and would I (for instance)
like to stake my own life on the chances of his continuing to
execute it with precision?

Unable to overcome a feeling that there would be something
treacherous in my communicating what he had told me to his
superiors in the Company, without first being plain with himself
and proposing a middle course to him, I ultimately resolved to
offer to accompany him (otherwise keeping his secret for the
present) to the wisest medical practitioner we could hear of in
those parts, and to take his opinion.  A change in his time
of duty would come round next night, he had apprised me, and he
would be off an hour or two after sunrise, and on again soon
after sunset.  I had appointed to return accordingly.

Next evening was a lovely evening, and I walked out early to
enjoy it.  The sun was not yet quite down when I traversed
the field-path near the top of the deep cutting.  I would
extend my walk for an p. 321hour, I said to myself, half an hour
on and half an hour back, and it would then be time to go to my
signal-man’s box.

Before pursuing my stroll, I stepped to the brink, and
mechanically looked down, from the point from which I had first
seen him.  I cannot describe the thrill that seized upon me,
when, close at the mouth of the tunnel, I saw the appearance of a
man, with his left sleeve across his eyes, passionately waving
his right arm.

The nameless horror that oppressed me passed in a moment, for
in a moment I saw that this appearance of a man was a man indeed,
and that there was a little group of other men, standing at a
short distance, to whom he seemed to be rehearsing the gesture he
made.  The Danger-light was not yet lighted.  Against
its shaft, a little low hut, entirely new to me, had been made of
some wooden supports and tarpaulin.  It looked no bigger
than a bed.

With an irresistible sense that something was
wrong,—with a flashing self-reproachful fear that fatal
mischief had come of my leaving the man there, and causing no one
to be sent to overlook or correct what he did,—I descended
the notched path with all the speed I could make.

“You will recognise him, sir, if you knew him,”
said the man who spoke for the others, solemnly uncovering his
own head, and raising an end of the tarpaulin, “for his
face is quite composed.”

“O, how did this happen, how did this happen?” I
asked, turning from one to another as the hut closed in
again.

“He was cut down by an engine, sir.  No man in
England knew his work better.  But somehow he was not clear
of the outer rail.  It was just at broad day.  He had
struck the light, and had the lamp in his hand.  As the
engine came out of the tunnel, his back was towards her, and she
cut him down.  That man drove her, and was showing how it
happened.  Show the gentleman, Tom.”

“Coming round the curve in the tunnel, sir,” he
said, “I saw him at the end, like as if I saw him down a
perspective-glass.  There was no time to check speed, and I
knew him to be very careful.  As he didn’t seem to
take heed of the whistle, I shut it off when we were running down
upon him, and called to him as loud as I could call.”

“Ah! it was a dreadful time, sir.  I never left off
calling to him.  p. 322I put this arm before my eyes not to
see, and I waved this arm to the last; but it was no
use.”

Without prolonging the narrative to dwell on any one of its
curious circumstances more than on any other, I may, in closing
it, point out the coincidence that the warning of the
Engine-Driver included, not only the words which the unfortunate
