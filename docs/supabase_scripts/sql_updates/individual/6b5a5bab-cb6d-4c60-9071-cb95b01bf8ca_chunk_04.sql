      peaceful and silent protest, the only one, he said, which was suitable to
      a priest, who was a man of mildness, and not of blood; and every one, for
      twenty-five miles round, praised Abbe Chantavoine''s firmness and heroism
      in venturing to proclaim the public mourning by the obstinate silence of
      his church bells.

The whole village, enthusiastic at his resistance, was ready to back up
      their pastor and to risk anything, for they looked upon that silent
      protest as the safeguard of the national honor. It seemed to the peasants
      that thus they deserved better of their country than Belfort and
      Strassburg, that they had set an equally valuable example, and that the
      name of their little village would become immortalized by that; but, with
      that exception, they refused their Prussian conquerors nothing.

The commandant and his officers laughed among themselves at this
      inoffensive courage, and as the people in the whole country round showed
      themselves obliging and compliant toward them, they willingly tolerated
      their silent patriotism. Little Baron Wilhelm alone would have liked to
      have forced them to ring the bells. He was very angry at his superior''s
      politic compliance with the priest''s scruples, and every day begged the
      commandant to allow him to sound “ding-dong, ding-dong,” just
      once, only just once, just by way of a joke. And he asked it in the
      coaxing, tender voice of some loved woman who is bent on obtaining her
      wish, but the commandant would not yield, and to console himself,
      Mademoiselle Fifi made a mine in the Chateau d''Uville.

The five men stood there together for five minutes, breathing in the moist
      air, and at last Lieutenant Fritz said with a laugh: “The ladies
      will certainly not have fine weather for their drive.” Then they
      separated, each to his duty, while the captain had plenty to do in
      arranging for the dinner.

When they met again toward evening they began to laugh at seeing each
      other as spick and span and smart as on the day of a grand review. The
      commandant''s hair did not look so gray as it was in the morning, and the
      captain had shaved, leaving only his mustache, which made him look as if
      he had a streak of fire under his nose.

In spite of the rain, they left the window open, and one of them went to
      listen from time to time; and at a quarter past six the baron said he
      heard a rumbling in the distance. They all rushed down, and presently the
      wagon drove up at a gallop with its four horses steaming and blowing, and
      splashed with mud to their girths. Five women dismounted, five handsome
      girls whom a comrade of the captain, to whom Le Devoir had presented his
      card, had selected with care.

They had not required much pressing, as they had got to know the Prussians
      in the three months during which they had had to do with them, and so they
      resigned themselves to the men as they did to the state of affairs.

They went at once into the dining-room, which looked still more dismal in
      its dilapidated condition when it was lighted up; while the table covered
      with choice dishes, the beautiful china and glass, and the plate, which
      had been found in the hole in the wall where its owner had hidden it, gave
      it the appearance of a bandits'' inn, where they were supping after
      committing a robbery in the place. The captain was radiant, and put his
      arm round the women as if he were familiar with them; and when the three
      young men wanted to appropriate one each, he opposed them authoritatively,
      reserving to himself the right to apportion them justly, according to
      their several ranks, so as not to offend the higher powers. Therefore, to
      avoid all discussion, jarring, and suspicion of partiality, he placed them
      all in a row according to height, and addressing the tallest, he said in a
      voice of command:

“What is your name?” “Pamela,” she replied,
      raising her voice. And then he said: “Number One, called Pamela, is
      adjudged to the commandant.” Then, having kissed Blondina, the
      second, as a sign of proprietorship, he proffered stout Amanda to
      Lieutenant Otto; Eva, “the Tomato,” to Sub-lieutenant Fritz,
      and Rachel, the shortest of them all, a very young, dark girl, with eyes
      as black as ink, a Jewess, whose snub nose proved the rule which allots
      hooked noses to all her race, to the youngest officer, frail Count Wilhelm
      d''Eyrick.

They were all pretty and plump, without any distinctive features, and all
      had a similarity of complexion and figure.

The three young men wished to carry off their prizes immediately, under
      the pretext that they might wish to freshen their toilets; but the captain
      wisely opposed this, for he said they were quite fit to sit down to
      dinner, and his experience in such matters carried the day. There were
      only many kisses, expectant kisses.

Suddenly Rachel choked, and began to cough until the tears came into her
      eyes, while smoke came through her nostrils. Under pretence of kissing
      her, the count had blown a whiff of tobacco into her mouth. She did not
      fly into a rage and did not say a word, but she looked at her tormentor
      with latent hatred in her dark eyes.

They sat down to dinner. The commandant seemed delighted; he made Pamela
      sit on his right, and Blondina on his left, and said, as he unfolded his
      table napkin: “That was a delightful idea of yours, captain.”

Lieutenants Otto and Fritz, who were as polite as if they had been with
      fashionable ladies, rather intimidated their guests, but Baron von
      Kelweinstein beamed, made obscene remarks and seemed on fire with his
      crown of red hair. He paid the women compliments in French of the Rhine,
      and sputtered out gallant remarks, only fit for a low pothouse, from
      between his two broken teeth.

They did not understand him, however, and their intelligence did not seem
      to be awakened until he uttered foul words and broad expressions, which
      were mangled by his accent. Then they all began to laugh at once like
      crazy women and fell against each other, repeating the words, which the
      baron then began to say all wrong, in order that he might have the
      pleasure of hearing them say dirty things. They gave him as much of that
      stuff as he wanted, for they were drunk after the first bottle of wine,
      and resuming their usual habits and manners, they kissed the officers to
      right and left of them, pinched their arms, uttered wild cries, drank out
      of every glass and sang French couplets and bits of German songs which
      they had picked up in their daily intercourse with the enemy.

Soon the men themselves became very unrestrained, shouted and broke the
      plates and dishes, while the soldiers behind them waited on them stolidly.
      The commandant was the only one who kept any restraint upon himself.

Mademoiselle Fifi had taken Rachel on his knee, and, getting excited, at
      one moment he kissed the little black curls on her neck and at another he
      pinched her furiously and made her scream, for he was seized by a species
      of ferocity, and tormented by his desire to hurt her. He often held her
      close to him and pressed a long kiss on the Jewess'' rosy mouth until she
      lost her breath, and at last he bit her until a stream of blood ran down
      her chin and on to her bodice.

For the second time she looked him full in the face, and as she bathed the
      wound, she said: “You will have to pay for, that!” But he
      merely laughed a hard laugh and said: “I will pay.”

At dessert champagne was served, and the commandant rose, and in the same
      voice in which he would have drunk to the health of the Empress Augusta,
      he drank: “To our ladies!” And a series of toasts began,
      toasts worthy of the lowest soldiers and of drunkards, mingled with
      obscene jokes, which were made still more brutal by their ignorance of the
      language. They got up, one after the other, trying to say something witty,
      forcing themselves to be funny, and the women, who were so drunk that they
      almost fell off their chairs, with vacant looks and clammy tongues
      applauded madly each time.

The captain, who no doubt wished to impart an appearance of gallantry to
      the orgy, raised his glass again and said: “To our victories over
      hearts.” and, thereupon Lieutenant Otto, who was a species of bear
      from the Black Forest, jumped up, inflamed and saturated with drink, and
      suddenly seized by an access of alcoholic patriotism, he cried: “To
      our victories over France!”

Drunk as they were, the women were silent, but Rachel turned round,
      trembling, and said: “See here, I know some Frenchmen in whose
      presence you would not dare say that.” But the little count, still
      holding her on his knee, began to laugh, for the wine had made him very
      merry, and said: “Ha! ha! ha! I have never met any of them myself.
      As soon as we show ourselves, they run away!” The girl, who was in a
      terrible rage, shouted into his face: “You are lying, you dirty
      scoundrel!”

For a moment he looked at her steadily with his bright eyes upon her, as
      he had looked at the portrait before he destroyed it with bullets from his
      revolver, and then he began to laugh: “Ah! yes, talk about them, my
      dear! Should we be here now if they were brave?” And, getting
      excited, he exclaimed: “We are the masters! France belongs to us!”
      She made one spring from his knee and threw herself into her chair, while
      he arose, held out his glass over the table and repeated: “France
      and the French, the woods, the fields and the houses of France belong to
      us!”

The others, who were quite drunk, and who were suddenly seized by military
      enthusiasm, the enthusiasm of brutes, seized their glasses, and shouting,
      “Long live Prussia!” they emptied them at a draught.

The girls did not protest, for they were reduced to silence and were
      afraid. Even Rachel did not say a word, as she had no reply to make. Then
      the little marquis put his champagne glass, which had just been refilled,
      on the head of the Jewess and exclaimed: “All the women in France
      belong to us also!”

At that she got up so quickly that the glass upset, spilling the
      amber-colored wine on her black hair as if to baptize her, and broke into
      a hundred fragments, as it fell to the floor. Her lips trembling, she
      defied the looks of the officer, who was still laughing, and stammered out
      in a voice choked with rage:

He sat down again so as to laugh at his ease; and, trying to speak with
      the Parisian accent, he said: “She is good, very good! Then why did
      you come here, my dear?” She was thunderstruck and made no reply for
      a moment, for in her agitation she did not understand him at first, but as
      soon as she grasped his meaning she said to him indignantly and
      vehemently: “I! I! I am not a woman, I am only a strumpet, and that
      is all that Prussians want.”

Almost before she had finished he slapped her full in the face; but as he
      was raising his hand again, as if to strike her, she seized a small
      dessert knife with a silver blade from the table and, almost mad with
      rage, stabbed him right in the hollow of his neck. Something that he was
      going to say was cut short in his throat, and he sat there with his mouth
      half open and a terrible look in his eyes.

All the officers shouted in horror and leaped up tumultuously; but,
      throwing her chair between the legs of Lieutenant Otto, who fell down at
      full length, she ran to the window, opened it before they could seize her
      and jumped out into the night and the pouring rain.

In two minutes Mademoiselle Fifi was dead, and Fritz and Otto drew their
      swords and wanted to kill the women, who threw themselves at their feet
      and clung to their knees. With some difficulty the major stopped the
      slaughter and had the four terrified girls locked up in a room under the
      care of two soldiers, and then he organized the pursuit of the fugitive as
      carefully as if he were about to engage in a skirmish, feeling quite sure
      that she would be caught.

The table, which had been cleared immediately, now served as a bed on
      which to lay out the lieutenant, and the four officers stood at the
      windows, rigid and sobered with the stern faces of soldiers on duty, and
      tried to pierce through the darkness of the night amid the steady torrent
      of rain. Suddenly a shot was heard and then another, a long way off; and
      for four hours they heard from time to time near or distant reports and
      rallying cries, strange words of challenge, uttered in guttural voices.

In the morning they all returned. Two soldiers had been killed and three
      others wounded by their comrades in the ardor of that chase and in the
      confusion of that nocturnal pursuit, but they had not caught Rachel.

Then the inhabitants of the district were terrorized, the houses were
      turned topsy-turvy, the country was scoured and beaten up, over and over
      again, but the Jewess did not seem to have left a single trace of her
      passage behind her.

When the general was told of it he gave orders to hush up the affair, so
      as not to set a bad example to the army, but he severely censured the
      commandant, who in turn punished his inferiors. The general had said:
      “One does not go to war in order to amuse one''s self and to caress
      prostitutes.” Graf von Farlsberg, in his exasperation, made up his
      mind to have his revenge on the district, but as he required a pretext for
      showing severity, he sent for the priest and ordered him to have the bell
      tolled at the funeral of Baron von Eyrick.

Contrary to all expectation, the priest showed himself humble and most
      respectful, and when Mademoiselle Fifi''s body left the Chateau d''Uville on
      its way to the cemetery, carried by soldiers, preceded, surrounded and
      followed by soldiers who marched with loaded rifles, for the first time
      the bell sounded its funeral knell in a lively manner, as if a friendly
      hand were caressing it. At night it rang again, and the next day, and
      every day; it rang as much as any one could desire. Sometimes even it
      would start at night and sound gently through the darkness, seized with a
      strange joy, awakened one could not tell why. All the peasants in the
      neighborhood declared that it was bewitched, and nobody except the priest
      and the sacristan would now go near the church tower. And they went
      because a poor girl was living there in grief and solitude and provided
      for secretly by those two men.

She remained there until the German troops departed, and then one evening
      the priest borrowed the baker''s cart and himself drove his prisoner to
      Rouen. When they got there he embraced her, and she quickly went back on
      foot to the establishment from which she had come, where the proprietress,
      who thought that she was dead, was very glad to see her.

A short time afterward a patriot who had no prejudices, and who liked her
      because of her bold deed, and who afterward loved her for herself, married
      her and made her a lady quite as good as many others.

The war was over. The Germans occupied France. The whole country was
      pulsating like a conquered wrestler beneath the knee of his victorious
      opponent.

The first trains from Paris, distracted, starving, despairing Paris, were
      making their way to the new frontiers, slowly passing through the country
      districts and the villages. The passengers gazed through the windows at
      the ravaged fields and burned hamlets. Prussian soldiers, in their black
      helmets with brass spikes, were smoking their pipes astride their chairs
      in front of the houses which were still left standing. Others were working
      or talking just as if they were members of the families. As you passed
      through the different towns you saw entire regiments drilling in the
      squares, and, in spite of the rumble of the carriage-wheels, you could
      every moment hear the hoarse words of command.

M. Dubuis, who during the entire siege had served as one of the National
      Guard in Paris, was going to join his wife and daughter, whom he had
      prudently sent away to Switzerland before the invasion.

Famine and hardship had not diminished his big paunch so characteristic of
      the rich, peace-loving merchant. He had gone through the terrible events
      of the past year with sorrowful resignation and bitter complaints at the
      savagery of men. Now that he was journeying to the frontier at the close
      of the war, he saw the Prussians for the first time, although he had done
      his duty on the ramparts and mounted guard on many a cold night.

He stared with mingled fear and anger at those bearded armed men,
      installed all over French soil as if they were at home, and he felt in his
      soul a kind of fever of impotent patriotism, at the same time also the
      great need of that new instinct of prudence which since then has, never
      left us. In the same railway carriage were two Englishmen, who had come to
      the country as sightseers and were gazing about them with looks of quiet
      curiosity. They were both also stout, and kept chatting in their own
      language, sometimes referring to their guidebook, and reading aloud the
      names of the places indicated.

Suddenly the train stopped at a little village station, and a Prussian
      officer jumped up with a great clatter of his sabre on the double
      footboard of the railway carriage. He was tall, wore a tight-fitting
      uniform, and had whiskers up to his eyes. His red hair seemed to be on
      fire, and his long mustache, of a paler hue, stuck out on both sides of
      his face, which it seemed to cut in two.

The Englishmen at once began staring at him, with smiles of newly awakened
      interest, while M. Dubuis made a show of reading a newspaper. He sat
      concealed in his corner like a thief in presence of a gendarme.

The train started again. The Englishmen went on chatting and looking out
      for the exact scene of different battles; and all of a sudden, as one of
      them stretched out his arm toward the horizon as he pointed out a village,
      the Prussian officer remarked in French, extending his long legs and
      lolling backward:

The train rolled on, still passing through hamlets occupied by the
      victorious army. German soldiers could be seen along the roads, on the
      edges of fields, standing in front of gates or chatting outside cafes.
      They covered the soil like African locusts.

“If I had been in command, I''d have taken Paris, burned everything,
      killed everybody. No more France!”

“In twenty years all Europe, all of it, will belong to us. Prussia
      is more than a match for all of them.”

The Englishmen, getting uneasy, no longer replied. Their faces, which had
      become impassive, seemed made of wax behind their long whiskers. Then the
      Prussian officer began to laugh. And still, lolling back, he began to
      sneer. He sneered at the downfall of France, insulted the prostrate enemy;
      he sneered at Austria, which had been recently conquered; he sneered at
      the valiant but fruitless defence of the departments; he sneered at the
      Garde Mobile and at the useless artillery. He announced that Bismarck was
      going to build a city of iron with the captured cannon. And suddenly he
      placed his boots against the thigh of M. Dubuis, who turned away his eyes,
      reddening to the roots of his hair.

The Englishmen seemed to have become indifferent to all that was going on,
      as if they were suddenly shut up in their own island, far from the din of
      the world.

The train whistled, and slackened its pace. They passed a station that had
      been burned down; and then they stopped altogether.

A Prussian detachment occupied the station. Other soldiers were standing
      behind wooden gratings, looking on. The engine was getting up steam before
      starting off again. Then M. Dubuis hurriedly jumped on the platform, and,
      in spite of the warnings of the station master, dashed into the adjoining
      compartment.

He was alone! He tore open his waistcoat, his heart was beating so
      rapidly, and, gasping for breath, he wiped the perspiration from his
      forehead.

The train drew up at another station. And suddenly the officer appeared at
      the carriage door and jumped in, followed close behind by the two
      Englishmen, who were impelled by curiosity. The German sat facing the
      Frenchman, and, laughing still, said:

The German had already pulled out a few hairs, and was still tugging at
      the mustache, when M. Dubuis, with a back stroke of his hand, flung aside
      the officer''s arm, and, seizing him by the collar, threw him down on the
      seat. Then, excited to a pitch of fury, his temples swollen and his eyes
      glaring, he kept throttling the officer with one hand, while with the
      other clenched he began to strike him violent blows in the face. The
      Prussian struggled, tried to draw his sword, to clinch with his adversary,
      who was on top of him. But M. Dubuis crushed him with his enormous weight
      and kept punching him without taking breath or knowing where his blows
      fell. Blood flowed down the face of the German, who, choking and with a
      rattling in his throat, spat out his broken teeth and vainly strove to
      shake off this infuriated man who was killing him.

The Englishmen had got on their feet and came closer in order to see
      better. They remained standing, full of mirth and curiosity, ready to bet
      for, or against, either combatant.

Suddenly M. Dubuis, exhausted by his violent efforts, rose and resumed his
      seat without uttering a word.

The Prussian did not attack him, for the savage assault had terrified and
      astonished the officer as well as causing him suffering. When he was able
      to breathe freely, he said:

“Here is the town of Strasbourg. I''ll get two officers to be my
      seconds, and there will be time before the train leaves the station.”

In a minute the Prussian had found two comrades, who brought pistols, and
      they made their way toward the ramparts.

The Englishmen were continually looking at their watches, shuffling their
      feet and hurrying on with the preparations, uneasy lest they should be too
      late for the train.

While he was answering, “Yes, monsieur,” he noticed that one
      of the Englishmen had opened his umbrella in order to keep off the rays of
      the sun.

M. Dubuis fired at random without delay, and he was amazed to see the
      Prussian opposite him stagger, lift up his arms and fall forward, dead. He
      had killed the officer.

One of the Englishmen exclaimed: “Ah!” He was quivering with
      delight, with satisfied curiosity and joyous impatience. The other, who
      still kept his watch in his hand, seized M. Dubuis'' arm and hurried him in
      double-quick time toward the station, his fellow-countryman marking time
      as he ran beside them, with closed fists, his elbows at his sides, “One,
      two; one, two!”

And all three, running abreast rapidly, made their way to the station like
      three grotesque figures in a comic newspaper.

The train was on the point of starting. They sprang into their carriage.
      Then the Englishmen, taking off their travelling caps, waved them three
      times over their heads, exclaiming:

And gravely, one after the other, they extended their right hands to M.
      Dubuis and then went back and sat down in their own corner.

“Upon my word,” said Colonel Laporte, “although I am old
      and gouty, my legs as stiff as two pieces of wood, yet if a pretty woman
      were to tell me to go through the eye of a needle, I believe I should take
      a jump at it, like a clown through a hoop. I shall die like that; it is in
      the blood. I am an old beau, one of the old school, and the sight of a
      woman, a pretty woman, stirs me to the tips of my toes. There!

“We are all very much alike in France in this respect; we still
      remain knights, knights of love and fortune, since God has been abolished
      whose bodyguard we really were. But nobody can ever get woman out of our
      hearts; there she is, and there she will remain, and we love her, and
      shall continue to love her, and go on committing all kinds of follies on
      her account as long as there is a France on the map of Europe; and even if
      France were to be wiped off the map, there would always be Frenchmen left.

“When I am in the presence of a woman, of a pretty woman, I feel
      capable of anything. By Jove! when I feel her looks penetrating me, her
      confounded looks which set your blood on fire, I should like to do I don''t
      know what; to fight a duel, to have a row, to smash the furniture, in
      order to show that I am the strongest, the bravest, the most daring and
      the most devoted of men.

“But I am not the only one, certainly not; the whole French army is
      like me, I swear to you. From the common soldier to the general, we all
      start out, from the van to the rear guard, when there is a woman in the
      case, a pretty woman. Do you remember what Joan of Arc made us do
      formerly? Come. I will make a bet that if a pretty woman had taken command
      of the army on the eve of Sedan, when Marshal MacMahon was wounded, we
      should have broken through the Prussian lines, by Jove! and had a drink
      out of their guns.

“It was not a Trochu, but a Sainte-Genevieve, who was needed in
      Paris; and I remember a little anecdote of the war which proves that we
      are capable of everything in presence of a woman.

“I was a captain, a simple captain, at the time, and I was in
      command of a detachment of scouts, who were retreating through a district
      which swarmed with Prussians. We were surrounded, pursued, tired out and
      half dead with fatigue and hunger, but we were bound to reach Bar-sur-Tain
      before the morrow, otherwise we should be shot, cut down, massacred. I do
      not know how we managed to escape so far. However, we had ten leagues to
      go during the night, ten leagues through the night, ten leagues through
      the snow, and with empty stomachs, and I thought to myself:

“We had eaten nothing since the day before, and the whole day long
      we remained hidden in a barn, huddled close together, so as not to feel
      the cold so much, unable to speak or even move, and sleeping by fits and
      starts, as one does when worn out with fatigue.

“It was dark by five o''clock, that wan darkness of the snow, and I
      shook my men. Some of them would not get up; they were almost incapable of
      moving or of standing upright; their joints were stiff from cold and
      hunger.

“Before us there was a large expanse of flat, bare country; the snow
      was still falling like a curtain, in large, white flakes, which concealed
      everything under a thick, frozen coverlet, a coverlet of frozen wool One
      might have thought that it was the end of the world.

“They looked at the thick white flakes that were coming down, and
      they seemed to think: ''We have had enough of this; we may just as well die
      here!'' Then I took out my revolver and said:

“''I will shoot the first man who flinches.'' And so they set off, but
      very slowly, like men whose legs were of very little use to them, and I
      sent four of them three hundred yards ahead to scout, and the others
      followed pell-mell, walking at random and without any order. I put the
      strongest in the rear, with orders to quicken the pace of the sluggards
      with the points of their bayonets in the back.

“The snow seemed as if it were going to bury us alive; it powdered
      our kepis and cloaks without melting, and made phantoms of us, a kind of
      spectres of dead, weary soldiers. I said to myself: ''We shall never get
      out of this except by a miracle.''

“Sometimes we had to stop for a few minutes, on account of those who
      could not follow us, and then we heard nothing except the falling snow,
      that vague, almost undiscernible sound made by the falling flakes. Some of
      the men shook themselves, others did not move, and so I gave the order to
      set off again. They shouldered their rifles, and with weary feet we
      resumed our march, when suddenly the scouts fell back. Something had
      alarmed them; they had heard voices in front of them. I sent forward six
      men and a sergeant and waited.

“All at once a shrill cry, a woman''s cry, pierced through the heavy
      silence of the snow, and in a few minutes they brought back two prisoners,
      an old man and a girl, whom I questioned in a low voice. They were
      escaping from the Prussians, who had occupied their house during the
      evening and had got drunk. The father was alarmed on his daughter''s
      account, and, without even telling their servants, they had made their
      escape in the darkness. I saw immediately that they belonged to the better
      class. I invited them to accompany us, and we started off again, the old
      man who knew the road acting as our guide.

“It had ceased snowing, the stars appeared and the cold became
      intense. The girl, who was leaning on her father''s arm, walked unsteadily
      as though in pain, and several times she murmured:

“''I have no feeling at all in my feet''; and I suffered more than she
      did to see that poor little woman dragging herself like that through the
      snow. But suddenly she stopped and said:

“The old man wanted to carry her, but he could not even lift her up,
      and she sank to the ground with a deep sigh. We all gathered round her,
      and, as for me, I stamped my foot in perplexity, not knowing what to do,
      and being unwilling to abandon that man and girl like that, when suddenly
      one of the soldiers, a Parisian whom they had nicknamed Pratique, said:

“''Come, comrades, we must carry the young lady, otherwise we shall
      not show ourselves Frenchmen, confound it!''

“I really believe that I swore with pleasure. ''That is very good of
      you, my children,'' I said; ''and I will take my share of the burden.''

“We could indistinctly see, through the darkness, the trees of a
      little wood on the left. Several of the men went into it, and soon came
      back with a bundle of branches made into a litter.

“''Who will lend his cape? It is for a pretty girl, comrades,''
      Pratique said, and ten cloaks were thrown to him. In a moment the girl was
      lying, warm and comfortable, among them, and was raised upon six
      shoulders. I placed myself at their head, on the right, well pleased with
      my position.

“We started off much more briskly, as if we had had a drink of wine,
      and I even heard some jokes. A woman is quite enough to electrify
      Frenchmen, you see. The soldiers, who had become cheerful and warm, had
      almost reformed their ranks, and an old ''franc-tireur'' who was following
      the litter, waiting for his turn to replace the first of his comrades who
      might give out, said to one of his neighbors, loud enough for me to hear:
      “''I am not a young man now, but by—-, there is nothing like
      the women to put courage into you!''

“We went on, almost without stopping, until three o''clock in the
      morning, when suddenly our scouts fell back once more, and soon the whole
      detachment showed nothing but a vague shadow on the ground, as the men lay
      on the snow. I gave my orders in a low voice, and heard the harsh,
      metallic sound of the cocking, of rifles. For there, in the middle of the
      plain, some strange object was moving about. It looked like some enormous
      animal running about, now stretching out like a serpent, now coiling
      itself into a ball, darting to the right, then to the left, then stopping,
      and presently starting off again. But presently that wandering shape came
      nearer, and I saw a dozen lancers at full gallop, one behind the other.
      They had lost their way and were trying to find it.

“They were so near by that time that I could hear the loud breathing
      of their horses, the clinking of their swords and the creaking of their
      saddles, and cried: ''Fire!''

“Fifty rifle shots broke the stillness of the night, then there were
      four or five reports, and at last one single shot was heard, and when the
      smoke had cleared away, we saw that the twelve men and nine horses had
      fallen. Three of the animals were galloping away at a furious pace, and
      one of them was dragging the dead body of its rider, which rebounded
      violently from the ground; his foot had caught in the stirrup.

“One of the soldiers behind me gave a terrible laugh and said:
      ''There will be some widows there!''

“''Poor fellows!'' she said. But as she was cold, she quickly
      disappeared beneath the cloaks again, and we started off once more. We
      marched on for a long time, and at last the sky began to grow lighter. The
      snow became quite clear, luminous and glistening, and a rosy tint appeared
      in the east. Suddenly a voice in the distance cried:

“The whole detachment halted, and I advanced to give the
      countersign. We had reached the French lines, and, as my men defiled
      before the outpost, a commandant on horseback, whom I had informed of what
      had taken place, asked in a sonorous voice, as he saw the litter pass him:
      ''What have you in there?''

“And immediately a small head covered with light hair appeared,
      dishevelled and smiling, and replied:

“At this the men raised a hearty laugh, and we felt quite
      light-hearted, while Pratique, who was walking by the side of the litter,
      waved his kepi and shouted:

“''Vive la France!'' And I felt really affected. I do not know why,
      except that I thought it a pretty and gallant thing to say.

“It seemed to me as if we had just saved the whole of France and had
      done something that other men could not have done, something simple and
      really patriotic. I shall never forget that little face, you may be sure;
      and if I had to give my opinion about abolishing drums, trumpets and
      bugles, I should propose to replace them in every regiment by a pretty
      girl, and that would be even better than playing the ''Marseillaise: By
      Jove! it would put some spirit into a trooper to have a Madonna like that,
      a live Madonna, by the colonel''s side.”

He was silent for a few moments and then continued, with an air of
      conviction, and nodding his head:

Fifteen years had passed since I was at Virelogne. I returned there in the
      autumn to shoot with my friend Serval, who had at last rebuilt his
      chateau, which the Prussians had destroyed.

I loved that district. It is one of those delightful spots which have a
      sensuous charm for the eyes. You love it with a physical love. We, whom
      the country enchants, keep tender memories of certain springs, certain
      woods, certain pools, certain hills seen very often which have stirred us
      like joyful events. Sometimes our thoughts turn back to a corner in a
      forest, or the end of a bank, or an orchard filled with flowers, seen but
      a single time on some bright day, yet remaining in our hearts like the
      image of certain women met in the street on a spring morning in their
      light, gauzy dresses, leaving in soul and body an unsatisfied desire which
      is not to be forgotten, a feeling that you have just passed by happiness.

At Virelogne I loved the whole countryside, dotted with little woods and
      crossed by brooks which sparkled in the sun and looked like veins carrying
      blood to the earth. You fished in them for crawfish, trout and eels.
      Divine happiness! You could bathe in places and you often found snipe
      among the high grass which grew along the borders of these small water
      courses.

I was stepping along light as a goat, watching my two dogs running ahead
      of me, Serval, a hundred metres to my right, was beating a field of
      lucerne. I turned round by the thicket which forms the boundary of the
      wood of Sandres and I saw a cottage in ruins.

Suddenly I remembered it as I had seen it the last time, in 1869, neat,
      covered with vines, with chickens before the door. What is sadder than a
      dead house, with its skeleton standing bare and sinister?

I also recalled that inside its doors, after a very tiring day, the good
      woman had given me a glass of wine to drink and that Serval had told me
      the history of its people. The father, an old poacher, had been killed by
      the gendarmes. The son, whom I had once seen, was a tall, dry fellow who
      also passed for a fierce slayer of game. People called them “Les
      Sauvage.”

When war was declared the son Sauvage, who was then thirty-three years
      old, enlisted, leaving his mother alone in the house. People did not pity
      the old woman very much because she had money; they knew it.

She remained entirely alone in that isolated dwelling, so far from the
      village, on the edge of the wood. She was not afraid, however, being of
      the same strain as the men folk—a hardy old woman, tall and thin,
      who seldom laughed and with whom one never jested. The women of the fields
      laugh but little in any case, that is men''s business. But they themselves
      have sad and narrowed hearts, leading a melancholy, gloomy life. The
      peasants imbibe a little noisy merriment at the tavern, but their
      helpmates always have grave, stern countenances. The muscles of their
      faces have never learned the motions of laughter.

Mother Sauvage continued her ordinary existence in her cottage, which was
      soon covered by the snows. She came to the village once a week to get
      bread and a little meat. Then she returned to her house. As there was talk
      of wolves, she went out with a gun upon her shoulder—her son''s gun,
      rusty and with the butt worn by the rubbing of the hand—and she was
      a strange sight, the tall “Sauvage,” a little bent, going with
      slow strides over the snow, the muzzle of the piece extending beyond the
      black headdress, which confined her head and imprisoned her white hair,
      which no one had ever seen.

One day a Prussian force arrived. It was billeted upon the inhabitants,
      according to the property and resources of each. Four were allotted to the
      old woman, who was known to be rich.

They were four great fellows with fair complexion, blond beards and blue
      eyes, who had not grown thin in spite of the fatigue which they had
      endured already and who also, though in a conquered country, had remained
      kind and gentle. Alone with this aged woman, they showed themselves full
      of consideration, sparing her, as much as they could, all expense and
      fatigue. They could be seen, all four of them, making their toilet at the
      well in their shirt-sleeves in the gray dawn, splashing with great swishes
      of water their pink-white northern skin, while La Mere Sauvage went and
      came, preparing their soup. They would be seen cleaning the kitchen,
      rubbing the tiles, splitting wood, peeling potatoes, doing up all the
      housework like four good sons around their mother.

But the old woman thought always of her own son, so tall and thin, with
      his hooked nose and his brown eyes and his heavy mustache which made a
      roll of black hair upon his lip. She asked every day of each of the
      soldiers who were installed beside her hearth: “Do you know where
      the French marching regiment, No. 23, was sent? My boy is in it.”

They invariably answered, “No, we don''t know, don''t know a thing at
      all.” And, understanding her pain and her uneasiness—they who
      had mothers, too, there at home—they rendered her a thousand little
      services. She loved them well, moreover, her four enemies, since the
      peasantry have no patriotic hatred; that belongs to the upper class alone.
      The humble, those who pay the most because they are poor and because every
      new burden crushes them down; those who are killed in masses, who make the
      true cannon''s prey because they are so many; those, in fine, who suffer
      most cruelly the atrocious miseries of war because they are the feeblest
      and offer least resistance—they hardly understand at all those
      bellicose ardors, that excitable sense of honor or those pretended
      political combinations which in six months exhaust two nations, the
      conqueror with the conquered.

Now, one morning, when the old woman was alone in the house, she observed,
      far off on the plain, a man coming toward her dwelling. Soon she
      recognized him; it was the postman to distribute the letters. He gave her
      a folded paper and she drew out of her case the spectacles which she used
      for sewing. Then she read:

She did not cry at all. She remained motionless, so overcome and stupefied
      that she did not even suffer as yet. She thought: “There''s Victor
      killed now.” Then little by little the tears came to her eyes and
      the sorrow filled her heart. Her thoughts came, one by one, dreadful,
      torturing. She would never kiss him again, her child, her big boy, never
      again! The gendarmes had killed the father, the Prussians had killed the
      son. He had been cut in two by a cannon-ball. She seemed to see the thing,
      the horrible thing: the head falling, the eyes open, while he chewed the
      corner of his big mustache as he always did in moments of anger.

What had they done with his body afterward? If they had only let her have
      her boy back as they had brought back her husband—with the bullet in
      the middle of the forehead!

But she heard a noise of voices. It was the Prussians returning from the
      village. She hid her letter very quickly in her pocket, and she received
      them quietly, with her ordinary face, having had time to wipe her eyes.

They were laughing, all four, delighted, for they brought with them a fine
      rabbit—stolen, doubtless—and they made signs to the old woman
      that there was to be something good to east.

She set herself to work at once to prepare breakfast, but when it came to
      killing the rabbit, her heart failed her. And yet it was not the first.
      One of the soldiers struck it down with a blow of his fist behind the
      ears.

The beast once dead, she skinned the red body, but the sight of the blood
      which she was touching, and which covered her hands, and which she felt
      cooling and coagulating, made her tremble from head to foot, and she kept
      seeing her big boy cut in two, bloody, like this still palpitating animal.

She sat down at table with the Prussians, but she could not eat, not even
      a mouthful. They devoured the rabbit without bothering themselves about
      her. She looked at them sideways, without speaking, her face so impassive
      that they perceived nothing.

All of a sudden she said: “I don''t even know your names, and here''s
      a whole month that we''ve been together.” They understood, not
      without difficulty, what she wanted, and told their names.

That was not sufficient; she had them written for her on a paper, with the
      addresses of their families, and, resting her spectacles on her great
      nose, she contemplated that strange handwriting, then folded the sheet and
      put it in her pocket, on top of the letter which told her of the death of
      her son.

They were astonished at her taking all this trouble; she explained to them
      that thus they would not be so cold; and they helped her. They heaped the
      stacks of hay as high as the straw roof, and in that manner they made a
      sort of great chamber with four walls of fodder, warm and perfumed, where
      they should sleep splendidly.

At dinner one of them was worried to see that La Mere Sauvage still ate
      nothing. She told him that she had pains in her stomach. Then she kindled
      a good fire to warm herself, and the four Germans ascended to their
      lodging-place by the ladder which served them every night for this
      purpose.

As soon as they closed the trapdoor the old woman removed the ladder, then
      opened the outside door noiselessly and went back to look for more bundles
      of straw, with which she filled her kitchen. She went barefoot in the
      snow, so softly that no sound was heard. From time to time she listened to
      the sonorous and unequal snoring of the four soldiers who were fast
      asleep.

When she judged her preparations to be sufficient, she threw one of the
      bundles into the fireplace, and when it was alight she scattered it over
      all the others. Then she went outside again and looked.

In a few seconds the whole interior of the cottage was illumined with a
      brilliant light and became a frightful brasier, a gigantic fiery furnace,
      whose glare streamed out of the narrow window and threw a glittering beam
      upon the snow.

Then a great cry issued from the top of the house; it was a clamor of men
      shouting heartrending calls of anguish and of terror. Finally the trapdoor
      having given way, a whirlwind of fire shot up into the loft, pierced the
      straw roof, rose to the sky like the immense flame of a torch, and all the
      cottage flared.

Nothing more was heard therein but the crackling of the fire, the cracking
      of the walls, the falling of the rafters. Suddenly the roof fell in and
      the burning carcass of the dwelling hurled a great plume of sparks into
      the air, amid a cloud of smoke.

The old “Sauvage” stood before her ruined dwelling, armed with
      her gun, her son''s gun, for fear one of those men might escape.

When she saw that it was ended, she threw her weapon into the brasier. A
      loud report followed.

She reached her bony arm toward the red heap of fire which was almost out
      and answered with a strong voice:

They did not believe her, they thought that the sudden disaster had made
      her crazy. While all pressed round and listened, she told the story from
      beginning to end, from the arrival of the letter to the last shriek of the
      men who were burned with her house, and never omitted a detail.

When she had finished, she drew two pieces of paper from her pocket, and,
      in order to distinguish them by the last gleams of the fire, she again
      adjusted her spectacles. Then she said, showing one:

“That, that is the death of Victor.” Showing the other, she
      added, indicating the red ruins with a bend of the head: “Here are
      their names, so that you can write home.” She quietly held a sheet
      of paper out to the officer, who held her by the shoulders, and she
      continued:

“You must write how it happened, and you must say to their mothers
      that it was I who did that, Victoire Simon, la Sauvage! Do not forget.”

The officer shouted some orders in German. They seized her, they threw her
      against the walls of her house, still hot. Then twelve men drew quickly up
      before her, at twenty paces. She did not move. She had understood; she
      waited.

An order rang out, followed instantly by a long report. A belated shot
      went off by itself, after the others.

The Prussian officer approached. She was almost cut in two, and in her
      withered hand she held her letter bathed with blood.

“It was by way of reprisal that the Germans destroyed the chateau of
      the district, which belonged to me.”

I thought of the mothers of those four fine fellows burned in that house
      and of the horrible heroism of that other mother shot against the wall.

I should say I did remember that Epiphany supper during the war! exclaimed
      Count de Garens, an army captain.

I was quartermaster of cavalry at the time, and for a fortnight had been
      scouting in front of the German advance guard. The evening before we had
      cut down a few Uhlans and had lost three men, one of whom was that poor
      little Raudeville. You remember Joseph de Raudeville, of course.

Well, on that day my commanding officer ordered me to take six troopers
      and to go and occupy the village of Porterin, where there had been five
      skirmishes in three weeks, and to hold it all night. There were not twenty
      houses left standing, not a dozen houses in that wasps'' nest. So I took
      ten troopers and set out about four o''clock, and at five o''clock, while it
      was still pitch dark, we reached the first houses of Porterin. I halted
      and ordered Marchas—you know Pierre de Marchas, who afterward
      married little Martel-Auvelin, the daughter of the Marquis de Martel-Auvelin—to
      go alone into the village, and to report to me what he saw.

I had selected nothing but volunteers, all men of good family. It is
      pleasant when on duty not to be forced to be on intimate terms with
      unpleasant fellows. This Marchas was as smart as possible, cunning as a
      fox and supple as a serpent. He could scent the Prussians as a dog can
      scent a hare, could discover food where we should have died of hunger
      without him, and obtained information from everybody, and information
      which was always reliable, with incredible cleverness.

In ten minutes he returned. “All right,” he said; “there
      have been no Prussians here for three days. It is a sinister place, is
      this village. I have been talking to a Sister of Mercy, who is caring for
      four or five wounded men in an abandoned convent.”

I ordered them to ride on, and we entered the principal street. On the
      right and left we could vaguely see roofless walls, which were hardly
      visible in the profound darkness. Here and there a light was burning in a
      room; some family had remained to keep its house standing as well as they
      were able; a family of brave or of poor people. The rain began to fall, a
      fine, icy cold rain, which froze as it fell on our cloaks. The horses
      stumbled against stones, against beams, against furniture. Marchas guided
      us, going before us on foot, and leading his horse by the bridle.

“Where are you taking us to?” I asked him. And he replied:
      “I have a place for us to lodge in, and a rare good one.” And
      we presently stopped before a small house, evidently belonging to some
      proprietor of the middle class. It stood on the street, was quite
      inclosed, and had a garden in the rear.

Marchas forced open the lock by means of a big stone which he picked up
      near the garden gate; then he mounted the steps, smashed in the front door
      with his feet and shoulders, lit a bit of wax candle, which he was never
      without, and went before us into the comfortable apartments of some rich
      private individual, guiding us with admirable assurance, as if he lived in
      this house which he now saw for the first time.

Two troopers remained outside to take care of our horses, and Marchas said
      to stout Ponderel, who followed him: “The stables must be on the
      left; I saw that as we came in; go and put the animals up there, for we do
      not need them”; and then, turning to me, he said: “Give your
      orders, confound it all!”

This fellow always astonished me, and I replied with a laugh: “I
      will post my sentinels at the country approaches and will return to you
      here.”

“Very well. Leave me four to look after provisions, to do the
      cooking and to set the table. I will go and find out where the wine is
      hidden.”

I went off, to reconnoitre the deserted streets until they ended in the
      open country, so as to post my sentries there.

Half an hour later I was back, and found Marchas lounging in a great
      easy-chair, the covering of which he had taken off, from love of luxury,
      as he said. He was warming his feet at the fire and smoking an excellent
      cigar, whose perfume filled the room. He was alone, his elbows resting on
      the arms of the chair, his head sunk between his shoulders, his cheeks
      flushed, his eyes bright, and looking delighted.

I heard the noise of plates and dishes in the next room, and Marchas said
      to me, smiling in a contented manner: “This is famous; I found the
      champagne under the flight of steps outside, the brandy—fifty
      bottles of the very finest in the kitchen garden under a pear tree, which
      did not seem to me to be quite straight when I looked at it by the light
      of my lantern. As for solids, we have two fowls, a goose, a duck, and
      three pigeons. They are being cooked at this moment. It is a delightful
      district.”

I sat down opposite him, and the fire in the grate was burning my nose and
      cheeks. “Where did you find this wood?” I asked. “Splendid
      wood,” he replied. “The owner''s carriage. It is the paint
      which is causing all this flame, an essence of punch and varnish. A
      capital house!”

I laughed, for I saw the creature was funny, and he went on: “Fancy
      this being the Epiphany! I have had a bean put into the goose dressing;
      but there is no queen; it is really very annoying!” And I repeated
      like an echo: “It is annoying, but what do you want me to do in the
      matter?” “To find some, of course.” “Some women.
      Women?—you must be mad?” “I managed to find the brandy
      under the pear tree, and the champagne under the steps; and yet there was
      nothing to guide me, while as for you, a petticoat is a sure bait. Go and
      look, old fellow.”

He looked so grave, so convinced, that I could not tell whether he was
      joking or not, and so I replied: “Look here, Marchas, are you having
      a joke with me?” “I never joke on duty.” “But
      where the devil do you expect me to find any women?” “Where
      you like; there must be two or three remaining in the neighborhood, so
      ferret them out and bring them here.”

“Do you want an idea?” “Yes.” “Go and see
      the priest.” “The priest? What for?” “Ask him to
      supper, and beg him to bring a woman with him.” “The priest! A
      woman! Ha! ha! ha!”

But Marchas continued with extraordinary gravity: “I am not
      laughing; go and find the priest and tell him how we are situated, and, as
      he must be horribly dull, he will come. But tell him that we want one
      woman at least, a lady, of course, since we, are all men of the world. He
      is sure to know his female parishioners on the tips of his fingers, and if
      there is one to suit us, and you manage it well, he will suggest her to
      you.”

“Come, come, Marchas, what are you thinking of?” “My
      dear Garens, you can do this quite well. It will even be very funny. We
      are well bred, by Jove! and we will put on our most distinguished manners
      and our grandest style. Tell the abbe who we are, make him laugh, soften
      his heart, coax him and persuade him!” “No, it is impossible.”

He drew his chair close to mine, and as he knew my special weakness, the
      scamp continued: “Just think what a swaggering thing it will be to
      do and how amusing to tell about; the whole army will talk about it, and
      it will give you a famous reputation.”

I hesitated, for the adventure rather tempted me, and he persisted:
      “Come, my little Garens. You are the head of this detachment, and
      you alone can go and call on the head of the church in this neighborhood.
      I beg of you to go, and I promise you that after the war I will relate the
      whole affair in verse in the Revue de Deux Mondes. You owe this much to
      your men, for you have made them march enough during the last month.”

I got up at last and asked: “Where is the priest''s house?”
      “Take the second turning at the end of the street, you will see an
      avenue, and at the end of the avenue you will find the church. The
      parsonage is beside it.” As I went out, he called out: “Tell
      him the bill of fare, to make him hungry!”

I discovered the ecclesiastic''s little house without any difficulty; it
      was by the side of a large, ugly brick church. I knocked at the door with
      my fist, as there was neither bell nor knocker, and a loud voice from
      inside asked: “Who is there?” To which I replied: “A
      quartermaster of hussars.”

I heard the noise of bolts and of a key being turned, and found myself
      face to face with a tall priest with a large stomach, the chest of a
      prizefighter, formidable hands projecting from turned-up sleeves, a red
      face, and the look of a kind man. I gave him a military salute and said:
      “Good-day, Monsieur le Cure.”

He had feared a surprise, some marauders'' ambush, and he smiled as he
      replied: “Good-day, my friend; come in.” I followed him into a
      small room with a red tiled floor, in which a small fire was burning, very
      different to Marchas'' furnace, and he gave me a chair and said: “What
      can I do for you?” “Monsieur, allow me first of all to
      introduce myself”; and I gave him my card, which he took and read
      half aloud: “Le Comte de Garens.”

I continued: “There are eleven of us here, Monsieur l''Abbe, five on
      picket duty, and six installed at the house of an unknown inhabitant. The
      names of the six are: Garens, myself; Pierre de Marchas, Ludovic de
      Ponderel, Baron d''Streillis, Karl Massouligny, the painter''s son, and
      Joseph Herbon, a young musician. I have come to ask you, in their name and
      my own, to do us the honor of supping with us. It is an Epiphany supper,
      Monsieur le Cure, and we should like to make it a little cheerful.”

The priest smiled and murmured: “It seems to me to be hardly a
      suitable occasion for amusing one''s self.” And I replied: “We
      are fighting during the day, monsieur. Fourteen of our comrades have been
      killed in a month, and three fell as late as yesterday. It is war time. We
      stake our life at every moment; have we not, therefore, the right to amuse
      ourselves freely? We are Frenchmen, we like to laugh, and we can laugh
      everywhere. Our fathers laughed on the scaffold! This evening we should
      like to cheer ourselves up a little, like gentlemen, and not like
      soldiers; you understand me, I hope. Are we wrong?”

He replied quickly: “You are quite right, my friend, and I accept
      your invitation with great pleasure.” Then he called out: “Hermance!”

An old bent, wrinkled, horrible peasant woman appeared and said: “What
      do you want?” “I shall not dine at home, my daughter.”
      “Where are you going to dine then?” “With some
      gentlemen, the hussars.”

I felt inclined to say: “Bring your servant with you,” just to
      see Marchas'' face, but I did not venture, and continued: “Do you
      know any one among your parishioners, male or female, whom I could invite
      as well?” He hesitated, reflected, and then said: “No, I do
      not know anybody!”

I persisted: “Nobody! Come, monsieur, think; it would be very nice
      to have some ladies, I mean to say, some married couples! I know nothing
      about your parishioners. The baker and his wife, the grocer, the—the—the—watchmaker—the—shoemaker—the—the
      druggist with Mrs. Druggist. We have a good spread and plenty of wine, and
      we should be enchanted to leave pleasant recollections of ourselves with
      the people here.”

The priest thought again for a long time, and then said resolutely:
      “No, there is nobody.” I began to laugh. “By Jove,
      Monsieur le Cure, it is very annoying not to have an Epiphany queen, for
      we have the bean. Come, think. Is there not a married mayor, or a married
      deputy mayor, or a married municipal councillor or a schoolmaster?”
      “No, all the ladies have gone away.” “What, is there not
      in the whole place some good tradesman''s wife with her good tradesman, to
      whom we might give this pleasure, for it would be a pleasure to them, a
      great pleasure under present circumstances?”

But, suddenly, the cure began to laugh, and laughed so violently that he
      fairly shook, and presently exclaimed: “Ha! ha! ha! I have got what
      you want, yes. I have got what you want! Ha! ha! ha! We will laugh and
      enjoy ourselves, my children; we will have some fun. How pleased the
      ladies will be, I say, how delighted they will be! Ha! ha! Where are you
      staying?”

I described the house, and he understood where it was. “Very good,”
      he said. “It belongs to Monsieur Bertin-Lavaille. I will be there in
      half an hour, with four ladies! Ha! ha! ha! four ladies!”

He went out with me, still laughing, and left me, repeating: “That
      is capital; in half an hour at Bertin-Lavaille''s house.”

I returned quickly, very much astonished and very much puzzled. “Covers
      for how many?” Marchas asked, as soon as he saw me. “Eleven.
      There are six of us hussars, besides the priest and four ladies.” He
      was thunderstruck, and I was triumphant. He repeated: “Four ladies!
      Did you say, four ladies?” “I said four women.” “Real
      women?” “Real women.” “Well, accept my
      compliments!” “I will, for I deserve them.”

He got out of his armchair, opened the door, and I saw a beautiful white
      tablecloth on a long table, round which three hussars in blue aprons were
      setting out the plates and glasses. “There are some women coming!”
      Marchas cried. And the three men began to dance and to cheer with all
      their might.

Everything was ready, and we were waiting. We waited for nearly an hour,
      while a delicious smell of roast poultry pervaded the whole house. At
      last, however, a knock against the shutters made us all jump up at the
      same moment. Stout Ponderel ran to open the door, and in less than a
      minute a little Sister of Mercy appeared in the doorway. She was thin,
      wrinkled and timid, and successively greeted the four bewildered hussars
      who saw her enter. Behind her, the noise of sticks sounded on the tiled
      floor in the vestibule, and as soon as she had come into the drawing-room,
      I saw three old heads in white caps, following each other one by one, who
      came in, swaying with different movements, one inclining to the right,
      while the other inclined to the left. And three worthy women appeared,
      limping, dragging their legs behind them, crippled by illness and deformed
      through old age, three infirm old women, past service, the only three
      pensioners who were able to walk in the home presided over by Sister
      Saint-Benedict.

She had turned round to her invalids, full of anxiety for them, and then,
      seeing my quartermaster''s stripes, she said to me: “I am much
      obliged to you for thinking of these poor women. They have very little
      pleasure in life, and you are at the same time giving them a great treat
      and doing them a great honor.”

I saw the priest, who had remained in the dark hallway, and was laughing
      heartily, and I began to laugh in my turn, especially when I saw Marchas''
      face. Then, motioning the nun to the seats, I said:

“Sit down, sister; we are very proud and very happy that you have
      accepted our unpretentious invitation.”

She took three chairs which stood against the wall, set them before the
      fire, led her three old women to them, settled them on them, took their
      sticks and shawls, which she put into a corner, and then, pointing to the
      first, a thin woman with an enormous stomach, who was evidently suffering
      from the dropsy, she said: “This is Mother Paumelle; whose husband
      was killed by falling from a roof, and whose son died in Africa; she is
      sixty years old.” Then she pointed to another, a tall woman, whose
      head trembled unceasingly: “This is Mother Jean-Jean, who is
      sixty-seven. She is nearly blind, for her face was terribly singed in a
      fire, and her right leg was half burned off.”

Then she pointed to the third, a sort of dwarf, with protruding, round,
      stupid eyes, which she rolled incessantly in all directions, “This
      is La Putois, an idiot. She is only forty-four.”

I bowed to the three women as if I were being presented to some royal
      highnesses, and turning to the priest, I said: “You are an excellent
      man, Monsieur l''Abbe, to whom all of us here owe a debt of gratitude.”

Everybody was laughing, in fact, except Marchas, who seemed furious, and
      just then Karl Massouligny cried: “Sister Saint-Benedict, supper is
      on the table!”

I made her go first with the priest, then I helped up Mother Paumelle,
      whose arm I took and dragged her into the next room, which was no easy
      task, for she seemed heavier than a lump of iron.

Stout Ponderel gave his arm to Mother Jean-Jean, who bemoaned her crutch,
      and little Joseph Herbon took the idiot, La Putois, to the dining-room,
      which was filled with the odor of the viands.

As soon as we were opposite our plates, the sister clapped her hands three
      times, and, with the precision of soldiers presenting arms, the women made
      a rapid sign of the cross, and then the priest slowly repeated the
      Benedictus in Latin. Then we sat down, and the two fowls appeared, brought
      in by Marchas, who chose to wait at table, rather than to sit down as a
      guest to this ridiculous repast.

But I cried: “Bring the champagne at once!” and a cork flew
      out with the noise of a pistol, and in spite of the resistance of the
      priest and of the kind sister, the three hussars, sitting by the side of
      the three invalids, emptied their three full glasses down their throats by
      force.

Massouligny, who possessed the faculty of making himself at home, and of
      being on good terms with every one, wherever he was, made love to Mother
      Paumelle in the drollest manner. The dropsical woman, who had retained her
      cheerfulness in spite of her misfortunes, answered him banteringly in a
      high falsetto voice which appeared as if it were put on, and she laughed
      so heartily at her neighbor''s jokes that it was quite alarming. Little
      Herbon had seriously undertaken the task of making the idiot drunk, and
      Baron d''Streillis, whose wits were not always particularly sharp, was
      questioning old Jean-Jean about the life, the habits, and the rules of the
      hospital.

“Oh! oh! you will make her ill; pray do not make her laugh like
      that, monsieur. Oh! monsieur—” Then she got up and rushed at
      Herbon to take from him a full glass which he was hastily emptying down La
      Putois'' throat, while the priest shook with laughter, and said to the
      sister: “Never mind; just this once, it will not hurt them. Do leave
      them alone.”

After the two fowls they ate the duck, which was flanked by the three
      pigeons and the blackbird, and then the goose appeared, smoking,
      golden-brown, and diffusing a warm odor of hot, browned roast meat. La
      Paumelle, who was getting lively, clapped her hands; La Jean-Jean left off
      answering the baron''s numerous questions, and La Putois uttered grunts of
      pleasure, half cries and half sighs, as little children do when one shows
      them candy. “Allow me to take charge of this animal,” the cure
      said. “I understand these sort of operations better than most
      people.” “Certainly, Monsieur l''Abbe,” and the sister
      said: “How would it be to open the window a little? They are too
      warm, and I am afraid they will be ill.”

I turned to Marchas: “Open the window for a minute.” He did
      so; the cold outer air as it came in made the candles flare, and the steam
      from the goose, which the cure was scientifically carving, with a table
      napkin round his neck, whirl about. We watched him doing it, without
      speaking now, for we were interested in his attractive handiwork, and
      seized with renewed appetite at the sight of that enormous golden-brown
      bird, whose limbs fell one after another into the brown gravy at the
      bottom of the dish. At that moment, in the midst of that greedy silence
      which kept us all attentive, the distant report of a shot came in at the
      open window.

I started to my feet so quickly that my chair fell down behind me, and I
      shouted: “To saddle, all of you! You, Marchas, take two men and go
      and see what it is. I shall expect you back here in five minutes.”
      And while the three riders went off at full gallop through the night, I
      got into the saddle with my three remaining hussars, in front of the steps
      of the villa, while the cure, the sister and the three old women showed
      their frightened faces at the window.

We heard nothing more, except the barking of a dog in the distance. The
      rain had ceased, and it was cold, very cold, and soon I heard the gallop
      of a horse, of a single horse, coming back. It was Marchas, and I called
      out to him: “Well?” “It is nothing; Francois has wounded
      an old peasant who refused to answer his challenge: ''Who goes there?'' and
      who continued to advance in spite of the order to keep off; but they are
      bringing him here, and we shall see what is the matter.”

I gave orders for the horses to be put back in the stable, and I sent my
      two soldiers to meet the others, and returned to the house. Then the cure,
      Marchas, and I took a mattress into the room to lay the wounded man on;
      the sister tore up a table napkin in order to make lint, while the three
      frightened women remained huddled up in a corner.

Soon I heard the rattle of sabres on the road, and I took a candle to show
      a light to the men who were returning; and they soon appeared, carrying
      that inert, soft, long, sinister object which a human body becomes when
      life no longer sustains it.

They put the wounded man on the mattress that had been prepared for him,
      and I saw at the first glance that he was dying. He had the death rattle
      and was spitting up blood, which ran out of the corners of his mouth at
      every gasp. The man was covered with blood! His cheeks, his beard, his
      hair, his neck and his clothes seemed to have been soaked, to have been
      dipped in a red tub; and that blood stuck to him, and had become a dull
      color which was horrible to look at.

The wounded man, wrapped up in a large shepherd''s cloak, occasionally
      opened his dull, vacant eyes, which seemed stupid with astonishment, like
      those of animals wounded by a sportsman, which fall at his feet, more than
      half dead already, stupefied with terror and surprise.

The cure exclaimed: “Ah, it is old Placide, the shepherd from Les
      Moulins. He is deaf, poor man, and heard nothing. Ah! Oh, God! they have
      killed the unhappy man!” The sister had opened his blouse and shirt,
      and was looking at a little blue hole in his chest, which was not bleeding
      any more. “There is nothing to be done,” she said.

The shepherd was gasping terribly and bringing up blood with every last
      breath, and in his throat, to the very depth of his lungs, they could hear
      an ominous and continued gurgling. The cure, standing in front of him,
      raised his right hand, made the sign of the cross, and in a slow and
      solemn voice pronounced the Latin words which purify men''s souls, but
      before they were finished, the old man''s body trembled violently, as if
      something had given way inside him, and he ceased to breathe. He was dead.

When I turned round, I saw a sight which was even more horrible than the
      death struggle of this unfortunate man; the three old women were standing
      up huddled close together, hideous, and grimacing with fear and horror. I
      went up to them, and they began to utter shrill screams, while La
      Jean-Jean, whose burned leg could no longer support her, fell to the
      ground at full length.

Sister Saint-Benedict left the dead man, ran up to her infirm old women,
      and without a word or a look for me, wrapped their shawls round them, gave
      them their crutches, pushed them to the door, made them go out, and
      disappeared with them into the dark night.

I saw that I could not even let a hussar accompany them, for the mere
      rattle of a sword would have sent them mad with fear.

I have no news. We live in the drawing-room, looking out at the rain. We
      cannot go out in this frightful weather, so we have theatricals. How
      stupid they are, my dear, these drawing entertainments in the repertory of
      real life! All is forced, coarse, heavy. The jokes are like cannon balls,
      smashing everything in their passage. No wit, nothing natural, no
      sprightliness, no elegance. These literary men, in truth, know nothing of
      society. They are perfectly ignorant of how people think and talk in our
      set. I do not mind if they despise our customs, our conventionalities, but
      I do not forgive them for not knowing them. When they want to be humorous
      they make puns that would do for a barrack; when they try to be jolly,
      they give us jokes that they must have picked up on the outer boulevard in
      those beer houses artists are supposed to frequent, where one has heard
      the same students'' jokes for fifty years.

So we have taken to Theatricals. As we are only two women, my husband
      takes the part of a soubrette, and, in order to do that, he has shaved off
      his mustache. You cannot imagine, my dear Lucy, how it changes him! I no
      longer recognize him-by day or at night. If he did not let it grow again I
      think I should no longer love him; he looks so horrid like this.

In fact, a man without a mustache is no longer a man. I do not care much
      for a beard; it almost always makes a man look untidy. But a mustache, oh,
      a mustache is indispensable to a manly face. No, you would never believe
      how these little hair bristles on the upper lip are a relief to the eye
      and good in other ways. I have thought over the matter a great deal but
      hardly dare to write my thoughts. Words look so different on paper and the
      subject is so difficult, so delicate, so dangerous that it requires
      infinite skill to tackle it.

Well, when my husband appeared, shaven, I understood at once that I never
      could fall in love with a strolling actor nor a preacher, even if it were
      Father Didon, the most charming of all! Later when I was alone with him
      (my husband) it was worse still. Oh, my dear Lucy, never let yourself be
      kissed by a man without a mustache; their kisses have no flavor, none
      whatever! They no longer have the charm, the mellowness and the snap
      —yes, the snap—of a real kiss. The mustache is the spice.

Imagine placing to your lips a piece of dry—or moist—parchment.
      That is the kiss of the man without a mustache. It is not worth while.

Whence comes this charm of the mustache, will you tell me? Do I know
      myself? It tickles your face, you feel it approaching your mouth and it
      sends a little shiver through you down to the tips of your toes.

And on your neck! Have you ever felt a mustache on your neck? It
      intoxicates you, makes you feel creepy, goes to the tips of your fingers.
      You wriggle, shake your shoulders, toss back your head. You wish to get
      away and at the same time to remain there; it is delightful, but
      irritating. But how good it is!

A lip without a mustache is like a body without clothing; and one must
      wear clothes, very few, if you like, but still some clothing.

I recall a sentence (uttered by a politician) which has been running in my
      mind for three months. My husband, who keeps up with the newspapers, read
      me one evening a very singular speech by our Minister of Agriculture, who
      was called M. Meline. He may have been superseded by this time. I do not
      know.

I was paying no attention, but the name Meline struck me. It recalled, I
      do not exactly know why, the ''Scenes de la vie de boheme''. I thought it
      was about some grisette. That shows how scraps of the speech entered my
      mind. This M. Meline was making this statement to the people of Amiens, I
      believe, and I have ever since been trying to understand what he meant:
      “There is no patriotism without agriculture!” Well, I have
      just discovered his meaning, and I affirm in my turn that there is no love
      without a mustache. When you say it that way it sounds comical, does it
      not?

“There is no patriotism without agriculture,” said M. Meline,
      and he was right, that minister; I now understand why.

From a very different point of view the mustache is essential. It gives
      character to the face. It makes a man look gentle, tender, violent, a
      monster, a rake, enterprising! The hairy man, who does not shave off his
      whiskers, never has a refined look, for his features are concealed; and
      the shape of the jaw and the chin betrays a great deal to those who
      understand.

The man with a mustache retains his own peculiar expression and his
      refinement at the same time.

And how many different varieties of mustaches there are! Sometimes they
      are twisted, curled, coquettish. Those seem to be chiefly devoted to
      women.

Sometimes they are pointed, sharp as needles, and threatening. That kind
      prefers wine, horses and war.

Sometimes they are enormous, overhanging, frightful. These big ones
      generally conceal a fine disposition, a kindliness that borders on
      weakness and a gentleness that savors of timidity.

But what I adore above all in the mustache is that it is French,
      altogether French. It came from our ancestors, the Gauls, and has remained
      the insignia of our national character.

It is boastful, gallant and brave. It sips wine gracefully and knows how
      to laugh with refinement, while the broad-bearded jaws are clumsy in
      everything they do.

I recall something that made me weep all my tears and also—I see it
      now—made me love a mustache on a man''s face.

It was during the war, when I was living with my father. I was a young
      girl then. One day there was a skirmish near the chateau. I had heard the
      firing of the cannon and of the artillery all the morning, and that
      evening a German colonel came and took up his abode in our house. He lef' WHERE id = '6b5a5bab-cb6d-4c60-9071-cb95b01bf8ca';
