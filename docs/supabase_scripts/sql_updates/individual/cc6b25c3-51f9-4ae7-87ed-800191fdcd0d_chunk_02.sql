      think, Grandfather, that each of these old governors should have his
      statue set up in our State House, Sculptured out of the hardest of New
      England granite.”

“It would not be amiss, Laurence,” said Grandfather; “but perhaps clay, or
      some other perishable material, might suffice for some of their
      successors. But let us go back to our chair. It was occupied by Governor
      Bradstreet from April, 1689, until May, 1692. Sir William Phips then
      arrived in Boston with a new charter from King William and a commission to
      be governor.”

“AND what became of the chair?” inquired Clara, “The outward aspect of our
      chair,” replied Grandfather, “was now somewhat the worse for its long and
      arduous services. It was considered hardly magnificent enough to be
      allowed to keep its place in the council chamber of Massachusetts. In
      fact, it was banished as an article of useless lumber. But Sir William
      Phips happened to see it, and, being much pleased with its construction,
      resolved to take the good old chair into his private mansion. Accordingly,
      with his own gubernatorial hands, he repaired one of its arms, which had
      been slightly damaged.”

“Why, Grandfather, here is the very arm!” interrupted Charley, in great
      wonderment. “And did Sir William Phips put in these screws with his own
      hands? I am sure he did it beautifully! But how came a governor to know
      how to mend a chair?”

“I will tell you a story about the early life of Sir William Phips,” said
      Grandfather. “You will then perceive that he well knew how to use his
      hands.”

Picture to yourselves, my dear children, a handsome, old-fashioned room,
      with a large, open cupboard at one end, in which is displayed a
      magnificent gold cup, with some other splendid articles of gold and silver
      plate. In another part of the room, opposite to a tall looking-glass,
      stands our beloved chair, newly polished, and adorned with a gorgeous
      cushion of crimson velvet tufted with gold.

In the chair sits a man of strong and sturdy frame, whose face has been
      roughened by northern tempests and blackened by the burning sun of the
      West Indies. He wears an immense periwig, flowing down over his shoulders.
      His coat has a wide embroidery of golden foliage; and his waistcoat,
      likewise, is all flowered over and bedizened with gold. His red, rough
      hands, which have done many a good day’s work with the hammer and adze,
      are half covered by the delicate lace ruffles at his wrists. On a table
      lies his silver-hilted sword; and in a corner of the room stands his
      gold-headed cane, made of a beautifully polished West India wood.

Somewhat such an aspect as this did Sir William Phips present when he sat
      in Grandfather’s chair after the king had appointed him governor of
      Massachusetts. Truly there was need that the old chair should be varnished
      and decorated with a crimson cushion, in order to make it suitable for
      such a magnificent-looking personage.

But Sir William Phips had not always worn a gold-embroidered coat, nor
      always sat so much at his ease as he did in Grandfather’s chair. He was a
      poor man’s son, and was born in the province of Maine, where he used to
      tend sheep upon the hills in his boyhood and youth. Until he had grown to
      be a man, he did not even know how to read and write. Tired of tending
      sheep, he next apprenticed himself to a ship-carpenter, and spent about
      four years in hewing the crooked limbs of oak-trees into knees for
      vessels.

In 1673, when he was twenty-two years old, he came to Boston, and soon
      afterwards was married to a widow lady, who had property enough to set him
      up in business. It was not long, however, before he lost all the money
      that he had acquired by his marriage, and became a poor man again. Still
      he was not discouraged. He often told his wife that, some time or other,
      he should be very rich, and would build a “fair brick house” in the Green
      Lane of Boston.

Do not suppose, children, that he had been to a fortune-teller to inquire
      his destiny. It was his own energy and spirit of enterprise, and his
      resolution to lead an industrious life, that made him look forward with so
      much confidence to better days.

Several years passed away, and William Phips had not yet gained the riches
      which he promised to himself. During this time he had begun to follow the
      sea for a living. In the year 1684 he happened to hear of a Spanish ship
      which had been cast away near the Bahama Islands, and which was supposed
      to contain a great deal of gold and silver. Phips went to the place in a
      small vessel, hoping that he should be able to recover some of the
      treasure from the wreck. He did not succeed, however, in fishing up gold
      and silver enough to pay the expenses of his voyage.

But, before he returned, he was told of another Spanish ship, or galleon,
      which had been east away near Porto de la Plata. She had now lain as much
      as fifty years beneath the waves. This old ship had been laden with
      immense wealth; and, hitherto, nobody had thought of the possibility of
      recovering any part of it from the deep sea which was rolling and tossing
      it about. But though it was now an old story, and the most aged people had
      almost forgotten that such a vessel had been wrecked, William Phips
      resolved that the sunken treasure should again be brought to light.

He went to London and obtained admittance to King James, who had not yet
      been driven from his throne. He told the king of the vast wealth that was
      lying at the bottom of the sea. King James listened with attention, and
      thought this a fine opportunity to fill his treasury with Spanish gold. He
      appointed William Phips to be captain of a vessel, called the Rose Algier,
      carrying eighteen guns and ninety-five men. So now he was Captain Phips of
      the English navy.

Captain Phips sailed from England in the Rose Algier, and cruised for
      nearly two years in the West Indies, endeavoring to find the wreck of the
      Spanish ship. But the sea is so wide and deep that it is no easy matter to
      discover the exact spot where a sunken vessel lies. The prospect of
      success seemed very small; and most people would have thought that Captain
      Phips was as far from having money enough to build a “fair brick house” as
      he was while he tended sheep.

The seamen of the Rose Algier became discouraged, and gave up all hope of
      making their fortunes by discovering the Spanish wreck. They wanted to
      compel Captain Phips to turn pirate. There was a much better prospect,
      they thought, of growing rich by plundering vessels which still sailed in
      the sea than by seeking for a ship that had lain beneath the waves full
      half a century. They broke out in open mutiny; but were finally mastered
      by Phips, and compelled to obey his orders. It would have been dangerous,
      however, to continue much longer at sea with such a crew of mutinous
      sailors; and, besides, the Rose Algier was leaky and unseaworthy. So
      Captain Phips judged it best to return to England.

Before leaving the West Indies, he met with a Spaniard, an old man, who
      remembered the wreck of the Spanish ship, and gave him directions how to
      find the very spot. It was on a reef of rocks, a few leagues from Porto de
      la Plata.

On his arrival in England, therefore, Captain Phips solicited the king to
      let him have another vessel and send him back again to the West Indies.
      But King James, who had probably expected that the Rose Algier would
      return laden with gold, refused to have anything more to do with the
      affair. Phips might never have been able to renew the search if the Duke
      of Albemarle and some other noblemen had not lent their assistance. They
      fitted out a ship, and gave the command to Captain Phips. He sailed from
      England, and arrived safely at Porto de la Plata, where he took an adze
      and assisted his men to build a large boat.

The boat was intended for the purpose of going closer to the reef of rocks
      than a large vessel could safely venture. When it was finished, the
      captain sent several men in it to examine the spot where the Spanish ship
      was said to have been wrecked. They were accompanied by some Indians, who
      were skilful divers, and could go down a great way into the depths of the
      sea.

The boat’s crew proceeded to the reef of rocks, and rowed round and round
      it a great many times. They gazed down into the water, which was so
      transparent that it seemed as if they could have seen the gold and silver
      at the bottom, had there been any of those precious metals there. Nothing,
      however, could they see, nothing more valuable than a curious sea shrub,
      which was growing beneath the water, in a crevice of the reef of rocks. It
      flaunted to and fro with the swell and reflux of the waves, and looked as
      bright and beautiful as if its leaves were gold.

“We won’t go back empty-handed,” cried an English sailor; and then he
      spoke to one of the Indian divers. “Dive down and bring me that pretty sea
      shrub there. That’s the only treasure we shall find.”

Down plunged the diver, and soon rose dripping from the water, holding the
      sea shrub in his hand. But he had learned some news at the bottom of the
      sea.

“There are some ship’s guns,” said he, the moment he had drawn breath,
      “some great cannon, among the rocks, near where the shrub was growing.”

No sooner had he spoken than the English sailors knew that they had found
      the very spot where the Spanish galleon had been wrecked, so many years
      before. The other Indian divers immediately plunged over the boat’s side
      and swam headlong down, groping among the rocks and sunken cannon. In a
      few moments one of them rose above the water with a heavy lump of silver
      in his arms. The single lump was worth more than a thousand dollars. The
      sailors took it into the boat, and then rowed back as speedily as they
      could, being in haste to inform Captain Phips of their good luck.

But, confidently as the captain had hoped to find the Spanish wreck, yet,
      now that it was really found, the news seemed too good to be true. He
      could not believe it till the sailors showed him the lump of silver.

Hereupon the captain and all the crew set to work, with iron rakes and
      great hooks and lines, fishing for gold and silver at the bottom of the
      sea. Up came the treasure in abundance. Now they beheld a table of solid
      silver, once the property of an old Spanish grandee. Now they found a
      sacramental vessel, which had been destined as a gift to some Catholic
      church. Now they drew up a golden cup, fit for the King of Spain to drink
      his wine out of. Perhaps the bony hand of its former owner had been
      grasping the precious cup, and was drawn up along with it. Now their rakes
      or fishing-lines were loaded with masses of silver bullion. There were
      also precious stones among the treasure, glittering and sparkling, so that
      it is a wonder how their radiance could have been concealed.

There is something sad and terrible in the idea of snatching all this
      wealth from the devouring ocean, which had possessed it for such a length
      of years. It seems as if men had no right to make themselves rich with it.
      It ought to have been left with the skeletons of the ancient Spaniards,
      who had been drowned when the ship was wrecked, and whose bones were now
      scattered among the gold and silver.

But Captain Phips and his crew were troubled with no such thoughts as
      these. After a day or two they lighted on another part of the wreck, where
      they found a great many bags of silver dollars. But nobody could have
      guessed that these were money-bags. By remaining so long in the salt
      water, they had become covered over with a crust which had the appearance
      of stone, so that it was necessary to break them in pieces with hammers
      and axes. When this was done, a stream of silver dollars gushed out upon
      the deck of the vessel.

The whole value of the recovered treasure, plate, bullion, precious
      stones, and all, was estimated at more than two millions of dollars. It
      was dangerous even to look at such a vast amount of wealth. A sea-captain,
      who had assisted Phips in the enterprise, utterly lost his reason at the
      sight of it. He died two years afterwards, still raving about the
      treasures that lie at the bottom of the sea. It would have been better for
      this man if he had left the skeletons of the shipwrecked Spaniards in
      quiet possession of their wealth.

Captain Phips and his men continued to fish up plate, bullion, and
      dollars, as plentifully as ever, till their provisions grew short. Then,
      as they could not feed upon gold and silver any more than old King Midas
      could, they found it necessary to go in search of better sustenance. Phips
      resolved to return to England. He arrived there in 1687, and was received
      with great joy by the Duke of Albemarle and other English lords who had
      fitted out the vessel. Well they might rejoice; for they took by far the
      greater part of the treasure to themselves.

The captain’s share, however, was enough to make him comfortable for the
      rest of his days. It also enabled him to fulfil his promise to his wife,
      by building a “fair brick house” in the Green Lane of Boston. The Duke of
      Albemarle sent Mrs. Phips a magnificent gold cup, worth at least five
      thousand dollars. Before Captain Phips left London, King James made him a
      knight; so that, instead of the obscure ship-carpenter who had formerly
      dwelt among them, the inhabitants of Boston welcomed him on his return as
      the rich and famous Sir William Phips.

“Sir William Phips,” continued Grandfather, “was too active and
      adventurous a man to sit still in the quiet enjoyment of his good fortune.
      In the year 1690 he went on a military expedition against the French
      colonies in America, conquered the whole province of Acadia, and returned
      to Boston with a great deal of plunder.”

“Ask Laurence what he thinks,” replied Grandfather, with a smile. “Well,
      in the same year, Sir William took command of an expedition against
      Que-bec, but did not succeed in capturing the city. In 1692, being then in
      London, King William III. appointed him governor of Massachusetts. And
      now, my dear children, having followed Sir William Phips through all his
      adventures and hardships till we find him comfortably seated in
      Grandfather’s chair, we will here bid him farewell. May he be as happy in
      ruling a people as he was while he tended sheep!”

Charley, whose fancy had been greatly taken by the adventurous disposition
      of Sir William Phips, was eager to know how he had acted and what happened
      to him while he held the office of governor. But Grandfather had made up
      his mind to tell no more stories for the present.

“Possibly, one of these days, I may go on with the adventures of the
      chair,” said he. “But its history becomes very obscure just at this point;
      and I must search into some old books and manuscripts before proceeding
      further. Besides, it is now a good time to pause in our narrative; because
      the new charter, which Sir William Phips brought over from England, formed
      a very important epoch in the history of the province.”

“Really, Grandfather,” observed Laurence, “this seems to be the most
      remarkable chair, in the world. Its history cannot be told without
      intertwining it with the lives of distinguished men and the great events
      that have befallen the country.”

“True, Laurence,’” replied Grandfather, smiling; “we must write a book
      with some such title as this: MEMOIRS OF MY OWN TIMES, BY GRANDFATHER’S
      CHAIR.”

“But, after all,” continued Grandfather, “any other old chair, if it
      possessed memory and a hand to write its recollections, could record
      stranger stories than any that I have told you. From generation to
      generation, a chair sits familiarly in the midst of human interests, and
      is witness to the most secret and confidential intercourse that mortal man
      can hold with his fellow. The human heart may best be read in the fireside
      chair. And as to external events, Grief and Joy keep a continual
      vicissitude around it and within it. Now we see the glad face and glowing
      form of Joy, sitting merrily in the old chair, and throwing a warm
      firelight radiance over all the household. Now, while we thought not of
      it, the dark-clad mourner, Grief, has stolen into the place of Joy, but
      not to retain it long. The imagination can hardly grasp so wide a subject
      as is embraced in the experience of a family chair.”

“It makes my breath flutter, my heart thrill, to think of it,” said
      Laurence. “Yes, a family chair must have a deeper history than a chair of
      state.”

“Oh yes!” cried Clara, expressing a woman’s feeling of the point in
      question; “the history of a country is not nearly so interesting as that
      of a single family would be.”

“But the history of a country is more easily told,” said Grandfather. “So,
      if we proceed with our narrative of the chair, I shall still confine
      myself to its connection with public events.”

Good old Grandfather now rose and quitted the room, while the children
      remained gazing at the chair. Laurence, so vivid was his conception of
      past times, would hardly have deemed it strange if its former occupants,
      one after another, had resumed the seat which they had each left vacant
      such a dim length of years ago.

First, the gentle and lovely Lady Arbella would have been seen in the old
      chair, almost sinking out of its arms for very weakness; then Roger
      Williams, in his cloak and band, earnest, energetic, and benevolent; then
      the figure of Anne Hutchinson, with the like gesture as when she presided
      at the assemblages of women; then the dark, intellectual face of Vane,
      “young in years, but in sage counsel old.” Next would have appeared the
      successive governors, Winthrop, Dudley, Bellingham, and Endicott, who sat
      in the chair while it was a chair of state. Then its ample seat would have
      been pressed by the comfortable, rotund corporation of the honest
      mint-master. Then the half-frenzied shape of Mary Dyer, the persecuted
      Quaker woman, clad in sackcloth and ashes would have rested in it for a
      moment. Then the holy, apostolic form of Eliot would have sanctified it.
      Then would have arisen, like the shade of departed Puritanism, the
      venerable dignity of the white-bearded Governor Bradstreet. Lastly, on the
      gorgeous crimson cushion of Grandfather’s chair would have shone the
      purple and golden magnificence of Sir William Phips. But all these, with
      the other historic personages, in the midst of whom the chair had so often
      stood, had passed, both in substance and shadow, from the scene of ages.
      Yet here stood the chair, with the old Lincoln coat of arms, and the oaken
      flowers and foliage, and the fierce lion’s head at the summit, the whole,
      apparently, in as perfect preservation as when it had first been placed in
      the Earl of Lincoln’s hall. And what vast changes of society and of
      nations had been wrought by sudden convulsions or by slow degrees since
      that era!

“This Chair had stood firm when the thrones of kings were overturned!”
       thought Laurence. “Its oaken frame has proved stronger than many frames of
      government!”

More the thoughtful and imaginative boy might have mused; but now a large
      yellow cat, a great favorite with all the children, leaped in at the open
      window. Perceiving that Grandfather’s chair was empty, and having often
      before experienced its comforts, puss laid herself quietly down upon the
      cushion. Laurence, Clara, Charley, and little Alice all laughed at the
      idea of such a successor to the worthies of old times.

“Pussy,” said little Alice, putting out her hand, into which the cat laid
      a velvet paw, “you look very wise. Do tell us a story about GRANDFATHER’S
      CHAIR!”

MR. ELIOT had been for some time assiduously employed in learning the
      Indian language. To accomplish this, he secured the assistance of one of
      the natives, who could speak English. Eliot, at the close of his Indian
      Grammar, mentions him as “a pregnant-witted young man, who had been a
      servant in an English house, who pretty well understood his own language,
      and had a clear pronunciation.” He took this Indian into his family, and
      by constant intercourse with him soon become sufficiently conversant with
      the vocabulary and construction of the language to translate the ten
      commandments, the Lord’s prayer, and several passages of Scripture,
      besides composing exhortations and prayers.

Mr. Eliot must have found his task anything but easy or inviting. He was
      to learn a dialect, in which he could be assisted by no affinity with the
      languages he already knew. He was to do this without the help of any
      written or printed specimens, with nothing in the shape of a grammar or
      analysis, but merely by oral communication with his Indian instructor, or
      with other natives, who, however comparatively intelligent, must from the
      nature of the case have been very imperfect teachers. He applied himself
      to the work with great patience and sagacity, carefully acting the
      differences between the Indian and the English modes of constructing
      words; and, having once got a clew to this, he pursued every noun and verb
      he could think of through all possible variations. In this way he arrived
      at analyses and rules, which he could apply for himself in a general
      manner.

Neal says that Eliot was able to speak the language intelligibly after
      conversing with the Indian servant a few months. This, in a limited sense,
      may be true; but he is said to have been engaged two years in the process
      of learning, before he went to preached to the Indians. In that time he
      acquired a somewhat ready facility in the use of that dialect, by means of
      which he was to carry the instructions of spiritual truth to the men of
      the forest, though as late as 1649 he still lamented his want of skill in
      this respect.

Notice having been given of his intention [of instructing the Indians],
      Mr. Eliot, in company with three others, whose names are not mentioned,
      having implored the divine blessing on the undertaking, made his first
      visit to the Indians on the 28th of October, 1646 at a place afterwards
      called Nonantum; a spot that has the honor of being the first on which a
      civilized and Christian settlement of Indians was effected within the
      English colonies of North America. This name was given to the high grounds
      in the north, east part of Newton, and to the bounds of that town and
      Watertown. At a short distance from the wigwams, they were met by Waban, a
      leading man among the Indians at that place, accompanied by others, and
      were welcomed with “English salutations.” Waban, who is described as “the
      chief minister of justice among them,” had before shown a better
      disposition than any other native to receive the religious instruction of
      the Christians, and had voluntarily proposed to have his eldest son
      educated by them. His son had been accordingly placed at school in Dedham,
      whence he had now come to attend the meeting.

The Indians assembled in Waban’s wigwam; and thither Mr. Eliot and his
      friends were conducted. When the company were all collected and quiet, a
      religious service was begun with prayer. This was uttered in English; the
      reason for which, as given by Mr. Eliot and his companions, was, that he
      did not then feel sufficiently acquainted with the Indian language to use
      it in that service.

The same difficulty would not occur in preaching, since for this, we may
      suppose, he had sufficiently prepared his thoughts and expressions to make
      his discourse intelligible on all important points; and if he should, in
      some parts, fail of being, understood, he could repeat or correct himself,
      till he should succeed better. Besides, he took with him an interpretor,
      who was frequently able to express his instructions more distinctly than
      he could himself. Though the prayer was unintelligible to the Indians,
      yet, as they knew what the nature of the service was, Mr. Eliot believed
      it might not be without an effect in subduing their feelings so as to
      prepare them better to listen to the preaching.

Mr. Eliot then began his sermon, or address, from Ezek. xxxvii. 9, 10. The
      word wind, in this passage, suggested to the minds of some, who afterwards
      gave an account of this meeting, a coincidence which might, in the spirit
      of the times, be construed into a special appointment of Providence. The
      name of Waban signified, in the Indian tongue, wind; so that when the
      preacher uttered the words, “say to the wind,” it was as if he had
      proclaimed, “say to Waban.” As this man afterwards exerted much influence
      in awaking the attention of his fellow savages to Christianity, it might
      seem that in this first visit of the messengers of the gospel he was
      singled out by a special call to work in the cause. It is not surprising
      that the Indians were struck with the coincidence. Mr. Eliot gave no
      countenance to a superstitious use of the circumstance, and took care to
      tell them that, when he chose his text, he had no thought of any such
      application.

The sermon was an hour and a quarter long. One cannot but suspect that Mr.
      Eliot injudiciously crowded too much into one address. It would seem to
      have been better, for the first time at least, to have given a shorter
      sermon, and to have touched upon fewer subjects. But he was doubtless
      borne on by his zeal to do much in a good cause; and, as we have reason to
      think, by the attentive, though vague, curiosity of the Indians.

Thus ended a conference three hours long, at the end of which the Indians
      affirmed that they were not weary, and requested their visitors to come
      again. They expressed a wish to build a town and live together. Mr. Eliot
      promised to intercede for them with the court. He and his companions then
      gave the men some tobacco, and the children some apples, and bade them
      farewell.

A fortnight afterwards, on the 11th of November, Mr. Eliot and his friends
      repeated their visit to the wigwam of Waban. This meeting was more
      numerous than the former. The religious service was opened, as before,
      with a prayer in English. This was followed by a few brief and plain
      questions addressed to the children, admitting short and easy answers. The
      children seemed well disposed to listen and learn. To encourage them, Mr.
      Eliot gave them occasionally an apple or a cake; and the adults were
      requested to repeat to them the instructions that had been given. He then
      preached to the assembly in their own language, telling them that he had
      come to bring them good news from God, and show them how wicked men might
      become good and happy; and, in general, discoursing on nearly the same
      topics as he had treated at his first visit.

“O GRANDFATHER, dear Grandfather,” cried little Alice, “pray tell us some
      more stories about your chair!”

How long a time had fled since the children bad felt any curiosity to hear
      the sequel of this venerable chair’s adventures! Summer was now past and
      gone, and the better part of autumn likewise. Dreary, chill November was
      howling out of doors, and vexing the atmosphere with sudden showers of
      wintry rain, or sometimes with gusts of snow, that rattled like small
      pebbles against the windows.

When the weather began to grow cool, Grandfather’s chair had been removed
      from the summer parlor into a smaller and snugger room. It now stood by
      the side of a bright, blazing wood-fire. Grandfather loved a wood-fire far
      better than a grate of glowing anthracite, or than the dull heat of an
      invisible furnace, which seems to think that it has done its duty in
      merely warming the house. But the wood-fire is a kindly, cheerful,
      sociable spirit, sympathizing with mankind, and knowing that to create
      warmth is but one of the good offices which are expected from it.
      Therefore it dances on the hearth, and laughs broadly throughout the room,
      and plays a thousand antics, and throws a joyous glow over all the faces
      that encircle it.

In the twilight of the evening the fire grew brighter and more cheerful.
      And thus, perhaps, there was something in Grandfather’s heart that cheered
      him most with its warmth and comfort in the gathering twilight of old age.
      He had been gazing at the red embers as intently as if his past life were
      all pictured there, or as if it were a prospect of the future world, when
      little Alice’s voice aroused him. “Dear Grandfather,” repeated the little
      girl, more earnestly, “do talk to us again about your chair.”

Laurence, and Clara, and Charley, and little Alice had been attracted to
      other objects for two or three months past. They had sported in the
      gladsome sunshine of the present, and so had forgotten the shadowy region
      of the past, in the midst of which stood Grandfather’s chair. But now, in
      the autumnal twilight, illuminated by the flickering blaze of the
      wood-fire, they looked at the old chair, and thought that it had never
      before worn such an interesting aspect. There it stood in the venerable
      majesty of more than two hundred years. The light from the hearth quivered
      upon the flowers and foliage that were wrought into its oaken back; and
      the lion’s head at the summit seemed almost to move its jaws and shake its
      mane.

“Does little Alice speak for all of you?” asked Grandfather. “Do you wish
      me to go on with the adventures of the chair?’

“Oh yes, yes, Grandfather!” cried Clara. “The dear old chair! How strange
      that we should have forgotten it so long!”

“Oh, pray begin, Grandfather,” said Laurence, “for I think, when we talk
      about old times, it should be in the early evening, before the candles are
      lighted. The shapes of the famous persons who once sat in the chair will
      be more apt to come back, and be seen among us, in this glimmer and
      pleasant gloom, than they would in the vulgar daylight. And, besides, we
      can make pictures of all that you tell us among the glowing embers and
      white ashes.”

Our friend Charley, too, thought the evening the best time to hear
      Grandfather’s stories, because he could not then be playing out of doors.
      So finding his young auditors unanimous in their petition, the good old
      gentleman took up the narrative of the historic chair at the point where
      he had dropped it.

“You recollect, my dear children,” said Grandfather, “that we took leave
      of the chair in 1692, while it was occupied by Sir William Phips. This
      fortunate treasure-seeker, you will remember, had come over from England,
      with King William’s commission, to be governor of Massachusetts. Within
      the limits of this province were now included the old colony of Plymouth,
      and the territories of Maine and Nova Scotia. Sir William Phips had
      likewise brought a new charter from the king, which served instead of a
      constitution, and set forth the method in which the province was to be
      governed.”

“No,” replied Grandfather. “Under the first charter, the people had been
      the source of all power. Winthrop, Endicott, Bradstreet, and the rest of
      them had been governors by the choice of the people, without any
      interference of the king. But henceforth the governor was to hold his
      station solely by the king’s appointment and during his pleasure; and the
      same was the case with the lieutenant-governor and some other high
      officers. The people, however, were still allowed to choose
      representatives; and the governor’s council was chosen by the General
      Court.”

“Would the inhabitants have elected Sir William Phips,” asked Laurence,
      “if the choice of governor had been left to them?”

“He might probably have been a successful candidate,” answered
      Grandfather; “for his adventures and military enterprises had gained him a
      sort of renown, which always goes a great way with the people. And he had
      many popular characteristics,—being a kind warm-hearted man, not
      ashamed of his low origin nor haughty in his present elevation. Soon after
      his arrival, he proved that he did not blush to recognize his former
      associates.”

“He made a grand festival at his new brick house,” said Grandfather, “and
      invited all the ship-carpenters of Boston to be his guests. At the head of
      the table, in our great chair, sat Sir William Phips himself, treating
      these hard-handed men as his brethren, cracking jokes with them, and
      talking familiarly about old times. I know not whether he wore his
      embroidered dress; but I rather choose to imagine that he had on a suit of
      rough clothes, such as he used to labor in while he was Phips the
      ship-carpenter.”

“An aristocrat need not be ashamed of the trade,” observed Laurence; “for
      the Czar Peter the Great once served an apprenticeship to it.”

“History says but little about his merits as a ship-carpenter,” answered
      Grandfather; “but, as a governor, a great deal of fault was found with
      him. Almost as soon as he assumed the government, he became engaged in a
      very frightful business, which might have perplexed a wiser and better
      cultivated head than his. This was the witchcraft delusion.”

And here Grandfather gave his auditors such details of this melancholy
      affair as he thought it fit for them to know. They shuddered to hear that
      a frenzy, which led to the death of many innocent persons, had originated
      in the wicked arts of a few children. They belonged to the Rev. Mr.
      Parris, minister of Salem. These children complained of being pinched and
      pricked with pins, and otherwise tormented by the shapes of men and women,
      who were supposed to have power to haunt them invisibly, both in darkness
      and daylight. Often in the midst of their family and friends the children
      would pretend to be seized with strange convulsions, and would cry out
      that the witches were afflicting them.

These stories spread abroad, and caused great tumult and alarm. From the
      foundation of New England, it had been the custom of the inhabitants, in
      all matters of doubt and difficulty, to look to their ministers for
      counsel. So they did now; but, unfortunately, the ministers and wise men
      were more deluded than the illiterate people. Cotton Mather, a very
      learned and eminent clergyman, believed that the whole country was full of
      witches and wizards, who had given up their hopes of heaven, and signed a
      covenant with the evil one.

Nobody could be certain that his nearest neighbor or most intimate friend
      was not guilty of this imaginary crime. The number of those who pretended
      to be afflicted by witchcraft grew daily more numerous; and they bore
      testimony against many of the best and worthiest people. A minister, named
      George Burroughs, was among the accused. In the months of August and
      September, 1692, he and nineteen other innocent men and women were put to
      death. The place of execution was a high hill, on the outskirts of Salem;
      so that many of the sufferers, as they stood beneath the gallows, could
      discern their own habitations in the town.

The martyrdom of these guiltless persons seemed only to increase the
      madness. The afflicted now grew bolder in their accusations. Many people
      of rank and wealth were either thrown into prison or compelled to flee for
      their lives. Among these were two sons of old Simon Bradstreet, the last
      of the Puritan governors. Mr. Willard, a pious minister of Boston, was
      cried out upon as a wizard in open court. Mrs. Hale, the wife of the
      minister of Beverly, was likewise accused. Philip English, a rich merchant
      of Salem, found it necessary to take flight, leaving his property and
      business in confusion. But a short time afterwards, the Salem people were
      glad to invite him back.

“The boldest thing that the accusers did,” continued Grandfather, “was to
      cry out against the governor’s own beloved wife. Yes, the lady of Sir
      William Phips was accused of being a witch and of flying through the air
      to attend witch-meetings. When the governor heard this he probably
      trembled, so that our great chair shook beneath him.”

“Dear Grandfather,” cried little Alice, clinging closer to his knee, “is
      it true that witches ever come in the night-time to frighten little
      children?”

“No, no, dear little Alice,” replied Grandfather. “Even if there were any
      witches, they would flee away from the presence of a pure-hearted child.
      But there are none; and our forefathers soon became convinced that they
      had been led into a terrible delusion. All the prisoners on account of
      witchcraft were set free. But the innocent dead could not be restored to
      life and the hill where they were executed will always remind people of
      the saddest and most humiliating passage in our history.”

Grandfather then said that the next remarkable event, while Sir William
      Phips remained in the chair, was the arrival at Boston of an English fleet
      in 1698. It brought an army which was intended for the conquest of Canada.
      But a malignant disease, more fatal than the smallpox, broke out among the
      soldiers and sailors, and destroyed the greater part of them. The
      infection spread into the town of Boston, and made much havoc there. This
      dreadful sickness caused the governor and Sir Francis Wheeler, who was
      commander of the British forces, to give up all thoughts of attacking
      Canada.

“Soon after this,” said Grandfather, “Sir William Phips quarrelled with
      the captain of an English frigate, and also with the collector of Boston.
      Being a man of violent temper, he gave each of them a sound beating with
      his cane.”

“He was a bold fellow,” observed Charley, who was himself somewhat
      addicted to a similar mode or settling disputes.

“More bold than wise,” replied Grandfather; “for complaints were carried
      to the king, and Sir William Phips was summoned to England to make the
      best answer he could. Accordingly he went to London, where, in 1695, he
      was seized with a malignant fever, of which he died. Had he lived longer,
      he would probably have gone again in search of sunken treasure. He had
      heard of a Spanish ship, which was cast away in 1502, during the lifetime
      of Columbus. Bovadilla, Roldan, and many other Spaniards were lost in her,
      together with the immense wealth of which they had robbed the South
      American kings.”

“Why, Grandfather!” exclaimed Laurence, “what magnificent ideas the
      governor had! Only think of recovering all that old treasure which had
      lain almost two centuries under the sea! Methinks Sir William Phips ought
      to have been buried in the ocean when he died, so that he might have gone
      down among the sunken ships and cargoes of treasure which he was always
      dreaming about in his lifetime.”

“He was buried in one of the crowded cemeteries of London,” said
      Grandfather. “As he left no children, his estate was inherited by his
      nephew, from whom is descended the present Marquis of Normandy. The noble
      Marquis is not aware, perhaps, that the prosperity of his family
      originated in the successful enterprise of a New England ship-carpenter.”

“At the death of Sir William Phips,” proceeded Grandfather, “our chair was
      bequeathed to Mr. Ezekiel Cheever, a famous schoolmaster in Boston. This
      old gentleman came from London in 1637, and had been teaching school ever
      since; so that there were now aged men, grandfathers like myself, to whom
      Master Cheever had taught their alphabet. He was a person of venerable
      aspect, and wore a long white beard.”

“Yes, in his school,” answered Grandfather; “and we may safely say that it
      had never before been regarded with such awful reverence,—no, not
      even when the old governors of Massachusetts sat in it. Even you, Charley,
      my boy, would have felt some respect for the chair if you had seen it
      occupied by this famous schoolmaster.”

And here grandfather endeavored to give his auditors an idea how matters
      were managed in schools above a hundred years ago. As this will probably
      be an interesting subject to our readers, we shall make a separate sketch
      of it, and call it The Old-Fashioned School.

Now, imagine yourselves, my children, in Master Ezekiel Cheever’s
      school-room. It is a large, dingy room, with a sanded floor, and is
      lighted by windows that turn on hinges and have little diamond-shaped
      panes of glass. The scholars sit on long benches, with desks before them.
      At one end of the room is a great fireplace, so very spacious that there
      is room enough for three or four boys to stand in each of the chimney
      corners. This was the good old fashion of fireplaces when there was wood
      enough in the forests to keep people warm without their digging into the
      bowels of the earth for coal.

It is a winter’s day when we take our peep into the school-room. See what
      great logs of wood have been rolled into the fireplace, and what a broad,
      bright blaze goes leaping up the chimney! And every few moments a vast
      cloud of smoke is puffed into the room, which sails slowly over the heads
      of the scholars, until it gradually settles upon the walls and ceiling.
      They are blackened with the smoke of many years already.

Next look at our old historic chair! It is placed, you perceive, in the
      most comfortable part of the room, where the generous glow of the fire is
      sufficiently felt without being too intensely hot. How stately the old
      chair looks, as if it remembered its many famous occupants, but yet were
      conscious that a greater man is sitting in it now! Do you see the
      venerable schoolmaster, severe in aspect, with a black skullcap on his
      head, like an ancient Puritan, and the snow of his white beard drifting
      down to his very girdle? What boy would dare to play; or whisper, or even
      glance aside from his book; while Master Cheever is on the lookout behind
      his spectacles? For such offenders, if any such there be, a rod of birch
      is hanging over the fireplace, and a heavy ferule lies on the master’s
      desk.

And now school is begun. What a murmur of multitudinous tongues, like the
      whispering leaves of a wind-stirred oak, as the scholars con over their
      various tasks! Buzz! buzz! buzz! Amid just such a murmur has Master
      Cheever spent above sixty years; and long habit has made it as pleasant to
      him as the hum of a beehive when the insects are busy in the sunshine.

Now a class in Latin is called to recite. Forth steps a rowel
      queer-looking little fellows, wearing square-skirted coats and
      small-clothes, with buttons at the knee. They look like so many
      grandfathers in their second-childhood. These lads are to be sent to
      Cambridge and educated for the learned professions. Old Master Cheever had
      lived so long, and seen so many generations of school-boys grow up to be
      men, that now he can almost prophesy what sort of a man each boy will be.
      One urchin shall hereafter be a doctor, and administer pills and potions,
      and stalk gravely through life, perfumed with assafoetida. Another shall
      wrangle at the bar, and fight his way to wealth and honors and, in his
      declining age, shall be a worshipful member of his Majesty’s council. A
      third-and he is the master’s favorite—shall be a worthy successor to
      the old Puritan ministers now in their graves; he shall preach with great
      unction and effect, and leave volumes of sermons, in print and manuscript,
      for the benefit of future generations.

But, as they are merely school-boys now, their business is to construe
      Virgil. Poor Virgil! whose verses, which he took so much pains to polish,
      have been misscanned, and misparsed, and misinterpreted by so many
      generations of idle school-boys. There, sit down, ye Latinists. Two or
      three of you, I fear, are doomed to feel the master’s ferule.

Next comes a class in arithmetic. These boys are to be the merchants,
      shopkeepers, and mechanics of a future period. Hitherto they have traded
      only in marbles and apples. Hereafter some will send vessels to England
      for broadcloths and all sorts of manufactured wares, and to the West
      Indies for sugar, and rum, and coffee. Others will stand behind counters,
      and measure tape, and ribbon, and cambric by the yard. Others will upheave
      the blacksmith’s hammer, or drive the plane over the carpenter’s bench, or
      take the lapstone and the awl and learn the trade of shoemaking. Many will
      follow the sea, and become bold, rough sea-captains.

This class of boys, in short, must supply the world with those active,
      skilful hands, and clear, sagacious heads, without which the affairs of
      life would be thrown into confusion by the theories of studious and
      visionary men. Wherefore, teach them their multiplication-table, good
      Master Cheever, and whip them well when they deserve it; for much of the
      country’s welfare depends on these boys.

But, alas! while, we have been thinking of other matters, Master Cheever’s
      watchful eye has caught two boys at play. Now we shall see awful times.
      The two malefactors are summoned before the master’s chair, wherein he
      sits with the terror of a judge upon his brow. Our old chair is now a
      judgment-seat. Ah, Master Cheever has taken down that terrible birch rod!
      Short is the trial,—the sentence quickly passed,—and now the
      judge prepares to execute it in person. Thwack! thwack! thwack! In these
      good old times, a schoolmaster’s blows were well laid on.

See, the birch rod has lost several of its twigs, and will hardly serve
      for another execution. Mercy on his, what a bellowing the urchins make! My
      ears are almost deafened, though the clamor comes through the far length
      of a hundred and fifty years. There, go to your seats, poor boys; and do
      not cry, sweet little Alice, for they have ceased to feel the pain a long
      time since.

And thus the forenoon passes away. Now it is twelve o’clock. The master
      looks at his great silver watch, and then, with tiresome deliberation,
      puts the ferule into his desk. The little multitude await the word of
      dismissal with almost irrepressible impatience.

The boys retire, treading softly until they have passed the threshold;
      but, fairly out of the schoolroom, lo, what a joyous shout! what a
      scampering and trampling of feet! what a sense of recovered freedom
      expressed in the merry uproar of all their voices! What care they for the
      ferule and birch rod now? Were boys created merely to study Latin and
      arithmetic? No; the better purposes of their being are to sport, to leap,
      to run, to shout, to slide upon the ice, to snowball.

Happy boys! Enjoy your playtime now, and come again to study and to feel
      the birch rod and the ferule to-morrow; not till to-morrow; for to-day is
      Thursday lecture; and, ever since the settlement of Massachusetts, there
      has been no school on Thursday afternoons. Therefore sport, boys, while
      you may, for the morrow cometh, with the birch rod and the ferule; and
      after that another morrow, with troubles of its own.

Now the master has set everything to rights, and is ready to go home to
      dinner. Yet he goes reluctantly. The old man has spent so much of his life
      in the smoky, noisy, buzzing school-room, that, when he has a holiday, he
      feels as if his place were lost and himself a stranger in the world. But
      forth he goes; and there stands our old chair, vacant and solitary, till
      good Master Cheever resumes his seat in it to-morrow morning.

“Grandfather,” said Charley, “I wonder whether the boys did not use to
      upset the old chair when the schoolmaster was out.”

“There is a tradition,” replied Grandfather, “that one of its arms was
      dislocated in some such manner. But I cannot believe that any school-boy
      would behave so naughtily.”

As it was now later than little Alice’s usual bedtime, Grandfather broke
      off his narrative, promising to talk more about Master Cheever and his
      scholars some other evening.

“Master Ezekiel Cheever,” said he, “died in 1707, after having taught
      school about seventy years. It would require a pretty good scholar in
      arithmetic to tell how many stripes he had inflicted, and how many birch
      rods he had worn out, during all that time, in his fatherly tenderness for
      his pupils. Almost all the great men of that period, and for many years
      back, had been whipped into eminence by Master Cheever. Moreover, he had
      written a Latin Accidence, which was used in schools more than half a
      century after his death; so that the good old man, even in his grave, was
      still the cause of trouble and stripes to idle schoolboys.”

Grandfather proceeded to say, that, when Master Cheever died, he
      bequeathed the chair to the most learned man that was educated at his
      school, or that had ever been born in America. This was the renowned
      Cotton Mather, minister of the Old North Church in Boston.

“Yes, Laurence,” replied Grandfather. “The Magnalia is a strange, pedantic
      history, in which true events and real personages move before the reader
      with the dreamy aspect which they wore in Cotton Mather’s singular mind.
      This huge volume, however, was written and published before our chair came
      into his possession. But, as he was the author of more books than there
      are days in the year, we may conclude that he wrote a great deal while
      sitting in this chair.”

“I am tired of these schoolmasters and learned men,” said Charley. “I wish
      some stirring man, that knew how to do something in the world, like Sir
      William Phips, would sit in the chair.”

“Such men seldom have leisure to sit quietly in a chair,” said
      Grandfather. “We must make the best of such people as we have.”

As Cotton Mather was a very distinguished man, Grandfather took some pains
      to give the children a lively conception of his character. Over the door
      of his library were painted these words, BE SHORT,—as a warning to
      visitors that they must not do the world so much harm as needlessly to
      interrupt this great man’s wonderful labors. On entering the room you
      would probably behold it crowded, and piled, and heaped with books. There
      were huge, ponderous folios, and quartos, and little duodecimos, in
      English, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Chaldaic, and all other languages that
      either originated at the confusion of Babel or have since come into use.

All these books, no doubt, were tossed about in confusion, thus forming a
      visible emblem of the manner in which their contents were crowded into
      Cotton Mather’s brain. And in the middle of the room stood table, on
      which, besides printed volumes, were strewn manuscript sermons, historical
      tracts, and political pamphlets, all written in such a queer, blind,
      crabbed, fantastical hand, that a writing-master would have gone raving
      mad at the sight of them. By this table stood Grandfather’s chair, which
      seemed to have contracted an air of deep erudition, as if its cushion were
      stuffed with Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and other hard matters.

In this chair, from one year’s end to another, sat that prodigious
      bookworm, Cotton Mather, sometimes devouring a great book, and sometimes
      scribbling one as big. In Grandfather’s younger days there used to be a
      wax figure of him in one of the Boston museums, representing a solemn,
      dark-visaged person, in a minister’s black gown, and with a black-letter
      volume before him.

“It is difficult, my children,” observed Grandfather, “to make you
      understand such a character as Cotton Mather’s, in whom there was so much
      good, and yet so many failings and frailties. Undoubtedly he was a pious
      man. Often he kept fasts; and once, for three whole days, he allowed
      himself not a morsel of food, but spent the time in prayer and religious
      meditation. Many a live-long night did he watch and pray. These fasts and
      vigils made him meagre and haggard, and probably caused him to appear as
      if he hardly belonged to the world.”

“He was the chief agent of the mischief,” answered Grandfather; “but we
      will not suppose that he acted otherwise than conscientiously. He believed
      that there were evil spirits all about the world. Doubtless he imagined
      that they were hidden in the corners and crevices of his library, and that
      they peeped out from among the leaves of many of his books, as he turned
      them over, at midnight. He supposed that these unlovely demons were
      everywhere, in the sunshine as well as in the darkness, and that they were
      hidden in men’s hearts, and stole into their most secret thoughts.”

Here Grandfather was interrupted by little Alice, who hid her face in his
      lap, and murmured a wish that he would not talk any more about Cotton
      Mather and the evil spirits. Grandfather kissed her, and told her that
      angels were the only spirits whom she had anything to do with.

A new War between France and England had broken out in 1702, and had been
      raging ever since. In the course of it, New England suffered much injury
      from the French and Indians, who often came through the woods from Canada
      and assaulted the frontier towns. Villages were sometimes burned, and the
      inhabitants slaughtered, within a day’s ride of Boston. The people of New
      England had a bitter hatred against the French, not only for the mischief
      which they did with their own hands, but because they incited the Indians
      to hostility.

The New-Englanders knew that they could never dwell in security until the
      provinces of France should be subdued and brought under the English
      government. They frequently, in time of war, undertook military
      expeditions against Acadia and Canada, and sometimes besieged the
      fortresses by which those territories were defended. But the most earnest
      wish of their hearts was to take Quebec, and so get possession of the
      whole province of Canada. Sir William Phips had once attempted it, but
      without success.

Fleets and soldiers were often sent from England to assist the colonists
      in their warlike undertakings. In 1710 Port Royal, a fortress of Acadia,
      was taken by the English. The next year, in the month of June, a fleet,
      commanded by Admiral Sir Hovenden Walker, arrived in Boston Harbor. On
      board of this fleet was the English General Hill, with seven regiments of
      soldiers, who had been fighting under the Duke of Marlborough in Flanders.
      The government of Massachusetts was called upon to find provisions for the
      army and fleet, and to raise more men to assist in taking Canada.

What with recruiting and drilling of soldiers, there was now nothing but
      warlike bustle in the streets of Boston. The drum and fife, the rattle of
      arms, and the shouts of boys were heard from morning till night. In about
      a month the fleet set sail, carrying four regiments from New England and
      New York, besides the English soldiers. The whole army amounted to at
      least seven thousand men. They steered for the mouth of the river St.
      Lawrence.

“Cotton Mather prayed most fervently for their success,” continued
      Grandfather, “both in his pulpit and when he kneeled down in the solitude
      of his library, resting his face on our old chair. But Providence ordered
      the result otherwise. In a few weeks tidings were received that eight or
      nine of the vessels had been wrecked in the St. Lawrence, and that above a
      thousand drowned soldiers had been washed ashore on the banks of that
      mighty river. After this misfortune Sir Hovenden Walker set sail for
      England; and many pious people began to think it a sin even to wish for
      the conquest of Canada.”

“Nor did they, as we shall see,” replied Grandfather. “However, no more
      attempts were made during this war, which came to a close in 1713. The
      people of New England were probably glad of some repose; for their young
      men had been made soldiers, till many of them were fit for nothing else.
      And those who remained at home had been heavily taxed to pay for the arms,
      ammunition; fortifications, and all the other endless expenses of a war.
      There was great need of the prayers of Cotton Mather and of all pious men,
      not only on account of the sufferings of the people, but because the old
      moral and religious character of New England was in danger of being
      utterly lost.”

“How glorious it would have been,” remarked Laurence, “if our forefathers
      could have kept the country unspotted with blood!”

“Yes,” said Grandfather; “but there was a stern, warlike spirit in them
      from the beginning. They seem never to have thought of questioning either
      the morality or piety of war.”

The next event which Grandfather spoke of was one that Cotton Mather, as
      well as most of the other inhabitants of New England, heartily rejoiced
      at. This was the accession of the Elector of Hanover to the throne of
      England, in 1714, on the death of Queen Anne. Hitherto the people had been
      in continual dread that the male line of the Stuarts, who were descended
      from the beheaded King Charles and the banished King James, would be
      restored to the throne.

“The importance of this event,” observed Grandfather, “was a thousand
      times greater than that of a Presidential election in our own days. If the
      people dislike their President, they may get rid of him in four years;
      whereas a dynasty of kings may wear the crown for an unlimited period.”

The German elector was proclaimed king from the balcony of the town-house
      in Boston, by the title of George I.; while the trumpets sounded and the
      people cried amen. That night the town was illuminated; and Cotton Mather
      threw aside book and pen, and left Grandfather’s chair vacant, while he
      walked hither and thither to witness the rejoicings.

“COTTON MATHER,” continued Grandfather, “was a bitter enemy to Governor
      Dudley; and nobody exulted more than he when that crafty politician was
      removed from the government, and succeeded by Colonel Shute. This took
      place in 1716. The new governor had been an officer in the renowned Duke
      of Marlborough’s army, and had fought in some of the great battles in
      Flanders.”

“I am afraid you will be disappointed, Charley,” answered Grandfather. “It
      is true that Colonel Shute had probably never led so unquiet a life while
      fighting the French as he did now, while governing this province of
      Massachusetts Bay. But his troubles consisted almost entirely of
      dissensions with the Legislature. The king had ordered him to lay claim to
      a fixed salary; but the representatives of the people insisted upon paying
      him only such sums from year to year as they saw fit.”

Grandfather here explained some of the circumstances that made the
      situation of a colonial governor so difficult and irksome. There was not
      the same feeling towards the chief magistrate now that had existed while
      he was chosen by the free suffrages of the people, it was felt that as the
      king appointed the governor, and as he held his office during the king’s
      pleasure, it would be his great object to please the king. But the people
      thought that a governor ought to have nothing in view but the best
      interests of those whom he governed.

“The governor,” remarked Grandfather, “had two masters to serve,—the
      king, who appointed him; and the people, on whom he depended for his pay.
      Few men in this position would have ingenuity enough to satisfy either
      party. Colonel Shute, though a good-natured, well-meaning man, succeeded
      so ill with the people, that, in 1722, he suddenly went away to England
      and made Complaint to King George. In the meantime Lieutenant-Governor
      Dummer directed the affairs of the province, and carried on a long and
      bloody war with the Indians.”

“It still remained in Cotton Mather’s library,” replied Grandfather; “and
      I must not omit to tell you an incident which is very much to the honor of
      this celebrated man. It is the more proper, too, that you should hear it,
      because it will show you what a terrible calamity the smallpox was to our
      forefathers. The history of the province (and, of course, the history of
      our chair) would be incomplete without particular mention of it.”

Accordingly Grandfather told the children a story, to which, for want of a
      better title, we shall give that of The Rejected Blessing.

One day, in 1721, Doctor Cotton Mather sat in his library reading a book
      that had been published by the Royal Society of London. But every few
      moments he laid the book upon the table, and leaned back in Grandfather’s
      chair with an aspect of deep care and disquietude. There were certain
      things which troubled him exceedingly, so that he could hardly fix his
      thoughts upon what he read.

It was now a gloomy time in Boston. That terrible disease; the small-pox,
      had recently made its appearance in the town. Ever since the first
      settlement of the country this awful pestilence had come at intervals, and
      swept away multitudes of the inhabitants. Whenever it commenced its
      ravages, nothing seemed to stay its progress until there were no more
      victims for it to seize upon. Oftentimes hundreds of people at once lay
      groaning with its agony; and when it departed, its deep footsteps were
      always to be traced in many graves.

The people never felt secure from this calamity. Sometimes, perhaps, it
      was brought into the country by a poor sailor, who had caught the
      infection in foreign parts, and came hither to die and to be the cause of
      many deaths. Sometimes, no doubt, it followed in the train of the pompous
      governors when they came over from England. Sometimes the disease lay
      hidden in the cargoes of ships, among silks, and brocades, and other
      costly merchandise which was imported for the rich people to wear. And
      sometimes it started up seemingly of its own accord, and nobody could tell
      whence it came. The physician, being called to attend the sick person,
      would look at him, and say, “It is the small-pox! Let the patient be
      carried to the hospital.”

And now this dreadful sickness had shown itself again in Boston. Cotton
      Mather was greatly afflicted for the sake of the whole province. He had
      children, too, who were exposed to the danger. At that very moment he
      heard the voice of his youngest son, for whom his heart was moved with
      apprehension.

“Alas! I fear for that poor child,” said Cotton Mather to himself. “What
      shall I do for my son Samuel?”

Again he attempted to drive away these thoughts by taking up the book
      which he had been reading. And now, all of a sudden, his attention became
      fixed. The book contained a printed letter that an Italian physician had
      written upon the very subject about which Cotton Mather was so anxiously
      meditating. He ran his eye eagerly over the pages; and, behold! a method
      was disclosed to him by which the small-pox might be robbed of its worst
      terrors. Such a method was known in Greece. The physicians of Turkey, too,
      those long-bearded Eastern sages, had been acquainted with it for many
      years. The negroes of Africa, ignorant as they were, had likewise
      practised it, and thus had shown themselves wiser than the white men.

“Of a truth,” ejaculated Cotton Mather, clasping his hands and looking up
      to heaven, “it was a merciful Providence that brought this book under mine
      eye. I will procure a consultation of physicians, and see whether this
      wondrous inoculation may not stay the progress of the destroyer.”

So he arose from Grandfather’s chair and went out of the library. Near the
      door he met his son Samuel, who seemed downcast and out of spirits. The
      boy had heard, probably, that some of his playmates were taken ill with
      the small-pox. But, as his father looked cheerfully at him, Samuel took
      courage, trusting that either the wisdom of so learned a minister would
      find some remedy for the danger, or else that his prayers would secure
      protection from on high.

Meanwhile Cotton Mather took his staff and three-cornered hat and walked
      about the streets, calling at the houses of all the physicians in Boston.
      They were a very wise fraternity; and their huge wigs, and black dresses,
      and solemn visages made their wisdom appear even profounder than it was.
      One after another he acquainted them with the discovery which he had hit
      upon.

But the grave and sagacious personages would scarcely listen to him. The
      oldest doctor in town contented himself with remarking that no such thing
      as inoculation was mentioned by Galen or Hippocrates; and it was
      impossible that modern physicians should be wiser than those old sages. A
      second held up his hands in dumb astonishment and horror at the mad-ness
      of what Cotton Mather proposed to do. A third told him, in pretty plain
      terms, that he knew not what he was talking about. A fourth requested, in
      the name of the whole medical fraternity, that Cotton Mather would confine
      his attention to people’s souls, and leave the physicians to take care of
      their bodies. In short, there was but a single doctor among them all who
      would grant the poor minister so much as a patient hearing, This was
      Doctor Zabdiel Boylston. He looked into the matter like a man of sense,
      and finding, beyond a doubt, that inoculation had rescued many from death,
      he resolved to try the experiment in his own family.

And so he did. But when the other physicians heard of it they arose in
      great fury and began a war of words, written, printed, and spoken, against
      Cotton Mather and Doctor Boylston. To hear them talk, you would have
      supposed that these two harmless and benevolent men had plotted the ruin
      of the country.

The people, also, took the alarm. Many, who thought themselves more pious
      than their neighbors, contended that, if Providence had ordained them to
      die of the small-pox, it was sinful to aim at preventing it. The strangest
      reports were in circulation. Some said that Doctor Boylston had contrived
      a method for conveying the gout, rheumatism, sick-headache, asthma, and
      all other diseases from one person to another, and diffusing them through
      the whole community. Others flatly affirmed that the evil one had got
      possession of Cotton Mather, and was at the bottom of the whole business.

You must observe, children, that Cotton Mather’s fellow-citizens were
      generally inclined to doubt the wisdom of any measure which he might
      propose to them. They recollected how he had led them astray in the old
      witchcraft delusion; and now, if he thought and acted ever so wisely, it
      was difficult for him to get the credit of it.

The people’s wrath grew so hot at his attempt to guard them from the
      small-pox that he could not walk the streets in peace. Whenever the
      venerable form of the old minister, meagre and haggard with fasts and
      vigils, was seen approaching, hisses were heard, and shouts of derision,
      and scornful and bitter laughter. The women snatched away their children
      from his path, lest he should do them a mischief. Still, however, bending
      his head meekly, and perhaps stretching out his hands to bless those who
      reviled him, he pursued his way. But the tears came into his eyes to think
      how blindly the people rejected the means of safety that were offered
      them.

Indeed, there were melancholy sights enough in the streets of Boston to
      draw forth the tears of a compassionate man. Over the door of almost every
      dwelling a red flag was fluttering in the air. This was the signal that
      the small-pox had entered the house and attacked some member of the
      family; or perhaps the whole family, old and young, were struggling at
      once with the pestilence. Friends and relatives, when they met one another
      in the streets, would hurry onward without a grasp of the hand or scarcely
      a word of greeting, lest they should catch or communicate the contagion;
      and often a coffin was borne hastily along.

“Alas! alas!” said Cotton Mather to himself, “what shall be done for this
      poor, misguided people? Oh that Providence would open their eyes, and
      enable them to discern good from evil!”

So furious, however, were the people, that they threatened vengeance
      against any person who should dare to practise inoculation, though it were
      only in his own family. This was a hard case for Cotton Mather, who saw no
      other way to rescue his poor child Samuel from the disease. But he
      resolved to save him, even if his house should be burned over his head.

“I will not be turned aside,” said he. “My townsmen shall see that I have
      faith in this thing, when I make the experiment on my beloved son, whose
      life is dearer to me than my own. And when I have saved Samuel,
      peradventure they will be persuaded to save themselves.”

Accordingly Samuel was inoculated; and so was Mr. Walter, a son-in-law of
      Cotton Mather. Doctor Boyleston, likewise, inoculated many persons; and
      while hundreds died who had caught the contagion from the garments of the
      sick, almost all were preserved who followed the wise physician’s advice.

But the people were not yet convinced of their mistake. One night a
      destructive little instrument, called a hand-grenade, was thrown into
      Cotton Mather’s window, and rolled under Grandfather’s chair. It was
      supposed to be filled with gunpowder, the explosion of which would have
      blown the poor minister to atoms. But the best informed historians are of
      opinion that the grenade contained only brimstone and assafoetida, and was
      meant to plague Cotton Mather with a very evil perfume.

This is no strange thing in human experience. Men who attempt to do the
      world mere good than the world is able entirely to comprehend are almost
      invariably held in bad odor. But yet, if the wise and good man can wait
      awhile, either the present generation or posterity will do him justice. So
      it proved in the case which we have been speaking of. In after years, when
      inoculation was universally practised, and thousands were saved from death
      by it, the people remembered old Cotton Mather, then sleeping in his
      grave. They acknowledged that the very thing for which they had so reviled
      and persecuted him was the best and wisest thing he ever did.

“No, Clara,” replied Grandfather. “But it is right that you should know
      what a dark shadow this disease threw over the times of our forefathers.
      And now, if you wish to learn more about Cotton Mather, you must read his
      biography, written by Mr. Peabody, of Springfield. You will find it very
      entertaining and instructive; but perhaps the writer is somewhat too harsh
      in his judgment of this singular man. He estimates him fairly, indeed, and
      understands him well; but he unriddles his character rather by acuteness
      than by sympathy. Now, his life should have been written by one who,
      knowing all his faults, would nevertheless love him.”

So Grandfather made an end of Cotton Mather, telling his auditors that he
      died in 1728, at the age of sixty-five, and bequeathed the chair to Elisha
      Cooke. This gentleman was a famous advocate of the people’s rights.

The same year William Burner, a son of the celebrated Bishop Burnet,
      arrived in Boston with the commission of governor. He was the first that
      had been appointed since the departure of Colonel Shute, Governor Burnet
      took up his residence with Mr. Cooke while the Province House was
      undergoing repairs. During this period he was always complimented with a
      seat in Grandfather’s chair; and so comfortable did he find it, that, on
      removing to the Province House, he could not bear to leave it behind him.
      Mr. Cooke, therefore, requested his acceptance of it.

“I should think,” said Laurence, “that the people would have petitioned
      the king always to appoint a native-born New-Englander to govern them.”

“Undoubtedly it was a grievance,” answered Grandfather, “to see men placed
      in this station who perhaps had neither talents nor virtues to fit them
      for it, and who certainly could have no natural affection for the country.
      The king generally bestowed the governorships of the American colonies
      upon needy noblemen, or hangers-on at court, or disbanded officers. The
      people knew that such persons would be very likely to make the good of the
      country subservient to the wishes of the king. The Legislature, therefore,
      endeavored to keep as much power as possible in their own hands, by
      refusing to settle a fixed salary upon the governors. It was thought
      better to pay them according to their deserts.”

Grandfather could not help smiling at the simplicity of Charley’s
      question. Nevertheless, it put the matter in a very plain point of view.

He then described the character of Governor Bur-net, representing him as a
      good scholar, possessed of much ability, and likewise of unspotted
      integrity. His story affords a striking example how unfortunate it is for
      a man, who is placed as ruler over a country to be compelled to aim at
      anything but the good of the people. Governor Burnet was so chained down
      by his instructions from the king that he could not act as he might
      otherwise have wished. Consequently, his whole term of office was wasted
      in quarrels with the Legislature.

“I am afraid, children,” said Grandfather, “that Governor Burner found but
      little rest or comfort in our old chair. Here he used to sit, dressed in a
      coat which was made of rough, shaggy cloth outside, but of smooth velvet
      within. It was said that his own character resembled that coat; for his
      outward manner was rough, but his inward disposition soft and kind. It is
      a pity that such a man could not have been kept free from trouble. But so
      harassing were his disputes with the representatives of the people that he
      fell into a fever, of which he died in 1729. The Legislature had refused
      him a salary while alive; but they appropriated money enough to give him a
      splendid and pompous funeral.”

And now Grandfather perceived that little Alice had fallen fast asleep,
      with her head upon his footstool. Indeed, as Clara observed, she had been
      sleeping from the time of Sir Hovenden Walker’s expedition against Quebec
      until the death of Governor Burnet,—a period of about eighteen
      years. And yet, after so long a nap, sweet little Alice was a
      golden-haired child of scarcely five years old.

“It puts me in mind,” said Laurence, “of the story of the enchanted
      princess, who slept many a hundred years, and awoke as young and beautiful
      as ever.”

A FEW evenings afterwards, cousin Clara happened inquire of Grandfather
      whether the old chair had never been present at a ball. At the same time
      little Alice brought forward a doll, with whom she had been holding a long
      conversation.

These questions led Grandfather to talk about the fashions and manners
      which now began to be introduced from England into the provinces. The
      simplicity of the good old Puritan times was fast disappearing. This was
      partly owing to the increasing number and wealth of the inhabitants, and
      to the additions which they continually received by the arrival and
      settlement of people from beyond the sea.

Another cause of a pompous and artificial mode of life, among those who
      could afford it, was that the example was set by the royal governors.
      Under the old charter, the governors were the representatives of the
      people, and therefore their way of living had probably been marked by a
      popular simplicity. But now, as they represented the person of the king,
      they thought it necessary to preserve the dignity of their station by the
      practice of high and gorgeous ceremonials. And, besides, the profitable
      offices under the government were filled by men who had lived in London,
      and had there contracted fashionable and luxurious habits of living which
      they would not now lay aside. The wealthy people of the province imitated
      them; and thus began a general change in social life.

“So, my dear Clara,” said Grandfather, “after our chair had entered the
      Province House, it must often have been present at balls and festivals;
      though I cannot give you a description of any particular one. But I doubt
      not that they were very magnificent; and slaves in gorgeous liveries
