Leonard Bilsiter was one of those people who have failed to
find this world attractive or interesting, and who have sought
compensation in an “unseen world” of their own
experience or imagination—or invention.  Children do
that sort of thing successfully, but children are content to
convince themselves, and do not vulgarise their beliefs by trying
to convince other people.  Leonard Bilsiter’s beliefs
were for “the few,” that is to say, anyone who would
listen to him.

His dabblings in the unseen might not have carried him beyond
the customary platitudes of the drawing-room visionary if
accident had not reinforced his stock-in-trade of mystical
lore.  In company with a friend, who was interested in a
Ural mining concern, he had made a trip across Eastern Europe at
a moment when the great Russian railway strike was developing
from a threat to a reality; its outbreak caught him on the return
journey, somewhere on the further side of Perm, and it was while
waiting for a couple of days at a wayside station in a state of
suspended locomotion that he made the acquaintance of a dealer in
harness and metalware, who profitably whiled away the tedium of
the long halt by initiating his English travelling companion in a
fragmentary system of folk-lore that he had picked up from
Trans-Baikal traders and natives.  Leonard returned to his
home circle garrulous about his Russian strike experiences, but
oppressively reticent about certain dark mysteries, which he
alluded to under the resounding title of Siberian Magic. 
The reticence wore off in a week or two under the influence of an
entire lack of general curiosity, and Leonard began to make more
detailed allusions to the enormous powers which this new esoteric
force, to use his own description of it, conferred on the
initiated few who knew how to wield it.  His aunt, Cecilia
Hoops, who loved sensation perhaps rather better than she loved
the truth, gave him as clamorous an advertisement as anyone could
wish for by retailing an account of how he had turned a vegetable
marrow into a wood pigeon before her very eyes.  As a
manifestation of the possession of supernatural powers, the story
was discounted in some quarters by the respect accorded to Mrs.
Hoops’ powers of imagination.

However divided opinion might be on the question of
Leonard’s status as a wonderworker or a charlatan, he
certainly arrived at Mary Hampton’s house-party with a
reputation for pre-eminence in one or other of those professions,
and he was not disposed to shun such publicity as might fall to
his share.  Esoteric forces and unusual powers figured
largely in whatever conversation he or his aunt had a share in,
and his own performances, past and potential, were the subject of
mysterious hints and dark avowals.

“I wish you would turn me into a wolf, Mr.
Bilsiter,” said his hostess at luncheon the day after his
arrival.

“A she-wolf, of course,” continued Mrs. Hampton;
“it would be too confusing to change one’s sex as
well as one’s species at a moment’s
notice.”

“I’m not jesting, I’m quite serious, I
assure you.  Only don’t do it to-day; we have only
eight available bridge players, and it would break up one of our
tables.  To-morrow we shall be a larger party. 
To-morrow night, after dinner—”

“In our present imperfect understanding of these hidden
forces I think one should approach them with humbleness rather
than mockery,” observed Leonard, with such severity that
the subject was forthwith dropped.

Clovis Sangrail had sat unusually silent during the discussion
on the possibilities of Siberian Magic; after lunch he
side-tracked Lord Pabham into the comparative seclusion of the
billiard-room and delivered himself of a searching question.

“Have you such a thing as a she-wolf in your collection
of wild animals?  A she-wolf of moderately good
temper?”

Lord Pabham considered.  “There is Louisa,”
he said, “a rather fine specimen of the timber-wolf. 
I got her two years ago in exchange for some Arctic foxes. 
Most of my animals get to be fairly tame before they’ve
been with me very long; I think I can say Louisa has an angelic
temper, as she-wolves go.  Why do you ask?”

“I was wondering whether you would lend her to me for
to-morrow night,” said Clovis, with the careless solicitude
of one who borrows a collar stud or a tennis racquet.

“Yes, wolves are nocturnal animals, so the late hours
won’t hurt her,” said Clovis, with the air of one who
has taken everything into consideration; “one of your men
could bring her over from Pabham Park after dusk, and with a
little help he ought to be able to smuggle her into the
conservatory at the same moment that Mary Hampton makes an
unobtrusive exit.”

Lord Pabham stared at Clovis for a moment in pardonable
bewilderment; then his face broke into a wrinkled network of
laughter.

“Oh, that’s your game, is it?  You are going
to do a little Siberian Magic on your own account.  And is
Mrs. Hampton willing to be a fellow-conspirator?”

By the following day the house-party had swollen to larger
proportions, and Bilsiter’s instinct for self-advertisement
expanded duly under the stimulant of an increased audience. 
At dinner that evening he held forth at length on the subject of
unseen forces and untested powers, and his flow of impressive
eloquence continued unabated while coffee was being served in the
drawing-room preparatory to a general migration to the
card-room.

His aunt ensured a respectful hearing for his utterances, but
her sensation-loving soul hankered after something more dramatic
than mere vocal demonstration.

“Won’t you do something to convince them of
your powers, Leonard?” she pleaded; “change something
into another shape.  He can, you know, if he only chooses
to,” she informed the company.

“Oh, do,” said Mavis Pellington earnestly, and her
request was echoed by nearly everyone present.  Even those
who were not open to conviction were perfectly willing to be
entertained by an exhibition of amateur conjuring.

“Has anyone present,” he asked, “got a
three-penny bit or some small object of no particular
value—?”

“You’re surely not going to make coins disappear,
or something primitive of that sort?” said Clovis
contemptuously.

“I think it very unkind of you not to carry out my
suggestion of turning me into a wolf,” said Mary Hampton,
as she crossed over to the conservatory to give her macaws their
usual tribute from the dessert dishes.

“I have already warned you of the danger of treating
these powers in a mocking spirit,” said Leonard
solemnly.

“I don’t believe you can do it,” laughed
Mary provocatively from the conservatory; “I dare you to do
it if you can.  I defy you to turn me into a
wolf.”

“Mrs. Hampton—” began Leonard with increased
solemnity, but he got no further.  A breath of chill air
seemed to rush across the room, and at the same time the macaws
broke forth into ear-splitting screams.

“What on earth is the matter with those confounded
birds, Mary?” exclaimed Colonel Hampton; at the same moment
an even more piercing scream from Mavis Pellington stampeded the
entire company from their seats.  In various attitudes of
helpless horror or instinctive defence they confronted the
evil-looking grey beast that was peering at them from amid a
setting of fern and azalea.

“Leonard!” she screamed shrilly to her nephew,
“turn it back into Mrs. Hampton at once!  It may fly
at us at any moment.  Turn it back!”

“What!” shouted Colonel Hampton,
“you’ve taken the abominable liberty of turning my
wife into a wolf, and now you stand there calmly and say you
can’t turn her back again!”

To do strict justice to Leonard, calmness was not a
distinguishing feature of his attitude at the moment.

“I assure you I didn’t turn Mrs. Hampton into a
wolf; nothing was farther from my intentions,” he
protested.

“Of course we must accept your assurance that you
didn’t turn Mrs. Hampton into a wolf,” said Clovis
politely, “but you will agree that appearances are against
you.”

“Are we to have all these recriminations with that beast
standing there ready to tear us to pieces?” wailed Mavis
indignantly.

“The wild beasts that I have been accustomed to,”
said Lord Pabham, “have come with proper credentials from
well-known dealers, or have been bred in my own menagerie. 
I’ve never before been confronted with an animal that walks
unconcernedly out of an azalea bush, leaving a charming and
popular hostess unaccounted for.  As far as one can judge
from outward characteristics,” he continued,
“it has the appearance of a well-grown female of the North
American timber-wolf, a variety of the common species canis
lupus.”

“Oh, never mind its Latin name,” screamed Mavis,
as the beast came a step or two further into the room;
“can’t you entice it away with food, and shut it up
where it can’t do any harm?”

“If it is really Mrs. Hampton, who has just had a very
good dinner, I don’t suppose food will appeal to it very
strongly,” said Clovis.

“Leonard,” beseeched Mrs. Hoops tearfully,
“even if this is none of your doing can’t you use
your great powers to turn this dreadful beast into something
harmless before it bites us all—a rabbit or
something?”

“I don’t suppose Colonel Hampton would care to
have his wife turned into a succession of fancy animals as though
we were playing a round game with her,” interposed
Clovis.

“Most wolves that I’ve had anything to do with
have been inordinately fond of sugar,” said Lord Pabham;
“if you like I’ll try the effect on this
one.”

He took a piece of sugar from the saucer of his coffee cup and
flung it to the expectant Louisa, who snapped it in
mid-air.  There was a sigh of relief from the company; a
wolf that ate sugar when it might at the least have been employed
in tearing macaws to pieces had already shed some of its
terrors.  The sigh deepened to a gasp of thanks-giving when
Lord Pabham decoyed the animal out of the room by a pretended
largesse of further sugar.  There was an instant rush to the
vacated conservatory.  There was no trace of Mrs. Hampton
except the plate containing the macaws’ supper.

“The door is locked on the inside!” exclaimed
Clovis, who had deftly turned the key as he affected to test
it.

“If you haven’t turned my wife into a wolf,”
said Colonel Hampton, “will you kindly explain where she
has disappeared to, since she obviously could not have gone
through a locked door?  I will not press you for an
explanation of how a North American timber-wolf suddenly appeared
in the conservatory, but I think I have some right to inquire
what has become of Mrs. Hampton.”

“If our hostess has really vanished out of human
form,” said Mrs. Hoops, “none of the ladies of the
party can very well remain.  I absolutely decline to be
chaperoned by a wolf!”

The correct etiquette to be observed under the unusual
circumstances received no further elucidation.  The sudden
entry of Mary Hampton deprived the discussion of its immediate
interest.

“Some one has mesmerised me,” she exclaimed
crossly; “I found myself in the game larder, of all places,
being fed with sugar by Lord Pabham.  I hate being
mesmerised, and the doctor has forbidden me to touch
sugar.”

The situation was explained to her, as far as it permitted of
anything that could be called explanation.

But Leonard had burned the boat in which he might now have
embarked on a sea of glory.  He could only shake his head
feebly.

“It was I who took that liberty,” said Clovis;
“you see, I happen to have lived for a couple of years in
North-Eastern Russia, and I have more than a tourist’s
acquaintance with the magic craft of that region.  One does
not care to speak about these strange powers, but once in a way,
when one hears a lot of nonsense being talked about them, one is
tempted to show what Siberian magic can accomplish in the hands
of someone who really understands it.  I yielded to that
temptation.  May I have some brandy? the effort has left me
rather faint.”

If Leonard Bilsiter could at that moment have transformed
Clovis into a cockroach and then have stepped on him he would
gladly have performed both operations.

“I never said I was going to die.  I am presumably
going to leave off being Laura, but I shall go on being
something.  An animal of some kind, I suppose.  You
see, when one hasn’t been very good in the life one has
just lived, one reincarnates in some lower organism.  And I
haven’t been very good, when one comes to think of
it.  I’ve been petty and mean and vindictive and all
that sort of thing when circumstances have seemed to warrant
it.”

“If you don’t mind my saying so,” observed
Laura, “Egbert is a circumstance that would warrant any
amount of that sort of thing.  You’re married to
him—that’s different; you’ve sworn to love,
honour, and endure him: I haven’t.”

“Oh, I daresay the wrongness has been on my part,”
admitted Laura dispassionately; “he has merely been the
extenuating circumstance.  He made a thin, peevish kind of
fuss, for instance, when I took the collie puppies from the farm
out for a run the other day.”

“They chased his young broods of speckled Sussex and
drove two sitting hens off their nests, besides running all over
the flower beds.  You know how devoted he is to his poultry
and garden.”

“Anyhow, he needn’t have gone on about it for the
entire evening and then have said, ‘Let’s say no more
about it’ just when I was beginning to enjoy the
discussion.  That’s where one of my petty vindictive
revenges came in,” added Laura with an unrepentant chuckle;
“I turned the entire family of speckled Sussex into his
seedling shed the day after the puppy episode.”

“It came quite easy,” said Laura; “two of
the hens pretended to be laying at the time, but I was
firm.”

“You see,” resumed Laura, “I really
have some grounds for supposing that my next incarnation
will be in a lower organism.  I shall be an animal of some
kind.  On the other hand, I haven’t been a bad sort in
my way, so I think I may count on being a nice animal, something
elegant and lively, with a love of fun.  An otter,
perhaps.”

“Personally I think an otter life would be rather
enjoyable,” continued Laura; “salmon to eat all the
year round, and the satisfaction of being able to fetch the trout
in their own homes without having to wait for hours till they
condescend to rise to the fly you’ve been dangling before
them; and an elegant svelte figure—”

“Think of the otter hounds,” interposed Amanda;
“how dreadful to be hunted and harried and finally worried
to death!”

“Rather fun with half the neighbourhood looking on, and
anyhow not worse than this Saturday-to-Tuesday business of dying
by inches; and then I should go on into something else.  If
I had been a moderately good otter I suppose I should get back
into human shape of some sort; probably something rather
primitive—a little brown, unclothed Nubian boy, I should
think.”

“I wish you would be serious,” sighed Amanda;
“you really ought to be if you’re only going to live
till Tuesday.”

“So dreadfully upsetting,” Amanda complained to
her uncle-in-law, Sir Lulworth Quayne.  “I’ve
asked quite a lot of people down for golf and fishing, and the
rhododendrons are just looking their best.”

“Laura always was inconsiderate,” said Sir
Lulworth; “she was born during Goodwood week, with an
Ambassador staying in the house who hated babies.”

“She had the maddest kind of ideas,” said Amanda;
“do you know if there was any insanity in her
family?”

“Insanity?  No, I never heard of any.  Her
father lives in West Kensington, but I believe he’s sane on
all other subjects.”

“One meets with those ideas of reincarnation so
frequently, even in the West,” said Sir Lulworth,
“that one can hardly set them down as being mad.  And
Laura was such an unaccountable person in this life that I should
not like to lay down definite rules as to what she might be doing
in an after state.”

“You think she really might have passed into some animal
form?” asked Amanda.  She was one of those who shape
their opinions rather readily from the standpoint of those around
them.

Just then Egbert entered the breakfast-room, wearing an air of
bereavement that Laura’s demise would have been
insufficient, in itself, to account for.

“Four of my speckled Sussex have been killed,” he
exclaimed; “the very four that were to go to the show on
Friday.  One of them was dragged away and eaten right in the
middle of that new carnation bed that I’ve been to such
trouble and expense over.  My best flower bed and my best
fowls singled out for destruction; it almost seems as if the
brute that did the deed had special knowledge how to be as
devastating as possible in a short space of time.”

“No,” said Egbert, “there were marks of
webbed feet all over the place, and we followed the tracks down
to the stream at the bottom of the garden; evidently an
otter.”

Egbert was too agitated to eat any breakfast, and went out to
superintend the strengthening of the poultry yard defences.

“I think she might at least have waited till the funeral
was over,” said Amanda in a scandalised voice.

“It’s her own funeral, you know,” said Sir
Lulworth; “it’s a nice point in etiquette how far one
ought to show respect to one’s own mortal
remains.”

Disregard for mortuary convention was carried to further
lengths next day; during the absence of the family at the funeral
ceremony the remaining survivors of the speckled Sussex were
massacred.  The marauder’s line of retreat seemed to
have embraced most of the flower beds on the lawn, but the
strawberry beds in the lower garden had also suffered.

“On no account!  You can’t dream of such a
thing!” exclaimed Amanda.  “I mean, it
wouldn’t do, so soon after a funeral in the
house.”

“There’s been so little water in the stream
lately,” objected Amanda; “it seems hardly sporting
to hunt an animal when it has so little chance of taking refuge
anywhere.”

“Good gracious!” fumed Egbert, “I’m
not thinking about sport.  I want to have the animal killed
as soon as possible.”

Even Amanda’s opposition weakened when, during church
time on the following Sunday, the otter made its way into the
house, raided half a salmon from the larder and worried it into
scaly fragments on the Persian rug in Egbert’s studio.

“We shall have it hiding under our beds and biting
pieces out of our feet before long,” said Egbert, and from
what Amanda knew of this particular otter she felt that the
possibility was not a remote one.

On the evening preceding the day fixed for the hunt Amanda
spent a solitary hour walking by the banks of the stream, making
what she imagined to be hound noises.  It was charitably
supposed by those who overheard her performance, that she was
practising for farmyard imitations at the forth-coming village
entertainment.

“Pity you weren’t out; we had quite a good
day.  We found at once, in the pool just below your
garden.”

“Rather.  A fine she-otter.  Your husband got
rather badly bitten in trying to ‘tail it.’ 
Poor beast, I felt quite sorry for it, it had such a human look
in its eyes when it was killed.  You’ll call me silly,
but do you know who the look reminded me of?  My dear woman,
what is the matter?”

When Amanda had recovered to a certain extent from her attack
of nervous prostration Egbert took her to the Nile Valley to
recuperate.  Change of scene speedily brought about the
desired recovery of health and mental balance.  The
escapades of an adventurous otter in search of a variation of
diet were viewed in their proper light.  Amanda’s
normally placid temperament reasserted itself.  Even a
hurricane of shouted curses, coming from her husband’s
dressing-room, in her husband’s voice, but hardly in his
usual vocabulary, failed to disturb her serenity as she made a
leisurely toilet one evening in a Cairo hotel.

“What little beast?” asked Amanda, suppressing a
desire to laugh; Egbert’s language was so hopelessly
inadequate to express his outraged feelings.

“There is a back way on to the lawn,” said Mrs.
Philidore Stossen to her daughter, “through a small grass
paddock and then through a walled fruit garden full of gooseberry
bushes.  I went all over the place last year when the family
were away.  There is a door that opens from the fruit garden
into a shrubbery, and once we emerge from there we can mingle
with the guests as if we had come in by the ordinary way. 
It’s much safer than going in by the front entrance and
running the risk of coming bang up against the hostess; that
would be so awkward when she doesn’t happen to have invited
us.”

“To a garden party, yes; to the garden party of
the season, certainly not.  Every one of any consequence in
the county, with the exception of ourselves, has been asked to
meet the Princess, and it would be far more troublesome to invent
explanations as to why we weren’t there than to get in by a
roundabout way.  I stopped Mrs. Cuvering in the road
yesterday and talked very pointedly about the Princess.  If
she didn’t choose to take the hint and send me an
invitation it’s not my fault, is it?  Here we are: we
just cut across the grass and through that little gate into the
garden.”

Mrs. Stossen and her daughter, suitably arrayed for a county
garden party function with an infusion of Almanack de Gotha,
sailed through the narrow grass paddock and the ensuing
gooseberry garden with the air of state barges making an
unofficial progress along a rural trout stream.  There was a
certain amount of furtive haste mingled with the stateliness of
their advance, as though hostile search-lights might be turned on
them at any moment; and, as a matter of fact, they were not
unobserved.  Matilda Cuvering, with the alert eyes of
thirteen years old and the added advantage of an exalted position
in the branches of a medlar tree, had enjoyed a good view of the
Stossen flanking movement and had foreseen exactly where it would
break down in execution.

“They’ll find the door locked, and they’ll
jolly well have to go back the way they came,” she remarked
to herself.  “Serves them right for not coming in by
the proper entrance.  What a pity Tarquin Superbus
isn’t loose in the paddock.  After all, as every one
else is enjoying themselves, I don’t see why Tarquin
shouldn’t have an afternoon out.”

Matilda was of an age when thought is action; she slid down
from the branches of the medlar tree, and when she clambered back
again Tarquin, the huge white Yorkshire boar-pig, had exchanged
the narrow limits of his stye for the wider range of the grass
paddock.  The discomfited Stossen expedition, returning in
recriminatory but otherwise orderly retreat from the unyielding
obstacle of the locked door, came to a sudden halt at the gate
dividing the paddock from the gooseberry garden.

“It’s there now, anyhow,” said her
daughter.  “What on earth are we to do?  I wish
we had never come.”

The boar-pig had drawn nearer to the gate for a closer
inspection of the human intruders, and stood champing his jaws
and blinking his small red eyes in a manner that was doubtless
intended to be disconcerting, and, as far as the Stossens were
concerned, thoroughly achieved that result.

“If they think they’re going to drive him away by
reciting lists of the kings of Israel and Judah they’re
laying themselves out for disappointment,” observed Matilda
from her seat in the medlar tree.  As she made the
observation aloud Mrs. Stossen became for the first time aware of
her presence.  A moment or two earlier she would have been
anything but pleased at the discovery that the garden was not as
deserted as it looked, but now she hailed the fact of the
child’s presence on the scene with absolute relief.

“Permettez-moi expliquer.  You see,
I’m rather under a cloud,” said Matilda. 
“I’m staying with my aunt, and I was told I must
behave particularly well to-day, as lots of people were coming
for a garden party, and I was told to imitate Claude,
that’s my young cousin, who never does anything wrong
except by accident, and then is always apologetic about it. 
It seems they thought I ate too much raspberry trifle at lunch,
and they said Claude never eats too much raspberry trifle. 
Well, Claude always goes to sleep for half an hour after lunch,
because he’s told to, and I waited till he was asleep, and
tied his hands and started forcible feeding with a whole
bucketful of raspberry trifle that they were keeping for the
garden-party.  Lots of it went on to his sailor-suit and
some of it on to the bed, but a good deal went down
Claude’s throat, and they can’t say again that he has
never been known to eat too much raspberry trifle.  That is
why I am not allowed to go to the party, and as an additional
punishment I must speak French all the afternoon. 
I’ve had to tell you all this in English, as there were
words like ‘forcible feeding’ that I didn’t
know the French for; of course I could have invented them, but if
I had said nourriture obligatoire you wouldn’t have
had the least idea what I was talking about.  Mais
maintenant, nous parlons français.”

“Oh, very well, trés bien,” said
Mrs. Stossen reluctantly; in moments of flurry such French as she
knew was not under very good control. 
“Là, à l’autre
côté de la porte, est un
cochon—”

“Une bête,” corrected Matilda;
“a pig is masculine as long as you call it a pig, but if
you lose your temper with it and call it a ferocious beast it
becomes one of us at once.  French is a dreadfully unsexing
language.”

“For goodness’ sake let us talk English
then,” said Mrs. Stossen.  “Is there any way out
of this garden except through the paddock where the pig
is?”

“Dressed as we are we could hardly do that,” said
Mrs. Stossen; it was difficult to imagine her doing it in any
costume.

“Shall I recite to you to make the time pass
quicker?” asked Matilda obligingly. 
“‘Belinda, the little Breadwinner,’ is
considered my best piece, or, perhaps, it ought to be something
in French.  Henri Quatre’s address to his soldiers is
the only thing I really know in that language.”

“If you will go and fetch some one to drive that animal
away I will give you something to buy yourself a nice
present,” said Mrs. Stossen.

“That is the most practical suggestion you have made yet
for getting out of the garden,” she remarked cheerfully;
“Claude and I are collecting money for the Children’s
Fresh Air Fund, and we are seeing which of us can collect the
biggest sum.”

“I shall be very glad to contribute half a crown, very
glad indeed,” said Mrs. Stossen, digging that coin out of
the depths of a receptacle which formed a detached outwork of her
toilet.

“Claude is a long way ahead of me at present,”
continued Matilda, taking no notice of the suggested offering;
“you see, he’s only eleven, and has golden hair, and
those are enormous advantages when you’re on the collecting
job.  Only the other day a Russian lady gave him ten
shillings.  Russians understand the art of giving far better
than we do.  I expect Claude will net quite twenty-five
shillings this afternoon; he’ll have the field to himself,
and he’ll be able to do the pale, fragile,
not-long-for-this-world business to perfection after his
raspberry trifle experience.  Yes, he’ll be
quite two pounds ahead of me by now.”

With much probing and plucking and many regretful murmurs the
beleaguered ladies managed to produce seven-and-sixpence between
them.

“I could not do violence to my conscience for anything
less than ten shillings,” she announced stiffly.

Mother and daughter muttered certain remarks under their
breath, in which the word “beast” was prominent, and
probably had no reference to Tarquin.

“I find I have got another half-crown,”
said Mrs. Stossen in a shaking voice; “here you are. 
Now please fetch some one quickly.”

Matilda slipped down from the tree, took possession of the
donation, and proceeded to pick up a handful of over-ripe medlars
from the grass at her feet.  Then she climbed over the gate
and addressed herself affectionately to the boar-pig.

Tarquin couldn’t.  By dint of throwing the fruit in
front of him at judicious intervals Matilda decoyed him back to
his stye, while the delivered captives hurried across the
paddock.

“Well, I never!  The little minx!” exclaimed
Mrs. Stossen when she was safely on the high road. 
“The animal wasn’t savage at all, and as for the ten
shillings, I don’t believe the Fresh Air Fund will see a
penny of it!”

There she was unwarrantably harsh in her judgment.  If
you examine the books of the fund you will find the
acknowledgment: “Collected by Miss Matilda Cuvering, 2s.
6d.”

The hunting season had come to an end, and the Mullets had not
succeeded in selling the Brogue.  There had been a kind of
tradition in the family for the past three or four years, a sort
of fatalistic hope, that the Brogue would find a purchaser before
the hunting was over; but seasons came and went without anything
happening to justify such ill-founded optimism.  The animal
had been named Berserker in the earlier stages of its career; it
had been rechristened the Brogue later on, in recognition of the
fact that, once acquired, it was extremely difficult to get rid
of.  The unkinder wits of the neighbourhood had been known
to suggest that the first letter of its name was
superfluous.  The Brogue had been variously described in
sale catalogues as a light-weight hunter, a lady’s hack,
and, more simply, but still with a touch of imagination, as a
useful brown gelding, standing 15.1.  Toby Mullet had ridden
him for four seasons with the West Wessex; you can ride almost
any sort of horse with the West Wessex as long as it is an animal
that knows the country.  The Brogue knew the country
intimately, having personally created most of the gaps that were
to be met with in banks and hedges for many miles round. 
His manners and characteristics were not ideal in the hunting
field, but he was probably rather safer to ride to hounds than he
was as a hack on country roads.  According to the Mullet
family, he was not really road-shy, but there were one or two
objects of dislike that brought on sudden attacks of what Toby
called the swerving sickness.  Motors and cycles he treated
with tolerant disregard, but pigs, wheelbarrows, piles of stones
by the roadside, perambulators in a village street, gates painted
too aggressively white, and sometimes, but not always, the newer
kind of beehives, turned him aside from his tracks in vivid
imitation of the zigzag course of forked lightning.  If a
pheasant rose noisily from the other side of a hedgerow the
Brogue would spring into the air at the same moment, but this may
have been due to a desire to be companionable.  The Mullet
family contradicted the widely prevalent report that the horse
was a confirmed crib-biter.

It was about the third week in May that Mrs. Mullet, relict of
the late Sylvester Mullet, and mother of Toby and a bunch of
daughters, assailed Clovis Sangrail on the outskirts of the
village with a breathless catalogue of local happenings.

“You know our new neighbour, Mr. Penricarde?” she
vociferated; “awfully rich, owns tin mines in Cornwall,
middle-aged and rather quiet.  He’s taken the Red
House on a long lease and spent a lot of money on alterations and
improvements.  Well, Toby’s sold him the
Brogue!”

Clovis spent a moment or two in assimilating the astonishing
news; then he broke out into unstinted congratulation.  If
he had belonged to a more emotional race he would probably have
kissed Mrs. Mullet.

“How wonderfully lucky to have pulled it off at
last!  Now you can buy a decent animal.  I’ve
always said that Toby was clever.  Ever so many
congratulations.”

“Don’t congratulate me.  It’s the most
unfortunate thing that could have happened!” said Mrs.
Mullet dramatically.

“Mr. Penricarde,” said Mrs. Mullet, sinking her
voice to what she imagined to be an impressive whisper, though it
rather resembled a hoarse, excited squeak, “Mr. Penricarde
has just begun to pay attentions to Jessie.  Slight at
first, but now unmistakable.  I was a fool not to have seen
it sooner.  Yesterday, at the Rectory garden party, he asked
her what her favourite flowers were, and she told him carnations,
and to-day a whole stack of carnations has arrived, clove and
malmaison and lovely dark red ones, regular exhibition blooms,
and a box of chocolates that he must have got on purpose from
London.  And he’s asked her to go round the links with
him to-morrow.  And now, just at this critical moment, Toby
has sold him that animal.  It’s a calamity!”

“I’ve got a houseful of daughters,” said
Mrs. Mullet, “and I’ve been trying—well, not to
get them off my hands, of course, but a husband or two
wouldn’t be amiss among the lot of them; there are six of
them, you know.”

“I don’t know,” said Clovis,
“I’ve never counted, but I expect you’re right
as to the number; mothers generally know these things.”

“And now,” continued Mrs. Mullet, in her tragic
whisper, “when there’s a rich husband-in-prospect
imminent on the horizon Toby goes and sells him that miserable
animal.  It will probably kill him if he tries to ride it;
anyway it will kill any affection he might have felt towards any
member of our family.  What is to be done?  We
can’t very well ask to have the horse back; you see, we
praised it up like anything when we thought there was a chance of
his buying it, and said it was just the animal to suit
him.”

“Couldn’t you steal it out of his stable and send
it to grass at some farm miles away?” suggested Clovis;
“write ‘Votes for Women’ on the stable door,
and the thing would pass for a Suffragette outrage.  No one
who knew the horse could possibly suspect you of wanting to get
it back again.”

“Every newspaper in the country would ring with the
affair,” said Mrs. Mullet; “can’t you imagine
the headline, ‘Valuable Hunter Stolen by
Suffragettes’?  The police would scour the countryside
till they found the animal.”

“Well, Jessie must try and get it back from Penricarde
on the plea that it’s an old favourite.  She can say
it was only sold because the stable had to be pulled down under
the terms of an old repairing lease, and that now it has been
arranged that the stable is to stand for a couple of years
longer.”

“It sounds a queer proceeding to ask for a horse back
when you’ve just sold him,” said Mrs. Mullet,
“but something must be done, and done at once.  The
man is not used to horses, and I believe I told him it was as
quiet as a lamb.  After all, lambs go kicking and twisting
about as if they were demented, don’t they?”

“It’s all right about the proposal,” she
announced; “he came out with it at the sixth hole.  I
said I must have time to think it over.  I accepted him at
the seventh.”

“My dear,” said her mother, “I think a
little more maidenly reserve and hesitation would have been
advisable, as you’ve known him so short a time.  You
might have waited till the ninth hole.”

“The seventh is a very long hole,” said Jessie;
“besides, the tension was putting us both off our
game.  By the time we’d got to the ninth hole
we’d settled lots of things.  The honeymoon is to be
spent in Corsica, with perhaps a flying visit to Naples if we
feel like it, and a week in London to wind up with.  Two of
his nieces are to be asked to be bridesmaids, so with our lot
there will be seven, which is rather a lucky number.  You
are to wear your pearl grey, with any amount of Honiton lace
jabbed into it.  By the way, he’s coming over this
evening to ask your consent to the whole affair.  So far
all’s well, but about the Brogue it’s a different
matter.  I told him the legend about the stable, and how
keen we were about buying the horse back, but he seems equally
keen on keeping it.  He said he must have horse exercise now
that he’s living in the country, and he’s going to
start riding to-morrow.  He’s ridden a few times in
the Row, on an animal that was accustomed to carry octogenarians
and people undergoing rest cures, and that’s about all his
experience in the saddle—oh, and he rode a pony once in
Norfolk, when he was fifteen and the pony twenty-four; and
to-morrow he’s going to ride the Brogue!  I shall be a
widow before I’m married, and I do so want to see what
Corsica’s like; it looks so silly on the map.”

“Nobody can ride that animal with any safety,”
said Mrs. Mullet, “except Toby, and he knows by long
experience what it is going to shy at, and manages to swerve at
the same time.”

“I did hint to Mr. Penricarde—to Vincent, I should
say—that the Brogue didn’t like white gates,”
said Jessie.

“White gates!” exclaimed Mrs. Mullet; “did
you mention what effect a pig has on him?  He’ll have
to go past Lockyer’s farm to get to the high road, and
there’s sure to be a pig or two grunting about in the
lane.”

“It’s obvious that Penricarde mustn’t be
allowed to go out on that animal,” said Clovis, “at
least not till Jessie has married him, and tired of him.  I
tell you what: ask him to a picnic to-morrow, starting at an
early hour; he’s not the sort to go out for a ride before
breakfast.  The day after I’ll get the rector to drive
him over to Crowleigh before lunch, to see the new cottage
hospital they’re building there.  The Brogue will be
standing idle in the stable and Toby can offer to exercise it;
then it can pick up a stone or something of the sort and go
conveniently lame.  If you hurry on the wedding a bit the
lameness fiction can be kept up till the ceremony is safely
over.”

It was nobody’s fault that the rain came down in
torrents the next morning, making a picnic a fantastic
impossibility.  It was also nobody’s fault, but sheer
ill-luck, that the weather cleared up sufficiently in the
afternoon to tempt Mr. Penricarde to make his first essay with
the Brogue.  They did not get as far as the pigs at
Lockyer’s farm; the rectory gate was painted a dull
unobtrusive green, but it had been white a year or two ago, and
the Brogue never forgot that he had been in the habit of making a
violent curtsey, a back-pedal and a swerve at this particular
point of the road.  Subsequently, there being apparently no
further call on his services, he broke his way into the rectory
orchard, where he found a hen turkey in a coop; later visitors to
the orchard found the coop almost intact, but very little left of
the turkey.

Mr. Penricarde, a little stunned and shaken, and suffering
from a bruised knee and some minor damages, good-naturedly
ascribed the accident to his own inexperience with horses and
country roads, and allowed Jessie to nurse him back into complete
recovery and golf-fitness within something less than a week.

In the list of wedding presents which the local newspaper
published a fortnight or so later appeared the following
item:

“You’ve rather done it, haven’t you?”
he chuckled; “Jane Martlet has only been here five days,
and she never stays less than a fortnight, even when she’s
asked definitely for a week.  You’ll never get her out
of the house by Thursday.”

“Why should I?” asked Mrs. Sangrail; “she
and Dora are good friends, aren’t they?  They used to
be, as far as I remember.”

“They used to be; that’s what makes them all the
more bitter now.  Each feels that she has nursed a viper in
her bosom.  Nothing fans the flame of human resentment so
much as the discovery that one’s bosom has been utilised as
a snake sanatorium.”

“It was a bronze Leghorn or some such exotic breed, and
Dora sold it to Jane at a rather exotic price.  They both go
in for prize poultry, you know, and Jane thought she was going to
get her money back in a large family of pedigree chickens. 
The bird turned out to be an abstainer from the egg habit, and
I’m told that the letters which passed between the two
women were a revelation as to how much invective could be got on
to a sheet of notepaper.”

“People tried,” said Clovis, “but it must
have been rather like composing the storm music of the
‘Fliegende Holländer.’  Jane was willing to
take back some of her most libellous remarks if Dora would take
back the hen, but Dora said that would be owning herself in the
wrong, and you know she’d as soon think of owning slum
property in Whitechapel as do that.”

“It’s a most awkward situation,” said Mrs.
Sangrail.  “Do you suppose they won’t speak to
one another?”

“On the contrary, the difficulty will be to get them to
leave off.  Their remarks on each other’s conduct and
character have hitherto been governed by the fact that only four
ounces of plain speaking can be sent through the post for a
penny.”

“I can’t put Dora off,” said Mrs.
Sangrail.  “I’ve already postponed her visit
once, and nothing short of a miracle would make Jane leave before
her self-allotted fortnight is over.”

“Miracles are rather in my line,” said
Clovis.  “I don’t pretend to be very hopeful in
this case but I’ll do my best.”

“Servants are a bit of a nuisance,” muttered
Clovis, as he sat in the smoking-room after lunch, talking
fitfully to Jane Martlet in the intervals of putting together the
materials of a cocktail, which he had irreverently patented under
the name of an Ella Wheeler Wilcox.  It was partly
compounded of old brandy and partly of curaçoa; there were
other ingredients, but they were never indiscriminately
revealed.

“Servants a nuisance!” exclaimed Jane, bounding
into the topic with the exuberant plunge of a hunter when it
leaves the high road and feels turf under its hoofs; “I
should think they were!  The trouble I’ve had in
getting suited this year you would hardly believe.  But I
don’t see what you have to complain of—your mother is
so wonderfully lucky in her servants.  Sturridge, for
instance—he’s been with you for years, and I’m
sure he’s a paragon as butlers go.”

“That’s just the trouble,” said
Clovis.  “It’s when servants have been with you
for years that they become a really serious nuisance.  The
‘here to-day and gone to-morrow’ sort don’t
matter—you’ve simply got to replace them; it’s
the stayers and the paragons that are the real worry.”

“That doesn’t prevent them from giving
trouble.  Now, you’ve mentioned Sturridge—it was
Sturridge I was particularly thinking of when I made the
observation about servants being a nuisance.”

“I know he’s excellent, and we just couldn’t
get along without him; he’s the one reliable element in
this rather haphazard household.  But his very orderliness
has had an effect on him.  Have you ever considered what it
must be like to go on unceasingly doing the correct thing in the
correct manner in the same surroundings for the greater part of a
lifetime?  To know and ordain and superintend exactly what
silver and glass and table linen shall be used and set out on
what occasions, to have cellar and pantry and plate-cupboard
under a minutely devised and undeviating administration, to be
noiseless, impalpable, omnipresent, and, as far as your own
department is concerned, omniscient?”

“On most points he’s thoroughly sane and
reliable,” said Clovis, “but at times he is subject
to the most obstinate delusions, and on those occasions he
becomes not merely a nuisance but a decided
embarrassment.”

“Unfortunately they usually centre round one of the
guests of the house party, and that is where the awkwardness
comes in.  For instance, he took it into his head that
Matilda Sheringham was the Prophet Elijah, and as all that he
remembered about Elijah’s history was the episode of the
ravens in the wilderness he absolutely declined to interfere with
what he imagined to be Matilda’s private catering
arrangements, wouldn’t allow any tea to be sent up to her
in the morning, and if he was waiting at table he passed her over
altogether in handing round the dishes.”

“Oh, Matilda got fed, after a fashion, but it was judged
to be best for her to cut her visit short.  It was really
the only thing to be done,” said Clovis with some
emphasis.

“I shouldn’t have done that,” said Jane,
“I should have humoured him in some way.  I certainly
shouldn’t have gone away.”

“It is not always wise to humour people when they get
these ideas into their heads.  There’s no knowing to
what lengths they may go if you encourage them.”

“One can never be certain,” said Clovis;
“now and then he gets some idea about a guest which might
take an unfortunate turn.  That is precisely what is
worrying me at the present moment.”

“What, has he taken a fancy about some one here
now?” asked Jane excitedly; “how thrilling!  Do
tell me who it is.”

“Queen Anne!  What an idea.  But, anyhow,
there’s nothing dangerous about her; she’s such a
colourless personality.”

“Ghost?  Dear no.  No one ever heard of a
ghost that came down to breakfast and ate kidneys and toast and
honey with a healthy appetite.  No, it’s the fact of
you being so very much alive and flourishing that perplexes and
annoys him.  All his life he has been accustomed to look on
Queen Anne as the personification of everything that is dead and
done with, ‘as dead as Queen Anne,’ you know; and now
he has to fill your glass at lunch and dinner and listen to your
accounts of the gay time you had at the Dublin Horse Show, and
naturally he feels that something’s very wrong with
you.”

“I didn’t get really alarmed about it till lunch
to-day,” said Clovis; “I caught him glowering at you
with a very sinister look and muttering: ‘Ought to be dead
long ago, she ought, and some one should see to it.’ 
That’s why I mentioned the matter to you.”

“My mother mustn’t hear a word about it,”
said Clovis earnestly; “it would upset her
dreadfully.  She relies on Sturridge for
everything.”

“You’ll have to keep a sharp look-out all the time
and be on your guard to frustrate any murderous attack,”
said Jane, adding in a tone of weak obstinacy: “It’s
a dreadful situation to be in, with a mad butler dangling over
you like the sword of What’s-his-name, but I’m
certainly not going to cut my visit short.”

It was in the hall the next morning after a late breakfast
that Clovis had his final inspiration as he stood engaged in
coaxing rust spots from an old putter.

“Writing letters in the morning-room, sir,” said
Sturridge, announcing a fact of which his questioner was already
aware.

“She wants to copy the inscription on that old
basket-hilted sabre,” said Clovis, pointing to a venerable
weapon hanging on the wall.  “I wish you’d take
it to her; my hands are all over oil.  Take it without the
sheath, it will be less trouble.”

The butler drew the blade, still keen and bright in its
well-cared for old age, and carried it into the
morning-room.  There was a door near the writing-table
leading to a back stairway; Jane vanished through it with such
lightning rapidity that the butler doubted whether she had seen
him come in.  Half an hour later Clovis was driving her and
her hastily-packed luggage to the station.

“Mother will be awfully vexed when she comes back from
her ride and finds you have gone,” he observed to the
departing guest, “but I’ll make up some story about
an urgent wire having called you away.  It wouldn’t do
to alarm her unnecessarily about Sturridge.”

Jane sniffed slightly at Clovis’ ideas of unnecessary
alarm, and was almost rude to the young man who came round with
thoughtful inquiries as to luncheon-baskets.

The miracle lost some of its usefulness from the fact that
Dora wrote the same day postponing the date of her visit, but, at
any rate, Clovis holds the record as the only human being who
ever hustled Jane Martlet out of the time-table of her
migrations.

“My aunt will be down presently, Mr. Nuttel,” said
a very self-possessed young lady of fifteen; “in the
meantime you must try and put up with me.”

Framton Nuttel endeavoured to say the correct something which
should duly flatter the niece of the moment without unduly
discounting the aunt that was to come.  Privately he doubted
more than ever whether these formal visits on a succession of
total strangers would do much towards helping the nerve cure
which he was supposed to be undergoing.

“I know how it will be,” his sister had said when
he was preparing to migrate to this rural retreat; “you
will bury yourself down there and not speak to a living soul, and
your nerves will be worse than ever from moping.  I shall
just give you letters of introduction to all the people I know
there.  Some of them, as far as I can remember, were quite
nice.”

Framton wondered whether Mrs. Sappleton, the lady to whom he
was presenting one of the letters of introduction, came into the
nice division.

“Do you know many of the people round here?” asked
the niece, when she judged that they had had sufficient silent
communion.

“Hardly a soul,” said Framton.  “My
sister was staying here, at the rectory, you know, some four
years ago, and she gave me letters of introduction to some of the
people here.”

“Only her name and address,” admitted the
caller.  He was wondering whether Mrs. Sappleton was in the
married or widowed state.  An undefinable something about
the room seemed to suggest masculine habitation.

“Her great tragedy happened just three years ago,”
said the child; “that would be since your sister’s
time.”

“You may wonder why we keep that window wide open on an
October afternoon,” said the niece, indicating a large
French window that opened on to a lawn.

“It is quite warm for the time of the year,” said
Framton; “but has that window got anything to do with the
tragedy?”

“Out through that window, three years ago to a day, her
husband and her two young brothers went off for their day’s
shooting.  They never came back.  In crossing the moor
to their favourite snipe-shooting ground they were all three
engulfed in a treacherous piece of bog.  It had been that
dreadful wet summer, you know, and places that were safe in other
years gave way suddenly without warning.  Their bodies were
never recovered.  That was the dreadful part of
it.”  Here the child’s voice lost its
self-possessed note and became falteringly human. 
“Poor aunt always thinks that they will come back some day,
they and the little brown spaniel that was lost with them, and
walk in at that window just as they used to do.  That is why
the window is kept open every evening till it is quite
dusk.  Poor dear aunt, she has often told me how they went
out, her husband with his white waterproof coat over his arm, and
Ronnie, her youngest brother, singing ‘Bertie, why do you
bound?’ as he always did to tease her, because she said it
got on her nerves.  Do you know, sometimes on still, quiet
evenings like this, I almost get a creepy feeling that they will
all walk in through that window—”

She broke off with a little shudder.  It was a relief to
Framton when the aunt bustled into the room with a whirl of
apologies for being late in making her appearance.

“I hope you don’t mind the open window,”
said Mrs. Sappleton briskly; “my husband and brothers will
be home directly from shooting, and they always come in this
way.  They’ve been out for snipe in the marshes
to-day, so they’ll make a fine mess over my poor
carpets.  So like you men-folk, isn’t it?”

She rattled on cheerfully about the shooting and the scarcity
of birds, and the prospects for duck in the winter.  To
Framton it was all purely horrible.  He made a desperate but
only partially successful effort to turn the talk on to a less
ghastly topic; he was conscious that his hostess was giving him
only a fragment of her attention, and her eyes were constantly
straying past him to the open window and the lawn beyond. 
It was certainly an unfortunate coincidence that he should have
paid his visit on this tragic anniversary.

“The doctors agree in ordering me complete rest, an
absence of mental excitement, and avoidance of anything in the
nature of violent physical exercise,” announced Framton,
who laboured under the tolerably widespread delusion that total
strangers and chance acquaintances are hungry for the least
detail of one’s ailments and infirmities, their cause and
cure.  “On the matter of diet they are not so much in
agreement,” he continued.

“No?” said Mrs. Sappleton, in a voice which only
replaced a yawn at the last moment.  Then she suddenly
brightened into alert attention—but not to what Framton was
saying.

“Here they are at last!” she cried. 
“Just in time for tea, and don’t they look as if they
were muddy up to the eyes!”

Framton shivered slightly and turned towards the niece with a
look intended to convey sympathetic comprehension.  The
child was staring out through the open window with dazed horror
in her eyes.  In a chill shock of nameless fear Framton
swung round in his seat and looked in the same direction.

In the deepening twilight three figures were walking across
the lawn towards the window; they all carried guns under their
arms, and one of them was additionally burdened with a white coat
hung over his shoulders.  A tired brown spaniel kept close
at their heels.  Noiselessly they neared the house, and then
a hoarse young voice chanted out of the dusk: “I said,
Bertie, why do you bound?”

Framton grabbed wildly at his stick and hat; the hall-door,
the gravel-drive, and the front gate were dimly-noted stages in
his headlong retreat.  A cyclist coming along the road had
to run into the hedge to avoid an imminent collision.

“Here we are, my dear,” said the bearer of the
white mackintosh, coming in through the window; “fairly
muddy, but most of it’s dry.  Who was that who bolted
out as we came up?”

“A most extraordinary man, a Mr. Nuttel,” said
Mrs. Sappleton; “could only talk about his illnesses, and
dashed off without a word of good-bye or apology when you
arrived.  One would think he had seen a ghost.”

“I expect it was the spaniel,” said the niece
calmly; “he told me he had a horror of dogs.  He was
once hunted into a cemetery somewhere on the banks of the Ganges
by a pack of pariah dogs, and had to spend the night in a newly
dug grave with the creatures snarling and grinning and foaming
just above him.  Enough to make anyone lose their
nerve.”

The great galleon lay in semi-retirement under the sand and
weed and water of the northern bay where the fortune of war and
weather had long ago ensconced it.  Three and a quarter
centuries had passed since the day when it had taken the high
seas as an important unit of a fighting squadron—precisely
which squadron the learned were not agreed.  The galleon had
brought nothing into the world, but it had, according to
tradition and report, taken much out of it.  But how
much?  There again the learned were in disagreement. 
Some were as generous in their estimate as an income-tax
assessor, others applied a species of higher criticism to the
submerged treasure chests, and debased their contents to the
currency of goblin gold.  Of the former school was Lulu,
Duchess of Dulverton.

The Duchess was not only a believer in the existence of a
sunken treasure of alluring proportions; she also believed that
she knew of a method by which the said treasure might be
precisely located and cheaply disembedded.  An aunt on her
mother’s side of the family had been Maid of Honour at the
Court of Monaco, and had taken a respectful interest in the
deep-sea researches in which the Throne of that country,
impatient perhaps of its terrestrial restrictions, was wont to
immerse itself.  It was through the instrumentality of this
relative that the Duchess learned of an invention, perfected and
very nearly patented by a Monegaskan savant, by means of which
the home-life of the Mediterranean sardine might be studied at a
depth of many fathoms in a cold white light of more than
ball-room brilliancy.  Implicated in this invention (and, in
the Duchess’s eyes, the most attractive part of it) was an
electric suction dredge, specially designed for dragging to the
surface such objects of interest and value as might be found in
the more accessible levels of the ocean-bed.  The rights of
the invention were to be acquired for a matter of eighteen
hundred francs, and the apparatus for a few thousand more. 
The Duchess of Dulverton was rich, as the world counted wealth;
she nursed the hope, of being one day rich at her own
computation.  Companies had been formed and efforts had been
made again and again during the course of three centuries to
probe for the alleged treasures of the interesting galleon; with
the aid of this invention she considered that she might go to
work on the wreck privately and independently.  After all,
one of her ancestors on her mother’s side was descended
from Medina Sidonia, so she was of opinion that she had as much
right to the treasure as anyone.  She acquired the invention
and bought the apparatus.

Among other family ties and encumbrances, Lulu possessed a
nephew, Vasco Honiton, a young gentleman who was blessed with a
small income and a large circle of relatives, and lived
impartially and precariously on both.  The name Vasco had
been given him possibly in the hope that he might live up to its
adventurous tradition, but he limited himself strictly to the
home industry of adventurer, preferring to exploit the assured
rather than to explore the unknown.  Lulu’s
intercourse with him had been restricted of recent years to the
negative processes of being out of town when he called on her,
and short of money when he wrote to her.  Now, however, she
bethought herself of his eminent suitability for the direction of
a treasure-seeking experiment; if anyone could extract gold from
an unpromising situation it would certainly be Vasco—of
course, under the necessary safeguards in the way of
supervision.  Where money was in question Vasco’s
conscience was liable to fits of obstinate silence.

Somewhere on the west coast of Ireland the Dulverton property
included a few acres of shingle, rock, and heather, too barren to
support even an agrarian outrage, but embracing a small and
fairly deep bay where the lobster yield was good in most
seasons.  There was a bleak little house on the property,
and for those who liked lobsters and solitude, and were able to
accept an Irish cook’s ideas as to what might be
perpetrated in the name of mayonnaise, Innisgluther was a
tolerable exile during the summer months.  Lulu seldom went
there herself, but she lent the house lavishly to friends and
relations.  She put it now at Vasco’s disposal.

“It will be the very place to practise and experiment
with the salvage apparatus,” she said; “the bay is
quite deep in places, and you will be able to test everything
thoroughly before starting on the treasure hunt.”

“The apparatus works beautifully,” he informed his
aunt; “the deeper one got the clearer everything
grew.  We found something in the way of a sunken wreck to
operate on, too!”

“No! really?” said Lulu; “poor Billy
Yuttley’s boat.  I remember it went down somewhere off
that coast some three years ago.  His body was washed ashore
at the Point.  People said at the time that the boat was
capsized intentionally—a case of suicide, you know. 
People always say that sort of thing when anything tragic
happens.”

“In a locker of the Sub-Rosa I found a
water-tight strong-box.  It contained papers.” 
Vasco paused with dramatic effect and searched for a moment in
the inner breast-pocket of his coat.  He drew out a folded
slip of paper.  The Duchess snatched at it in almost
indecent haste and moved appreciably nearer the fireplace.

“Oh no,” said Vasco carelessly, “that is a
list of the well-known people who would be involved in a very
disagreeable scandal if the Sub-Rosa’s papers were
made public.  I’ve put you at the head of it,
otherwise it follows alphabetical order.”

The Duchess gazed helplessly at the string of names, which
seemed for the moment to include nearly every one she knew. 
As a matter of fact, her own name at the head of the list
exercised an almost paralysing effect on her thinking
faculties.

“Of course you have destroyed the papers?” she
asked, when she had somewhat recovered herself.  She was
conscious that she made the remark with an entire lack of
conviction.

“Then you should put them out of harm’s way at
once.  Supposing anything should leak out, think of all
these poor, unfortunate people who would be involved in the
disclosures,” and Lulu tapped the list with an agitated
gesture.

“Unfortunate, perhaps, but not poor,” corrected
Vasco; “if you read the list carefully you’ll notice
that I haven’t troubled to include anyone whose financial
standing isn’t above question.”

Lulu glared at her nephew for some moments in silence. 
Then she asked hoarsely: “What are you going to
do?”

“Nothing—for the remainder of my life,” he
answered meaningly.  “A little hunting,
perhaps,” he continued, “and I shall have a villa at
Florence.  The Villa Sub-Rosa would sound rather quaint and
picturesque, don’t you think, and quite a lot of people
would be able to attach a meaning to the name.  And I
suppose I must have a hobby; I shall probably collect
Raeburns.”

Lulu’s relative, who lived at the Court of Monaco, got
quite a snappish answer when she wrote recommending some further
invention in the realm of marine research.

The farmhouse kitchen probably stood where it did as a matter
of accident or haphazard choice; yet its situation might have
been planned by a master-strategist in farmhouse
architecture.  Dairy and poultry-yard, and herb garden, and
all the busy places of the farm seemed to lead by easy access
into its wide flagged haven, where there was room for everything
and where muddy boots left traces that were easily swept
away.  And yet, for all that it stood so well in the centre
of human bustle, its long, latticed window, with the wide
window-seat, built into an embrasure beyond the huge fireplace,
looked out on a wild spreading view of hill and heather and
wooded combe.  The window nook made almost a little room in
itself, quite the pleasantest room in the farm as far as
situation and capabilities went.  Young Mrs. Ladbruk, whose
husband had just come into the farm by way of inheritance, cast
covetous eyes on this snug corner, and her fingers itched to make
it bright and cosy with chintz curtains and bowls of flowers, and
a shelf or two of old china.  The musty farm parlour,
looking out on to a prim, cheerless garden imprisoned within
high, blank walls, was not a room that lent itself readily either
to comfort or decoration.

“When we are more settled I shall work wonders in the
way of making the kitchen habitable,” said the young woman
to her occasional visitors.  There was an unspoken wish in
those words, a wish which was unconfessed as well as
unspoken.  Emma Ladbruk was the mistress of the farm;
jointly with her husband she might have her say, and to a certain
extent her way, in ordering its affairs.  But she was not
mistress of the kitchen.

On one of the shelves of an old dresser, in company with
chipped sauce-boats, pewter jugs, cheese-graters, and paid bills,
rested a worn and ragged Bible, on whose front page was the
record, in faded ink, of a baptism dated ninety-four years
ago.  “Martha Crale” was the name written on
that yellow page.  The yellow, wrinkled old dame who hobbled
and muttered about the kitchen, looking like a dead autumn leaf
which the winter winds still pushed hither and thither, had once
been Martha Crale; for seventy odd years she had been Martha
Mountjoy.  For longer than anyone could remember she had
pattered to and fro between oven and wash-house and dairy, and
out to chicken-run and garden, grumbling and muttering and
scolding, but working unceasingly.  Emma Ladbruk, of whose
coming she took as little notice as she would of a bee wandering
in at a window on a summer’s day, used at first to watch
her with a kind of frightened curiosity.  She was so old and
so much a part of the place, it was difficult to think of her
exactly as a living thing.  Old Shep, the white-nozzled,
stiff-limbed collie, waiting for his time to die, seemed almost
more human than the withered, dried-up old woman.  He had
been a riotous, roystering puppy, mad with the joy of life, when
she was already a tottering, hobbling dame; now he was just a
blind, breathing carcase, nothing more, and she still worked with
frail energy, still swept and baked and washed, fetched and
carried.  If there were something in these wise old dogs
that did not perish utterly with death, Emma used to think to
herself, what generations of ghost-dogs there must be out on
those hills, that Martha had reared and fed and tended and spoken
a last good-bye word to in that old kitchen.  And what
memories she must have of human generations that had passed away
in her time.  It was difficult for anyone, let alone a
stranger like Emma, to get her to talk of the days that had been;
her shrill, quavering speech was of doors that had been left
unfastened, pails that had got mislaid, calves whose feeding-time
was overdue, and the various little faults and lapses that
chequer a farmhouse routine.  Now and again, when election
time came round, she would unstore her recollections of the old
names round which the fight had waged in the days gone by. 
There had been a Palmerston, that had been a name down Tiverton
way; Tiverton was not a far journey as the crow flies, but to
Martha it was almost a foreign country.  Later there had
been Northcotes and Aclands, and many other newer names that she
had forgotten; the names changed, but it was always Libruls and
Toories, Yellows and Blues.  And they always quarrelled and
shouted as to who was right and who was wrong.  The one they
quarrelled about most was a fine old gentleman with an angry
face—she had seen his picture on the walls.  She had
seen it on the floor too, with a rotten apple squashed over it,
for the farm had changed its politics from time to time. 
Martha had never been on one side or the other; none of
“they” had ever done the farm a stroke of good. 
Such was her sweeping verdict, given with all a peasant’s
distrust of the outside world.

When the half-frightened curiosity had somewhat faded away,
Emma Ladbruk was uncomfortably conscious of another feeling
towards the old woman.  She was a quaint old tradition,
lingering about the place, she was part and parcel of the farm
itself, she was something at once pathetic and
picturesque—but she was dreadfully in the way.  Emma
had come to the farm full of plans for little reforms and
improvements, in part the result of training in the newest ways
and methods, in part the outcome of her own ideas and
fancies.  Reforms in the kitchen region, if those deaf old
ears could have been induced to give them even a hearing, would
have met with short shrift and scornful rejection, and the
kitchen region spread over the zone of dairy and market business
and half the work of the household.  Emma, with the latest
science of dead-poultry dressing at her finger-tips, sat by, an
unheeded watcher, while old Martha trussed the chickens for the
market-stall as she had trussed them for nearly fourscore
years—all leg and no breast.  And the hundred hints
anent effective cleaning and labour-lightening and the things
that make for wholesomeness which the young woman was ready to
impart or to put into action dropped away into nothingness before
that wan, muttering, unheeding presence.  Above all, the
coveted window corner, that was to be a dainty, cheerful oasis in
the gaunt old kitchen, stood now choked and lumbered with a
litter of odds and ends that Emma, for all her nominal authority,
would not have dared or cared to displace; over them seemed to be
spun the protection of something that was like a human
cobweb.  Decidedly Martha was in the way.  It would
have been an unworthy meanness to have wished to see the span of
that brave old life shortened by a few paltry months, but as the
days sped by Emma was conscious that the wish was there, disowned
though it might be, lurking at the back of her mind.

She felt the meanness of the wish come over her with a qualm
of self-reproach one day when she came into the kitchen and found
an unaccustomed state of things in that usually busy
quarter.  Old Martha was not working.  A basket of corn
was on the floor by her side, and out in the yard the poultry
were beginning to clamour a protest of overdue
feeding-time.  But Martha sat huddled in a shrunken bunch on
the window seat, looking out with her dim old eyes as though she
saw something stranger than the autumn landscape.

“’Tis death, ’tis death a-coming,”
answered the quavering voice; “I knew ’twere
coming.  I knew it.  ’Tweren’t for nothing
that old Shep’s been howling all morning.  An’
last night I heard the screech-owl give the death-cry, and there
were something white as run across the yard yesterday;
’tweren’t a cat nor a stoat, ’twere
something.  The fowls knew ’twere something; they all
drew off to one side.  Ay, there’s been
warnings.  I knew it were a-coming.”

The young woman’s eyes clouded with pity.  The old
thing sitting there so white and shrunken had once been a merry,
noisy child, playing about in lanes and hay-lofts and farmhouse
garrets; that had been eighty odd years ago, and now she was just
a frail old body cowering under the approaching chill of the
death that was coming at last to take her.  It was not
probable that much could be done for her, but Emma hastened away
to get assistance and counsel.  Her husband, she knew, was
down at a tree-felling some little distance off, but she might
find some other intelligent soul who knew the old woman better
than she did.  The farm, she soon found out, had that
faculty common to farmyards of swallowing up and losing its human
population.  The poultry followed her in interested fashion,
and swine grunted interrogations at her from behind the bars of
their styes, but barnyard and rickyard, orchard and stables and
dairy, gave no reward to her search.  Then, as she retraced
her steps towards the kitchen, she came suddenly on her cousin,
young Mr. Jim, as every one called him, who divided his time
between amateur horse-dealing, rabbit-shooting, and flirting with
the farm maids.

“I’m afraid old Martha is dying,” said
Emma.  Jim was not the sort of person to whom one had to
break news gently.

“She may be actually dying at this moment, or it may
just be the beginning of the break-up,” persisted Emma,
with a feeling of contempt for the slowness and dulness of the
young man.

“It don’t look like it,” he said, nodding
towards the yard.  Emma turned to catch the meaning of his
remark.  Old Martha stood in the middle of a mob of poultry
scattering handfuls of grain around her.  The turkey-cock,
with the bronzed sheen of his feathers and the purple-red of his
wattles, the gamecock, with the glowing metallic lustre of his
Eastern plumage, the hens, with their ochres and buffs and umbers
and their scarlet combs, and the drakes, with their bottle-green
heads, made a medley of rich colour, in the centre of which the
old woman looked like a withered stalk standing amid a riotous
growth of gaily-hued flowers.  But she threw the grain
deftly amid the wilderness of beaks, and her quavering voice
carried as far as the two people who were watching her.  She
was still harping on the theme of death coming to the farm.

“’Tis young Mister Ladbruk,” she shrilled
back; “they’ve just a-carried his body in.  Run
out of the way of a tree that was coming down an’ ran
hisself on to an iron post.  Dead when they picked un
up.  Aye, I knew ’twere coming.”

And she turned to fling a handful of barley at a belated group
of guinea-fowl that came racing toward her.

The farm was a family property, and passed to the
rabbit-shooting cousin as the next-of-kin.  Emma Ladbruk
drifted out of its history as a bee that had wandered in at an
open window might flit its way out again.  On a cold grey
morning she stood waiting, with her boxes already stowed in the
farm cart, till the last of the market produce should be ready,
for the train she was to catch was of less importance than the
chickens and butter and eggs that were to be offered for
sale.  From where she stood she could see an angle of the
long latticed window that was to have been cosy with curtains and
gay with bowls of flowers.  Into her mind came the thought
that for months, perhaps for years, long after she had been
utterly forgotten, a white, unheeding face would be seen peering
out through those latticed panes, and a weak muttering voice
would be heard quavering up and down those flagged
passages.  She made her way to a narrow barred casement that
opened into the farm larder.  Old Martha was standing at a
table trussing a pair of chickens for the market stall as she had
trussed them for nearly fourscore years.

“I’ve asked Latimer Springfield to spend Sunday
with us and stop the night,” announced Mrs. Durmot at the
breakfast-table.

“Exactly; the poll is on Wednesday, and the poor man
will have worked himself to a shadow by that time.  Imagine
what electioneering must be like in this awful soaking rain,
going along slushy country roads and speaking to damp audiences
in draughty schoolrooms, day after day for a fortnight. 
He’ll have to put in an appearance at some place of worship
on Sunday morning, and he can come to us immediately afterwards
and have a thorough respite from everything connected with
politics.  I won’t let him even think of them. 
I’ve had the picture of Cromwell dissolving the Long
Parliament taken down from the staircase, and even the portrait
of Lord Rosebery’s ‘Ladas’ removed from the
smoking-room.  And Vera,” added Mrs. Durmot, turning
to her sixteen-year-old niece, “be careful what colour
ribbon you wear in your hair; not blue or yellow on any account;
those are the rival party colours, and emerald green or orange
would be almost as bad, with this Home Rule business to the
fore.”

Latimer Springfield was a rather cheerless, oldish young man,
who went into politics somewhat in the spirit in which other
people might go into half-mourning.  Without being an
enthusiast, however, he was a fairly strenuous plodder, and Mrs.
Durmot had been reasonably near the mark in asserting that he was
working at high pressure over this election.  The restful
lull which his hostess enforced on him was decidedly welcome, and
yet the nervous excitement of the contest had too great a hold on
him to be totally banished.

“I know he’s going to sit up half the night
working up points for his final speeches,” said Mrs. Durmot
regretfully; “however, we’ve kept politics at
arm’s length all the afternoon and evening.  More than
that we cannot do.”

Latimer had scarcely shut his bedroom door before he was
immersed in a sheaf of notes and pamphlets, while a fountain-pen
and pocket-book were brought into play for the due marshalling of
useful facts and discreet fictions.  He had been at work for
perhaps thirty-five minutes, and the house was seemingly
consecrated to the healthy slumber of country life, when a
stifled squealing and scuffling in the passage was followed by a
loud tap at his door.  Before he had time to answer, a
much-encumbered Vera burst into the room with the question;
“I say, can I leave these here?”

Latimer was moderately fond of animals, and particularly
interested in small livestock rearing from the economic point of
view; in fact, one of the pamphlets on which he was at that
moment engaged warmly advocated the further development of the
pig and poultry industry in our rural districts; but he was
pardonably unwilling to share even a commodious bedroom with
samples of henroost and stye products.

“Wouldn’t they be happier somewhere
outside?” he asked, tactfully expressing his own preference
in the matter in an apparent solicitude for theirs.

“There is no outside,” said Vera impressively,
“nothing but a waste of dark, swirling waters.  The
reservoir at Brinkley has burst.”

“Well, there isn’t now, it’s jolly well all
over the place, and as we stand particularly low we’re the
centre of an inland sea just at present.  You see the river
has overflowed its banks as well.”

“Heaps, I should say.  The second housemaid has
already identified three bodies that have floated past the
billiard-room window as being the young man she’s engaged
to.  Either she’s engaged to a large assortment of the
population round here or else she’s very careless at
identification.  Of course it may be the same body coming
round again and again in a swirl; I hadn’t thought of
that.”

“But we ought to go out and do rescue work,
oughtn’t we?” said Latimer, with the instinct of a
Parliamentary candidate for getting into the local limelight.

“We can’t,” said Vera decidedly, “we
haven’t any boats and we’re cut off by a raging
torrent from any human habitation.  My aunt particularly
hoped you would keep to your room and not add to the confusion,
but she thought it would be so kind of you if you would take in
Hartlepool’s Wonder, the gamecock, you know, for the
night.  You see, there are eight other gamecocks, and they
fight like furies if they get together, so we’re putting
one in each bedroom.  The fowl-houses are all flooded out,
you know.  And then I thought perhaps you wouldn’t
mind taking in this wee piggie; he’s rather a little love,
but he has a vile temper.  He gets that from his
mother—not that I like to say things against her when
she’s lying dead and drowned in her stye, poor thing. 
What he really wants is a man’s firm hand to keep him in
order.  I’d try and grapple with him myself, only
I’ve got my chow in my room, you know, and he goes for pigs
wherever he finds them.”

“Couldn’t the pig go in the bathroom?” asked
Latimer faintly, wishing that he had taken up as determined a
stand on the subject of bedroom swine as the chow had.

“The bathroom?” Vera laughed shrilly. 
“It’ll be full of Boy Scouts till morning if the hot
water holds out.”

“Yes, thirty of them came to rescue us while the water
was only waist-high; then it rose another three feet or so and we
had to rescue them.  We’re giving them hot baths in
batches and drying their clothes in the hot-air cupboard, but, of
course, drenched clothes don’t dry in a minute, and the
corridor and staircase are beginning to look like a bit of coast
scenery by Tuke.  Two of the boys are wearing your Melton
overcoat; I hope you don’t mind.”

“You’ll take every care of Hartlepool’s
Wonder, won’t you?” said Vera.  “His
mother took three firsts at Birmingham, and he was second in the
cockerel class last year at Gloucester.  He’ll
probably roost on the rail at the bottom of your bed.  I
wonder if he’d feel more at home if some of his wives were
up here with him?  The hens are all in the pantry, and I
think I could pick out Hartlepool Helen; she’s his
favourite.”

Latimer showed a belated firmness on the subject of Hartlepool
Helen, and Vera withdrew without pressing the point, having first
settled the gamecock on his extemporised perch and taken an
affectionate farewell of the pigling.  Latimer undressed and
got into bed with all due speed, judging that the pig would abate
its inquisitorial restlessness once the light was turned
out.  As a substitute for a cosy, straw-bedded sty the room
offered, at first inspection, few attractions, but the
disconsolate animal suddenly discovered an appliance in which the
most luxuriously contrived piggeries were notably
deficient.  The sharp edge of the underneath part of the bed
was pitched at exactly the right elevation to permit the pigling
to scrape himself ecstatically backwards and forwards, with an
artistic humping of the back at the crucial moment and an
accompanying gurgle of long-drawn delight.  The gamecock,
who may have fancied that he was being rocked in the branches of
a pine-tree, bore the motion with greater fortitude than Latimer
was able to command.  A series of slaps directed at the
pig’s body were accepted more as an additional and pleasing
irritant than as a criticism of conduct or a hint to desist;
evidently something more than a man’s firm hand was needed
to deal with the case.  Latimer slipped out of bed in search
of a weapo' WHERE id = 'd00a72c9-4c8f-44a9-9e4f-e77bd3c50827';
