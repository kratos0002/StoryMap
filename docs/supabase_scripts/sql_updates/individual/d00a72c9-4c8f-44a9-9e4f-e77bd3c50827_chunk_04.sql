“Well, yes,” admitted the aunt lamely, “but
I don’t think they would have run quite so fast to her help
if they had not liked her so much.”

“It’s the stupidest story I’ve ever
heard,” said the bigger of the small girls, with immense
conviction.

The smaller girl made no actual comment on the story, but she
had long ago recommenced a murmured repetition of her favourite
line.

“It’s a very difficult thing to tell stories that
children can both understand and appreciate,” she said
stiffly.

“Once upon a time,” began the bachelor,
“there was a little girl called Bertha, who was
extraordinarily good.”

The children’s momentarily-aroused interest began at
once to flicker; all stories seemed dreadfully alike, no matter
who told them.

“She did all that she was told, she was always truthful,
she kept her clothes clean, ate milk puddings as though they were
jam tarts, learned her lessons perfectly, and was polite in her
manners.”

There was a wave of reaction in favour of the story; the word
horrible in connection with goodness was a novelty that commended
itself.  It seemed to introduce a ring of truth that was
absent from the aunt’s tales of infant life.

“She was so good,” continued the bachelor,
“that she won several medals for goodness, which she always
wore, pinned on to her dress.  There was a medal for
obedience, another medal for punctuality, and a third for good
behaviour.  They were large metal medals and they clicked
against one another as she walked.  No other child in the
town where she lived had as many as three medals, so everybody
knew that she must be an extra good child.”

“Everybody talked about her goodness, and the Prince of
the country got to hear about it, and he said that as she was so
very good she might be allowed once a week to walk in his park,
which was just outside the town.  It was a beautiful park,
and no children were ever allowed in it, so it was a great honour
for Bertha to be allowed to go there.”

“There were no sheep in the park,” said the
bachelor, “because the Prince’s mother had once had a
dream that her son would either be killed by a sheep or else by a
clock falling on him.  For that reason the Prince never kept
a sheep in his park or a clock in his palace.”

“He is still alive, so we can’t tell whether the
dream will come true,” said the bachelor unconcernedly;
“anyway, there were no sheep in the park, but there were
lots of little pigs running all over the place.”

“Black with white faces, white with black spots, black
all over, grey with white patches, and some were white all
over.”

The story-teller paused to let a full idea of the park’s
treasures sink into the children’s imaginations; then he
resumed:

“Bertha was rather sorry to find that there were no
flowers in the park.  She had promised her aunts, with tears
in her eyes, that she would not pick any of the kind
Prince’s flowers, and she had meant to keep her promise, so
of course it made her feel silly to find that there were no
flowers to pick.”

“Because the pigs had eaten them all,” said the
bachelor promptly.  “The gardeners had told the Prince
that you couldn’t have pigs and flowers, so he decided to
have pigs and no flowers.”

There was a murmur of approval at the excellence of the
Prince’s decision; so many people would have decided the
other way.

“There were lots of other delightful things in the
park.  There were ponds with gold and blue and green fish in
them, and trees with beautiful parrots that said clever things at
a moment’s notice, and humming birds that hummed all the
popular tunes of the day.  Bertha walked up and down and
enjoyed herself immensely, and thought to herself: ‘If I
were not so extraordinarily good I should not have been allowed
to come into this beautiful park and enjoy all that there is to
be seen in it,’ and her three medals clinked against one
another as she walked and helped to remind her how very good she
really was.  Just then an enormous wolf came prowling into
the park to see if it could catch a fat little pig for its
supper.”

“Mud-colour all over, with a black tongue and pale grey
eyes that gleamed with unspeakable ferocity.  The first
thing that it saw in the park was Bertha; her pinafore was so
spotlessly white and clean that it could be seen from a great
distance.  Bertha saw the wolf and saw that it was stealing
towards her, and she began to wish that she had never been
allowed to come into the park.  She ran as hard as she
could, and the wolf came after her with huge leaps and
bounds.  She managed to reach a shrubbery of myrtle bushes
and she hid herself in one of the thickest of the bushes. 
The wolf came sniffing among the branches, its black tongue
lolling out of its mouth and its pale grey eyes glaring with
rage.  Bertha was terribly frightened, and thought to
herself: ‘If I had not been so extraordinarily good I
should have been safe in the town at this moment.’ 
However, the scent of the myrtle was so strong that the wolf
could not sniff out where Bertha was hiding, and the bushes were
so thick that he might have hunted about in them for a long time
without catching sight of her, so he thought he might as well go
off and catch a little pig instead.  Bertha was trembling
very much at having the wolf prowling and sniffing so near her,
and as she trembled the medal for obedience clinked against the
medals for good conduct and punctuality.  The wolf was just
moving away when he heard the sound of the medals clinking and
stopped to listen; they clinked again in a bush quite near
him.  He dashed into the bush, his pale grey eyes gleaming
with ferocity and triumph, and dragged Bertha out and devoured
her to the last morsel.  All that was left of her were her
shoes, bits of clothing, and the three medals for
goodness.”

“It is the most beautiful story that I ever
heard,” said the bigger of the small girls, with immense
decision.

“A most improper story to tell to young children! 
You have undermined the effect of years of careful
teaching.”

“At any rate,” said the bachelor, collecting his
belongings preparatory to leaving the carriage, “I kept
them quiet for ten minutes, which was more than you were able to
do.”

“Unhappy woman!” he observed to himself as he
walked down the platform of Templecombe station; “for the
next six months or so those children will assail her in public
with demands for an improper story!”

Treddleford sat in an easeful arm-chair in front of a
slumberous fire, with a volume of verse in his hand and the
comfortable consciousness that outside the club windows the rain
was dripping and pattering with persistent purpose.  A
chill, wet October afternoon was merging into a bleak, wet
October evening, and the club smoking-room seemed warmer and
cosier by contrast.  It was an afternoon on which to be
wafted away from one’s climatic surroundings, and
“The Golden Journey to Samarkand” promised to bear
Treddleford well and bravely into other lands and under other
skies.  He had already migrated from London the rain-swept
to Bagdad the Beautiful, and stood by the Sun Gate “in the
olden time” when an icy breath of imminent annoyance seemed
to creep between the book and himself.  Amblecope, the man
with the restless, prominent eyes and the mouth ready mobilised
for conversational openings, had planted himself in a
neighbouring arm-chair.  For a twelvemonth and some odd
weeks Treddleford had skilfully avoided making the acquaintance
of his voluble fellow-clubman; he had marvellously escaped from
the infliction of his relentless record of tedious personal
achievements, or alleged achievements, on golf links, turf, and
gaming table, by flood and field and covert-side.  Now his
season of immunity was coming to an end.  There was no
escape; in another moment he would be numbered among those who
knew Amblecope to speak to—or rather, to suffer being
spoken to.

The intruder was armed with a copy of Country Life, not
for purposes of reading, but as an aid to conversational
ice-breaking.

“Rather a good portrait of Throstlewing,” he
remarked explosively, turning his large challenging eyes on
Treddleford; “somehow it reminds me very much of
Yellowstep, who was supposed to be such a good thing for the
Grand Prix in 1903.  Curious race that was; I suppose
I’ve seen every race for the Grand Prix for the
last—”

“Be kind enough never to mention the Grand Prix in my
hearing,” said Treddleford desperately; “it awakens
acutely distressing memories.  I can’t explain why
without going into a long and complicated story.”

“Oh, certainly, certainly,” said Amblecope
hastily; long and complicated stories that were not told by
himself were abominable in his eyes.  He turned the pages of
Country Life and became spuriously interested in the
picture of a Mongolian pheasant.

“Not a bad representation of the Mongolian
variety,” he exclaimed, holding it up for his
neighbour’s inspection.  “They do very well in
some covers.  Take some stopping too, once they’re
fairly on the wing.  I suppose the biggest bag I ever made
in two successive days—”

“My aunt, who owns the greater part of
Lincolnshire,” broke in Treddleford, with dramatic
abruptness, “possesses perhaps the most remarkable record
in the way of a pheasant bag that has ever been achieved. 
She is seventy-five and can’t hit a thing, but she always
goes out with the guns.  When I say she can’t hit a
thing, I don’t mean to say that she doesn’t
occasionally endanger the lives of her fellow-guns, because that
wouldn’t be true.  In fact, the chief Government Whip
won’t allow Ministerial M.P.’s to go out with her;
‘We don’t want to incur by-elections
needlessly,’ he quite reasonably observed.  Well, the
other day she winged a pheasant, and brought it to earth with a
feather or two knocked out of it; it was a runner, and my aunt
saw herself in danger of being done out of about the only bird
she’d hit during the present reign.  Of course she
wasn’t going to stand that; she followed it through bracken
and brushwood, and when it took to the open country and started
across a ploughed field she jumped on to the shooting pony and
went after it.  The chase was a long one, and when my aunt
at last ran the bird to a standstill she was nearer home than she
was to the shooting party; she had left that some five miles
behind her.”

“The story rests on my aunt’s authority,”
said Treddleford coldly, “and she is local vice-president
of the Young Women’s Christian Association.  She
trotted three miles or so to her home, and it was not till the
middle of the afternoon that it was discovered that the lunch for
the entire shooting party was in a pannier attached to the
pony’s saddle.  Anyway, she got her bird.”

“Some birds, of course, take a lot of killing,”
said Amblecope; “so do some fish.  I remember once I
was fishing in the Exe, lovely trout stream, lots of fish, though
they don’t run to any great size—”

“One of them did,” announced Treddleford, with
emphasis.  “My uncle, the Bishop of Southmolton, came
across a giant trout in a pool just off the main stream of the
Exe near Ugworthy; he tried it with every kind of fly and worm
every day for three weeks without an atom of success, and then
Fate intervened on his behalf.  There was a low stone bridge
just over this pool, and on the last day of his fishing holiday a
motor van ran violently into the parapet and turned completely
over; no one was hurt, but part of the parapet was knocked away,
and the entire load that the van was carrying was pitched over
and fell a little way into the pool.  In a couple of minutes
the giant trout was flapping and twisting on bare mud at the
bottom of a waterless pool, and my uncle was able to walk down to
him and fold him to his breast.  The van-load consisted of
blotting-paper, and every drop of water in that pool had been
sucked up into the mass of spilt cargo.”

There was silence for nearly half a minute in the
smoking-room, and Treddleford began to let his mind steal back
towards the golden road that led to Samarkand.  Amblecope,
however, rallied, and remarked in a rather tired and dispirited
voice:

“Talking of motor accidents, the narrowest squeak I ever
had was the other day, motoring with old Tommy Yarby in North
Wales.  Awfully good sort, old Yarby, thorough good
sportsman, and the best—”

“It was in North Wales,” said Treddleford,
“that my sister met with her sensational carriage accident
last year.  She was on her way to a garden-party at Lady
Nineveh’s, about the only garden-party that ever comes to
pass in those parts in the course of the year, and therefore a
thing that she would have been very sorry to miss.  She was
driving a young horse that she’d only bought a week or two
previously, warranted to be perfectly steady with motor traffic,
bicycles, and other common objects of the roadside.  The
animal lived up to its reputation, and passed the most explosive
of motor-bikes with an indifference that almost amounted to
apathy.  However, I suppose we all draw the line somewhere,
and this particular cob drew it at travelling wild beast
shows.  Of course my sister didn’t know that, but she
knew it very distinctly when she turned a sharp corner and found
herself in a mixed company of camels, piebald horses, and
canary-coloured vans.  The dogcart was overturned in a ditch
and kicked to splinters, and the cob went home across
country.  Neither my sister nor the groom was hurt, but the
problem of how to get to the Nineveh garden-party, some three
miles distant, seemed rather difficult to solve; once there, of
course, my sister would easily find some one to drive her
home.  ‘I suppose you wouldn’t care for the loan
of a couple of my camels?’ the showman suggested, in
humorous sympathy.  ‘I would,’ said my sister,
who had ridden camel-back in Egypt, and she overruled the
objections of the groom, who hadn’t.  She picked out
two of the most presentable-looking of the beasts and had them
dusted and made as tidy as was possible at short notice, and set
out for the Nineveh mansion.  You may imagine the sensation
that her small but imposing caravan created when she arrived at
the hall door.  The entire garden-party flocked up to
gape.  My sister was rather glad to slip down from her
camel, and the groom was thankful to scramble down from
his.  Then young Billy Doulton, of the Dragoon Guards, who
has been a lot at Aden and thinks he knows camel-language
backwards, thought he would show off by making the beasts kneel
down in orthodox fashion.  Unfortunately camel
words-of-command are not the same all the world over; these were
magnificent Turkestan camels, accustomed to stride up the stony
terraces of mountain passes, and when Doulton shouted at them
they went side by side up the front steps, into the entrance
hall, and up the grand staircase.  The German governess met
them just at the turn of the corridor.  The Ninevehs nursed
her with devoted attention for weeks, and when I last heard from
them she was well enough to go about her duties again, but the
doctor says she will always suffer from Hagenbeck
heart.”

Amblecope got up from his chair and moved to another part of
the room.  Treddleford reopened his book and betook himself
once more across

For a blessed half-hour he disported himself in imagination by
the “gay Aleppo-Gate,” and listened to the
bird-voiced singing-man.  Then the world of to-day called
him back; a page summoned him to speak with a friend on the
telephone.

As Treddleford was about to pass out of the room he
encountered Amblecope, also passing out, on his way to the
billiard-room, where, perchance, some luckless wight might be
secured and held fast to listen to the number of his attendances
at the Grand Prix, with subsequent remarks on Newmarket and the
Cambridgeshire.  Amblecope made as if to pass out first, but
a new-born pride was surging in Treddleford’s breast and he
waved him back.

Teresa, Mrs. Thropplestance, was the richest and most
intractable old woman in the county of Woldshire.  In her
dealings with the world in general her manner suggested a blend
between a Mistress of the Robes and a Master of Foxhounds, with
the vocabulary of both.  In her domestic circle she
comported herself in the arbitrary style that one attributes,
probably without the least justification, to an American
political Boss in the bosom of his caucus.  The late
Theodore Thropplestance had left her, some thirty-five years ago,
in absolute possession of a considerable fortune, a large landed
property, and a gallery full of valuable pictures.  In those
intervening years she had outlived her son and quarrelled with
her elder grandson, who had married without her consent or
approval.  Bertie Thropplestance, her younger grandson, was
the heir-designate to her property, and as such he was a centre
of interest and concern to some half-hundred ambitious mothers
with daughters of marriageable age.  Bertie was an amiable,
easy-going young man, who was quite ready to marry anyone who was
favourably recommended to his notice, but he was not going to
waste his time in falling in love with anyone who would come
under his grandmother’s veto.  The favourable
recommendation would have to come from Mrs. Thropplestance.

Teresa’s house-parties were always rounded off with a
plentiful garnishing of presentable young women and alert,
attendant mothers, but the old lady was emphatically discouraging
whenever any one of her girl guests became at all likely to
outbid the others as a possible granddaughter-in-law.  It
was the inheritance of her fortune and estate that was in
question, and she was evidently disposed to exercise and enjoy
her powers of selection and rejection to the utmost. 
Bertie’s preferences did not greatly matter; he was of the
sort who can be stolidly happy with any kind of wife; he had
cheerfully put up with his grandmother all his life, so was not
likely to fret and fume over anything that might befall him in
the way of a helpmate.

The party that gathered under Teresa’s roof in Christmas
week of the year nineteen-hundred-and-something was of smaller
proportions than usual, and Mrs. Yonelet, who formed one of the
party, was inclined to deduce hopeful augury from this
circumstance.  Dora Yonelet and Bertie were so obviously
made for one another, she confided to the vicar’s wife, and
if the old lady were accustomed to seeing them about a lot
together she might adopt the view that they would make a suitable
married couple.

“People soon get used to an idea if it is dangled
constantly before their eyes,” said Mrs. Yonelet hopefully,
“and the more often Teresa sees those young people
together, happy in each other’s company, the more she will
get to take a kindly interest in Dora as a possible and desirable
wife for Bertie.”

“My dear,” said the vicar’s wife resignedly,
“my own Sybil was thrown together with Bertie under the
most romantic circumstances—I’ll tell you about it
some day—but it made no impression whatever on Teresa; she
put her foot down in the most uncompromising fashion, and Sybil
married an Indian civilian.”

“Quite right of her,” said Mrs. Yonelet with vague
approval; “it’s what any girl of spirit would have
done.  Still, that was a year or two ago, I believe; Bertie
is older now, and so is Teresa.  Naturally she must be
anxious to see him settled.”

The vicar’s wife reflected that Teresa seemed to be the
one person who showed no immediate anxiety to supply Bertie with
a wife, but she kept the thought to herself.

Mrs. Yonelet was a woman of resourceful energy and
generalship; she involved the other members of the house-party,
the deadweight, so to speak, in all manner of exercises and
occupations that segregated them from Bertie and Dora, who were
left to their own devisings—that is to say, to Dora’s
devisings and Bertie’s accommodating acquiescence. 
Dora helped in the Christmas decorations of the parish church,
and Bertie helped her to help.  Together they fed the swans,
till the birds went on a dyspepsia-strike, together they played
billiards, together they photographed the village almshouses,
and, at a respectful distance, the tame elk that browsed in
solitary aloofness in the park.  It was “tame”
in the sense that it had long ago discarded the least vestige of
fear of the human race; nothing in its record encouraged its
human neighbours to feel a reciprocal confidence.

Whatever sport or exercise or occupation Bertie and Dora
indulged in together was unfailingly chronicled and advertised by
Mrs. Yonelet for the due enlightenment of Bertie’s
grandmother.

“Those two inseparables have just come in from a bicycle
ride,” she would announce; “quite a picture they
make, so fresh and glowing after their spin.”

“A picture needing words,” would be Teresa’s
private comment, and as far as Bertie was concerned she was
determined that the words should remain unspoken.

On the afternoon after Christmas Day Mrs. Yonelet dashed into
the drawing-room, where her hostess was sitting amid a circle of
guests and teacups and muffin-dishes.  Fate had placed what
seemed like a trump-card in the hands of the
patiently-manoeuvring mother.  With eyes blazing with
excitement and a voice heavily escorted with exclamation marks
she made a dramatic announcement.

In swift, excited sentences, broken with maternal emotion, she
gave supplementary information as to how the treacherous animal
had ambushed Dora as she was hunting for a strayed golf ball, and
how Bertie had dashed to her rescue with a stable fork and driven
the beast off in the nick of time.

“It was touch and go!  She threw her niblick at it,
but that didn’t stop it.  In another moment she would
have been crushed beneath its hoofs,” panted Mrs.
Yonelet.

“The animal is not safe,” said Teresa, handing her
agitated guest a cup of tea.  “I forget if you take
sugar.  I suppose the solitary life it leads has soured its
temper.  There are muffins in the grate.  It’s
not my fault; I’ve tried to get it a mate for ever so
long.  You don’t know of anyone with a lady elk for
sale or exchange, do you?” she asked the company
generally.

But Mrs. Yonelet was in no humour to listen to talk of elk
marriages.  The mating of two human beings was the subject
uppermost in her mind, and the opportunity for advancing her pet
project was too valuable to be neglected.

“Teresa,” she exclaimed impressively, “after
those two young people have been thrown together so dramatically,
nothing can be quite the same again between them.  Bertie
has done more than save Dora’s life; he has earned her
affection.  One cannot help feeling that Fate has
consecrated them for one another.”

“Exactly what the vicar’s wife said when Bertie
saved Sybil from the elk a year or two ago,” observed
Teresa placidly; “I pointed out to her that he had rescued
Mirabel Hicks from the same predicement a few months previously,
and that priority really belonged to the gardener’s boy,
who had been rescued in the January of that year.  There is
a good deal of sameness in country life, you know.”

“That’s what the mother of the gardener’s
boy said,” remarked Teresa; “she wanted me to have it
destroyed, but I pointed out to her that she had eleven children
and I had only one elk.  I also gave her a black silk skirt;
she said that though there hadn’t been a funeral in her
family she felt as if there had been.  Anyhow, we parted
friends.  I can’t offer you a silk skirt, Emily, but
you may have another cup of tea.  As I have already
remarked, there are muffins in the grate.”

Teresa closed the discussion, having deftly conveyed the
impression that she considered the mother of the gardener’s
boy had shown a far more reasonable spirit than the parents of
other elk-assaulted victims.

“Teresa is devoid of feeling,” said Mrs. Yonelet
afterwards to the vicar’s wife; “to sit there,
talking of muffins, with an appalling tragedy only narrowly
averted—”

“Of course you know whom she really intends Bertie to
marry?” asked the vicar’s wife; “I’ve
noticed it for some time.  The Bickelbys’ German
governess.”

“She’s of quite good family, I believe,”
said the vicar’s wife, “and not at all the
mouse-in-the-back-ground sort of person that governesses are
usually supposed to be.  In fact, next to Teresa,
she’s about the most assertive and combative personality in
the neighbourhood.  She’s pointed out to my husband
all sorts of errors in his sermons, and she gave Sir Laurence a
public lecture on how he ought to handle the hounds.  You
know how sensitive Sir Laurence is about any criticism of his
Mastership, and to have a governess laying down the law to him
nearly drove him into a fit.  She’s behaved like that
to every one, except, of course, Teresa, and every one has been
defensively rude to her in return.  The Bickelbys are simply
too afraid of her to get rid of her.  Now isn’t that
exactly the sort of woman whom Teresa would take a delight in
installing as her successor?  Imagine the discomfort and
awkwardness in the county if we suddenly found that she was to be
the future hostess at the Hall.  Teresa’s only regret
will be that she won’t be alive to see it.”

“But,” objected Mrs. Yonelet, “surely Bertie
hasn’t shown the least sign of being attracted in that
quarter?”

“Oh, she’s quite nice-looking in a way, and
dresses well, and plays a good game of tennis.  She often
comes across the park with messages from the Bickelby mansion,
and one of these days Bertie will rescue her from the elk, which
has become almost a habit with him, and Teresa will say that Fate
has consecrated them to one another.  Bertie might not be
disposed to pay much attention to the consecrations of Fate, but
he would not dream of opposing his grandmother.”

The vicar’s wife spoke with the quiet authority of one
who has intuitive knowledge, and in her heart of hearts Mrs.
Yonelet believed her.

Six months later the elk had to be destroyed.  In a fit
of exceptional moroseness it had killed the Bickelbys’
German governess.  It was an irony of its fate that it
should achieve popularity in the last moments of its career; at
any rate, it established the record of being the only living
thing that had permanently thwarted Teresa Thropplestance’s
plans.

Dora Yonelet broke off her engagement with an Indian civilian,
and married Bertie three months after his grandmother’s
death—Teresa did not long survive the German governess
fiasco.  At Christmas time every year young Mrs.
Thropplestance hangs an extra large festoon of evergreens on the
elk horns that decorate the hall.

“It was a fearsome beast,” she observes to Bertie,
“but I always feel that it was instrumental in bringing us
together.”

“No,” said Janetta, with a note of tired defiance
in her voice; “I’ve written eleven letters to-day
expressing surprise and gratitude for sundry unmerited gifts, but
I haven’t written to the Froplinsons.”

“I don’t dispute the necessity, but I don’t
think the some one should be me,” said Janetta. 
“I wouldn’t mind writing a letter of angry
recrimination or heartless satire to some suitable recipient; in
fact, I should rather enjoy it, but I’ve come to the end of
my capacity for expressing servile amiability.  Eleven
letters to-day and nine yesterday, all couched in the same strain
of ecstatic thankfulness: really, you can’t expect me to
sit down to another.  There is such a thing as writing
oneself out.”

“I’ve written nearly as many,” said Egbert,
“and I’ve had my usual business correspondence to get
through, too.  Besides, I don’t know what it was that
the Froplinsons sent us.”

“A William the Conqueror calendar,” said Janetta,
“with a quotation of one of his great thoughts for every
day in the year.”

“Impossible,” said Egbert; “he didn’t
have three hundred and sixty-five thoughts in the whole of his
life, or, if he did, he kept them to himself.  He was a man
of action, not of introspection.”

“That sounds more probable,” said Egbert;
“well, let’s collaborate on this letter of thanks and
get it done.  I’ll dictate, and you can scribble it
down.  ‘Dear Mrs. Froplinson—thank you and your
husband so much for the very pretty calendar you sent us. 
It was very good of you to think of us.’”

“We sent them something on the twenty-second,”
said Janetta, “so they simply had to think of
us.  There was no getting away from it.”

“Bridge-markers,” said Janetta, “in a
cardboard case, with some inanity about ‘digging for
fortune with a royal spade’ emblazoned on the cover. 
The moment I saw it in the shop I said to myself
‘Froplinsons’ and to the attendant ‘How
much?’  When he said ‘Ninepence,’ I gave
him their address, jabbed our card in, paid tenpence or
elevenpence to cover the postage, and thanked heaven.  With
less sincerity and infinitely more trouble they eventually
thanked me.”

“One is not supposed to notice social deformities of
that sort,” said Janetta; “it wouldn’t be
polite.  Besides, what trouble did they take to find out
whether we read Wordsworth with gladness?   For all
they knew or cared we might be frantically embedded in the belief
that all poetry begins and ends with John Masefield, and it might
infuriate or depress us to have a daily sample of Wordsworthian
products flung at us.”

“Do you realise what that means?” she asked;
“a Wordsworth booklet next Christmas, and another calendar
the Christmas after, with the same problem of having to write
suitable letters of thankfulness.  No, the best thing to do
is to drop all further allusion to the calendar and switch off on
to some other topic.”

“Oh, something like this: ‘What do you think of
the New Year Honours List?  A friend of ours made such a
clever remark when he read it.’  Then you can stick in
any remark that comes into your head; it needn’t be
clever.  The Froplinsons won’t know whether it is or
isn’t.”

“We don’t even know on which side they are in
politics,” objected Egbert; “and anyhow you
can’t suddenly dismiss the subject of the calendar. 
Surely there must be some intelligent remark that can be made
about it.”

“Well, we can’t think of one,” said Janetta
wearily; “the fact is, we’ve both written ourselves
out.  Heavens!  I’ve just remembered Mrs. Stephen
Ludberry.  I haven’t thanked her for what she
sent.”

There was a long silence, the forlorn silence of those who are
bereft of hope and have almost ceased to care.

Presently Egbert started from his seat with an air of
resolution.  The light of battle was in his eyes.

“To neither,” said Egbert, drawing a stack of
notepaper towards him; “I’m going to write to the
editor of every enlightened and influential newspaper in the
Kingdom, I’m going to suggest that there should be a sort
of epistolary Truce of God during the festivities of Christmas
and New Year.  From the twenty-fourth of December to the
third or fourth of January it shall be considered an offence
against good sense and good feeling to write or expect any letter
or communication that does not deal with the necessary events of
the moment.  Answers to invitations, arrangements about
trains, renewal of club subscriptions, and, of course, all the
ordinary everyday affairs of business, sickness, engaging new
cooks, and so forth, these will be dealt with in the usual manner
as something inevitable, a legitimate part of our daily
life.  But all the devastating accretions of correspondence,
incident to the festive season, these should be swept away to
give the season a chance of being really festive, a time of
untroubled, unpunctuated peace and good will.”

“But you would have to make some acknowledgment of
presents received,” objected Janetta; “otherwise
people would never know whether they had arrived
safely.”

“Of course, I have thought of that,” said Egbert;
“every present that was sent off would be accompanied by a
ticket bearing the date of dispatch and the signature of the
sender, and some conventional hieroglyphic to show that it was
intended to be a Christmas or New Year gift; there would be a
counterfoil with space for the recipient’s name and the
date of arrival, and all you would have to do would be to sign
and date the counterfoil, add a conventional hieroglyphic
indicating heartfelt thanks and gratified surprise, put the thing
into an envelope and post it.”

“It sounds delightfully simple,” said Janetta
wistfully, “but people would consider it too cut-and-dried,
too perfunctory.”

“It is not a bit more perfunctory than the present
system,” said Egbert; “I have only the same
conventional language of gratitude at my disposal with which to
thank dear old Colonel Chuttle for his perfectly delicious
Stilton, which we shall devour to the last morsel, and the
Froplinsons for their calendar, which we shall never look
at.  Colonel Chuttle knows that we are grateful for the
Stilton, without having to be told so, and the Froplinsons know
that we are bored with their calendar, whatever we may say to the
contrary, just as we know that they are bored with the
bridge-markers in spite of their written assurance that they
thanked us for our charming little gift.  What is more, the
Colonel knows that even if we had taken a sudden aversion to
Stilton or been forbidden it by the doctor, we should still have
written a letter of hearty thanks around it.  So you see the
present system of acknowledgment is just as perfunctory and
conventional as the counterfoil business would be, only ten times
more tiresome and brain-racking.”

“Your plan would certainly bring the ideal of a Happy
Christmas a step nearer realisation,” said Janetta.

“There are exceptions, of course,” said Egbert,
“people who really try to infuse a breath of reality into
their letters of acknowledgment.  Aunt Susan, for instance,
who writes: ‘Thank you very much for the ham; not such a
good flavour as the one you sent last year, which itself was not
a particularly good one.  Hams are not what they used to
be.’  It would be a pity to be deprived of her
Christmas comments, but that loss would be swallowed up in the
general gain.”

Adventures, according to the proverb, are to the
adventurous.  Quite as often they are to the
non-adventurous, to the retiring, to the constitutionally
timid.  John James Abbleway had been endowed by Nature with
the sort of disposition that instinctively avoids Carlist
intrigues, slum crusades, the tracking of wounded wild beasts,
and the moving of hostile amendments at political meetings. 
If a mad dog or a Mad Mullah had come his way he would have
surrendered the way without hesitation.  At school he had
unwillingly acquired a thorough knowledge of the German tongue
out of deference to the plainly-expressed wishes of a
foreign-languages master, who, though he taught modern subjects,
employed old-fashioned methods in driving his lessons home. 
It was this enforced familiarity with an important commercial
language which thrust Abbleway in later years into strange lands
where adventures were less easy to guard against than in the
ordered atmosphere of an English country town.  The firm
that he worked for saw fit to send him one day on a prosaic
business errand to the far city of Vienna, and, having sent him
there, continued to keep him there, still engaged in humdrum
affairs of commerce, but with the possibilities of romance and
adventure, or even misadventure, jostling at his elbow. 
After two and a half years of exile, however, John James Abbleway
had embarked on only one hazardous undertaking, and that was of a
nature which would assuredly have overtaken him sooner or later
if he had been leading a sheltered, stay-at-home existence at
Dorking or Huntingdon.  He fell placidly in love with a
placidly lovable English girl, the sister of one of his
commercial colleagues, who was improving her mind by a short trip
to foreign parts, and in due course he was formally accepted as
the young man she was engaged to.  The further step by which
she was to become Mrs. John Abbleway was to take place a
twelvemonth hence in a town in the English midlands, by which
time the firm that employed John James would have no further need
for his presence in the Austrian capital.

It was early in April, two months after the installation of
Abbleway as the young man Miss Penning was engaged to, when he
received a letter from her, written from Venice.  She was
still peregrinating under the wing of her brother, and as the
latter’s business arrangements would take him across to
Fiume for a day or two, she had conceived the idea that it would
be rather jolly if John could obtain leave of absence and run
down to the Adriatic coast to meet them.  She had looked up
the route on the map, and the journey did not appear likely to be
expensive.  Between the lines of her communication there lay
a hint that if he really cared for her—

Abbleway obtained leave of absence and added a journey to
Fiume to his life’s adventures.  He left Vienna on a
cold, cheerless day.  The flower shops were full of spring
blooms, and the weekly organs of illustrated humour were full of
spring topics, but the skies were heavy with clouds that looked
like cotton-wool that has been kept over long in a shop
window.

“Snow comes,” said the train official to the
station officials; and they agreed that snow was about to
come.  And it came, rapidly, plenteously.  The train
had not been more than an hour on its journey when the
cotton-wool clouds commenced to dissolve in a blinding downpour
of snowflakes.  The forest trees on either side of the line
were speedily coated with a heavy white mantle, the telegraph
wires became thick glistening ropes, the line itself was buried
more and more completely under a carpeting of snow, through which
the not very powerful engine ploughed its way with increasing
difficulty.  The Vienna-Fiume line is scarcely the best
equipped of the Austrian State railways, and Abbleway began to
have serious fears for a breakdown.  The train had slowed
down to a painful and precarious crawl and presently came to a
halt at a spot where the drifting snow had accumulated in a
formidable barrier.  The engine made a special effort and
broke through the obstruction, but in the course of another
twenty minutes it was again held up.  The process of
breaking through was renewed, and the train doggedly resumed its
way, encountering and surmounting fresh hindrances at frequent
intervals.  After a standstill of unusually long duration in
a particularly deep drift the compartment in which Abbleway was
sitting gave a huge jerk and a lurch, and then seemed to remain
stationary; it undoubtedly was not moving, and yet he could hear
the puffing of the engine and the slow rumbling and jolting of
wheels.  The puffing and rumbling grew fainter, as though it
were dying away through the agency of intervening distance. 
Abbleway suddenly gave vent to an exclamation of scandalised
alarm, opened the window, and peered out into the
snowstorm.  The flakes perched on his eyelashes and blurred
his vision, but he saw enough to help him to realise what had
happened.  The engine had made a mighty plunge through the
drift and had gone merrily forward, lightened of the load of its
rear carriage, whose coupling had snapped under the strain. 
Abbleway was alone, or almost alone, with a derelict railway
waggon, in the heart of some Styrian or Croatian forest.  In
the third-class compartment next to his own he remembered to have
seen a peasant woman, who had entered the train at a small
wayside station.  “With the exception of that
woman,” he exclaimed dramatically to himself, “the
nearest living beings are probably a pack of wolves.”

Before making his way to the third-class compartment to
acquaint his fellow-traveller with the extent of the disaster
Abbleway hurriedly pondered the question of the woman’s
nationality.  He had acquired a smattering of Slavonic
tongues during his residence in Vienna, and felt competent to
grapple with several racial possibilities.

“If she is Croat or Serb or Bosniak I shall be able to
make her understand,” he promised himself.  “If
she is Magyar, heaven help me!  We shall have to converse
entirely by signs.”

He entered the carriage and made his momentous announcement in
the best approach to Croat speech that he could achieve.

The woman shook her head with a movement that might be
intended to convey resignation to the will of heaven, but
probably meant noncomprehension.  Abbleway repeated his
information with variations of Slavonic tongues and generous
displays of pantomime.

She seemed about as much interested as though Abbleway had
told her the result of the municipal elections in Amsterdam.

“They will find out at some station, and when the line
is clear of snow they will send an engine.  It happens that
way sometimes.”

“Many,” said the woman; “just outside this
forest my aunt was devoured three years ago, as she was coming
home from market.  The horse and a young pig that was in the
cart were eaten too.  The horse was a very old one, but it
was a beautiful young pig, oh, so fat.  I cried when I heard
that it was taken.  They spare nothing.”

“They may attack us here,” said Abbleway
tremulously; “they could easily break in, these carriages
are like matchwood.  We may both be devoured.”

“It is the day of Saint Mariä Kleophä, my
name-day.  She would not allow me to be eaten by wolves on
her day.  Such a thing could not be thought of.  You,
yes, but not me.”

“I have here some good eatables,” said the woman
tranquilly; “on my festival day it is natural that I should
have provision with me.  I have five good blood-sausages; in
the town shops they cost twenty-five heller each.  Things
are dear in the town shops.”

“In a railway accident things become very dear,”
said the woman; “these blood-sausages are four kronen
apiece.”

“You cannot get them any cheaper on this train,”
said the woman, with relentless logic, “because there
aren’t any others to get.  In Agram you can buy them
cheaper, and in Paradise no doubt they will be given to us for
nothing, but here they cost four kronen each.  I have a
small piece of Emmenthaler cheese and a honey-cake and a piece of
bread that I can let you have.  That will be another three
kronen, eleven kronen in all.  There is a piece of ham, but
that I cannot let you have on my name-day.”

Abbleway wondered to himself what price she would have put on
the ham, and hurried to pay her the eleven kronen before her
emergency tariff expanded into a famine tariff.  As he was
taking possession of his modest store of eatables he suddenly
heard a noise which set his heart thumping in a miserable fever
of fear.  ‘There was a scraping and shuffling as of
some animal or animals trying to climb up to the footboard. 
In another moment, through the snow-encrusted glass of the
carriage window, he saw a gaunt prick-eared head, with gaping jaw
and lolling tongue and gleaming teeth; a second later another
head shot up.

“There are hundreds of them,” whispered Abbleway;
“they have scented us.  They will tear the carriage to
pieces.  We shall be devoured.”

“Not me, on my name-day.  The holy Mariä
Kleophä would not permit it,” said the woman with
provoking calm.

The heads dropped down from the window and an uncanny silence
fell on the beleaguered carriage.  Abbleway neither moved
nor spoke.  Perhaps the brutes had not clearly seen or
winded the human occupants of the carriage, and had prowled away
on some other errand of rapine.

“It grows cold,” said the woman suddenly, crossing
over to the far end of the carriage, where the heads had
appeared.  “The heating apparatus does not work any
longer.  See, over there beyond the trees, there is a
chimney with smoke coming from it.  It is not far, and the
snow has nearly stopped, I shall find a path through the forest
to that house with the chimney.”

“Not on my name-day,” said the woman obstinately,
and before he could stop her she had opened the door and climbed
down into the snow.  A moment later he hid his face in his
hands; two gaunt lean figures rushed upon her from the
forest.  No doubt she had courted her fate, but Abbleway had
no wish to see a human being torn to pieces and devoured before
his eyes.

When he looked at last a new sensation of scandalised
astonishment took possession of him.  He had been straitly
brought up in a small English town, and he was not prepared to be
the witness of a miracle.  The wolves were not doing
anything worse to the woman than drench her with snow as they
gambolled round her.

“My cousin Karl’s dogs, yes,” she answered;
“that is his inn, over beyond the trees.  I knew it
was there, but I did not want to take you there; he is always
grasping with strangers.  However, it grows too cold to
remain in the train.  Ah, ah, see what comes!”

A whistle sounded, and a relief engine made its appearance,
snorting its way sulkily through the snow.  Abbleway did not
have the opportunity for finding out whether Karl was really
avaricious.

The children were to be driven, as a special treat, to the
sands at Jagborough.  Nicholas was not to be of the party;
he was in disgrace.  Only that morning he had refused to eat
his wholesome bread-and-milk on the seemingly frivolous ground
that there was a frog in it.  Older and wiser and better
people had told him that there could not possibly be a frog in
his bread-and-milk and that he was not to talk nonsense; he
continued, nevertheless, to talk what seemed the veriest
nonsense, and described with much detail the colouration and
markings of the alleged frog.  The dramatic part of the
incident was that there really was a frog in Nicholas’
basin of bread-and-milk; he had put it there himself, so he felt
entitled to know something about it.  The sin of taking a
frog from the garden and putting it into a bowl of wholesome
bread-and-milk was enlarged on at great length, but the fact that
stood out clearest in the whole affair, as it presented itself to
the mind of Nicholas, was that the older, wiser, and better
people had been proved to be profoundly in error in matters about
which they had expressed the utmost assurance.

“You said there couldn’t possibly be a frog in my
bread-and-milk; there was a frog in my
bread-and-milk,” he repeated, with the insistence of a
skilled tactician who does not intend to shift from favourable
ground.

So his boy-cousin and girl-cousin and his quite uninteresting
younger brother were to be taken to Jagborough sands that
afternoon and he was to stay at home.  His cousins’
aunt, who insisted, by an unwarranted stretch of imagination, in
styling herself his aunt also, had hastily invented the
Jagborough expedition in order to impress on Nicholas the
delights that he had justly forfeited by his disgraceful conduct
at the breakfast-table.  It was her habit, whenever one of
the children fell from grace, to improvise something of a
festival nature from which the offender would be rigorously
debarred; if all the children sinned collectively they were
suddenly informed of a circus in a neighbouring town, a circus of
unrivalled merit and uncounted elephants, to which, but for their
depravity, they would have been taken that very day.

A few decent tears were looked for on the part of Nicholas
when the moment for the departure of the expedition
arrived.  As a matter of fact, however, all the crying was
done by his girl-cousin, who scraped her knee rather painfully
against the step of the carriage as she was scrambling in.

“How she did howl,” said Nicholas cheerfully, as
the party drove off without any of the elation of high spirits
that should have characterised it.

“She’ll soon get over that,” said the
soi-disant aunt; “it will be a glorious afternoon
for racing about over those beautiful sands.  How they will
enjoy themselves!”

“Bobby won’t enjoy himself much, and he
won’t race much either,” said Nicholas with a grim
chuckle; “his boots are hurting him.  They’re
too tight.”

“He told you twice, but you weren’t
listening.  You often don’t listen when we tell you
important things.”

Nicholas did not admit the flawlessness of the reasoning; he
felt perfectly capable of being in disgrace and in a gooseberry
garden at the same moment.  His face took on an expression
of considerable obstinacy.  It was clear to his aunt that he
was determined to get into the gooseberry garden,
“only,” as she remarked to herself, “because I
have told him he is not to.”

Now the gooseberry garden had two doors by which it might be
entered, and once a small person like Nicholas could slip in
there he could effectually disappear from view amid the masking
growth of artichokes, raspberry canes, and fruit bushes. 
The aunt had many other things to do that afternoon, but she
spent an hour or two in trivial gardening operations among flower
beds and shrubberies, whence she could keep a watchful eye on the
two doors that led to the forbidden paradise.  She was a
woman of few ideas, with immense powers of concentration.

Nicholas made one or two sorties into the front garden,
wriggling his way with obvious stealth of purpose towards one or
other of the doors, but never able for a moment to evade the
aunt’s watchful eye.  As a matter of fact, he had no
intention of trying to get into the gooseberry garden, but it was
extremely convenient for him that his aunt should believe that he
had; it was a belief that would keep her on self-imposed
sentry-duty for the greater part of the afternoon.  Having
thoroughly confirmed and fortified her suspicions Nicholas
slipped back into the house and rapidly put into execution a plan
of action that had long germinated in his brain.  By
standing on a chair in the library one could reach a shelf on
which reposed a fat, important-looking key.  The key was as
important as it looked; it was the instrument which kept the
mysteries of the lumber-room secure from unauthorised intrusion,
which opened a way only for aunts and such-like privileged
persons.  Nicholas had not had much experience of the art of
fitting keys into keyholes and turning locks, but for some days
past he had practised with the key of the schoolroom door; he did
not believe in trusting too much to luck and accident.  The
key turned stiffly in the lock, but it turned.  The door
opened, and Nicholas was in an unknown land, compared with which
the gooseberry garden was a stale delight, a mere material
pleasure.

Often and often Nicholas had pictured to himself what the
lumber-room might be like, that region that was so carefully
sealed from youthful eyes and concerning which no questions were
ever answered.  It came up to his expectations.  In the
first place it was large and dimly lit, one high window opening
on to the forbidden garden being its only source of
illumination.  In the second place it was a storehouse of
unimagined treasures.  The aunt-by-assertion was one of
those people who think that things spoil by use and consign them
to dust and damp by way of preserving them.  Such parts of
the house as Nicholas knew best were rather bare and cheerless,
but here there were wonderful things for the eye to feast
on.  First and foremost there was a piece of framed tapestry
that was evidently meant to be a fire-screen.  To Nicholas
it was a living, breathing story; he sat down on a roll of Indian
hangings, glowing in wonderful colours beneath a layer of dust,
and took in all the details of the tapestry picture.  A man,
dressed in the hunting costume of some remote period, had just
transfixed a stag with an arrow; it could not have been a
difficult shot because the stag was only one or two paces away
from him; in the thickly-growing vegetation that the picture
suggested it would not have been difficult to creep up to a
feeding stag, and the two spotted dogs that were springing
forward to join in the chase had evidently been trained to keep
to heel till the arrow was discharged.  That part of the
picture was simple, if interesting, but did the huntsman see,
what Nicholas saw, that four galloping wolves were coming in his
direction through the wood?  There might be more than four
of them hidden behind the trees, and in any case would the man
and his dogs be able to cope with the four wolves if they made an
attack?  The man had only two arrows left in his quiver, and
he might miss with one or both of them; all one knew about his
skill in shooting was that he could hit a large stag at a
ridiculously short range.  Nicholas sat for many golden
minutes revolving the possibilities of the scene; he was inclined
to think that there were more than four wolves and that the man
and his dogs were in a tight corner.

But there were other objects of delight and interest claiming
his instant attention: there were quaint twisted candlesticks in
the shape of snakes, and a teapot fashioned like a china duck,
out of whose open beak the tea was supposed to come.  How
dull and shapeless the nursery teapot seemed in comparison! 
And there was a carved sandal-wood box packed tight with aromatic
cotton-wool, and between the layers of cotton-wool were little
brass figures, hump-necked bulls, and peacocks and goblins,
delightful to see and to handle.  Less promising in
appearance was a large square book with plain black covers;
Nicholas peeped into it, and, behold, it was full of coloured
pictures of birds.  And such birds!  In the garden, and
in the lanes when he went for a walk, Nicholas came across a few
birds, of which the largest were an occasional magpie or
wood-pigeon; here were herons and bustards, kites, toucans,
tiger-bitterns, brush turkeys, ibises, golden pheasants, a whole
portrait gallery of undreamed-of creatures.  And as he was
admiring the colouring of the mandarin duck and assigning a
life-history to it, the voice of his aunt in shrill vociferation
of his name came from the gooseberry garden without.  She
had grown suspicious at his long disappearance, and had leapt to
the conclusion that he had climbed over the wall behind the
sheltering screen of the lilac bushes; she was now engaged in
energetic and rather hopeless search for him among the artichokes
and raspberry canes.

“Nicholas, Nicholas!” she screamed, “you are
to come out of this at once.  It’s no use trying to
hide there; I can see you all the time.”

Presently the angry repetitions of Nicholas’ name gave
way to a shriek, and a cry for somebody to come quickly. 
Nicholas shut the book, restored it carefully to its place in a
corner, and shook some dust from a neighbouring pile of
newspapers over it.  Then he crept from the room, locked the
door, and replaced the key exactly where he had found it. 
His aunt was still calling his name when he sauntered into the
front garden.

“Me,” came the answer from the other side of the
wall; “didn’t you hear me?  I’ve been
looking for you in the gooseberry garden, and I’ve slipped
into the rain-water tank.  Luckily there’s no water in
it, but the sides are slippery and I can’t get out. 
Fetch the little ladder from under the cherry
tree—”

“I told you not to, and now I tell you that you
may,” came the voice from the rain-water tank, rather
impatiently.

“Your voice doesn’t sound like
aunt’s,” objected Nicholas; “you may be the
Evil One tempting me to be disobedient.  Aunt often tells me
that the Evil One tempts me and that I always yield.  This
time I’m not going to yield.”

“Now I know that you are the Evil One and not
aunt,” shouted Nicholas gleefully; “when we asked
aunt for strawberry jam yesterday she said there wasn’t
any.  I know there are four jars of it in the store
cupboard, because I looked, and of course you know it’s
there, but she doesn’t, because she said there wasn’t
any.  Oh, Devil, you have sold yourself!”

There was an unusual sense of luxury in being able to talk to
an aunt as though one was talking to the Evil One, but Nicholas
knew, with childish discernment, that such luxuries were not to
be over-indulged in.  He walked noisily away, and it was a
kitchenmaid, in search of parsley, who eventually rescued the
aunt from the rain-water tank.

Tea that evening was partaken of in a fearsome silence. 
The tide had been at its highest when the children had arrived at
Jagborough Cove, so there had been no sands to play on—a
circumstance that the aunt had overlooked in the haste of
organising her punitive expedition.  The tightness of
Bobby’s boots had had disastrous effect on his temper the
whole of the afternoon, and altogether the children could not
have been said to have enjoyed themselves.  The aunt
maintained the frozen muteness of one who has suffered
undignified and unmerited detention in a rain-water tank for
thirty-five minutes.  As for Nicholas, he, too, was silent,
in the absorption of one who has much to think about; it was just
possible, he considered, that the huntsman would escape with his
hounds while the wolves feasted on the stricken stag.

“I am worried,” admitted Suzanne; “not
worried exactly, but anxious.  You see, my birthday happens
next week—”

“Well, old Bertram Kneyght is over in England just now
from the Argentine.  He’s a kind of distant cousin of
my mother’s, and so enormously rich that we’ve never
let the relationship drop out of sight.  Even if we
don’t see him or hear from him for years he is always
Cousin Bertram when he does turn up.  I can’t say
he’s ever been of much solid use to us, but yesterday the
subject of my birthday cropped up, and he asked me to let him
know what I wanted for a present.”

“As a rule when one is confronted with a problem like
that,” said Suzanne, “all one’s ideas vanish;
one doesn’t seem to have a desire in the world.  Now
it so happens that I have been very keen on a little Dresden
figure that I saw somewhere in Kensington; about thirty-six
shillings, quite beyond my means.  I was very nearly
describing the figure, and giving Bertram the address of the
shop.  And then it suddenly struck me that thirty-six
shillings was such a ridiculously inadequate sum for a man of his
immense wealth to spend on a birthday present.  He could
give thirty-six pounds as easily as you or I could buy a bunch of
violets.  I don’t want to be greedy, of course, but I
don’t like being wasteful.”

“The question is,” said Eleanor, “what are
his ideas as to present-giving?  Some of the wealthiest
people have curiously cramped views on that subject.  When
people grow gradually rich their requirements and standard of
living expand in proportion, while their present-giving instincts
often remain in the undeveloped condition of their earlier
days.  Something showy and not-too-expensive in a shop is
their only conception of the ideal gift.  That is why even
quite good shops have their counters and windows crowded with
things worth about four shillings that look as if they might be
worth seven-and-six, and are priced at ten shillings and labelled
seasonable gifts.’”

“I know,” said Suzanne; “that is why it is
so risky to be vague when one is giving indications of
one’s wants.  Now if I say to him: ‘I am going
out to Davos this winter, so anything in the travelling line
would be acceptable,’ he might give me a dressing-bag with
gold-mounted fittings, but, on the other hand, he might give me
Baedeker’s Switzerland, or ‘Skiing without
Tears,’ or something of that sort.”

“He would be more likely to say: ‘She’ll be
going to lots of dances, a fan will be sure to be
useful.’”

“Yes, and I’ve got tons of fans, so you see where
the danger and anxiety lies.  Now if there is one thing more
than another that I really urgently want it is furs.  I
simply haven’t any.  I’m told that Davos is full
of Russians, and they are sure to wear the most lovely sables and
things.  To be among people who are smothered in furs when
one hasn’t any oneself makes one want to break most of the
Commandments.”

“If it’s furs that you’re out for,”
said Eleanor, “you will have to superintend the choice of
them in person.  You can’t be sure that your cousin
knows the difference between silver-fox and ordinary
squirrel.”

“There are some heavenly silver-fox stoles at Goliath
and Mastodon’s,” said Suzanne, with a sigh; “if
I could only inveigle Bertram into their building and take him
for a stroll through the fur department!”

“He lives somewhere near there, doesn’t he?”
said Eleanor.  “Do you know what his habits are? 
Does he take a walk at any particular time of day?”

“He usually walks down to his club about three
o’clock, if it’s a fine day.  That takes him
right past Goliath and Mastodon’s.”

“Let us two meet him accidentally at the street corner
to-morrow,” said Eleanor; “we can walk a little way
with him, and with luck we ought to be able to side-track him
into the shop.  You can say you want to get a hair-net or
something.  When we’re safely there I can say:
‘I wish you’d tell me what you want for your
birthday.’  Then you’ll have everything ready to
hand—the rich cousin, the fur department, and the topic of
birthday presents.”

“It’s a great idea,” said Suzanne;
“you really are a brick.  Come round to-morrow at
twenty to three; don’t be late, we must carry out our
ambush to the minute.”

At a few minutes to three the next afternoon the fur-trappers
walked warily towards the selected corner.  In the near
distance rose the colossal pile of Messrs.  Goliath and
Mastodon’s famed establishment.  The afternoon was
brilliantly fine, exactly the sort of weather to tempt a
gentleman of advancing years into the discreet exercise of a
leisurely walk.

“I say, dear, I wish you’d do something for me
this evening,” said Eleanor to her companion; “just
drop in after dinner on some pretext or other, and stay on to
make a fourth at bridge with Adela and the aunts.  Otherwise
I shall have to play, and Harry Scarisbrooke is going to come in
unexpectedly about nine-fifteen, and I particularly want to be
free to talk to him while the others are playing.”

“Sorry, my dear, no can do,” said Suzanne;
“ordinary bridge at three-pence a hundred, with such
dreadfully slow players as your aunts, bores me to tears.  I
nearly go to sleep over it.”

“But I most particularly want an opportunity to talk
with Harry,” urged Eleanor, an angry glint coming into her
eyes.

“Sorry, anything to oblige, but not that,” said
Suzanne cheerfully; the sacrifices of friendship were beautiful
in her eyes as long as she was not asked to make them.

Mr. Bertram Kneyght greeted his cousin and her friend with
genuine heartiness, and readily accepted their invitation to
explore the crowded mart that stood temptingly at their
elbow.  The plate-glass doors swung open and the trio
plunged bravely into the jostling throng of buyers and
loiterers.

Suzanne, in her anxiety to pilot her cousin to the desired
haven of the fur department, was usually a few paces ahead of the
others, coming back to them now and then if they lingered for a
moment at some attractive counter, with the nervous solicitude of
a parent rook encouraging its young ones on their first flying
expedition.

“It’s Suzanne’s birthday on Wednesday
next,” confided Eleanor to Bertram Kneyght at a moment when
Suzanne had left them unusually far behind; “my birthday
comes the day before, so we are both on the look-out for
something to give each other.”

“Ah,” said Bertram.  “Now, perhaps you
can advise me on that very point.  I want to give Suzanne
something, and I haven’t the least idea what she
wants.”

“She’s rather a problem,” said
Eleanor.  “She seems to have everything one can think
of, lucky girl.  A fan is always useful; she’ll be
going to a lot of dances at Davos this winter.  Yes, I
should think a fan would please her more than anything. 
After our birthdays are over we inspect each other’s muster
of presents, and I always feel dreadfully humble.  She gets
such nice things, and I never have anything worth showing. 
You see, none of my relations or any of the people who give me
presents are at all well off, so I can’t expect them to do
anything more than just remember the day with some little
trifle.  Two years ago an uncle on my mother’s side of
the family, who had come into a small legacy, promised me a
silver-fox stole for my birthday.  I can’t tell you
how excited I was about it, how I pictured myself showing it off
to all my friends and enemies.  Then just at that moment his
wife died, and, of course, poor man, he could not be expected to
think of birthday presents at such a time.  He has lived
abroad ever since, and I never got my fur.  Do you know, to
this day I can scarcely look at a silver-fox pelt in a shop
window or round anyone’s neck without feeling ready to
burst into tears.  I suppose if I hadn’t had the
prospect of getting one I shouldn’t feel that way. 
Look, there is the fan counter, on your left; you can easily slip
away in the crowd.  Get her as nice a one as you can
see—she is such a dear, dear girl.”

“Hullo, I thought I had lost you,” said Suzanne,
making her way through an obstructive knot of shoppers. 
“Where is Bertram?”

“I got separated from him long ago.  I thought he
was on ahead with you,” said Eleanor.  “We shall
never find him in this crush.”

“All our trouble and forethought thrown away,”
said Suzanne sulkily, when they had pushed their way fruitlessly
through half a dozen departments.

“I can’t think why you didn’t grab him by
the arm,” said Eleanor; “I would have if I’d
known him longer, but I’d only just been introduced. 
It’s nearly four now, we’d better have
tea.”

“Thank you very much for the photograph frame.  It
was just what I wanted.  Very good of you.  I say, do
you know what that Kneyght person has given me?  Just what
you said he would—a wretched fan.  What?  Oh yes,
quite a good enough fan in its way, but still . . .”

“Your cousin appears to be one of those rare people of
wealth who take a pleasure in giving good presents,” came
the reply.

“I wondered why he was so anxious to know where she
lived,” snapped Suzanne to herself as she rang off.

A cloud has arisen between the friendships of the two young
women; as far as Eleanor is concerned the cloud has a silver-fox
lining.

Jocantha Bessbury was in the mood to be serenely and
graciously happy.  Her world was a pleasant place, and it
was wearing one of its pleasantest aspects.  Gregory had
managed to get home for a hurried lunch and a smoke afterwards in
the little snuggery; the lunch had been a good one, and there was
just time to do justice to the coffee and cigarettes.  Both
were excellent in their way, and Gregory was, in his way, an
excellent husband.  Jocantha rather suspected herself of
making him a very charming wife, and more than suspected herself
of having a first-rate dressmaker.

“I don’t suppose a more thoroughly contented
personality is to be found in all Chelsea,” observed
Jocantha in allusion to herself; “except perhaps
Attab,” she continued, glancing towards the large
tabby-marked cat that lay in considerable ease in a corner of the
divan.  “He lies there, purring and dreaming, shifting
his limbs now and then in an ecstasy of cushioned comfort. 
He seems the incarnation of everything soft and silky and
velvety, without a sharp edge in his composition, a dreamer whose
philosophy is sleep and let sleep; and then, as evening draws on,
he goes out into the garden with a red glint in his eyes and
slays a drowsy sparrow.”

“As every pair of sparrows hatches out ten or more young
ones in the year, while their food supply remains stationary, it
is just as well that the Attabs of the community should have that
idea of how to pass an amusing afternoon,” said
Gregory.  Having delivered himself of this sage comment he
lit another cigarette, bade Jocantha a playfully affectionate
good-bye, and departed into the outer world.

“Remember, dinner’s a wee bit earlier to-night, as
we’re going to the Haymarket,” she called after
him.

Left to herself, Jocantha continued the process of looking at
her life with placid, introspective eyes.  If she had not
everything she wanted in this world, at least she was very well
pleased with what she had got.  She was very well pleased,
for instance, with the snuggery, which contrived somehow to be
cosy and dainty and expensive all at once.  The porcelain
was rare and beautiful, the Chinese enamels took on wonderful
tints in the firelight, the rugs and hangings led the eye through
sumptuous harmonies of colouring.  It was a room in which
one might have suitably entertained an ambassador or an
archbishop, but it was also a room in which one could cut out
pictures for a scrap-book without feeling that one was
scandalising the deities of the place with one’s
litter.  And as with the snuggery, so with the rest of the
house, and as with the house, so with the other departments of
Jocantha’s life; she really had good reason for being one
of the most contented women in Chelsea.

From being in a mood of simmering satisfaction with her lot
she passed to the phase of being generously commiserating for
those thousands around her whose lives and circumstances were
dull, cheap, pleasureless, and empty.  Work girls, shop
assistants and so forth, the class that have neither the
happy-go-lucky freedom of the poor nor the leisured freedom of
the rich, came specially within the range of her sympathy. 
It was sad to think that there were young people who, after a
long day’s work, had to sit alone in chill, dreary bedrooms
because they could not afford the price of a cup of coffee and a
sandwich in a restaurant, still less a shilling for a theatre
gallery.

Jocantha’s mind was still dwelling on this theme when
she started forth on an afternoon campaign of desultory shopping;
it would be rather a comforting thing, she told herself, if she
could do something, on the spur of the moment, to bring a gleam
of pleasure and interest into the life of even one or two
wistful-hearted, empty-pocketed workers; it would add a good deal
to her sense of enjoyment at the theatre that night.  She
would get two upper circle tickets for a popular play, make her
way into some cheap tea-shop, and present the tickets to the
first couple of interesting work girls with whom she could
casually drop into conversation.  She could explain matters
by saying that she was unable to use the tickets herself and did
not want them to be wasted, and, on the other hand, did not want
the trouble of sending them back.  On further reflection she
decided that it might be better to get only one ticket and give
it to some lonely-looking girl sitting eating her frugal meal by
herself; the girl might scrape acquaintance with her next-seat
neighbour at the theatre and lay the foundations of a lasting
friendship.

With the Fairy Godmother impulse strong upon her, Jocantha
marched into a ticket agency and selected with immense care an
upper circle seat for the “Yellow Peacock,” a play
that was attracting a considerable amount of discussion and
criticism.  Then she went forth in search of a tea-shop and
philanthropic adventure, at about the same time that Attab
sauntered into the garden with a mind attuned to sparrow
stalking.  In a corner of an A.B.C. shop she found an
unoccupied table, whereat she promptly installed herself,
impelled by the fact that at the next table was sitting a young
girl, rather plain of feature, with tired, listless eyes, and a
general air of uncomplaining forlornness.  Her dress was of
poor material, but aimed at being in the fashion, her hair was
pretty, and her complexion bad; she was finishing a modest meal
of tea and scone, and she was not very different in her way from
thousands of other girls who were finishing, or beginning, or
continuing their teas in London tea-shops at that exact
moment.  The odds were enormously in favour of the
supposition that she had never seen the “Yellow
Peacock”; obviously she supplied excellent material for
Jocantha’s first experiment in haphazard benefaction.

Jocantha ordered some tea and a muffin, and then turned a
friendly scrutiny on her neighbour with a view to catching her
eye.  At that precise moment the girl’s face lit up
with sudden pleasure, her eyes sparkled, a flush came into her
cheeks, and she looked almost pretty.  A young man, whom she
greeted with an affectionate “Hullo, Bertie,” came up
to her table and took his seat in a chair facing her. 
Jocantha looked hard at the new-comer; he was in appearance a few
years younger than herself, very much better looking than
Gregory, rather better looking, in fact, than any of the young
men of her set.  She guessed him to be a well-mannered young
clerk in some wholesale warehouse, existing and amusing himself
as best he might on a tiny salary, and commanding a holiday of
about two weeks in the year.  He was aware, of course, of
his good looks, but with the shy self-consciousness of the
Anglo-Saxon, not the blatant complacency of the Latin or
Semite.  He was obviously on terms of friendly intimacy with
the girl he was talking to, probably they were drifting towards a
formal engagement.  Jocantha pictured the boy’s home,
in a rather narrow circle, with a tiresome mother who always
wanted to know how and where he spent his evenings.  He
would exchange that humdrum thraldom in due course for a home of
his own, dominated by a chronic scarcity of pounds, shillings,
and pence, and a dearth of most of the things that made life
attractive or comfortable.  Jocantha felt extremely sorry
for him.  She wondered if he had seen the “Yellow
Peacock”; the odds were enormously in favour of the
supposition that he had not.  The girl had finished her tea
and would shortly be going back to her work; when the boy was
alone it would be quite easy for Jocantha to say: “My
husband has made other arrangements for me this evening; would
you care to make use of this ticket, which would otherwise be
wasted?”  Then she could come there again one
afternoon for tea, and, if she saw him, ask him how he liked the
play.  If he was a nice boy and improved on acquaintance he
could be given more theatre tickets, and perhaps asked to come
one Sunday to tea at Chelsea.  Jocantha made up her mind
that he would improve on acquaintance, and that Gregory would
like him, and that the Fairy Godmother business would prove far
more entertaining than she had originally anticipated.  The
boy was distinctly presentable; he knew how to brush his hair,
which was possibly an imitative faculty; he knew what colour of
tie suited him, which might be intuition; he was exactly the type
that Jocantha admired, which of course was accident. 
Altogether she was rather pleased when the girl looked at the
clock and bade a friendly but hurried farewell to her
companion.  Bertie nodded “good-bye,” gulped
down a mouthful of tea, and then produced from his overcoat
pocket a paper-covered book, bearing the title “Sepoy and
Sahib, a tale of the great Mutiny.”

The laws of tea-shop etiquette forbid that you should offer
theatre tickets to a stranger without having first caught the
stranger’s eye.  It is even better if you can ask to
have a sugar basin passed to you, having previously concealed the
fact that you have a large and well-filled sugar basin on your
own table; this is not difficult to manage, as the printed menu
is generally nearly as large as the table, and can be made to
stand on end.  Jocantha set to work hopefully; she had a
long and rather high-pitched discussion with the waitress
concerning alleged defects in an altogether blameless muffin, she
made loud and plaintive inquiries about the tube service to some
impossibly remote suburb, she talked with brilliant insincerity
to the tea-shop kitten, and as a last resort she upset a milk-jug
and swore at it daintily.  Altogether she attracted a good
deal of attention, but never for a moment did she attract the
attention of the boy with the beautifully-brushed hair, who was
some thousands of miles away in the baking plains of Hindostan,
amid deserted bungalows, seething bazaars, and riotous barrack
squares, listening to the throbbing of tom-toms and the distant
rattle of musketry.

Jocantha went back to her house in Chelsea, which struck her
for the first time as looking dull and over-furnished.  She
had a resentful conviction that Gregory would be uninteresting at
dinner, and that the play would be stupid after dinner.  On
the whole her frame of mind showed a marked divergence from the
purring complacency of Attab, who was again curled up in his
corner of the divan with a great peace radiating from every curve
of his body.

Of all the genuine Bohemians who strayed from time to time
into the would-be Bohemian circle of the Restaurant Nuremberg,
Owl Street, Soho, none was more interesting and more elusive than
Gebhard Knopfschrank.  He had no friends, and though he
treated all the restaurant frequenters as acquaintances he never
seemed to wish to carry the acquaintanceship beyond the door that
led into Owl Street and the outer world.  He dealt with them
all rather as a market woman might deal with chance passers-by,
exhibiting her wares and chattering about the weather and the
slackness of business, occasionally about rheumatism, but never
showing a desire to penetrate into their daily lives or to
dissect their ambitions.

He was understood to belong to a family of peasant farmers,
somewhere in Pomerania; some two years ago, according to all that
was known of him, he had abandoned the labours and
responsibilities of swine tending and goose rearing to try his
fortune as an artist in London.

Well, there was a ship that left Stolpmünde for London
twice a month, that carried few passengers, but carried them
cheaply; the railway fares to Munich or Paris were not
cheap.  Thus it was that he came to select London as the
scene of his great adventure.

The question that had long and seriously agitated the
frequenters of the Nuremberg was whether this goose-boy migrant
was really a soul-driven genius, spreading his wings to the
light, or merely an enterprising young man who fancied he could
paint and was pardonably anxious to escape from the monotony of
rye bread diet and the sandy, swine-bestrewn plains of
Pomerania.  There was reasonable ground for doubt and
caution; the artistic groups that foregathered at the little
restaurant contained so many young women with short hair and so
many young men with long hair, who supposed themselves to be
abnormally gifted in the domain of music, poetry, painting, or
stagecraft, with little or nothing to support the supposition,
that a self-announced genius of any sort in their midst was
inevitably suspect.  On the other hand, there was the
ever-imminent danger of entertaining, and snubbing, an angel
unawares.  There had been the lamentable case of Sledonti,
the dramatic poet, who had been belittled and cold-shouldered in
the Owl Street hall of judgment, and had been afterwards hailed
as a master singer by the Grand Duke Constantine
Constantinovitch—“the most educated of the
Romanoffs,” according to Sylvia Strubble, who spoke rather
as one who knew every individual member of the Russian imperial
family; as a matter of fact, she knew a newspaper correspondent,
a young man who ate bortsch with the air of having
invented it.  Sledonti’s “Poems of Death and
Passion” were now being sold by the thousand in seven
European languages, and were about to be translated into Syrian,
a circumstance which made the discerning critics of the Nuremberg
rather shy of maturing their future judgments too rapidly and too
irrevocably.

As regards Knopfschrank’s work, they did not lack
opportunity for inspecting and appraising it.  However
resolutely he might hold himself aloof from the social life of
his restaurant acquaintances, he was not minded to hide his
artistic performances from their inquiring gaze.  Every
evening, or nearly every evening, at about seven o’clock,
he would make his appearance, sit himself down at his accustomed
table, throw a bulky black portfolio on to the chair opposite
him, nod round indiscriminately at his fellow-guests, and
commence the serious business of eating and drinking.  When
the coffee stage was reached he would light a cigarette, draw the
portfolio over to him, and begin to rummage among its
contents.  With slow deliberation he would select a few of
his more recent studies and sketches, and silently pass them
round from table to table, payi' WHERE id = 'd00a72c9-4c8f-44a9-9e4f-e77bd3c50827';
