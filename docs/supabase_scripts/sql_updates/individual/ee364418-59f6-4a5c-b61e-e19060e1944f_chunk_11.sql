      if beside himself with rage, and the lieutenant, white and still, stood
      looking at him. The crew appeared forward, with amazed faces.

Suddenly, in a pause of this outbreak, the lieutenant came to some heroic
      decision, saluted, drew himself together and clambered upon the deck of
      the cuberta.

"Ah!" said Gerilleau, and his mouth shut like a trap. Holroyd saw the ants
      retreating before da Cunha''s boots. The Portuguese walked slowly to the
      fallen man, stooped down, hesitated, clutched his coat and turned him
      over. A black swarm of ants rushed out of the clothes, and da Cunha
      stepped back very quickly and trod two or three times on the deck.

Holroyd put up the glasses. He saw the scattered ants about the invader''s
      feet, and doing what he had never seen ants doing before. They had nothing
      of the blind movements of the common ant; they were looking at him—as
      a rallying crowd of men might look at some gigantic monster that had
      dispersed it.

The lieutenant walked a few paces, and began his answer in Portuguese. He
      stopped abruptly and beat off something from his leg. He made some
      peculiar steps as if he was trying to stamp on something invisible, and
      went quickly towards the side. Then he controlled himself, turned about,
      walked deliberately forward to the hold, clambered up to the fore decking,
      from which the sweeps are worked, stooped for a time over the second man,
      groaned audibly, and made his way back and aft to the cabin, moving very
      rigidly. He turned and began a conversation with his captain, cold and
      respectful in tone on either side, contrasting vividly with the wrath and
      insult of a few moments before. Holroyd gathered only fragments of its
      purport.

He reverted to the field-glass, and was surprised to find the ants had
      vanished from all the exposed surfaces of the deck. He turned towards the
      shadows beneath the decking, and it seemed to him they were full of
      watching eyes.

The cuberta, it was agreed; was derelict, but too full of ants to put men
      aboard to sit and sleep: it must be towed. The lieutenant went forward to
      take in and adjust the cable, and the men in the boat stood up to be ready
      to help him. Holroyd''s glasses searched the canoe.

He became more and more impressed by the fact that a great if minute and
      furtive activity was going on. He perceived that a number of gigantic ants—they
      seemed nearly a couple of inches in length—carrying oddly-shaped
      burthens for which he could imagine no use—were moving in rushes
      from one point of obscurity to another. They did not move in columns
      across the exposed places, but in open, spaced-out lines, oddly suggestive
      of the rushes of modern infantry advancing under fire. A number were
      taking cover under the dead man''s clothes, and a perfect swarm was
      gathering along the side over which da Cunha must presently go.

He did not see them actually rush for the lieutenant as he returned, but
      he has no doubt they did make a concerted rush. Suddenly the lieutenant
      was shouting and cursing and beating at his legs. "I''m stung!" he shouted,
      with a face of hate and accusation towards Gerilleau.

Then he vanished over the side, dropped into his boat, and plunged at once
      into the water. Holroyd heard the splash.

III. — Holroyd and the captain came out of the cabin in which the
      swollen and contorted body of the lieutenant lay and stood together at the
      stern of the monitor, staring at the sinister vessel they trailed behind
      them. It was a close, dark night that had only phantom flickerings of
      sheet lightning to illuminate it. The cuberta, a vague black triangle,
      rocked about in the steamer''s wake, her sails bobbing and flapping, and
      the black smoke from the funnels, spark-lit ever and again, streamed over
      her swaying masts.

Gerilleau''s mind was inclined to run on the unkind things the lieutenant
      had said in the heat of his last fever.

"He says I murdered ''im," he protested. "It is simply absurd. Someone ''ad
      to go aboard. Are we to run away from these confounded ants whenever they
      show up?"

Holroyd said nothing. He was thinking of a disciplined rush of little
      black shapes across bare sunlit planking.

"It was his place to go," harped Gerilleau. "He died in the execution of
      his duty. What has he to complain of? Murdered!... But the poor fellow was—what
      is it?—demented. He was not in his right mind. The poison swelled
      him... U''m."

The inquiry irritated Gerilleau. His shoulders went up, his hands flew out
      at right angles from his body. "What is one to do?" he said, his
      voice going up to an angry squeak.

Holroyd was not moved to conversation. A distant ululation of howling
      monkeys filled the sultry night with foreboding sounds, and as the gunboat
      drew near the black mysterious banks this was reinforced by a depressing
      clamour of frogs.

"What is one to do?" the captain repeated after a vast interval,
      and suddenly becoming active and savage and blasphemous, decided to burn
      the Santa Rosa without further delay. Everyone aboard was pleased
      by that idea, everyone helped with zest; they pulled in the cable, cut it,
      and dropped the boat and fired her with tow and kerosene, and soon the
      cuberta was crackling and flaring merrily amidst the immensities of the
      tropical night. Holroyd watched the mounting yellow flare against the
      blackness, and the livid flashes of sheet lightning that came and went
      above the forest summits, throwing them into momentary silhouette, and his
      stoker stood behind him watching also.

The stoker was stirred to the depths of his linguistics. "Sa|ba go
      pop, pop," he said, "Wahaw" and laughed richly.

But Holroyd was thinking that these little creatures on the decked canoe
      had also eyes and brains.

The whole thing impressed him as incredibly foolish and wrong, but—what
      was one to do? This question came back enormously reinforced on the
      morrow, when at last the gunboat reached Badama.

This place, with its leaf-thatch-covered houses and sheds, its
      creeper-invaded sugar-mill, its little jetty of timber and canes, was very
      still in the morning heat, and showed never a sign of living men. Whatever
      ants there were at that distance were too small to see.

"All the people have gone," said Gerilleau, "but we will do one thing
      anyhow. We will ''oot and vissel."

Then the captain fell into a doubting fit of the worst kind. "Dere is one
      thing we can do," he said presently, "What''s that?" said Holroyd.

The captain walked his deck and gesticulated to himself. He seemed to have
      many things on his mind. Fragments of speeches came from his lips. He
      appeared to be addressing some imaginary public tribunal either in Spanish
      or Portuguese. Holroyd''s improving ear detected something about
      ammunition. He came out of these preoccupations suddenly into English. "My
      dear ''Olroyd!" he cried, and broke off with "But what can one do?"

They took the boat and the field-glasses, and went close in to examine the
      place. They made out a number of big ants, whose still postures had a
      certain effect of watching them, dotted about the edge of the rude
      embarkation jetty. Gerilleau tried ineffectual pistol shots at these.
      Holroyd thinks he distinguished curious earthworks running between the
      nearer houses, that may have been the work of the insect conquerors of
      those human habitations. The explorers pulled past the jetty, and became
      aware of a human skeleton wearing a loin cloth, and very bright and clean
      and shining, lying beyond. They came to a pause regarding this...

Holroyd turned and stared at the captain, realising slowly that he
      referred to the unappetising mixture of races that constituted his crew.

"To send a landing party—it is impossible—impossible. They
      will be poisoned, they will swell, they will swell up and abuse me and
      die. It is totally impossible... If we land, I must land alone, alone, in
      thick boots and with my life in my hand. Perhaps I should live. Or again—I
      might not land. I do not know. I do not know."

"De whole thing," said Gerilleau suddenly, "''as been got up to make me
      ridiculous. De whole thing!"

They paddled about and regarded the clean white skeleton from various
      points of view, and then they returned to the gunboat. Then Gerilleau''s
      indecisions became terrible. Steam was got up, and in the afternoon the
      monitor went on up the river with an air of going to ask somebody
      something, and by sunset came back again and anchored. A thunderstorm
      gathered and broke furiously, and then the night became beautifully cool
      and quiet and everyone slept on deck. Except Gerilleau, who tossed about
      and muttered. In the dawn he awakened Holroyd.

"No!" said the captain, and was for a time very reserved. "I have
      decided," he repeated, and Holroyd manifested symptoms of impatience.

And he did! Heaven knows what the ants thought of it, but he did. He fired
      it twice with great sternness and ceremony. All the crew had wadding in
      their ears, and there was an effect of going into action about the whole
      affair, and first they hit and wrecked the old sugar-mill, and then they
      smashed the abandoned store behind the jetty. And then Gerilleau
      experienced the inevitable reaction.

"It is no good," he said to Holroyd; "no good at all. No sort of bally
      good. We must go back—for instructions. Dere will be de devil of a
      row about dis ammunition—oh! de devil of a row! You don''t
      know, ''Olroyd..."

In the afternoon the monitor started down stream again, and in the evening
      a landing party took the body of the lieutenant and buried it on the bank
      upon which the new ants have so far not appeared...

These new ants have got into his brain, and he has come back to England
      with the idea, as he says, of "exciting people" about them "before it is
      too late." He says they threaten British Guiana, which cannot be much over
      a trifle of a thousand miles from their present sphere of activity, and
      that the Colonial Office ought to get to work upon them at once. He
      declaims with great passion: "These are intelligent ants. Just think what
      that means!"

There can be no doubt they are a serious pest, and that the Brazilian
      Government is well advised in offering a prize of five hundred pounds for
      some effectual method of extirpation. It is certain too that since they
      first appeared in the hills beyond Badama, about three years ago, they
      have achieved extraordinary conquests. The whole of the south bank of the
      Batemo River, for nearly sixty miles, they have in their effectual
      occupation; they have driven men out completely, occupied plantations and
      settlements, and boarded and captured at least one ship. It is even said
      they have in some inexplicable way bridged the very considerable Capuarana
      arm and pushed many miles towards the Amazon itself. There can be little
      doubt that they are far more reasonable and with a far better social
      organisation than any previously known ant species; instead of being in
      dispersed societies they are organised into what is in effect a single
      nation; but their peculiar and immediate formidableness lies not so much
      in this as in the intelligent use they make of poison against their larger
      enemies. It would seem this poison of theirs is closely akin to snake
      poison, and it is highly probable they actually manufacture it, and that
      the larger individuals among them carry the needle-like crystals of it in
      their attacks upon men.

Of course it is extremely difficult to get any detailed information about
      these new competitors for the sovereignty of the globe. No eye-witnesses
      of their activity, except for such glimpses as Holroyd''s, have survived
      the encounter. The most extraordinary legends of their prowess and
      capacity are in circulation in the region of the Upper Amazon, and grow
      daily as the steady advance of the invader stimulates men''s imaginations
      through their fears. These strange little creatures are credited not only
      with the use of implements and a knowledge of fire and metals and with
      organised feats of engineering that stagger our northern minds—unused
      as we are to such feats as that of the Sa|bas of Rio de Janeiro, who in
      1841 drove a tunnel under the Parahyba where it is as wide as the Thames
      at London Bridge—but with an organised and detailed method of record
      and communication analogous to our books. So far their action has been a
      steady progressive settlement, involving the flight or slaughter of every
      human being in the new areas they invade. They are increasing rapidly in
      numbers, and Holroyd at least is firmly convinced that they will finally
      dispossess man over the whole of tropical South America.

Well, there they are, anyhow. By 1911 or thereabouts, if they go on as
      they are going, they ought to strike the Capuarana Extension Railway, and
      force themselves upon the attention of the European capitalist.

By 1920 they will be half-way down the Amazon. I fix 1950 or ''60 at the
      latest for the discovery of Europe.

I. — One confidential evening, not three months ago, Lionel Wallace
      told me this story of the Door in the Wall. And at the time I thought that
      so far as he was concerned it was a true story.

He told it me with such a direct simplicity of conviction that I could not
      do otherwise than believe in him. But in the morning, in my own flat, I
      woke to a different atmosphere, and as I lay in bed and recalled the
      things he had told me, stripped of the glamour of his earnest slow voice,
      denuded of the focussed, shaded table light, the shadowy atmosphere that
      wrapped about him and me, and the pleasant bright things, the dessert and
      glasses and napery of the dinner we had shared, making them for the time a
      bright little world quite cut off from everyday realities, I saw it all as
      frankly incredible. "He was mystifying!" I said, and then: "How well he
      did it!... It isn''t quite the thing I should have expected him, of all
      people, to do well."

Afterwards as I sat up in bed and sipped my morning tea, I found myself
      trying to account for the flavour of reality that perplexed me in his
      impossible reminiscences, by supposing they did in some way suggest,
      present, convey—I hardly know which word to use—experiences it
      was otherwise impossible to tell.

Well, I don''t resort to that explanation now. I have got over my
      intervening doubts. I believe now, as I believed at the moment of telling,
      that Wallace did to the very best of his ability strip the truth of his
      secret for me. But whether he himself saw, or only thought he saw, whether
      he himself was the possessor of an inestimable privilege or the victim of
      a fantastic dream, I cannot pretend to guess. Even the facts of his death,
      which ended my doubts for ever, throw no light on that.

I forget now what chance comment or criticism of mine moved so reticent a
      man to confide in me. He was, I think, defending himself against an
      imputation of slackness and unreliability I had made in relation to a
      great public movement, in which he had disappointed me. But he plunged
      suddenly. "I have," he said, "a preoccupation——

"I know," he went on, after a pause, "I have been negligent. The fact is—
      it isn''t a case of ghosts or apparitions—but—it''s an odd thing
      to tell of, Redmond—I am haunted. I am haunted by something—that
      rather takes the light out of things, that fills me with longings..."

He paused, checked by that English shyness that so often overcomes us when
      we would speak of moving or grave or beautiful things. "You were at Saint
      Aethelstan''s all through," he said, and for a moment that seemed to me
      quite irrelevant. "Well"—and he paused. Then very haltingly at
      first, but afterwards more easily, he began to tell of the thing that was
      hidden in his life, the haunting memory of a beauty and a happiness that
      filled his heart with insatiable longings, that made all the interests and
      spectacle of worldly life seem dull and tedious and vain to him.

Now that I have the clue to it, the thing seems written visibly in his
      face. I have a photograph in which that look of detachment has been caught
      and intensified. It reminds me of what a woman once said of him—a
      woman who had loved him greatly. "Suddenly," she said, "the interest goes
      out of him. He forgets you. He doesn''t care a rap for you—under his
      very nose..."

Yet the interest was not always out of him, and when he was holding his
      attention to a thing Wallace could contrive to be an extremely successful
      man. His career, indeed, is set with successes. He left me behind him long
      ago: he soared up over my head, and cut a figure in the world that I
      couldn''t cut—anyhow. He was still a year short of forty, and they
      say now that he would have been in office and very probably in the new
      Cabinet if he had lived. At school he always beat me without effort—as
      it were by nature. We were at school together at Saint Aethelstan''s
      College in West Kensington for almost all our school-time. He came into
      the school as my coequal, but he left far above me, in a blaze of
      scholarships and brilliant performance. Yet I think I made a fair average
      running. And it was at school I heard first of the "Door in the Wall"—that
      I was to hear of a second time only a month before his death.

To him at least the Door in the Wall was a real door, leading through a
      real wall to immortal realities. Of that I am now quite assured.

And it came into his life quite early, when he was a little fellow between
      five and six. I remember how, as he sat making his confession to me with a
      slow gravity, he reasoned and reckoned the date of it. "There was," he
      said, "a crimson Virginia creeper in it—all one bright uniform
      crimson, in a clear amber sunshine against a white wall. That came into
      the impression somehow, though I don''t clearly remember how, and there
      were horse-chestnut leaves upon the clean pavement outside the green door.
      They were blotched yellow and green, you know, not brown nor dirty, so
      that they must have been new fallen. I take it that means October. I look
      out for horse-chestnut leaves every year and I ought to know.

He was, he said, rather a precocious little boy—he learnt to talk at
      an abnormally early age, and he was so sane and "old-fashioned," as people
      say, that he was permitted an amount of initiative that most children
      scarcely attain by seven or eight. His mother died when he was two, and he
      was under the less vigilant and authoritative care of a nursery governess.
      His father was a stern, preoccupied lawyer, who gave him little attention,
      and expected great things of him. For all his brightness he found life a
      little grey and dull, I think. And one day he wandered.

He could not recall the particular neglect that enabled him to get away,
      nor the course he took among the West Kensington roads. All that had faded
      among the incurable blurs of memory. But the white wall and the green door
      stood out quite distinctly.

As his memory of that childish experience ran, he did at the very first
      sight of that door experience a peculiar emotion, an attraction, a desire
      to get to the door and open it and walk in. And at the same time he had
      the clearest conviction that either it was unwise or it was wrong of him—
      he could not tell which—to yield to this attraction. He insisted
      upon it as a curious thing that he knew from the very beginning—unless
      memory has played him the queerest trick—that the door was
      unfastened, and that he could go in as he chose.

I seem to see the figure of that little boy, drawn and repelled. And it
      was very clear in his mind, too, though why it should be so was never
      explained, that his father would be very angry if he went in through that
      door.

Wallace described all these moments of hesitation to me with the utmost
      particularity. He went right past the door, and then, with his hands in
      his pockets and making an infantile attempt to whistle, strolled right
      along beyond the end of the wall. There he recalls a number of mean dirty
      shops, and particularly that of a plumber and decorator with a dusty
      disorder of earthenware pipes, sheet lead, ball taps, pattern books of
      wall paper, and tins of enamel. He stood pretending to examine these
      things, and coveting, passionately desiring, the green door.

Then, he said, he had a gust of emotion. He made a run for it, lest
      hesitation should grip him again; he went plump with outstretched hand
      through the green door and let it slam behind him. And so, in a trice, he
      came into the garden that has haunted all his life.

It was very difficult for Wallace to give me his full sense of that garden
      into which he came.

There was something in the very air of it that exhilarated, that gave one
      a sense of lightness and good happening and well-being; there was
      something in the sight of it that made all its colour clean and perfect
      and subtly luminous. In the instant of coming into it one was exquisitely
      glad—as only in rare moments, and when one is young and joyful one
      can be glad in this world. And everything was beautiful there...

Wallace mused before he went on telling me. "You see," he said, with the
      doubtful inflection of a man who pauses at incredible things, "there were
      two great panthers there... Yes, spotted panthers. And I was not afraid.
      There was a long wide path with marble-edged flower borders on either
      side, and these two huge velvety beasts were playing there with a ball.
      One looked up and came towards me, a little curious as it seemed. It came
      right up to me, rubbed its soft round ear very gently against the small
      hand I held out, and purred. It was, I tell you, an enchanted garden. I
      know. And the size? Oh! it stretched far and wide, this way and that. I
      believe there were hills far away. Heaven knows where West Kensington had
      suddenly got to. And somehow it was just like coming home.

"You know, in the very moment the door swung to behind me, I forgot the
      road with its fallen chestnut leaves, its cabs and tradesmen''s carts, I
      forgot the sort of gravitational pull back to the discipline and obedience
      of home, I forgot all hesitations and fear, forgot discretion, forgot all
      the intimate realities of this life. I became in a moment a very glad and
      wonder-happy little boy—in another world. It was a world with a
      different quality, a warmer, more penetrating and mellower light, with a
      faint clear gladness in its air, and wisps of sun-touched cloud in the
      blueness of its sky. And before me ran this long wide path, invitingly,
      with weedless beds on either side, rich with untended flowers, and these
      two great panthers. I put my little hands fearlessly on their soft fur,
      and caressed their round ears and the sensitive corners under their ears,
      and played with them, and it was as though they welcomed me home. There
      was a keen sense of home-coming in my mind, and when presently a tall,
      fair girl appeared in the pathway and came to meet me, smiling, and said
      ''Well?'' to me, and lifted me, and kissed me, and put me down, and led me
      by the hand, there was no amazement, but only an impression of delightful
      rightness, of being reminded of happy things that had in some strange way
      been overlooked. There were broad red steps, I remember, that came into
      view between spikes of delphinium, and up these we went to a great avenue
      between very old and shady dark trees. All down this avenue, you know,
      between the red chapped stems, were marble seats of honour and statuary,
      and very tame and friendly white doves...

"Along this cool avenue my girl-friend led me, looking down—I recall
      the pleasant lines, the finely-modelled chin of her sweet kind face—asking
      me questions in a soft, agreeable voice, and telling me things, pleasant
      things I know, though what they were I was never able to recall...
      Presently a little Capuchin monkey, very clean, with a fur of ruddy brown
      and kindly hazel eyes, came down a tree to us and ran beside me, looking
      up at me and grinning, and presently leapt to my shoulder. So we two went
      on our way in great happiness."

"I remember little things. We passed an old man musing among laurels, I
      remember, and a place gay with paroquets, and came through a broad shaded
      colonnade to a spacious cool palace, full of pleasant fountains, full of
      beautiful things, full of the quality and promise of heart''s desire. And
      there were many things and many people, some that still seem to stand out
      clearly and some that are a little vague; but all these people were
      beautiful and kind. In some way—I don''t know how—it was
      conveyed to me that they all were kind to me, glad to have me there, and
      filling me with gladness by their gestures, by the touch of their hands,
      by the welcome and love in their eyes. Yes——"

He mused for a while. "Playmates I found there. That was very much to me,
      because I was a lonely little boy. They played delightful games in a
      grass-covered court where there was a sun-dial set about with flowers. And
      as one played one loved...

"But—it''s odd—there''s a gap in my memory. I don''t remember the
      games we played. I never remembered. Afterwards, as a child, I spent long
      hours trying, even with tears, to recall the form of that happiness. I
      wanted to play it all over again—in my nursery—by myself. No!
      All I remember is the happiness and two dear playfellows who were most
      with me... Then presently came a sombre dark woman, with a grave, pale
      face and dreamy eyes, a sombre woman, wearing a soft long robe of pale
      purple, who carried a book, and beckoned and took me aside with her into a
      gallery above a hall—though my playmates were loth to have me go,
      and ceased their game and stood watching as I was carried away. Come back
      to us!'' they cried. ''Come back to us soon!'' I looked up at her face, but
      she heeded them not at all. Her face was very gentle and grave. She took
      me to a seat in the gallery, and I stood beside her, ready to look at her
      book as she opened it upon her knee. The pages fell open. She pointed, and
      I looked, marvelling, for in the living pages of that book I saw myself;
      it was a story about myself, and in it were all the things that had
      happened to me since ever I was born...

"It was wonderful to me, because the pages of that book were not pictures,
      you understand, but realities."

"They were realities—-yes, they must have been; people moved and
      things came and went in them; my dear mother, whom I had near forgotten;
      then my father, stern and upright, the servants, the nursery, all the
      familiar things of home. Then the front door and the busy streets, with
      traffic to and fro. I looked and marvelled, and looked half doubtfully
      again into the woman''s face and turned the pages over, skipping this and
      that, to see more of this book and more, and so at last I came to myself
      hovering and hesitating outside the green door in the long white wall, and
      felt again the conflict and the fear.

"''And next?'' I cried, and would have turned on, but the cool hand of the
      grave woman delayed me.

"''Next?'' I insisted, and struggled gently with her hand, pulling up her
      fingers with all my childish strength, and as she yielded and the page
      came over she bent down upon me like a shadow and kissed my brow.

"But the page did not show the enchanted garden, nor the panthers, nor the
      girl who had led me by the hand, nor the playfellows who had been so loth
      to let me go. It showed a long grey street in West Kensington, in that
      chill hour of afternoon before the lamps are lit, and I was there, a
      wretched little figure, weeping aloud, for all that I could do to restrain
      myself, and I was weeping because I could not return to my dear
      playfellows who had called after me, ''Come back to us! Come back to us
      soon!'' I was there. This was no page in a book, but harsh reality; that
      enchanted place and the restraining hand of the grave mother at whose knee
      I stood had gone—whither had they gone?"

"Poor little wretch I was!—brought back to this grey world again! As
      I realised the fulness of what had happened to me, I gave way to quite
      ungovernable grief. And the shame and humiliation of that public weeping
      and my disgraceful home-coming remain with me still. I see again the
      benevolent-looking old gentleman in gold spectacles who stopped and spoke
      to me—prodding me first with his umbrella. ''Poor little chap,'' said
      he; ''and are you lost then?''—and me a London boy of five and more!
      And he must needs bring in a kindly young policeman and make a crowd of
      me, and so march me home. Sobbing, conspicuous, and frightened, I came
      back from the enchanted garden to the steps of my father''s house.

"That is as well as I can remember my vision of that garden—the
      garden that haunts me still. Of course, I can convey nothing of that
      indescribable quality of translucent unreality, that difference
      from the common things of experience that hung about it all; but that—
      that is what happened. If it was a dream, I am sure it was a day-time and
      altogether extraordinary dream... H''m!—naturally there followed a
      terrible questioning, by my aunt, my father, the nurse, the governess—
      everyone...

"I tried to tell them, and my father gave me my first thrashing for
      telling lies. When afterwards I tried to tell my aunt, she punished me
      again for my wicked persistence. Then, as I said, everyone was forbidden
      to listen to me, to hear a word about it. Even my fairytale books were
      taken away from me for a time—because I was too ''imaginative.'' Eh?
      Yes, they did that! My father belonged to the old school... And my story
      was driven back upon myself. I whispered it to my pillow—my pillow
      that was often damp and salt to my whispering lips with childish tears.
      And I added always to my official and less fervent prayers this one
      heartfelt request: ''Please God I may dream of the garden. Oh! take me back
      to my garden!'' Take me back to my garden! I dreamt often of the garden. I
      may have added to it, I may have changed it; I do not know... All this,
      you understand, is an attempt to reconstruct from fragmentary memories a
      very early experience. Between that and the other consecutive memories of
      my boyhood there is a gulf. A time came when it seemed impossible I should
      ever speak of that wonder glimpse again."

"No," he said. "I don''t remember that I ever attempted to find my way back
      to the garden in those early years. This seems odd to me now, but I think
      that very probably a closer watch was kept on my movements after this
      misadventure to prevent my going astray. No, it wasn''t till you knew me
      that I tried for the garden again. And I believe there was a period—
      incredible as it seems now—when I forgot the garden altogether—when
      I was about eight or nine it may have been. Do you remember me as a kid at
      Saint Aethelstan''s?"

"It was the sort of game," he went on, "that every imaginative child plays
      all day. The idea was the discovery of a North-West Passage to school. The
      way to school was plain enough; the game consisted in finding some way
      that wasn''t plain, starting off ten minutes early in some almost hopeless
      direction, and working my way round through unaccustomed streets to my
      goal. And one day I got entangled among some rather low-class streets on
      the other side of Campden Hill, and I began to think that for once the
      game would be against me and that I should get to school late. I tried
      rather desperately a street that seemed a cul-de-sac, and found a
      passage at the end. I hurried through that with renewed hope. ''I shall do
      it yet,'' I said, and passed a row of frowsy little shops that were
      inexplicably familiar to me, and behold! there was my long white wall and
      the green door that led to the enchanted garden!

"The thing whacked upon me suddenly. Then, after all, that garden, that
      wonderful garden, wasn''t a dream!"

"I suppose my second experience with the green door marks the world of
      difference there is between the busy life of a schoolboy and the infinite
      leisure of a child. Anyhow, this second time I didn''t for a moment think
      of going in straight away. You see——. For one thing, my mind
      was full of the idea of getting to school in time—set on not
      breaking my record for punctuality. I must surely have felt some
      little desire at least to try the door—yes. I must have felt that...
      But I seem to remember the attraction of the door mainly as another
      obstacle to my overmastering determination to get to school. I was
      immensely interested by this discovery I had made, of course—I went
      on with my mind full of it—but I went on. It didn''t check me. I ran
      past, tugging out my watch, found I had ten minutes still to spare, and
      then I was going downhill into familiar surroundings. I got to school,
      breathless, it is true, and wet with perspiration, but in time. I can
      remember hanging up my coat and hat... Went right by it and left it behind
      me. Odd, eh?"

He looked at me thoughtfully, "Of course I didn''t know then that it
      wouldn''t always be there. Schoolboys have limited imaginations. I suppose
      I thought it was an awfully jolly thing to have it there, to know my way
      back to it, but there was the school tugging at me. I expect I was a good
      deal distraught and inattentive that morning, recalling what I could of
      the beautiful strange people I should presently see again. Oddly enough I
      had no doubt in my mind that they would be glad to see me... Yes, I must
      have thought of the garden that morning just as a jolly sort of place to
      which one might resort in the interludes of a strenuous scholastic career.

"I didn''t go that day at all. The next day was a half holiday, and that
      may have weighed with me. Perhaps, too, my state of inattention brought
      down impositions upon me, and docked the margin of time necessary for the
      detour. I don''t know. What I do know is that in the meantime the
      enchanted garden was so much upon my mind that I could not keep it to
      myself.

"Young Hopkins," said I. — "Hopkins it was. I did not like telling
      him. I had a feeling that in some way it was against the rules to tell
      him, but I did. He was walking part of the way home with me; he was
      talkative, and if we had not talked about the enchanted garden we should
      have talked of something else, and it was intolerable to me to think about
      any other subject. So I blabbed.

"Well, he told my secret. The next day in the play interval I found myself
      surrounded by half a dozen bigger boys, half teasing, and wholly curious
      to hear more of the enchanted garden. There was that big Fawcett—you
      remember him?—and Carnaby and Morley Reynolds. You weren''t there by
      any chance? No, I think I should have remembered if you were...

"A boy is a creature of odd feelings. I was, I really believe, in spite of
      my secret self-disgust, a little flattered to have the attention of these
      big fellows. I remember particularly a moment of pleasure caused by the
      praise of Crawshaw—you remember Crawshaw major, the son of Crawshaw
      the composer?—who said it was the best lie he had ever heard. But at
      the same time there was a really painful undertow of shame at telling what
      I felt was indeed a sacred secret. That beast Fawcett made a joke about
      the girl in green——"

Wallace''s voice sank with the keen memory of that shame. "I pretended not
      to hear," he said. "Well, then Carnaby suddenly called me a young liar,
      and disputed with me when I said the thing was true. I said I knew where
      to find the green door, could lead them all there in ten minutes. Carnaby
      became outrageously virtuous, and said I''d have to—and bear out my
      words or suffer. Did you ever have Carnaby twist your arm? Then perhaps
      you''ll understand how it went with me. I swore my story was true. There
      was nobody in the school then to save a chap from Carnaby, though Crawshaw
      put in a word or so. Carnaby had got his game. I grew excited and
      red-eared, and a little frightened. I behaved altogether like a silly
      little chap, and the outcome of it all was that instead of starting alone
      for my enchanted garden, I led the way presently—cheeks flushed,
      ears hot, eyes smarting, and my soul one burning misery and shame—for
      a party of six mocking, curious, and threatening schoolfellows.

"And afterwards when I could go alone I couldn''t find it. I never found
      it. I seem now to have been always looking for it through my school-boy
      days, but I never came upon it—never."

"Beastly... Carnaby held a council over me for wanton lying. I remember
      how I sneaked home and upstairs to hide the marks of my blubbering. But
      when I cried myself to sleep at last it wasn''t for Carnaby, but for the
      garden, for the beautiful afternoon I had hoped for, for the sweet
      friendly women and the waiting playfellows, and the game I had hoped to
      learn again, that beautiful forgotten game...

"I believed firmly that if I had not told—... I had bad times after
      that—crying at night and wool-gathering by day. For two terms I
      slackened and had bad reports. Do you remember? Of course you would! It
      was you—your beating me in mathematics that brought me back
      to the grind again."

III. — For a time my friend stared silently into the red heart of
      the fire. Then he said: "I never saw it again until I was seventeen.

"It leapt upon me for the third time—as I was driving to Paddington
      on my way to Oxford and a scholarship. I had just one momentary glimpse. I
      was leaning over the apron of my hansom smoking a cigarette, and no doubt
      thinking myself no end of a man of the world, and suddenly there was the
      door, the wall, the dear sense of unforgettable and still attainable
      things.

"We clattered by—I too taken by surprise to stop my cab until we
      were well past and round a corner. Then I had a queer moment, a double and
      divergent movement of my will: I tapped the little door in the roof of the
      cab, and brought my arm down to pull out my watch. ''Yes, sir!'' said the
      cabman, smartly. ''Er—well—it''s nothing,'' I cried. ''My
      mistake! We haven''t much time! Go on!'' And he went on...

"I got my scholarship. And the night after I was told of that I sat over
      my fire in my little upper room, my study, in my father''s house, with his
      praise—his rare praise—and his sound counsels ringing in my
      ears, and I smoked my favourite pipe—the formidable bulldog of
      adolescence—and thought of that door in the long white wall. ''If I
      had stopped,'' I thought, ''I should have missed my scholarship, I should
      have missed Oxford—muddled all the fine career before me! I begin to
      see things better!'' I fell musing deeply, but I did not doubt then this
      career of mine was a thing that merited sacrifice.

"Those dear friends and that clear atmosphere seemed very sweet to me,
      very fine but remote. My grip was fixing now upon the world. I saw another
      door opening—the door of my career."

He stared again into the fire. Its red light picked out a stubborn
      strength in his face for just one flickering moment, and then it vanished
      again.

"Well," he said and sighed, "I have served that career. I have done—much
      work, much hard work. But I have dreamt of the enchanted garden a thousand
      dreams, and seen its door, or at least glimpsed its door, four times since
      then. Yes—four times. For a while this world was so bright and
      interesting, seemed so full of meaning and opportunity, that the
      half-effaced charm of the garden was by comparison gentle and remote. Who
      wants to pat panthers on the way to dinner with pretty women and
      distinguished men? I came down to London from Oxford, a man of bold
      promise that I have done something to redeem. Something—and yet
      there have been disappointments...

"Twice I have been in love—I will not dwell on that—but once,
      as I went to someone who, I knew, doubted whether I dared to come, I took
      a short cut at a venture through an unfrequented road near Earl''s Court,
      and so happened on a white wall and a familiar green door. ''Odd!'' said I
      to myself, ''but I thought this place was on Campden Hill. It''s the place I
      never could find somehow—like counting Stonehenge—the place of
      that queer daydream of mine.'' And I went by it intent upon my purpose. It
      had no appeal to me that afternoon.

"I had just a moment''s impulse to try the door, three steps aside were
      needed at the most—though I was sure enough in my heart that it
      would open to me—and then I thought that doing so might delay me on
      the way to that appointment in which I thought my honour was involved.
      Afterwards I was sorry for my punctuality—might at least have peeped
      in, I thought, and waved a hand to those panthers, but I knew enough by
      this time not to seek again belatedly that which is not found by seeking.
      Yes, that time made me very sorry...

"Years of hard work after that, and never a sight of the door. It''s only
      recently it has come back to me. With it there has come a sense as though
      some thin tarnish had spread itself over my world. I began to think of it
      as a sorrowful and bitter thing that I should never see that door again.
      Perhaps I was suffering a little from overwork—perhaps it was what
      I''ve heard spoken of as the feeling of forty. I don''t know. But certainly
      the keen brightness that makes effort easy has gone out of things
      recently, and that just at a time—with all these new political
      developments—when I ought to be working. Odd, isn''t it? But I do
      begin to find life toilsome, its rewards, as I come near them, cheap. I
      began a little while ago to want the garden quite badly. Yes—and
      I''ve seen it three times."

He leant over the table to me, with an enormous sorrow in his voice as he
      spoke. "Thrice I have had my chance—thrice! If ever that door
      offers itself to me again, I swore, I will go in, out of this dust and
      heat, out of this dry glitter of vanity, out of these toilsome futilities.
      I will go and never return. This time I will stay... I swore it, and when
      the time came—I didn''t go.

"Three times in one year have I passed that door and failed to enter.
      Three times in the last year.

"The first time was on the night of the snatch division on the Tenants''
      Redemption Bill, on which the Government was saved by a majority of three.
      You remember? No one on our side—perhaps very few on the opposite
      side— expected the end that night. Then the debate collapsed like
      eggshells. I and Hotchkiss were dining with his cousin at Brentford; we
      were both unpaired, and we were called up by telephone, and set off at
      once in his cousin''s motor. We got in barely in time, and on the way we
      passed my wall and door—livid in the moonlight, blotched with hot
      yellow as the glare of our lamps lit it, but unmistakable. ''My God!'' cried
      I. ''What?'' said Hotchkiss. ''Nothing!'' I answered, and the moment passed.

"''I''ve made a great sacrifice,'' I told the whip as I got in. ''They all
      have,'' he said, and hurried by.

"I do not see how I could have done otherwise then. And the next occasion
      was as I rushed to my father''s bedside to bid that stern old man farewell.
      Then, too, the claims of life were imperative. But the third time was
      different; it happened a week ago. It fills me with hot remorse to recall
      it. I was with Gurker and Ralphs—it''s no secret now, you know, that
      I''ve had my talk with Gurker. We had been dining at Frobisher''s, and the
      talk had become intimate between us. The question of my place in the
      reconstructed Ministry lay always just over the boundary of the
      discussion. Yes—yes. That''s all settled. It needn''t be talked about
      yet, but there''s no reason to keep a secret from you... Yes—thanks!
      thanks! But let me tell you my story.

"Then, on that night things were very much in the air. My position was a
      very delicate one. I was keenly anxious to get some definite word from
      Gurker, but was hampered by Ralphs'' presence. I was using the best power
      of my brain to keep that light and careless talk not too obviously
      directed to the point that concerned me. I had to. Ralphs'' behaviour since
      has more than justified my caution... Ralphs, I knew, would leave us
      beyond the Kensington High Street, and then I could surprise Gurker by a
      sudden frankness. One has sometimes to resort to these little devices...
      And then it was that in the margin of my field of vision I became aware
      once more of the white wall, the green door before us down the road.

"We passed it talking. I passed it. I can still see the shadow of Gurker''s
      marked profile, his opera hat tilted forward over his prominent nose, the
      many folds of his neck wrap going before my shadow and Ralphs'' as we
      sauntered past.

"I passed within twenty inches of the door. ''If I say good-night to them,
      and go in,'' I asked myself, ''what will happen?'' And I was all a-tingle for
      that word with Gurker.

"I could not answer that question in the tangle of my other problems.
      ''They will think me mad,'' I thought. ''And suppose I vanish now!—-Amazing
      disappearance of a prominent politician!'' That weighed with me. A thousand
      inconceivably petty worldlinesses weighed with me in that crisis."

"Here I am!" he repeated, "and my chance has gone from me. Three times in
      one year the door has been offered me—the door that goes into peace,
      into delight, into a beauty beyond dreaming, a kindness no man on earth
      can know. And I have rejected it, Redmond, and it has gone——"

"I know. I know. I am left now to work it out, to stick to the tasks that
      held me so strongly when my moments came. You say I have success—this
      vulgar, tawdry, irksome, envied thing. I have it." He had a walnut in his
      big hand. "If that was my success," he said, and crushed it, and held it
      out for me to see.

"Let me tell you something, Redmond. This loss is destroying me. For two
      months, for ten weeks nearly now, I have done no work at all, except the
      most necessary and urgent duties. My soul is full of inappeasable regrets.
      At nights—when it is less likely I shall be recognised—I go
      out. I wander. Yes. I wonder what people would think of that if they knew.
      A Cabinet Minister, the responsible head of that most vital of all
      departments, wandering alone—grieving—sometimes near audibly
      lamenting— for a door, for a garden!"

IV. — I can see now his rather pallid face, and the unfamiliar
      sombre fire that had come into his eyes. I see him very vividly to-night.
      I sit recalling his words, his tones, and last evening''s Westminster
      Gazette still lies on my sofa, containing the notice of his death. At
      lunch to-day the club was busy with his death. We talked of nothing else.

They found his body very early yesterday morning in a deep excavation near
      East Kensington Station. It is one of two shafts that have been made in
      connection with an extension of the railway southward. It is protected
      from the intrusion of the public by a hoarding upon the high road, in
      which a small doorway has been cut for the convenience of some of the
      workmen who live in that direction. The doorway was left unfastened
      through a misunderstanding between two gangers, and through it he made his
      way...

It would seem he walked all the way from the House that night—he has
      frequently walked home during the past Session—and so it is I figure
      his dark form coming along the late and empty streets, wrapped up, intent.
      And then did the pale electric lights near the station cheat the rough
      planking into a semblance of white? Did that fatal unfastened door awaken
      some memory?

I do not know. I have told his story as he told it to me. There are times
      when I believe that Wallace was no more than the victim of the coincidence
      between a rare but not unprecedented type of hallucination and a careless
      trap, but that indeed is not my profoundest belief. You may think me
      superstitious, if you will, and foolish; but, indeed, I am more than half
      convinced that he had, in truth, an abnormal gift, and a sense, something—I
      know not what—-that in the guise of wall and door offered him an
      outlet, a secret and peculiar passage of escape into another and
      altogether more beautiful world. At any rate, you will say, it betrayed
      him in the end. But did it betray him? There you touch the inmost mystery
      of these dreamers, these men of vision and the imagination. We see our
      world fair and common, the hoarding and the pit. By our daylight standard
      he walked out of security into darkness, danger, and death.

Three hundred miles and more from Chimborazo, one hundred from the snows
      of Cotopaxi, in the wildest wastes of Ecuador''s Andes, there lies that
      mysterious mountain valley, cut off from the world of men, the Country of
      the Blind. Long years ago that valley lay so far open to the world that
      men might come at last through frightful gorges and over an icy pass into
      its equable meadows; and thither indeed men came, a family or so of
      Peruvian half-breeds fleeing from the lust and tyranny of an evil Spanish
      ruler. Then came the stupendous outbreak of Mindobamba, when it was night
      in Quito for seventeen days, and the water was boiling at Yaguachi and all
      the fish floating dying even as far as Guayaquil; everywhere along the
      Pacific slopes there were land-slips and swift thawings and sudden floods,
      and one whole side of the old Arauca crest slipped and came down in
      thunder, and cut off the Country of the Blind for ever from the exploring
      feet of men. But one of these early settlers had chanced to be on the
      hither side of the gorges when the world had so terribly shaken itself,
      and he perforce had to forget his wife and his child and all the friends
      and possessions he had left up there, and start life over again in the
      lower world. He started it again but ill, blindness overtook him, and he
      died of punishment in the mines; but the story he told begot a legend that
      lingers along the length of the Cordilleras of the Andes to this day.

He told of his reason for venturing back from that fastness, into which he
      had first been carried lashed to a llama, beside a vast bale of gear, when
      he was a child. The valley, he said, had in it all that the heart of man
      could desire—sweet water, pasture, and even climate, slopes of rich
      brown soil with tangles of a shrub that bore an excellent fruit, and on
      one side great hanging forests of pine that held the avalanches high. Far
      overhead, on three sides, vast cliffs of grey-green rock were capped by
      cliffs of ice; but the glacier stream came not to them but flowed away by
      the farther slopes, and only now and then huge ice masses fell on the
      valley side. In this valley it neither rained nor snowed, but the abundant
      springs gave a rich green pasture, that irrigation would spread over all
      the valley space. The settlers did well indeed there. Their beasts did
      well and multiplied, and but one thing marred their happiness. Yet it was
      enough to mar it greatly. A strange disease had come upon them, and had
      made all the children born to them there—and indeed, several older
      children also—blind. It was to seek some charm or antidote against
      this plague of blindness that he had with fatigue and danger and
      difficulty returned down the gorge. In those days, in such cases, men did
      not think of germs and infections but of sins; and it seemed to him that
      the reason of this affliction must lie in the negligence of these
      priestless immigrants to set up a shrine so soon as they entered the
      valley. He wanted a shrine—a handsome, cheap, effectual shrine—to
      be erected in the valley; he wanted relics and such-like potent things of
      faith, blessed objects and mysterious medals and prayers. In his wallet he
      had a bar of native silver for which he would not account; he insisted
      there was none in the valley with something of the insistence of an
      inexpert liar. They had all clubbed their money and ornaments together,
      having little need for such treasure up there, he said, to buy them holy
      help against their ill. I figure this dim-eyed young mountaineer,
      sunburnt, gaunt, and anxious, hat-brim clutched feverishly, a man all
      unused to the ways of the lower world, telling this story to some
      keen-eyed, attentive priest before the great convulsion; I can picture him
      presently seeking to return with pious and infallible remedies against
      that trouble, and the infinite dismay with which he must have faced the
      tumbled vastness where the gorge had once come out. But the rest of his
      story of mischances is lost to me, save that I know of his evil death
      after several years. Poor stray from that remoteness! The stream that had
      once made the gorge now bursts from the mouth of a rocky cave, and the
      legend his poor, ill-told story set going developed into the legend of a
      race of blind men somewhere "over there" one may still hear to-day.

And amidst the little population of that now isolated and forgotten valley
      the disease ran its course. The old became groping and purblind, the young
      saw but dimly, and the children that were born to them saw never at all.
      But life was very easy in that snow-rimmed basin, lost to all the world,
      with neither thorns nor briars, with no evil insects nor any beasts save
      the gentle breed of llamas they had lugged and thrust and followed up the
      beds of the shrunken rivers in the gorges up which they had come. The
      seeing had become purblind so gradually that they scarcely noted their
      loss. They guided the sightless youngsters hither and thither until they
      knew the whole Valley marvellously, and when at last sight died out among
      them the race lived on. They had even time to adapt themselves to the
      blind control of fire, which they made carefully in stoves of stone. They
      were a simple strain of people at the first, unlettered, only slightly
      touched with the Spanish civilisation, but with something of a tradition
      of the arts of old Peru and of its lost philosophy. Generation followed
      generation. They forgot many things; they devised many things. Their
      tradition of the greater world they came from became mythical in colour
      and uncertain. In all things save sight they were strong and able, and
      presently the chance of birth and heredity sent one who had an original
      mind and who could talk and persuade among them, and then afterwards
      another. These two passed, leaving their effects, and the little community
      grew in numbers and in understanding, and met and settled social and
      economic problems that arose. Generation followed generation. Generation
      followed generation. There came a time when a child was born who was
      fifteen generations from that ancestor who went out of the valley with a
      bar of silver to seek God''s aid, and who never returned. Thereabouts it
      chanced that a man came into this community from the outer world. And this
      is the story of that man.

He was a mountaineer from the country near Quito, a man who had been down
      to the sea and had seen the world, a reader of books in an original way,
      an acute and enterprising man, and he was taken on by a party of
      Englishmen who had come out to Ecuador to climb mountains, to replace one
      of their three Swiss guides who had fallen ill. He climbed here and he
      climbed there, and then came the attempt on Parascotopetl, the Matterhorn
      of the Andes, in which he was lost to the outer world. The story of the
      accident has been written a dozen times. Pointer''s narrative is the best.
      He tells how the little party worked their difficult and almost vertical
      way up to the very foot of the last and greatest precipice, and how they
      built a night shelter amidst the snow upon a little shelf of rock, and,
      with a touch of real dramatic power, how presently they found Nunez had
      gone from them. They shouted, and there was no reply; shouted and
      whistled, and for the rest of that night they slept no more.

As the morning broke they saw the traces of his fall. It seems impossible
      he could have uttered a sound. He had slipped eastward towards the unknown
      side of the mountain; far below he had struck a steep slope of snow, and
      ploughed his way down it in the midst of a snow avalanche. His track went
      straight to the edge of a frightful precipice, and beyond that everything
      was hidden. Far, far below, and hazy with distance, they could see trees
      rising out of a narrow, shut-in valley—the lost Country of the
      Blind. But they did not know it was the lost Country of the Blind, nor
      distinguish it in any way from any other narrow streak of upland valley.
      Unnerved by this disaster, they abandoned their attempt in the afternoon,
      and Pointer was called away to the war before he could make another
      attack. To this day Parascotopetl lifts an unconquered crest, and
      Pointer''s shelter crumbles unvisited amidst the snows.

At the end of the slope he fell a thousand feet, and came down in the
      midst of a cloud of snow upon a snow slope even steeper than the one
      above. Down this he was whirled, stunned and insensible, but without a
      bone broken in his body; and then at last came to gentler slopes, and at
      last rolled out and lay still, buried amidst a softening heap of the white
      masses that had accompanied and saved him. He came to himself with a dim
      fancy that he was ill in bed; then realised his position with a
      mountaineer''s intelligence, and worked himself loose and, after a rest or
      so, out until he saw the stars. He rested flat upon his chest for a space,
      wondering where he was and what had happened to him. He explored his
      limbs, and discovered that several of his buttons were gone and his coat
      turned over his head. His knife had gone from his pocket and his hat was
      lost, though he had tied it under his chin. He recalled that he had been
      looking for loose stones to raise his piece of the shelter wall. His
      ice-axe had disappeared.

He decided he must have fallen, and looked up to see, exaggerated by the
      ghastly light of the rising moon, the tremendous flight he had taken. For
      a while he lay, gazing blankly at that vast pale cliff towering above,
      rising moment by moment out of a subsiding tide of darkness. Its
      phantasmal, mysterious beauty held him for a space, and then he was seized
      with a paroxysm of sobbing laughter...

After a great interval of time he became aware that he was near the lower
      edge of the snow. Below, down what was now a moonlit and practicable
      slope, he saw the dark and broken appearance of rock-strewn turf. He
      struggled to his feet, aching in every joint and limb, got down painfully
      from the heaped loose snow about him, went downward until he was on the
      turf, and there dropped rather than lay beside a boulder, drank deep from
      the flask in his inner pocket, and instantly fell asleep...

He sat up and perceived he was on a little alp at the foot of a vast
      precipice, that was grooved by the gully down which he and his snow had
      come. Over against him another wall of rock reared itself against the sky.
      The gorge between these precipices ran east and west and was full of the
      morning sunlight, which lit to the westward the mass of fallen mountain
      that closed the descending gorge. Below him it seemed there was a
      precipice equally steep, but behind the snow in the gully he found a sort
      of chimney-cleft dripping with snow-water down which a desperate man might
      venture. He found it easier than it seemed, and came at last to another
      desolate alp, and then after a rock climb of no particular difficulty to a
      steep slope of trees. He took his bearings and turned his face up the
      gorge, for he saw it opened out above upon green meadows, among which he
      now glimpsed quite distinctly a cluster of stone huts of unfamiliar
      fashion. At times his progress was like clambering along the face of a
      wall, and after a time the rising sun ceased to strike along the gorge,
      the voices of the singing birds died away, and the air grew cold and dark
      about him. But the distant valley with its houses was all the brighter for
      that. He came presently to talus, and among the rocks he noted—for
      he was an observant man—an unfamiliar fern that seemed to clutch out
      of the crevices with intense green hands. He picked a frond or so and
      gnawed its stalk and found it helpful.

About midday he came at last out of the throat of the gorge into the plain
      and the sunlight. He was stiff and weary; he sat down in the shadow of a
      rock, filled up his flask with water from a spring and drank it down, and
      remained for a time resting before he went on to the houses.

They were very strange to his eyes, and indeed the whole aspect of that
      valley became, as he regarded it, queerer and more unfamiliar. The greater
      part of its surface was lush green meadow, starred with many beautiful
      flowers, irrigated with extraordinary care, and bearing evidence of
      systematic cropping piece by piece. High up and ringing the valley about
      was a wall, and what appeared to be a circumferential water-channel, from
      which the little trickles of water that fed the meadow plants came, and on
      the higher slopes above this flocks of llamas cropped the scanty herbage.
      Sheds, apparently shelters or feeding-places for the llamas, stood against
      the boundary wall here and there. The irrigation streams ran together into
      a main channel down the centre of the valley, and this was enclosed on
      either side by a wall breast high. This gave a singularly urban quality to
      this secluded place, a quality that was greatly enhanced by the fact that
      a number of paths paved with black and white stones, and each with a
      curious little kerb at the side, ran hither and thither in an orderly
      manner. The houses of the central village were quite unlike the casual and
      higgledy-piggledy agglomeration of the mountain villages he knew; they
      stood in a continuous row on either side of a central street of
      astonishing cleanness; here and there their particoloured facade was
      pierced by a door, and not a solitary window broke their even frontage.
      They were particoloured with extraordinary irregularity, smeared with a
      sort of plaster that was sometimes grey, sometimes drab, sometimes
      slate-coloured or dark brown; and it was the sight of this wild plastering
      first brought the word "blind" into the thoughts of the explorer. "The
      good man who did that," he thought, "must have been as blind as a bat."

He descended a steep place, and so came to the wall and channel that ran
      about the valley, near where the latter spouted out its surplus contents
      into the deeps of the gorge in a thin and wavering thread of cascade. He
      could now see a number of men and women resting on piled heaps of grass,
      as if taking a siesta, in the remoter part of the meadow, and nearer the
      village a number of recumbent children, and then nearer at hand three men
      carrying pails on yokes along a little path that ran from the encircling
      wall towards the houses. These latter were clad in garments of llama cloth
      and boots and belts of leather, and they wore caps of cloth with back and
      ear flaps. They followed one another in single file, walking slowly and
      yawning as they walked, like men who have been up all night. There was
      something so reassuringly prosperous and respectable in their bearing that
      after a moment''s hesitation Nunez stood forward as conspicuously as
      possible upon his rock, and gave vent to a mighty shout that echoed round
      the valley.

The three men stopped, and moved their heads as though they were looking
      about them. They turned their faces this way and that, and Nunez
      gesticulated with freedom. But they did not appear to see him for all his
      gestures, and after a time, directing themselves towards the mountains far
      away to the right, they shouted as if in answer. Nunez bawled again, and
      then once more, and as he gestured ineffectually the word "blind" came up
      to the top of his thoughts. "The fools must be blind," he said.

When at last, after much shouting and wrath, Nunez crossed the stream by a
      little bridge, came through a gate in the wall, and approached them, he
      was sure that they were blind. He was sure that this was the Country of
      the Blind of which the legends told. Conviction had sprung upon him, and a
      sense of great and rather enviable adventure. The three stood side by
      side, not looking at him, but with their ears directed towards him,
      judging him by his unfamiliar steps. They stood close together like men a
      little afraid, and he could see their eyelids closed and sunken, as though
      the very balls beneath had shrunk away. There was an expression near awe
      on their faces.

"A man," one said, in hardly recognisable Spanish—"a man it is—a
      man or a spirit—coming down from the rocks."

But Nunez advanced with the confident steps of a youth who enters upon
      life. All the old stories of the lost valley and the Country of the Blind
      had come back to his mind, and through his thoughts ran this old proverb,
      as if it were a refrain—

"Over the mountains I come," said Nunez, "out of the country beyond there—where
      men can see. From near Bogota, where there are a hundred thousands of
      people, and where the city passes out of sight."

The cloth of their coats Nunez saw was curiously fashioned, each with a
      different sort of stitching.

They startled him by a simultaneous movement towards him, each with a hand
      outstretched. He stepped back from the advance of these spread fingers.

"Carefully," he cried, with a finger in his eye, and found they thought
      that organ, with its fluttering lids, a queer thing in him. They went over
      it again.

"A strange creature, Correa," said the one called Pedro. "Feel the
      coarseness of his hair. Like a llama''s hair."

"Rough he is as the rocks that begot him," said Correa, investigating
      Nunez''s unshaven chin with a soft and slightly moist hand. "Perhaps he
      will grow finer." Nunez struggled a little under their examination, but
      they gripped him firm.

"Out of the world. Over mountains and glaciers; right over above
      there, half-way to the sun. Out of the great big world that goes down,
      twelve days'' journey to the sea."

They scarcely seemed to heed him. "Our fathers have told us men may be
      made by the forces of Nature," said Correa. "It is the warmth of things
      and moisture, and rottenness—rottenness."

"His senses are still imperfect," said the third blind man. "He stumbles,
      and talks unmeaning words. Lead him by the hand."

He heard people shouting, and saw a number of figures gathering together
      in the middle roadway of the village.

He found it tax his nerve and patience more than he had anticipated, that
      first encounter with the population of the Country of the Blind. The place
      seemed larger as he drew near to it, and the smeared plasterings queerer,
      and a crowd of children and men and women (the women and girls, he was
      pleased to note, had some of them quite sweet faces, for all that their
      eyes were shut and sunken) came about him, holding on to him, touching him
      with soft, sensitive hands, smelling at him, and listening at every word
      he spoke. Some of the maidens and children, however, kept aloof as if
      afraid, and indeed his voice seemed coarse and rude beside their softer
      notes. They mobbed him. His three guides kept close to him with an effect
      of proprietorship, and said again and again, "A wild man out of the rock."

"A wild man—using wild words," said Pedro. "Did you hear that—
      Bogota? His mind is hardly formed yet. He has only the beginnings
      of speech."

And they thrust him suddenly through a doorway into a room as black as
      pitch, save at the end there faintly glowed a fire. The crowd closed in
      behind him and shut out all but the faintest glimmer of day, and before he
      could arrest himself he had fallen headlong over the feet of a seated man.
      His arm, outflung, struck the face of someone else as he went down; he
      felt the soft impact of features and heard a cry of anger, and for a
      moment he struggled against a number of hands that clutched him. It was a
      one-sided fight. An inkling of the situation came to him, and he lay
      quiet.

There was a pause as if the unseen persons about him tried to understand
      his words. Then the voice of Correa said: "He is but newly formed. He
      stumbles as he walks and mingles words that mean nothing with his speech."

The voice of an older man began to question him, and Nunez found himself
      trying to explain the great world out of which he had fallen, and the sky
      and mountains and sight and such-like marvels, to these elders who sat in
      darkness in the Country of the Blind. And they would believe and
      understand nothing whatever he told them, a thing quite outside his
      expectation. They would not even understand many of his words. For
      fourteen generations these people had been blind and cut off from all the
      seeing world; the names for all the things of sight had faded and changed;
      the story of the outer world was faded and changed to a child''s story; and
      they had ceased to concern themselves with anything beyond the rocky
      slopes above their circling wall. Blind men of genius had arisen among
      them and questioned the shreds of belief and tradition they had brought
      with them from their seeing days, and had dismissed all these things as
      idle fancies, and replaced them with new and saner explanations. Much of
      their imagination had shrivelled with their eyes, and they had made for
      themselves new imaginations with their ever more sensitive ears and
      finger-tips. Slowly Nunez realised this; that his expectation of wonder
      and reverence at his origin and his gifts was not to be borne out; and
      after his poor attempt to explain sight to them had been set aside as the
      confused version of a new-made being describing the marvels of his
      incoherent sensations, he subsided, a little dashed, into listening to
      their instruction. And the eldest of the blind men explained to him life
      and philosophy and religion, how that the world (meaning their valley) had
      been first an empty hollow in the rocks, and then had come, first,
      inanimate things without the gift of touch, and llamas and a few other
      creatures that had little sense, and then men, and at last angels, whom
      one could hear singing and making fluttering sounds, but whom no one could
      touch at all, which puzzled Nunez greatly until he thought of the birds.

He went on to tell Nunez how this time had been divided into the warm and
      the cold, which are the blind equivalents of day and night, and how it was
      good to sleep in the warm and work during the cold, so that now, but for
      his advent, the whole town of the blind would have been asleep. He said
      Nunez must have been specially created to learn and serve the wisdom, they
      had acquired, and that for all his mental incoherency and stumbling
      behaviour he must have courage, and do his best to learn, and at that all
      the people in the doorway murmured encouragingly. He said the night—for
      the blind call their day night—was now far gone, and it behoved
      every one to go back to sleep. He asked Nunez if he knew how to sleep, and
      Nunez said he did, but that before sleep he wanted food.

They brought him food—llama''s milk in a bowl, and rough salted bread—and
      led him into a lonely place, to eat out of their hearing, and afterwards
      to slumber until the chill of the mountain evening roused them to begin
      their day again. But Nunez slumbered not at all.

Instead, he sat up in the place where they had left him, resting his limbs
      and turning the unanticipated circumstances of his arrival over and over
      in his mind.

"Unformed mind!" he said. "Got no senses yet! They little know they''ve
      been insulting their heaven-sent king and master. I see I must bring them
      to reason. Let me think—let me think."

Nunez had an eye for all beautiful things, and it seemed to him that the
      glow upon the snowfields and glaciers that rose about the valley on every
      side was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. His eyes went from
      that inaccessible glory to the village and irrigated fields, fast sinking
      into the twilight, and suddenly a wave of emotion took him, and he thanked
      God from the bottom of his heart that the power of sight had been given
      him.

At that he stood up smiling. He would show these people once and for all
      what sight would do for a man. They would seek him, but not find him.

"Why did you not come when I called you?" said the blind man. "Must you be
      led like a child? Cannot you hear the path as you walk?"

"There is no such word as see," said the blind man, after a pause.
      "Cease this folly, and follow the sound of my feet."

Four days passed, and the fifth found the King of the Blind still
      incognito, as a clumsy and useless stranger among his subjects.

It was, he found, much more difficult to proclaim himself than he had
      supposed, and in the meantime, while he meditated his coup d''itat,
      he did what he was told and learnt the manners and customs of the Country
      of the Blind. He found working and going about at night a particularly
      irksome thing, and he decided that that should be the first thing he would
      change.

They led a simple, laborious life, these people, with all the elements of
      virtue and happiness, as these things can be understood by men. They
      toiled, but not oppressively; they had food and clothing sufficient for
      their needs; they had days and seasons of rest; they made much of music
      and singing, and there was love among them, and little children.

It was marvellous with what confidence and precision they went about their
      ordered world. Everything, you see, had been made to fit their needs; each
      of the radiating paths of the valley area had a constant angle to the
      others, and was distinguished by a special notch upon its kerbing; all
      obstacles and irregularities of path or meadow had long since been cleared
      away; all their methods and procedure arose naturally from their special
      needs. Their senses had become marvellously acute; they could hear and
      judge the slightest gesture of a man a dozen paces away—could hear
      the very beating of his heart. Intonation had long replaced expression
      with them, and touches gesture, and their work with hoe and spade and fork
      was as free and confident as garden work can be. Their sense of smell was
      extraordinarily fine; they could distinguish individual differences as
      readily as a dog can, and they went about the tending of the llamas, who
      lived among the rocks above and came to the wall for food and shelter,
      with ease and confidence. It was only when at last Nunez sought to assert
      himself that he found how easy and confident their movements could be.

He tried at first on several occasions to tell them of sight. "Look you
      here, you people," he said. "There are things you do not understand in
      me."

Once or twice one or two of them attended to him; they sat with faces
      downcast and ears turned intelligently towards him, and he did his best to
      tell them what it was to see. Among his hearers was a girl, with eyelids
      less red and sunken than the others, so that one could almost fancy she
      was hiding eyes, whom especially he hoped to persuade. He spoke of the
      beauties of sight, of watching the mountains, of the sky and the sunrise,
      and they heard him with amused incredulity that presently became
      condemnatory. They told him there were indeed no mountains at all, but
      that the end of the rocks where the llamas grazed was indeed the end of
      the world; thence sprang a cavernous ' WHERE id = 'ee364418-59f6-4a5c-b61e-e19060e1944f';
