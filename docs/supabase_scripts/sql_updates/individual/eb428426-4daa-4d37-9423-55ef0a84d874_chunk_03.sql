Ashley Down, to see that in the main the latter work so far resembles
the former as to be in not a few respects its counterpart. Mr. Müller
began his orphan work a little more than one hundred years after
Francke''s death; ultimately housed, fed, clothed, and taught over two
thousand orphans year by year; personally supervised the work for over
sixty years—twice as long a period as that of Francke''s personal
management—and at his decease likewise left his like minded son-in-law
to be his successor as the sole director of the work. It need not be
added that, beginning his enterprise like Francke in dependence on God
alone, the founder of the Bristol Orphan Houses trusted from first to
last only in Him.

It is very noticeable how, when God is preparing a workman for a certain
definite service, He often leads him out of the beaten track into a path
peculiarly His own by means of some striking biography, or by contact
with some other living servant who is doing some such work, and
exhibiting the spirit which must guide if there is to be a true success.
Meditation on Franeke''s life and work naturally led this man who was
hungering for a wider usefulness to think more of the poor homeless
waifs about him, and to ask whether he also could not plan under God
some way to provide for them; and as he was musing the fire burned.

As early as June 12, 1833, when not yet twenty-eight years old, the
inward flame began to find vent in a scheme which proved the first
forward step toward his orphan work. It occurred to him to gather out of
the streets, at about eight o''clock each morning, the poor children,
give them a bit of bread for breakfast, and then, for about an hour and
a half, teach them to read or read to them the Holy Scriptures; and
later on to do a like service to the adult and aged poor. He began at
once to feed from thirty to forty such persons, confident that, as the
number increased, the Lord''s provision would increase also. Unburdening
his heart to Mr. Craik, he was guided to a place which could hold one
hundred and fifty children and which could be rented for ten shillings
yearly; as also to an aged brother who would gladly undertake the
teaching.

Unexpected obstacles, however, prevented the carrying out of this plan.
The work already pressing upon Mr. Müller and Mr. Craik, the rapid
increase of applicants for food, and the annoyance to neighbours of
having crowds of idlers congregating in the streets and lying about in
troops—these were some of the reasons why this method was abandoned.
But the central thought and aim were never lost sight of: God had
planted a seed in the soil of Mr. Müllers heart, presently to spring up
in the orphan work, and in the Scriptural Knowledge Institution with its
many branches and far-reaching fruits.

From time to time a backward glance over the Lord''s dealings encouraged
his heart, as he looked forward to unknown paths and untried scenes. He
records at this time—the close of the year 1833—that during the four
years since he first began to trust in the Lord alone for temporal
supplies he had suffered no want. He had received during the first year
one hundred and thirty pounds, during the second one hundred and
fifty-one, during the third one hundred and ninety-five, and during the
last two hundred and sixty-seven—all in free-will offerings and without
ever asking any human being for a penny. He had looked alone to the
Lord, yet he had not only received a supply, but an increasing supply,
year by year. Yet he also noticed that at each year''s close he had very
little, if anything, left, and that much had come through strange
channels, from distances very remote, and from parties whom he had never
seen. He observed also that in every case, according as the need was
greater or less, the supply corresponded. He carefully records for the
benefit of others that, when the calls for help were many, the Great
Provider showed Himself able and willing to send help accordingly.* The
ways of divine dealing which he had thus found true of the early years
of his life of trust were marked and magnified in all his
after-experience, and the lessons learned in these first four years
prepared him for others taught in the same school of God and under the
same Teacher.

Thus God had brought His servant by a way which he knew not to the very
place and sphere of his life''s widest and most enduring work. He had
moulded and shaped His chosen vessel, and we are now to see to what
purposes of world-wide usefulness that earthen vessel was to be put, and
how conspicuously the excellency of the power was to be of God and not
of man.

THE time was now fully come when the divine Husbandman was to glorify
Himself by a product of His own husbandry in the soil of Bristol.

On February 20, 1834, George Müller was led of God to sow the seed of
what ultimately developed into a great means of good, known as "The
Scriptural Knowledge Institution, for Home and Abroad." As in all other
steps of his life, this was the result of much prayer, meditation on the
Word, searching of his own heart, and patient waiting to know the mind
of God.

A brief statement of the reasons for founding such an institution, and
the principles on which it was based, will be helpful at this point.
Motives of conscience controlled Mr. Müller and Mr. Craik in starting a
new work rather than in uniting with existing societies already
established for missionary purposes, Bible and tract distribution, and
for the promotion of Christian schools. As they had sought to conform
personal life and church conduct wholly to the scriptural pattern, they
felt that all work for God should be carefully carried on in exact
accordance with His known will, in order to have His fullest blessing.
Many features of the existing societies seemed to them extra-scriptural,
if not decidedly anti-scriptural, and these they felt constrained to
avoid.

For example, they felt that the end proposed by such organizations,
namely, the conversion of the world in this dispensation, was not
justified by the Word, which everywhere represents this as the age of
the outgathering of the church from the world, and not the
ingathering of the world into the church. To set such an end before
themselves as the world''s conversion would therefore not only be
unwarranted by Scripture, but delusive and disappointing, disheartening
God''s servants by the failure to realize the result, and dishonoring to
God Himself by making Him to appear unfaithful.

Again, these existing societies seemed to Mr. Müller and Mr. Craik to
sustain a wrong relation to the world—mixed up with it, instead of
separate from it. Any one by paying a certain fixed sum of money might
become a member or even a director, having a voice or vote in the
conduct of affairs and becoming eligible to office. Unscriptural means
were commonly used to raise money, such as appealing for aid to
unconverted persons, asking for donations simply for money''s sake and
without regard to the character of the donors or the manner in which the
money was obtained. The custom of seeking patronage from men of the
world and asking such to preside at public meetings, and the habit of
contracting debts,—these and some other methods of management seemed
so unscriptural and unspiritual that the founders of this new
institution could not with a good conscience give them sanction. Hence
they hoped that by basing their work upon thoroughly biblical principles
they might secure many blessed results.

First of all, they confidently believed that the work of the Lord could
be best and most successfully carried on within the landmarks and limits
set up in His word; that the fact of thus carrying it on would give
boldness in prayer and confidence in labour. But they also desired the
work itself to be a witness to the living God, and a testimony to
believers, by calling attention to the objectionable methods already in
use and encouraging all God''s true servants in adhering to the
principles and practices which He has sanctioned.

On March 5th at a public meeting a formal announcement of the intention
to found such an institution was accompanied by a full statement of its
purposes and principles,* in substance as follows:

3. Pecuniary aid, or help in managing or carrying on its affairs, is not
to be asked for or sought from those who are not believers.

Thus the word of God was accepted as counsellor, and all dependence was
on God''s blessing in answer to prayer.

1. To establish or aid day-schools, Sunday-schools, and adult-schools,
taught and conducted only by believers and on thoroughly scriptural
principles.

3. To aid missionary efforts and assist labourers, in the Lord''s
vineyard anywhere, who are working upon a biblical basis and looking
only to the Lord for support.

To project such a work, on such a scale, and at such a time, was doubly
an act of faith; for not only was the work already in hand enough to tax
all available time and strength, but at this very time this record
appears in Mr. Müller''s journal: "We have only one shilling left."
Surely no advance step would have been taken, had not the eyes been
turned, not on the empty purse, but on the full and exhaustless treasury
of a rich and bountiful Lord!

It was plainly God''s purpose that, out of such abundance of poverty, the
riches of His liberality should be manifested. It pleased Him, from whom
and by whom are all things, that the work should be begun when His
servants were poorest and weakest, that its growth to such giant
proportions might the more prove it to be a plant of His own right
hand''s planting, and that His word might be fulfilled in its whole
history:

"I the Lord do keep it:
        I will water it every moment:
        Lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day:"
            (Isa. xxvii. 3.)

Whatever may be thought as to the need of such a new organization, or as
to such scruples as moved its founders to insist even in minor matters
upon the closest adherence to scripture teaching, this at least is
plain, that for more than half a century it has stood upon its original
foundation, and its increase and usefulness have surpassed the most
enthusiastic dreams of its founders; nor have the principles first
avowed ever been abandoned. With the Living God as its sole patron, and
prayer as its only appeal, it has attained vast proportions, and its
world-wide work has been signally owned and blessed.

On March 19th Mrs. Müller gave birth to a son, to the great joy of his
parents; and, after much prayer, they gave him the name Elijah—"My God
is Jah"—the name itself being one of George Müllers life-mottoes. Up to
this time the families of Mr. Müller and Mr. Craik had dwelt under one
roof, but henceforth it was thought wise that they should have separate
lodgings.

When, at the close of 1834, the usual backward glance was cast over the
Lord''s leadings and dealings, Mr. Müller gratefully recognized the
divine goodness which had thus helped him to start upon its career the
work with its several departments. Looking to the Lord alone for light
and help, he had laid the corner-stone of this "little institution"; and
in October, after only seven months'' existence, it had already begun to
be established. In the Sunday-school there were one hundred and twenty
children; in the adult classes, forty; in the four day-schools, two
hundred and nine boys and girls; four hundred and eighty-two Bibles and
five hundred and twenty Testaments had been put into circulation, and
fifty-seven pounds had been spent in aid of missionary operations.
During these seven months the Lord had sent, in answer to prayer, over
one hundred and sixty-seven pounds in money, and much blessing upon the
work itself. The brothers and sisters who were in charge had likewise
been given by the same prayer-hearing God, in direct response to the cry
of need and the supplication of faith.

Meanwhile another object was coming into greater prominence before the
mind and heart of Mr. Müller: it was the thought of making some
permanent provision for fatherless and motherless children.

An orphan boy who had been in the school had been taken to the
poorhouse, no longer able to attend on account of extreme poverty; and
this little incident set Mr. Müller thinking and praying about orphans.
Could not something be done to meet the temporal and spiritual wants of
this class of very poor children? Unconsciously to himself, God had set
a seed in his soul, and was watching and watering it. The idea of a
definite orphan work had taken root within him, and, like any other
living germ, it was springing up and growing, he knew not how. As yet it
was only in the blade, but in time there would come the ear and the
full-grown corn in the ear, the new seed of a larger harvest.

Meanwhile the church was growing. In these two and a half years over two
hundred had been added, making the total membership two hundred and
fifty-seven; but the enlargement of the work generally neither caused
the church life to be neglected nor any one department of duty to suffer
declension—a very noticeable fact in this history.

The point to which we have now come is one of double interest and
importance, as at once a point of arrival and of departure. The work of
God''s chosen servant may be considered as fairly if not fully
inaugurated in all its main forms of service. He himself is in his
thirtieth year, the age when his divine Master began to be fully
manifest to the world and to go about doing good. Through the
preparatory steps and stages leading up to his complete mission and
ministry to the church and the world, Christ''s humble disciple has
likewise been brought, and his fuller career of usefulness now begins,
with the various agencies in operation whereby for more than threescore
years he was to show both proof and example of what God can do through
one man who is willing to be simply the instrument for Him to work with.
Nothing is more marked in George Müller, to the very day of his death,
than this, that he so looked to God and leaned on God that he felt
himself to be nothing, and God everything. He sought to be always and in
all things surrendered as a passive tool to the will and hand of the
Master Workman.

This point of arrival and of departure is also a point of prospect.
Here, halting and looking backward, we may take in at a glance the
various successive steps and stages of preparation whereby the Lord had
made His servant ready for the sphere of service to which He called, and
for which He fitted him. One has only, from this height, to look over
the ten years that were past, to see beyond dispute or doubt the divine
design that lay back of George Müllers life, and to feel an awe of the
God who thus chooses and shapes, and then uses, His vessels of service.

It will be well, even if it involves some repetition, to pass in review
the more important steps in the process by which the divine Potter had
shaped His vessel for His purpose, educating and preparing George Müller
for His work.

1. First of all, his conversion. In the most unforeseen manner and at
the most unexpected time God led him to turn from the error of his way,
and brought him to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.

2. Next, his missionary spirit. That consuming flame was kindled
within him which, when it is fanned by the Spirit and fed by the fuel of
facts, inclines to unselfish service and makes one willing to go
wherever, and to do whatever, the Lord will.

3. Next, his renunciation of self. In more than one instance he was
enabled to give up for Christ''s sake an earthly attachment that was
idolatrous, because it was a hindrance to his full obedience and
single-eyed loyalty to his heavenly Master.

4. Then his taking counsel of God. Early in his Christian life he
formed the habit, in things great and small, of ascertaining the will of
the Lord before taking action, asking guidance in every matter, through
the Word and the Spirit.

5. His humble and childlike temper. The Father drew His child to
Himself, imparting to him the simple mind that asks believingly and
trusts confidently, and the filial spirit that submits to fatherly
counsel and guidance.

6. His method of preaching. Under this same divine tuition he early
learned how to preach the Word, in simple dependence on the Spirit of
God, studying the Scriptures in the original and expounding them without
wisdom of words.

7. His cutting loose from man. Step by step, all dependence on man or
appeals to man for pecuniary support were abandoned, together with all
borrowing, running into debt, stated salary, etc. His eyes were turned
to God alone as the Provider.

8. His satisfaction in the Word. As knowledge of the Scriptures grew,
love for the divine oracles increased, until all other books, even of a
religious sort, lost their charms in comparison with God''s own
text-book, as explained and illumined by the divine Interpreter.

9. His thorough Bible study. Few young men have ever been led to such
a systematic search into the treasures of God''s truth. He read the Book
of God through and through, fixing its teachings on his mind by
meditation and translating them into practice.

10. His freedom from human control. He felt the need of independence
of man in order to complete dependence on God, and boldly broke all
fetters that hindered his liberty in preaching, in teaching, or in
following the heavenly Guide and serving the heavenly Master.

11. His use of opportunity. He felt the value of souls, and he formed
habits of approaching others as to matters of salvation, even in public
conveyances. By a word of witness, a tract, a humble example, he sought
constantly to lead some one to Christ.

12. His release from civil obligations. This was purely providential.
In a strange way God set him free from all liability to military
service, and left him free to pursue his heavenly calling as His
soldier, without entanglement in the affairs of this life.

13. His companions in service. Two most efficient coworkers were
divinely provided: first his brother Craik so like-minded with himself,
and secondly, his wife, so peculiarly God''s gift, both of them proving
great aids in working and in bearing burdens of responsibility.

14. His view of the Lord''s coming. He thanked God for unveiling to him
that great truth, considered by him as second to no other in its
influence upon his piety and usefulness; and in the light of it he saw
clearly the purpose of this gospel age, to be not to convert the world
but to call out from it a believing church as Christ''s bride.

15. His waiting on God for a message. For every new occasion he asked
of Him a word in season; then a mode of treatment, and unction in
delivery; and, in godly simplicity and sincerity, with the demonstration
of the Spirit, he aimed to reach the hearers.

16. His submission to the authority of the Word. In the light of the
holy oracles he reviewed all customs, however ancient, and all
traditions of men, however popular, submitted all opinions and practices
to the test of Scripture, and then, regardless of consequences, walked
according to any new light God gave him.

17. His pattern of church life. From his first entrance upon pastoral
work, he sought to lead others only by himself following the Shepherd
and Bishop of Souls. He urged the assembly of believers to conform in
all things to New Testament models so far as they could be clearly found
in the Word, and thus reform all existing abuses.

18. His stress upon voluntary offerings. While he courageously gave up
all fixed salary for himself, he taught that all the work of God should
be maintained by the freewill gifts of believers, and that pew-rents
promote invidious distinctions among saints.

19. His surrender of all earthly possessions. Both himself and his
wife literally sold all they had and gave alms, henceforth to live by
the day, hoarding no money even against a time of future need, sickness,
old age, or any other possible crisis of want.

20. His habit of secret prayer. He learned so to prize closet
communion with God that he came to regard it as his highest duty and
privilege. To him nothing could compensate for the lack or loss of that
fellowship with God and meditation on His word which are the support of
all spiritual life.

21. His jealousy of his testimony. In taking oversight of a
congregation he took care to guard himself from all possible
interference with fulness and freedom of utterance and of service. He
could not brook any restraints upon his speech or action that might
compromise his allegiance to the Lord or his fidelity to man.

22. His organizing of work. God led him to project a plan embracing
several departments of holy activity, such as the spreading of the
knowledge of the word of God everywhere, and the encouraging of
world-wide evangelization and the Christian education of the young; and
to guard the new Institution from all dependence on worldly patronage,
methods, or appeals.

23. His sympathy with orphans. His loving heart had been drawn out
toward poverty and misery everywhere, but especially in the case of
destitute children bereft of both parents; and familiarity with
Francke''s work at Halle suggested similar work at Bristol.

24. Beside all these steps of preparation, he had been guided by the
Lord from his birthplace in Prussia to London, Teignmouth, and Bristol
in Britain, and thus the chosen vessel, shaped for its great use, had by
the same divine Hand been borne to the very place where it was to be of
such signal service in testimony to the Living God.

Surely no candid observer can survey this course of divine discipline
and preparation, and remember how brief was the period of time it
covers, being less than ten years, and mark the many distinct steps by
which this education for a life of service was made singularly complete,
without a feeling of wonder and awe. Every prominent feature, afterward
to appear conspicuous in the career of this servant of God, was
anticipated in the training whereby he was fitted for his work and
introduced to it. We have had a vivid vision of the divine Potter
sitting at His wheel, taking the clay in His hands, softening its
hardness, subduing it to His own will; then gradually and skilfully
shaping from it the earthen vessel; then baking it in His oven of
discipline till it attained the requisite solidity and firmness, then
filling it with the rich treasures of His word and Spirit, and finally
setting it down where He would have it serve His special uses in
conveying to others the excellency of His power!

To lose sight of this sovereign shaping Hand is to miss one of the main
lessons God means to teach us by George Müller''s whole career. He
himself saw and felt that he was only an earthen vessel; that God had
both chosen and filled him for the work he was to do; and, while this
conviction made him happy in his work, it made him humble, and the older
he grew the humbler he became. He felt more and more his own utter
insufficiency. It grieved him that human eyes should ever turn away from
the Master to the servant, and he perpetually sought to avert their gaze
from himself to God alone. "For of Him, and through Him, and to Him are
all things—to Whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen."

There are several important episodes in Mr. Müller''s history which may
be lightly passed by, because not so characteristic of him as that they
might not have been common to many others, and therefore not
constituting features so distinguishing this life from others as to make
it a special lesson to believers.

For example, early in 1835 he made a visit to Germany upon a particular
errand. He went to aid Mr. Groves, who had come from the East Indies to
get missionary recruits, and who asked help of him, as of one knowing
the language of the country, in setting the claims of India before
German brethren, and pleading for its unsaved millions.

When Mr. Müller went to the alien office in London to get a passport, he
found that, through ignorance, he had broken the law which required
every alien semi-annually to renew his certificate of residence, under
penalty of fifty pounds fine or imprisonment. He confessed to the
officer his non-compliance, excusing himself only on the ground of
ignorance, and trusted all consequences with God, who graciously
inclined the officer to pass over his non-compliance with the law.
Another hindrance which still interfered with obtaining his passport,
was also removed in answer to prayer; so that at the outset he was much
impressed with the Lord''s sanction of his undertaking.

His sojourn abroad continued for nearly two months, during which time he
was at Paris, Strasburg, Basle, Tubingen, Wurtemberg, Sehaffhausen,
Stuttgart, Halle, Sandersleben, Aschersleben, Heimersleben, Halberstadt,
and Hamburg. At Halle, calling on Dr. Tholuck after seven years of
separation, he was warmly welcomed and constrained to lodge at his
house. From Dr. Tholuck he heard many delightful incidents as to former
fellow students who had been turned to the Lord from impious paths, or
had been strengthened in their Christian faith and devotion. He also
visited Francke''s orphan houses, spending an evening in the very room
where God''s work of grace had begun in his heart, and meeting again
several of the same little company of believers that in those days had
prayed together.

He likewise gave everywhere faithful witness to the Lord. While at his
father''s house the way was opened for him to bear testimony indirectly
to his father and brother. He had found that a direct approach to his
father upon the subject of his soul''s salvation only aroused his anger,
and he therefore judged that it was wiser to refrain from a course which
would only repel one whom he desired to win. An unconverted friend of
his father was visiting him at this time, before whom he put the truth
very frankly and fully, in the presence of both his father and brother,
and thus quite as effectively gave witness to them also. But he was
especially moved to pray that he might by his whole life bear witness at
his home, manifesting his love for his kindred and his own joy in God,
his satisfaction in Christ, and his utter indifference to all former
fascinations of a worldly and sinful life, through the supreme
attraction he found in Him; for this, he felt sure, would have far more
influence than any mere words: our walk counts for more than our talk,
always.

The effect was most happy. God so helped the son to live before the
father that, just before his leaving for England, he said to him: "My
son, may God help me to follow your example, and to act according to
what you have said to me!"

On June 22, 1835, Mr. Müller''s father-in-law, Mr. Groves, died; and both
of his own children were very ill, and four days later little Elijah was
taken. Both parents had been singularly prepared for these bereavements,
and were divinely upheld. They had felt no liberty in prayer for the
child''s recovery, dear as he was; and grandfather and grandson were laid
in one grave. Henceforth Mr. and Mrs. Müller were to have no son, and
Lydia was to remain their one and only child.

About the middle of the following month, Mr. Müller was quite disabled
from work by weakness of the chest, which made necessary rest and
change. The Lord tenderly provided for his need through those whose
hearts He touched, leading them to offer him and his wife hospitalities
in the Isle of Wight, while at the same time money was sent him which
was designated for ''a change of air.'' On his thirtieth birthday, in
connection with specially refreshing communion with God, and for the
first time since his illness, there was given him a spirit of believing
prayer for his own recovery; and his strength so rapidly grew that by
the middle of October he was back in Bristol.

It was just before this, on the ninth of the same month, that the
reading of John Newton''s Life stirred him up to bear a similar witness
to the Lord''s dealings with himself. Truly there are no little things
in our life, since what seems to be trivial may be the means of bringing
about results of great consequence. This is the second time that a
chance reading of a book had proved a turning-point with George Müller.
Franke''s life stirred his heart to begin an orphan work, and Newton''s
life suggested the narrative of the Lord''s dealings. To what is called
an accident are owing, under God, those pages of his life-journal which
read like new chapters in the Acts of the Apostles, and will yet be so
widely read, and so largely used of God.

THE last great step of full entrance upon Mr. Müller''s life-service was
the founding of the orphan work, a step so important and so prominent
that even the lesser particulars leading to it have a strange
significance and fascination.

In the year 1835, on November 20th, in taking tea at the house of a
Christian sister, he again saw a copy of Francke''s life. For no little
time he had thought of like labours, though on no such scale, nor in
mere imitation of Francke, but under a sense of similar divine leading.
This impression had grown into a conviction, and the conviction had
blossomed into a resolution which now rapidly ripened into corresponding
action. He was emboldened to take this forward step in sole reliance on
God, by the fact that at that very time, in answer to prayer, ten pounds
more had been sent him than he had asked for other existing work, as
though God gave him a token of both willingness and readiness to supply
all needs.

Nothing is more worthy of imitation, perhaps, than the uniformly
deliberate, self-searching, and prayerful way in which he set about any
work which he felt led to undertake. It was preeminently so in
attempting this new form of service, the future growth of which was not
then even in his thought. In daily prayer he sought as in his Master''s
presence to sift from the pure grain of a godly purpose to glorify Him,
all the chaff of selfish and carnal motives, to get rid of every taint
of worldly self-seeking or lust of applause, and to bring every thought
into captivity to the Lord. He constantly probed his own heart to
discover the secret and subtle impulses which are unworthy of a true
servant of God; and, believing that a spiritually minded brother often
helps one to an insight into his own heart, he spoke often to his
brother Craik about his plans, praying God to use him as a means of
exposing any unworthy motive, or of suggesting any scriptural objections
to his project. His honest aim being to please God, he yearned to know
his own heart, and welcomed any light which revealed his real self and
prevented a mistake.

Mr. Craik so decidedly encouraged him, and further prayer so confirmed
previous impressions of God''s guidance, that on December 2, 1835, the
first formal step was taken in ordering printed bills announcing a
public meeting for the week following, when the proposal to open an
orphan house was to be laid before brethren, and further light to be
sought unitedly as to the mind of the Lord.

Three days later, in reading the Psalms, he was struck with these nine
words:
        "OPEN THY MOUTH WIDE,
        AND I WILL FILL IT." (Psalm lxxxi. 10.)

From that moment this text formed one of his great life-mottoes, and
this promise became a power in moulding all his work. Hitherto he had
not prayed for the supply of money or of helpers, but he was now led to
apply this scripture confidently to this new plan, and at once boldly to
ask for premises, and for one thousand pounds in money, and for
suitable helpers to take charge of the children. Two days after, he
received, in furtherance of his work, the first gift of money—one
shilling—and within two days more the first donation in furniture—a
large wardrobe.

The day came for the memorable public meeting—December 9th. During the
interval Satan had been busy hurling at Mr. Müller his fiery darts, and
he was very low in spirit. He was taking a step not to be retraced
without both much humiliation to himself and reproach to his Master: and
what if it were a misstep and he were moving without real guidance
from above! But as soon as he began to speak, help was given him. He was
borne up on the Everlasting Arms, and had the assurance that the work
was of the Lord. He cautiously avoided all appeals to the transient
feelings of his hearers, and took no collection, desiring all these
first steps to be calmly taken, and every matter carefully and
prayerfully weighed before a decision. Excitement of emotion or
kindlings of enthusiasm might obscure the vision and hinder clear
apprehension of the mind of God. After the meeting there was a voluntary
gift of ten shillings, and one sister offered herself for the work. The
next morning a statement concerning the new orphan work was put in
print, and on January 16, 1836, a supplementary statement appeared.*

At every critical point Mr. Müller is entitled to explain his own views
and actions; and the work he was now undertaking is so vitally linked
with his whole after-life that it should here have full mention. As to
his proposed orphan house he gives three chief reasons for its
establishment:

1. That God may be glorified in so furnishing the means as to show that
it is not a vain thing to trust in Him.

He had frequent reminders in his pastoral labours that the faith of
God''s children greatly needed strengthening; and he longed to have some
visible proof to point to, that the heavenly Father is the same faithful
Promiser and Provider as ever, and as willing to PROVE Himself the
LIVING GOD to all who put their trust in Him, and that even in their
old age He does not forsake those who rely only upon Him. Remembering
the great blessing that had come to himself through the work of faith of
Francke, he judged that he was bound to serve the Church of Christ in
being able to take God at His word and rely upon it.

If he, a poor man, without asking any one but God, could get means to
carry on an orphan house, it would be seen that God is FAITHFUL STILL
and STILL HEARS PRAYER. While the orphan work was to be a branch of the
Scriptural Knowledge Institution, only those funds were to be applied
thereto which should be expressly given for that purpose; and it would
be carried on only so far and so fast as the Lord should provide both
money and helpers.

It was proposed to receive only such children as had been bereft of both
parents, and to take in such from their seventh to their twelfth year,
though later on younger orphans were admitted; and to bring up the boys
for a trade, and the girls for service, and to give them all a plain
education likely to fit them for their life-work.

So soon as the enterprise was fairly launched, the Lord''s power and will
to provide began at once and increasingly to appear; and, from this
point on, the journal is one long record of man''s faith and supplication
and of God''s faithfulness and interposition. It only remains to note the
new steps in advance which mark the growth of the work, and the new
straits which arise and how they are met, together with such questions
and perplexing crises as from time to time demand and receive a new
divine solution.

A foremost need was that of able and suitable helpers, which only God
could supply. In order fully to carry out his plans, Mr. Müller felt
that he must have men and women like-minded, who would naturally care
for the state of the orphans and of the work. If one Achan could disturb
the whole camp of Israel, and one Ananias or Saphira, the whole church
of Christ, one faithless, prayerless, self-seeking assistant would prove
not a helper but a hinderer both to the work itself and to all
fellow-workers. No step was therefore hastily taken. He had patiently
waited on God hitherto, and he now waited to receive at His hands His
own chosen servants to join in this service and give to it unity of plan
and spirit.

Before he called, the Lord answered. As early as December 10th a brother
and sister had willingly offered themselves, and the spirit that moved
them will appear in the language of their letter:

"We propose ourselves for the service of the intended orphan house, if
you think us qualified for it; also to give up all the furniture, etc.,
which the Lord has given us, for its use; and to do this without
receiving any salary whatever; believing that, if it be the will of the
Lord to employ us, He will supply all our need."

Other similar self-giving followed, proving that God''s people are
willing in the day of His power. He who wrought in His servant to will
and to work, sent helpers to share his burdens, and to this day has met
all similar needs out of His riches in glory. There has never yet been
any lack of competent, cheerful, and devoted helpers, although the work
so rapidly expanded and extended.

The gifts whereby the work was supported need a separate review that
many lessons of interest may find a record. But it should here be noted
that, among the first givers, was a poor needlewoman who brought the
surprising sum of one hundred pounds, the singular self-denial and
whole-hearted giving exhibited making this a peculiarly sacred offering
and a token of God''s favour. There was a felt significance in His choice
of a poor sickly seamstress as His instrument for laying the foundations
for this great work. He who worketh all things after the counsel of His
own will, passing by the rich, mighty, and noble somethings of this
world, chose again the poor, weak, base, despised nothings, that no
flesh should glory in His presence.

For work among orphans a house was needful, and for this definite prayer
was offered; and April 1, 1836, was fixed as the date for opening such
house for female orphans, as the most helplessly destitute. The
building, No. 6 Wilson Street, where Mr. Müller had himself lived up to
March 25th, having been rented for one year, was formally opened April
21st, the day being set apart for prayer and praise. The public
generally were informed that the way was open to receive needy
applicants, and the intimation was further made on May 18th that it was
intended shortly to open a second house for infant children—both boys
and girls.

We now retrace our steps a little to take special notice of a fact in
Mr. Müller''s experience which, in point of time, belongs earlier.

Though he had brought before the Lord even the most minute details about
his plans for the proposed orphan work and house and helpers, asking in
faith for building and furnishing, money for rent and other expenses,
etc., he confesses that he had never once asked the Lord to send the
orphans! This seems an unaccountable omission; but the fact is he had
assumed that there would be applications in abundance. His surprise and
chagrin cannot easily be imagined, when the appointed time came for
receiving applications, February 3rd, and not one application was
made! Everything was ready except the orphans. This led to the
deepest humiliation before God. All the evening of that day he literally
lay on his face, probing his own heart to read his own motives, and
praying God to search him and show him His mind. He was thus brought so
low that from his heart he could say that, if God would thereby be more
glorified, he would rejoice in the fact that his whole scheme should
come to nothing. The very next day the first application was made for
admission; on April 11th orphans began to be admitted; and by May 18th
there were in the house twenty-six, and more daily expected. Several
applications being made for children under seven, the conclusion was
reached that, while vacancies were left, the limit of years at first
fixed should not be adhered to; but every new step was taken with care
and prayer, that it should not be in the energy of the flesh, or in the
wisdom of man, but in the power and wisdom of the Spirit. How often we
forget that solemn warning of the Holy Ghost, that even when our whole
work is not imperilled by a false beginning, but is well laid upon a
true foundation, we may carelessly build into it wood, hay, and stubble,
which will be burned up in the fiery ordeal that is to try every man''s
work of what sort it is!

The first house had scarcely been opened for girls when the way for the
second was made plain, suitable premises being obtained at No. 1 in the
same street, and a well-fitted matron being given in answer to prayer.
On November 28th, some seven months after the opening of the first, this
second house was opened. Some of the older and abler girls from the
first house were used for the domestic work of the second, partly to
save hired help, and partly to accustom them to working for others and
thus give a proper dignity to what is sometimes despised as a degrading
and menial form of service. By April 8, 1837, there were in each house
thirty orphan children.

The founder of this orphan work, who had at the first asked for one
thousand pounds of God, tells us that, in his own mind, the thing was
as good as done, so that he often gave thanks for this large sum as
though already in hand. (Mark xi. 24; 1 John v. 13, 14.) This habit of
counting a promise as fulfilled had much to do with the triumphs of his
faith and the success of his labour. Now that the first part of his
Narrative of the Lord''s Dealings was about to issue from the press, he
felt that it would much honour the Master whom he served if the entire
amount should be actually in hand before the Narrative should appear,
and without any one having been asked to contribute. He therefore gave
himself anew to prayer; and on June 15th the whole sum was complete, no
appeal having been made but to the Living God, before whom, as he
records with his usual mathematical precision, he had daily brought his
petition for eighteen months and ten days.

In closing this portion of his narrative he hints at a proposed further
enlargement of the work in a third house for orphan boys above seven
years, with accommodations for about forty. Difficulties interposed, but
as usual disappeared before the power of prayer. Meanwhile the whole
work of the Scriptural Knowledge Institution prospered, four day-schools
having been established, with over one thousand pupils, and more than
four thousand copies of the word of God having been distributed.

George Müller was careful always to consult and then to obey conviction.
Hence his moral sense, by healthy exercise, more and more clearly
discerned good and evil. This conscientiousness was seen in the issue of
the first edition of his Narrative. When the first five hundred copies
came from the publishers, he was so weighed down by misgivings that he
hesitated to distribute them. Notwithstanding the spirit of prayer with
which he had begun, continued, and ended the writing of it and had made
every correction in the proof; notwithstanding the motive, consciously
cherished throughout, that God''s glory might be promoted in this record
of His faithfulness, he reopened with himself the whole question whether
this published Narrative might not turn the eyes of men from the great
Master Workman to His human instrument. As he opened the box containing
the reports, he felt strongly tempted to withhold from circulation the
pamphlets it held; but from the moment when he gave out the first copy,
and the step could not be retraced, his scruples were silenced.

He afterward saw his doubts and misgivings to have been a temptation of
Satan, and never thenceforth questioned that in writing, printing, and
distributing this and the subsequent parts of the Narrative he had done
the will of God. So broad and clear was the divine seal set upon it in
the large blessing it brought to many and widely scattered persons that
no room was left for doubt. It may be questioned whether any like
journal has been as widely read and as remarkably used, both in
converting sinners and in quickening saints. Proofs of this will
hereafter abundantly appear.

It was in the year 1837 that Mr. Müller, then in his thirty-second year,
felt with increasingly deep conviction that to his own growth in grace,
godliness, and power for service two things were quite indispensable:
first, more retirement for secret communion with God, even at the
apparent expense of his public work; and second, ampler provision for
the spiritual oversight of the flock of God, the total number of
communicants now being near to four hundred.

The former of these convictions has an emphasis which touches every
believer''s life at its vital centre. George Müller was conscious of
being too busy to pray as he ought. His outward action was too constant
for inward reflection, and he saw that there was risk of losing peace
and power, and that activity even in the most sacred sphere must not be
so absorbing as to prevent holy meditation on the Word and fervent
supplication. The Lord said first to Elijah, "Go, HIDE THYSELF"; then,
"Go, SHOW THYSELF." He who does not first hide himself in the secret
place to be alone with God, is unfit to show himself in the public place
to move among men. Mr. Müller afterward used to say to brethren who had
"too much to do" to spend proper time with God, that four hours of work
for which one hour of prayer prepares, is better than five hours of work
with the praying left out; that our service to our Master is more
acceptable and our mission to man more profitable, when saturated with
the moisture of God''s blessing—the dew of the Spirit. Whatever is
gained in quantity is lost in quality whenever one engagement follows
another without leaving proper intervals for refreshment and renewal of
strength by waiting on God. No man, perhaps, since John Wesley has
accomplished so much even in a long life as George Müller; yet few have
ever withdrawn so often or so long into the pavilion of prayer. In fact,
from one point of view his life seems more given to supplication and
intercession than to mere action or occupation among men.

At the same time he felt that the curacy of souls must not be neglected
by reason of his absorption in either work or prayer. Both believers and
inquirers needed pastoral oversight; neither himself nor his brother
Craik had time enough for visiting so large a flock, many of whom were
scattered over the city; and about fifty new members were added every
year who had special need of teaching and care. Again, as there were two
separate congregations, the number of meetings was almost doubled; and
the interruptions of visitors from near and far, the burdens of
correspondence, and the oversight of the Lord''s work generally, consumed
so much time that even with two pastors the needs of the church could
not be met. At a meeting of both congregations in October, these matters
were frankly brought before the believers, and it was made plain that
other helpers should be provided, and the two churches so united as to
lessen the number of separate meetings.

In October, 1837, a building was secured for a third orphan house, for
boys; but as the neighbours strongly opposed its use as a charitable
institution, Mr Müller, with meekness of spirit, at once relinquished
all claim upon the premises, being mindful of the maxim of Scripture:
"As much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men." (Rom. xiii. 18.)
He felt sure that the Lord would provide, and his faith was rewarded in
the speedy supply of a building in the same street where the other two
houses were.

Infirmity of the flesh again tried the faith and patience of Mr. Müller.
For eight weeks he was kept out of the pulpit. The strange weakness in
the head, from which he had suffered before and which at times seemed to
threaten his reason, forced him to rest; and in November he went to Bath
and Weston-super-Mare, leaving to higher Hands the work to which he was
unequal.

One thing he noticed and recorded: that, even during this head trouble,
prayer and Bible-reading could be borne better than anything else. He
concluded that whenever undue carefulness is expended on the body, it is
very hard to avoid undue carelessness as to the soul; and that it is
therefore much safer comparatively to disregard the body, that one may
give himself wholly to the culture of his spiritual health and the care
of the Lord''s work. Though some may think that in this he ran to a
fanatical extreme, there is no doubt that such became more and more a
law of his life. He sought to dismiss all anxiety, as a duty; and, among
other anxious cares, that most subtle and seductive form of solicitude
which watches every change of symptoms and rushes after some new medical
man or medical remedy for all ailments real or fancied.

Mr. Müller was never actually reckless of his bodily health. His habits
were temperate and wholesome, but no man could be so completely wrapped
up in his Master''s will and work without being correspondingly forgetful
of his physical frame. There are not a few, even among God''s saints,
whose bodily weaknesses and distresses so engross them that their sole
business seems to be to nurse the body, keep it alive and promote its
comfort. As Dr. Watts would have said, this is living "at a poor dying
rate."

When the year 1838 opened, the weakness and distress in the head still
afflicted Mr. Müller. The symptoms were as bad as ever, and it
particularly tried him that they were attended by a tendency to
irritability of temper, and even by a sort of satanic feeling wholly
foreign to him at other times. He was often reminded that he was by
nature a child of wrath even as others, and that, as a child of God, he
could stand against the wiles of the devil only by putting on the whole
armour of God. The pavilion of God is the saint''s place of rest; the
panoply of God is his coat of mail. Grace does not at once remove or
overcome all tendencies to evil, but, if not eradicated, they are
counteracted by the Spirit''s wondrous working. Peter found that so
long as his eye was on His Master he could walk on the water. There is
always a tendency to sink, and a holy walk with God, that defies the
tendency downward, is a divine art that can neither be learned nor
practised except so long as we keep ''looking unto Jesus'': that look of
faith counteracts the natural tendency to sink, so long as it holds the
soul closely to Him. This man of God felt his risk, and, sore as this
trial was to him, he prayed not so much for its removal as that he might
be kept from any open dishonour to the name of the Lord, beseeching God
that he might rather die than ever bring on Him reproach.

Mr. Müller''s journal is not only a record of his outer life of
consecrated labour and its expansion, but it is a mirror of his inner
life and its growth. It is an encouragement to all other saints to find
that this growth was, like their own, in spite of many and formidable
hindrances, over which only grace could triumph. Side by side with
glimpses of habitual conscientiousness and joy in God, we have
revelations of times of coldness and despondency. It is a wholesome
lesson in holy living that we find this man setting himself to the
deliberate task of cultivating obedience and gratitude; by the culture
of obedience growing in knowledge and strength, and by the culture of
gratitude growing in thankfulness and love. Weakness and coldness are
not hopeless states: they have their divine remedies which strengthen
and warm the whole being.

Three entries, found side by side in his journal, furnish pertinent
illustration and most wholesome instruction on this point. One entry
records his deep thankfulness to God for the privilege of being
permitted to be His instrument in providing for homeless orphans, as he
watches the little girls, clad in clean warm garments, pass his window
on their way to the chapel on the Lord''s day morning. A second entry
records his determination, with God''s help, to send no more letters in
parcels because he sees it to be a violation of the postal laws of the
land, and because he desires, as a disciple of the Lord Jesus, to submit
himself to all human laws so far as such submission does not conflict
with loyalty to God. A third entry immediately follows which reveals
this same man struggling against those innate tendencies to evil which
compel a continual resort to the throne of grace with its sympathizing
High Priest. "This morning," he writes, "I greatly dishonoured the Lord
by irritability manifested towards my dear wife; and that, almost
immediately after I had been on my knees before God, praising Him for
having given me such a wife."

These three entries, put together, convey a lesson which is not learned
from either of them alone. Here is gratitude for divine mercy,
conscientious resolve at once to stop a doubtful practice, and a
confession of inconsistency in his home life. All of these are typical
experiences and suggest to us means of gracious growth. He who lets no
mercy of God escape thankful recognition, who never hesitates at once to
abandon an evil or questionable practice, and who, instead of
extenuating a sin because it is comparatively small, promptly confesses
and forsakes it,—such a man will surely grow in Christlikeness.

We must exercise our spiritual senses if we are to discern things
spiritual. There is a clear vision for God''s goodness, and there is a
dull eye that sees little to be thankful for; there is a tender
conscience, and there is a moral sense that grows less and less
sensitive to evil; there is an obedience to the Spirit''s rebuke which
leads to immediate confession and increases strength for every new
conflict. Mr. Müller cultivated habits of life which made his whole
nature more and more open to divine impression, and so his sense of God
became more and more keen and constant.

One great result of this spiritual culture was a growing absorption in
God and jealousy for His glory. As he saw divine things more clearly and
felt their supreme importance, he became engrossed in the magnifying of
them before men; and this is glorifying God. We cannot make God
essentially any more glorious, for He is infinitely perfect; but we can
help men to see what a glorious God He is, and thus come into that holy
partnership with the Spirit of God whose office it is to take of the
things of Christ and show them unto men, and so glorify Christ. Such
fellowship in glorifying God Mr. Müller set before him: and in the light
of such sanctified aspiration we may read that humble entry in which,
reviewing the year 1837 with all its weight of increasing
responsibility, he lifts his heart to his divine Lord and Master in
these simple words:

"Lord, Thy servant is a poor man; but he has trusted in Thee and made
his boast in Thee before the sons of men; therefore let him not be
confounded! Let it not be said, ''All this is enthusiasm, and therefore
it is come to naught.''"

One is reminded of Moses in his intercession for Israel, of Elijah in
his exceeding jealousy for the Lord of hosts, and of that prayer of
Jeremiah that so amazes us by its boldness:

Looking back over the growth of the work at the end of the year 1837, he
puts on record the following facts and figures:

Three orphan houses were now open with eighty-one children, and nine
helpers in charge of them. In the Sunday-schools there were three
hundred and twenty, and in the day-schools three hundred and fifty; and
the Lord had furnished over three hundred and seven pounds for temporal
supplies.

From this same point of view it may be well to glance back over the five
years of labour in Bristol up to July, 1837. Between himself and his
brother Craik uninterrupted harmony had existed from the beginning. They
had been perfectly at one in their views of the truth, in their witness
to the truth, and in their judgment as to all matters affecting the
believers over whom the Holy Ghost had made them overseers. The children
of God had been kept from heresy and schism under their joint pastoral
care; and all these blessings Mr. Müller and his true yoke-fellow humbly
traced to the mercy and grace of the great Shepherd and Bishop of souls.
Thus far over one hundred and seventy had been converted and admitted to
fellowship, making the total number of communicants three hundred and
seventy, nearly equally divided between Bethesda and Gideon. The whole
history of these years is lit up with the sunlight of God''s smile and
blessing.

HABIT both shows and makes the man, for it is at once historic and
prophetic, the mirror of the man as he is and the mould of the man as he
is to be. At this point, therefore, special attention may properly be
given to the two marked habits which had principally to do with the man
we are studying.

Early in the year 1838, he began reading that third biography which,
with those of Francke and John Newton, had such a singular influence on
his own life—Philip''s Life of George Whitefield. The life-story of the
orphan''s friend had given the primary impulse to his work; the
life-story of the converted blasphemer had suggested his narrative of
the Lord''s dealings; and now the life-story of the great evangelist was
blessed of God to shape his general character and give new power to his
preaching and his wider ministry to souls. These three biographies
together probably affected the whole inward and outward life of George
Müller more than any other volumes but the Book of God, and they were
wisely fitted of God to co-work toward such a blessed result. The
example of Francke incited to faith in prayer and to a work whose sole
dependence was on God. Newton''s witness to grace led to a testimony to
the same sovereign love and mercy as seen in his own case. Whitefield''s
experience inspired to greater fidelity and earnestness in preaching the
Word, and to greater confidence in the power of the anointing Spirit.

Particularly was this impression deeply made on Mr. Müller''s mind and
heart: that Whitefield''s unparalleled success in evangelistic labours
was plainly traceable to two causes and could not be separated from them
as direct effects; namely, his unusual prayerfulness, and his habit of
reading the Bible on his knees.

The great evangelist of the last century had learned that first lesson
in service, his own utter nothingness and helplessness: that he was
nothing, and could do nothing, without God. He could neither understand
the Word for himself, nor translate it into his own life, nor apply it
to others with power, unless the Holy Spirit became to him both
insight and unction. Hence his success; he was filled with the
Spirit: and this alone accounts both for the quality and the quantity of
his labours. He died in 1770, in the fifty-sixth year of his age, having
preached his first sermon in Gloucester in 1736. During this thirty-four
years his labours had been both unceasing and untiring. While on his
journeyings in America, he preached one hundred and seventy-five times
in seventy-five days, besides travelling, in the slow vehicles of those
days, upwards of eight hundred miles. When health declined, and he was
put on ''short allowance,'' even that was one sermon each week-day and
three on Sunday. There was about his preaching, moreover, a nameless
charm which held thirty thousand hearers half-breathless on Boston
Common and made tears pour down the sooty faces of the colliers at
Kingswood.

The passion of George Müller''s soul was to know fully the secrets of
prevailing with God and with man. George Whitefield''s life drove home
the truth that God alone could create in him a holy earnestness to win
souls and qualify him for such divine work by imparting a compassion for
the lost that should become an absorbing passion for their salvation.
And—let this be carefully marked as another secret of this life of
service—he now began himself to read the word of God upon his knees,
and often found for hours great blessing in such meditation and prayer
over a single psalm or chapter.

Here we stop and ask what profit there can be in thus prayerfully
reading and searching the Scriptures in the very attitude of prayer.
Having tried it for ourselves, we may add our humble witness to its
value.

First of all, this habit is a constant reminder and recognition of the
need of spiritual teaching in order to the understanding of the holy
Oracles. No reader of God''s word can thus bow before God and His open
book, without a feeling of new reverence for the Scriptures, and
dependence on their Author for insight into their mysteries. The
attitude of worship naturally suggests sober-mindedness and deep
seriousness, and banishes frivolity. To treat that Book with lightness
or irreverence would be doubly profane when one is in the posture of
prayer.

Again, such a habit naturally leads to self-searching and comparison of
the actual life with the example and pattern shown in the Word. The
precept compels the practice to be seen in the light of its teaching;
the command challenges the conduct to appear for examination. The
prayer, whether spoken or unspoken, will inevitably be:

"Search me, O God, and know my heart,
        Try me, and know my thoughts;
        And see if there be any wicked way in me,
        And lead me in the way everlasting!"
            (Psalm cxxxix. 23, 24.)

The words thus reverently read will be translated into the life and
mould the character into the image of God. "Beholding as in a glass the
glory of the Lord, we are changed into the same image from glory to
glory, even as by the Lord the Spirit."*

But perhaps the greatest advantage will be that the Holy Scriptures will
thus suggest the very words which become the dialect of prayer. "We know
not what we should pray for as we ought"—neither what nor how to pray.
But here is the Spirit''s own inspired utterance, and, if the praying be
moulded on the model of His teaching, how can we go astray? Here is our
God-given liturgy and litany—a divine prayer-book. We have here God''s
promises, precepts, warnings, and counsels, not to speak of all the
Spirit-inspired literal prayers therein contained; and, as we reflect
upon these, our prayers take their cast in this matrix. We turn precept
and promise, warning and counsel into supplication, with the assurance
that we cannot be asking anything that is not according to His will,*
for are we not turning His own word into prayer?

So Mr. Müller found it to be. In meditating over Hebrews xiii. 8: "Jesus
Christ the same yesterday and to-day and for ever," translating it into
prayer, he besought God, with the confidence that the prayer was already
granted, that, as Jesus had already in His love and power supplied all
that was needful, in the same unchangeable love and power He would so
continue to provide. And so a promise was not only turned into a prayer,
but into a prophecy—an assurance of blessing—and a river of joy at
once poured into and flowed through his soul.

The prayer habit, on the knees, with the Word open before the disciple,
has thus an advantage which it is difficult to put into words: It
provides a sacred channel of approach to God. The inspired Scriptures
form the vehicle of the Spirit in communicating to us the knowledge of
the will of God. If we think of God on the one side and man on the
other, the word of God is the mode of conveyance from God to man, of His
own mind and heart. It therefore becomes a channel of God''s approach to
us, a channel prepared by the Spirit for the purpose, and unspeakably
sacred as such. When therefore the believer uses the word of God as the
guide to determine both the spirit and the dialect of his prayer, he is
inverting the process of divine revelation and using the channel of
God''s approach to him as the channel of his approach to God. How can
such use of God''s word fail to help and strengthen spiritual life? What
medium or channel of approach could so insure in the praying soul both
an acceptable frame and language taught of the Holy Spirit? If the first
thing is not to pray but to hearken, this surely is hearkening for God
to speak to us that we may know how to speak to Him.

It was habits of life such as these, and not impulsive feelings and
transient frames, that made this man of God what he was and strengthened
him to lift up his hands in God''s name, and follow hard after Him and in
Him rejoice.* Even his sore affliction, seen in the light of such
prayer—prayer itself illuminated by the word of God—became radiant;
and his soul was brought into that state where he so delighted in the
will of God as to be able from his heart to say that he would not have
his disease removed until through it God had wrought the blessing it was
meant to convey. And when his acquiescence in the will of God had become
thus complete he instinctively felt that he would speedily be restored
to health.

Subsequently, in reading Proverbs iii. 5-12, he was struck with the
words, "Neither be weary of His correction." He felt that, though he
had not been permitted to "despise the chastening of the Lord," he had
at times been somewhat "weary of His correction," and he lifted up the
prayer that he might so patiently bear it as neither to faint nor be
weary under it, till its full purpose was wrought.

Frequent were the instances of the habit of translating promises into
prayers, immediately applying the truth thus unveiled to him. For
example, after prolonged meditation over the first verse of Psalm lxv,
"O Thou that hearest prayer," he at once asked and recorded certain
definite petitions. This writing down specific requests for permanent
reference has a blessed influence upon the prayer habit. It assures
practical and exact form for our supplications, impresses the mind and
memory with what is thus asked of God, and leads naturally to the record
of the answers when given, so that we accumulate evidences in our own
experience that God is to us personally a prayer-hearing God, whereby
unbelief is rebuked and importunity encouraged.

On this occasion eight specific requests are put on record, together
with the solemn conviction that, having asked in conformity with the
word and will of God, and in the name of Jesus, he has confidence in Him
that He heareth and that he has the petitions thus asked of Him.* He
writes:

"I believe He has heard me. I believe He will make it manifest in
His own good time that He has heard me; and I have recorded these my
petitions this fourteenth day of January, 1838, that when God has
answered them He may get, through this, glory to His name."

The thoughtful reader must see in all this a man of weak faith, feeding
and nourishing his trust in God that his faith may grow strong. He uses
the promise of a prayer-hearing God as a staff to stay his conscious
feebleness, that he may lean hard upon the strong Word which cannot
fail. He records the day when he thus takes this staff in hand, and the
very petitions which are the burdens which he seeks to lay on God, so
that his act of committal may be the more complete and final. Could God
ever dishonour such trust?

It was in this devout reading on his knees that his whole soul was first
deeply moved by that phrase,

He saw this to be one of those "names" of Jehovah which He reveals to
His people to lead them to trust in Him, as it is written in Psalm ix.
10:

These five words from the sixty-eighth psalm became another of his
life-texts, one of the foundation stones of all his work for the
fatherless. These are his own words:

"By the help of God, this shall be my argument before Him, respecting
the orphans, in the hour of need. He is their Father, and therefore has
pledged Himself, as it were, to provide for them; and I have only to
remind Him of the need of these poor children in order to have it
supplied."

This is translating the promises of God''s word, not only into praying,
but into living, doing, serving. Blessed was the hour when Mr. Müller
learned that one of God''s chosen names is "the Father of the
fatherless"!

To sustain such burdens would have been quite impossible but for faith
in such a God. In reply to oft-repeated remarks of visitors and
observers who could not understand the secret of his peace, or how any
man who had so many children to clothe and feed could carry such
prostrating loads of care, he had one uniform reply: "By the grace of
God, this is no cause of anxiety to me. These children I have years ago
cast upon the Lord. The whole work is His, and it becomes me to be
without carefulness. In whatever points I am lacking, in this point I am
able by the grace of God to roll the burden upon my heavenly Father."*

In tens of thousands of cases this peculiar title of God, chosen by
Himself and by Himself declared, became to Mr. Müller a peculiar
revelation of God, suited to his special need. The natural inferences
drawn from such a title became powerful arguments in prayer, and rebukes
to all unbelief. Thus, at the outset of his work for the orphans, the
word of God put beneath his feet a rock basis of confidence that he
could trust the almighty Father to support the work. And, as the
solicitudes of the work came more and more heavily upon him, he cast the
loads he could not carry upon Him who, before George Müller was born,
was the Father of the fatherless.

About this time we meet other signs of the conflict going on in Mr.
Müllers own soul. He could not shut his eyes to the lack of earnestness
in prayer and fervency of spirit which at times seemed to rob him of
both peace and power. And we notice his experience, in common with so
many saints, of the paradox of spiritual life. He saw that "such
fervency of spirit is altogether the gift of God," and yet he adds, "I
have to ascribe to myself the loss of it." He did not run divine
sovereignty into blank fatalism as so many do. He saw that God must be
sovereign in His gifts, and yet man must be free in his reception and
rejection of them. He admitted the mystery without attempting to
reconcile the apparent contradiction. He confesses also that the same
book, Philip''s Life of Whitefield, which had been used of God to kindle
such new fires on the altar of his heart, had been also used of Satan to
tempt him to neglect for its sake the systematic study of the greatest
of books.

Thus, at every step, George Müllers life is full of both encouragement
and admonition to fellow disciples. While away from Bristol he wrote in
February, 1838, a tender letter to the saints there, which is another
revelation of the man''s heart. He makes grateful mention of the mercies
of God, to him, particularly His gentleness, long-suffering, and
faithfulness and the lessons taught him through affliction. The letter
makes plain that much sweetness is mixed in the cup of suffering, and
that our privileges are not properly prized until for a time we are
deprived of them. He particularly mentions how secret prayer, even
when reading, conversation, or prayer with others was a burden, always
brought relief to his head. Converse with the Father was an
indispensable source of refreshment and blessing at all times. As J.
Hudson Taylor says "Satan, the Hinderer, may build a barrier about us,
but he can never roof us in, so that we cannot look up." Mr. Müller
also gives a valuable hint that has already been of value to many
afflicted saints, that he found he could help by prayer to fight the
battles of the Lord even when he could not by preaching. After a short
visit to Germany, partly in quest of health and partly for missionary
objects, and after more than twenty-two weeks of retirement from
ordinary public duties, his head was much better, but his mental health
allowed only about three hours of daily work. While in Germany he had
again seen his father and elder brother, and spoken with them about
their salvation. To his father his words brought apparent blessing, for
he seemed at least to feel his lack of the one thing needful. The
separation from him was the more painful as there was so little hope
that they should meet again on earth.

In May he once more took part in public services in Bristol, a period of
six months having elapsed since he had previously done so. His head was
still weak, but there seemed no loss of mental power.

About three months after he had been in Germany part of the fruits of
his visit were gathered, for twelve brothers and three sisters sailed
for the East Indies.

On June 13, 1838, Mrs. Müller gave birth to a stillborn babe,—another
parental disappointment,—and for more than a fortnight her life hung in
the balance. But once more prayer prevailed for her and her days were
prolonged.

One month later another trial of faith confronted them in the orphan
work. A twelvemonth previous there were in hand seven hundred and eighty
pounds; now that sum was reduced to one thirty-ninth of the
amount—twenty pounds. Mr. and Mrs. Müller, with Mr. Craik and one other
brother, connected with the Boys'' Orphan House, were the only four
persons who were permitted to know of the low state of funds; and they
gave themselves to united prayer. And let it be carefully observed that
Mr. Müller testifies that his own faith was kept even stronger than when
the larger sum was on hand a year before; and this faith was no mere
fancy, for, although the supply was so low and shortly thirty pounds
would be needed, notice was given for seven more children to enter, and
it was further proposed to announce readiness to receive five others!

The trial-hour had come, but was not past. Less than two months later
the money-supply ran so low that it was needful that the Lord should
give by the day and almost by the hour if the needs were to be met. In
answer to prayer for help God seemed to say, "Mine hour is not yet
come." Many pounds would shortly be required, toward which there was not
one penny in hand. When, one day, over four pounds came in, the thought
occurred to Mr. Müller, "Why not lay aside three pounds against the
coming need?" But immediately he remembered that it is written:
"SUFFICIENT UNTO THE DAY is THE EVIL THEREOF."* He unhesitatingly cast
himself upon God, and paid out the whole amount for salaries then due,
leaving himself again penniless.

At this time Mr. Craik was led to read a sermon on Abraham, from Genesis
xii, making prominent two facts: first, that so long as he acted in
faith and walked in the will of God, all went on well; but that,
secondly, so far as he distrusted the Lord and disobeyed Him, all ended
in failure. Mr. Müller heard this sermon and conscientiously applied it
to himself. He drew two most practical conclusions which he had abundant
opportunity to put into practice:

And, secondly, that in proportion as he had been permitted to honour God
and bring some glory to His name by trusting Him, he was in danger of
dishonouring Him.

Having taught him these blessed truths, the Lord tested him as to how
far he would venture upon them. While in such sore need of money for the
orphan work, he had in the bank some two hundred and twenty pounds,
intrusted to him for other purposes. He might use this money for the
time at least, and so relieve the present distress. The temptation was
the stronger so to do, because he knew the donors and knew them to be
liberal supporters of the orphans; and he had only to explain to them
the straits he was in and they would gladly consent to any appropriation
of their gift that he might see best! Most men would have cut that
Gordian knot of perplexity without hesitation.

Not so George Müller. He saw at once that this would be finding a way
of his own out of difficulty, instead of waiting on the Lord for
deliverance. Moreover, he also saw that it would be forming a habit of
trusting to such expedients of his own, which in other trials would lead
to a similar course and so hinder the growth of faith. We use italics
here because here is revealed one of the tests by which this man of
faith, was proven; and we see how he kept consistently and persistently
to the one great purpose of his life—to demonstrate to all men that to
rest solely on I the promise of a faithful God is the only way to know
for one''s self and prove to others, His faithfulness.

At this time of need—the type of many others—this man who had
determined to risk everything upon God''s word of promise, turned from
doubtful devices and questionable methods of relief to pleading with
God. And it may be well to mark his manner of pleading. He used
argument in prayer, and at this time he piles up eleven reasons why
God should and would send help.

This method of holy argument—ordering our cause before God, as an
advocate would plead before a judge—is not only almost a lost art, but
to many it actually seems almost puerile. And yet it is abundantly
taught and exemplified in Scripture. Abraham in his plea for Sodom is
the first great example of it. Moses excelled in this art, in many
crises interceding in behalf of the people with consummate skill,
marshalling arguments as a general-in-chief marshals battalions. Elijah
on Carmel is a striking example of power in this special pleading. What
holy zeal and jealousy for God! It is probable that if we had fuller
records we should find that all pleaders with God, like Noah, Job,
Samuel, David, Daniel, Jeremiah, Paul, and James, have used the same
method.

Of course God does not need to be convinced: no arguments can make any
plainer to Him the claims of trusting souls to His intervention, claims
based upon His own word, confirmed by His oath. And yet He will be
inquired of and argued with. That is His way of blessing. He loves to
have us set before Him our cause and His own promises: He delights in
the well-ordered plea, where argument is piled upon argument. See how
the Lord Jesus Christ commended the persistent argument of the woman of
Canaan, who with the wit of importunity actually turned his own
objection into a reason. He said, "It is not meet to take the
children''s bread and cast it to the little dogs."* "Truth, Lord," she
answered, "yet the little dogs under the master''s tables eat of the
crumbs which fall from the children''s mouths!" What a triumph of
argument! Catching the Master Himself in His words, as He meant she
should, and turning His apparent reason for not granting into a reason
for granting her request! "O woman," said He, "great is thy faith! Be it
unto thee even as thou wilt"—thus, as Luther said, "flinging the reins
on her neck."

This case stands unique in the word of God, and it is this use of
argument in prayer that makes it thus solitary in grandeur. But one
other case is at all parallel,—that of the centurion of Capernaum,*
who, when our Lord promised to go and heal his servant, argued that such
coming was not needful, since He had only to speak the healing word. And
notice the basis of his argument: if he, a commander exercising
authority and yielding himself to higher authority, both obeyed the word
of his superior and exacted obedience of his subordinate, how much more
could the Great Healer, in his absence, by a word of command, wield the
healing Power that in His presence was obedient to His will! Of him
likewise our Lord said: "I have not found so great faith, no, not in
Israel!"

We are to argue our case with God, not indeed to convince Him, but to
convince ourselves. In proving to Him that, by His own word and oath
and character, He has bound Himself to interpose, we demonstrate to our
own faith that He has given us the right to ask and claim, and that He
will answer our plea because He cannot deny Himself.

There are two singularly beautiful touches of the Holy Spirit in which
the right thus to order argument before God is set forth to the
reflective reader. In Micah. vii. 20 we read:

"Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob,
        The mercy to Abraham,
        Which thou hast sworn unto our fathers,
        From the days of old."

Mark the progress of the thought. What was mercy to Abraham was truth to
Jacob. God was under no obligation to extend covenant blessings; hence
it was to Abraham a simple act of pure mercy; but, having so put
Himself under voluntary bonds, Jacob could claim as truth what to
Abraham had been mercy. So in 1 John i. ' WHERE id = 'eb428426-4daa-4d37-9423-55ef0a84d874';
