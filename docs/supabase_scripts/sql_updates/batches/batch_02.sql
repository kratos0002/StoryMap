UPDATE stories SET original_text = 'One hot June afternoon, a group of ponies with
their foals and yearlings stood on the edge of a
tableland or âplainâ in the New Forest. The
ground about them was covered with stunted
heather and fern, with here and there patches of
moss and bare white gravel showing the poverty
of the soil.

Beyond the company was a great expanse of
blue sky flecked with pinkish cloudlets, and, on
the horizon, blue and violet wooded heights, a
crinkly contour denoting oak and beech and an
evenly serrated line, plantations of firs. As
everyone who has journeyed from Southampton
to Bournemouth by road or rail knows, a great
part of the forest is open heath or moorland; but,
unlike the barren wilds of the Highlands, the New
Forest has also extensive woods full of gigantic
oaks and beeches, while the open ground in
many places is becoming choked with self-sown
firs.

Therefore, looking into the distance, the masses
of woodland largely concealed the open spaces.
Emery Down showed on the horizon, the sun fell
on the spire of Lyndhurst Church, and in the
middle distance a white curving ribbon showed
itself as a forest road, before it was lost among the
trees.

Below the ponies was a wide valley, covered
with coarse grass, and dotted with hollies, gorse
and stunted firs. The mares had chosen the
hill for their afternoon siesta because up there
were fewer flies and biting torments than down
below in the swampy bottoms, where, earlier in
the day, the ponies had been feeding. They stood
mostly in pairs, head to tail, so that the swish of
the latter drove the flies from their noses and
flanks. Once in a while, a yearlingâthat is, one
born the previous yearâfinding the sun too hot,
butted in between the mares.

The foals or âsuckersâ lay half-hidden in the
heather, wandered here and there nibbling at the
herbage, or drew nourishment from their mothers.
These varied greatly in colour and size. The
tallest was a black mare with the graceful lines of
the racehorse, as well there might be, seeing she
had some of the blood of that breed in her veins.
Next her stood an old white mare, bleached with
age, for, while the forest ponies exhibit the usual
equine diversity of hues, there are none all white.
In her prime she had been a grey, perhaps a
beautiful pearl grey with a few darker dapplings,
like her neighbour, a young mare with her first
foal, black of coat except for a white forehead
blaze and fore-foot. Close by stood, and dozed, a
chestnut mare with a mane and tail of pure gold,
or so it seemed in the sunshine. There were also
bays, with black manes and tails, but the commonest
colour in the group was a dark brown. It
was noticeable that most of the foals were darker
in colour than their mothers.

Standing by themselves were two dingy brown
ponies, a mare and a two-year-old, shorter of leg
than the other adults. Their necks showed little
of the arch of a well-shaped animalâindeed, both
ponies were almost donkey-like in shape, with
hollow backs, drooping bellies, and âcow-hockedâ
hind-legs. The mare had a beard hanging below
her chin.

Almost their exact counterpart, even to the
beard, had been set down, ages before, in the wall-paintings
and drawings scratched on bone of the
old Stone Age. These two, one might suppose,
were throw-backs to the old forest pony, which
was hunted, or possibly domesticated, by the men
whose remains were interred in the mounds dotted
over the forest. Indeed, close by stood a great
tumulus, and some way off was a group of nine
mounds, big and little, like parents and children.

Of the other ponies, several showed the
attempts at improving the breed practised of late
years. One had the short leg of the Exmoor
pony, another the tiny ear of the Shetland, others
the shapely line of the polo and even of the Arab,
for at one time or another all these, and others,
have been used as sires. In some cases the importation
threatened to improve the race off the
forest altogether. It is no land of milk and
honey, for the green pastures and lush spots are
not in themselves extensive enough to support
the stock of ponies, and only those which can
exist on the coarse tussock grass, the sweet but
prickly shoots of gorse, and the astringent
heather tufts, are sure of surviving. Also a good
proportion of the ponies stay out in the forest all
the winter; and though snow does not fall frequently
or lie long in this locality, yet the
weather is often colder than in the Shetlands,
where the little pony of the far North, his ears
buried in his shaggy mane, and a doormat-like
thatch on his back, winters without difficulty.

But here, at the other extreme of Britain, if
there come a long spell of bleak wet weather, and
especially if sharp frosts intervene, the younger
ponies are likely to suffer, and a man, seeing his
neighbourâs yearling looking âseedy,â will think
it his duty to inform the owner, who, unless careless
and improvident, will have the creature
âcaught in,â and give it shelter and food.

Perhaps the most striking in colour of the
group on the hill was a chestnut mare, of that
rich hue known as âliverâ chestnut. In the sun
her coat flashed bright orange-red, while by contrast
it appeared deep purple in the shade. Her
foal at the moment was lying in the heather, out
of sight. When at length he arose, one saw why
he could lie hidden so completely, for he was so
small and evidently had not long been born.
Compared with the other foals, which were now
well grown, though still leggy, the colt seemed
absurdly disproportioned, and with his big head,
long ears, and bent hind-legs looked, apart from
his colour, more like a fawn than a pony in the
making. His body was so meagre that it seemed
merely a connecting-link between his fore and
hind quarters. As he stood up he swayed to and
fro. His little napping tail looked exactly like
the strip of goatskin nailed on to form the tail of
those wooden steeds which were being made, not
so far away from where the ponies stood, in the
toy factory at Brockenhurst.

But the interesting thing about him was his
colour, for he was a âskewbald,â patterned
boldly in chestnut and white. Nearly all the
other foals were dark, and it was as yet almost
impossible to foretell their exact adult colour.
Alone among the youngsters, the skewbald foal
showed what his coat would be like when he was
full grown. Although so young, he possessed the
agility of young creatures which have no period
of sheltered repose, unlike fledglings in the nest,
or the young fawn hardly able to stand, and
hidden by its mother while it gathers strength.
In his way the foal was as nimble and alive as
young partridge or lapwing chicks. He trotted
to his mother, took nourishment with the curious
twisted neck characteristic of the attitude of a
foal when feeding, and relapsed from sight among
the heather.

Nearly all the mares had shaggy manes and
tails, and the hair hung down over their foreheads
so as almost to conceal their eyes. The
foals had manes standing up along their necks as
if they had been âhogged,â and their fore hair
rose in a curious tuft between their ears.

The ponies, to all appearance, were as tame
as any stable animal, and they would not have
retreated if a man had quietly approached them
or gone past at a distance of a few yards; unless,
of course, he had used a binocular or camera,
when the flash of light from glass or metal would
have caused them to start and make off. A horseman,
however, would be a different matter, and
they would have been on the move long before he
reached them.

At a nearer view the branding marks on the
mares and yearlings could be seen, mostly on the
back where a saddle would cover it, but sometimes
on the shoulder. These marks indicated the
initials or devices of their owners, commoners of
the forest, or Crown tenants, who have the right
of pasturing their ponies, the Crown demanding
a small annual sum for each animal put out in the
forest.

These marked ponies had the hair of their tails
cut curiously. This had been done by the
agisters, forest officers with numerous and complicated
duties. The forest is divided into three
districts, each served by an agister, and each
district has its own way of marking the tails of
the ponies registered by him. In one district the
lower third of the hair is cut away, leaving a
centre tassel; in the other two half the lower
third is cut off on the right and left respectively.
Thus an agister can tell at a glance whether a
pony belongs to his district or not. The cut tail
is, in effect, a receipt, testifying that the ponyâs
owner has registered it and paid the dues.

The lord and master of the herd on the hill, the
stallion, was not, for the moment, in sight. He
might have been cooling his heels in a stream,
dozing among the gnarled, ingrown hollies,
which, with their twisted branches, look fully as
grotesque as any of Mr. Rackhamâs picturing,
or have gone off to turn back a mare wandering
away down the valley.

Presently a shrill whistling call was heard, and
the mares showed signs of animation; ears were
pricked up and heads flung round. Up the hill
came the stallion with a pounding step. He was
a bright bay with a big white blotch on his back.
His forelock covered his white forehead blaze,
and his eyes also, for all one could see. The black
hair of his mane and tail was crimped or waved,
unlike the lank locks of the mares. He moved
with a vigorous action, lifting his feet high, and
with a long stride. He carried his tail with a
finer sweep than the mares, while his mane rose
and fell with the energetic movement of his neck.
His coat was glossy, and the high lights rippling
to and fro on the bright sienna surface were
golden in the sun and blue in the shade. When
he reached the summit he stopped, looking back
with twitching ears. He snorted and hurried to
the group of ponies, and past them, then stopped,
and the herd, understanding, prepared to follow
their leader, the mares calling to their recumbent
foals, which rose to their feet and stretched before
cantering to their mothers. The cavalcade moved
off, only the dappled grey remaining motionless.
She was wilful or lazy. The stallion took a few
quick paces back and touched her with his nose
as a hint to move on. She whinnied crossly and
tried to strike him with a fore-foot. He lowered
his head, bared his teeth and snorted, whereupon
she thought better of it, and moved off. The
stallion trotted to the head of the column, and
looked round to see that all were following.

As they went down the hill, two riders showed
on the ridge to the right, a man on a tall white
horse and a boy on a forest pony.

âLook, sonny,â said the horseman, âthat
was the stallion walking before us up the hill.
He has warned his mares and set them all going.
How fine they look in a bunch with their varying
colours! Seems a pity,â he continued, âthat
these fine creatures should have to go down into
the coal-mines.â

âNot a bit of it,â his father answered. âWe
should want a good reason to disturb mares with
young foals. The forest people would think us
very inconsiderate. Remember,â with a smile,
âyou may be a verderer yourself some day, and
sit in the court hall at Lyndhurst, where the big
stirrup hangs on the wall. Weâll make off to the
right and watch them as we go.â

As the ponies saw their supposed pursuers
getting further from them, they relaxed their
pace, stopped, and fell to grazing.

Only the stallion, still suspicious, kept his head
up, and trotted a little way towards the receding
figures, watching the intruders until they disappeared
behind a rise.

Then he turned and walked to the little stream
in which some of the ponies were standing,
fetlock-deep, or drinking.

During July the herd wandered over moor and
âplainâ or in the woods, keeping to their unmarked,
though to them fairly well-defined,
territory of several square miles. Outside those
limits were other herds, with their leaders ready
to take offence at the presence of strange
males.

The little skewbald foal kept away from the
other youngsters, for they were too big and
strong for him to play with; but by good fortune
a brown mare with a colt of the same colour, and
about the same age as Skewbald, joined the party.
What with milk and nibblings of heather and the
lush grass of the bottoms, the little foals grew
apace and became playmates.

In the late afternoons before the long evening
feed, the pair would gambol with all the abandon
of youth, while their mothers stood head to tail,
jerking manes, waving tails, shaking fore-legs,
and ever and anon changing the weight from one
hind-leg to another. The colts would race across
the meadow where the herd was pasturing, then
stop dead, and stand nose to nose, watching for
the otherâs next move; one would rear up suddenly,
startling his playfellow, and race away in
glee. Then followed a biting of manes and
nibbling of shoulders like any old couple. At
times they grew rougher in their play. They ran
shoulder to shoulder, trying to bite, or, rearing
up on hind-legs like veterans, indulged in an orgy
of make-believe biting and kicking.

But, for the greater part of the day, life went
quietly with the little foal. His mane, half white
and chestnut with a streak of black, was growing
fast. His barrel was filling out, and his legs growing
straight and strong. His slender muzzle poked
about everywhere, and his tail flapped continually.

In the hot July days, the colt and his mother
wandered over the hills, and by the little streams
meandering along the bottoms except where the
gurgling water was checked, and collected to
form a bog. Sometimes the stream was bordered
with birch and alder, growing in a soggy bed,
littered with dead wood, and choked with undergrowth.
Tracks ran in and out among the trees,
worn by the hoofs of generations of ponies.
Here, the deeper water flowed more slowly. One
afternoon, as Skewbald paused at the edge to
nibble at a bed of watercress, his mother snorted
at two curious objects moving on the surface of
the water, two bristling cat-like heads with small
ears and a swirling of water behind. They were
otters, steering themselves with their thick tails.

Once he nearly stepped on a snipe, her head so
far immersed in a muddy pool that she was not
aware of an intruder until the hoof was almost
upon her, and then what a fluttering and zig-zagging
and crying of âscape-scape!â Another
time, but this was next year, in spring, as he
dawdled around the edge of the wood among the
dead bracken, he nosed against a brown stem. It
moved, and suddenly became part of the barred
head and widely opened eyes of a sitting woodcock,
her buff, grey and white back matching the
dead leaves and bracken, and her long beak indistinguishable
from the stalks of the fern.

At one point the stream opened out into a wide
shallow with a pebbly bottom where the little
trout played. Tracks led into the stream and out
on the other side, for this was a forest ford.

How pleasant the colts found the water, enjoying
the splashing of their hoofs as they walked
in the stream, the while their elders stood fetlock-deep!
How refreshing to take a deep drink, head
and neck inclined at just the right angle so that
the nostrils were clear of the water, followed by a
snort of content!

After whiling away the hotter hours thus, the
ponies would take the tracks towards the hill.
As they got higher, the white stones showed in
the thin crust of soil, and the heather grew more
sparsely. One August afternoon, while rounding
a gorsebush which shaded a patch of bare blackish
soil, strewn with dead sticks and gravel, the colt
almost touched with his nose what looked like a
piece of dead wood covered with grey lichen and
spots of orange fungus, when, on the moment, the
thing came to life. The lichen and fungus
became grey-tipped and barred feathers, the
stalk-like projection opened in half, disclosing a
great, rose-pink, frog-like mouthâa mouth so
enormous and menacing, that Skewbald shrunk
back. Then the mother nightjar appeared from
nowhere, and croaking and spluttering she
fluttered right before the foalâs nose, so that his
attention was distracted from her young one. If
he had looked again he would have found the
gaping mouth and widely spread wings gone, and
the young chick again reduced to the semblance
of an unattractive lump.

Sometimes the ponies would take the open
moor with its coarse grass, scanty tufts of heather,
and sweet-scented bog myrtle. Much of it was
swamp, and the mare watched her offspring
to see that he did not venture into one of the deep
bogs known only to the forest men, and to the
ponies and deer. If he were rash, she called him
on to safety, while if he were obstinate, she butted
him with her forehead on to drier ground.

In places the moor was curiously patterned,
like a chessboard, a tuft of heather next a patch
of bare soil. This was owing to the peat-cutting,
a right possessed by the commoners, who, however,
are required âto cut one and leave two,â
so that the soil should not be deprived altogether
of vegetable growth.

In early September the colt may have seen the
forest gentian, a single blossom of a beautiful
violet-blue on an erect stalk, while the seed-pods
of the bog asphodel close by, of a vivid orange-yellow,
formed a perfect colour complementary.
But do ponies see colours? They apparently see
well by night, which would seem to show that a
large part of their retina consists of structures
adapted for nocturnal vision, just as the outer
part of the human retina only is used at dusk, the
inner being practically blind at this time, and
therefore green foliage and grass turn grey, and
red flowers appear black, red and green being
seen only with that part of the retina concerned
with diurnal vision.

About this time, too, as he crossed a sandy
forest path, he may have seen the brilliantly green
caterpillar of the emperor moth, its sides spotted
with pink, full fed, and wandering about seeking
a site for its cocoon. Was he able to detect the
same creature on its natural resting-place, the
heather, practically invisible to human eyes, when
motionless; its green merged into the leafage,
and the pink spots simulating heather buds?

Certainly the heather the year of Skewbaldâs
birth was of a brilliance such that the oldest forest
man declared he had never seen equalled.
Especially was this the case on the most barren
gravelly spots, where instead of the usual
magenta, clumps of the brightest crimson blazed
in the sun.

In the warm September days life passed
pleasantly. Through the cold, clear nights,
while Vega blazed above, he paced on with his
mother, ever nibbling, for, like his kind, he did
not spend the long nights in sleep, but towards
dawn lay down for an hour or so. His coat, fast
thickening, kept him warm, even when just after
sunrise a white frost covered every blade of grass,
heather tuft, and fern frond. As the sun rose
higher, the frost turned to a heavy dew in which
the colt wandered, the wet bog myrtle washing
him to the shoulder, while the rays, shining
through the mist, enveloped him with a golden
aura.

Later in the day he plodded up the hill on to
the âplain,â and while his mother dozed in the
shade of a clump of holly, he would roll in a patch
of brilliantly white or golden sand. Once as he
bent his knees to lie down, a grey-brown thing
like a dead furze branch suddenly galvanized into
life with a hiss. As the viper moved, the colt,
with a snort of astonishment, jumped all four feet
in the air at once, and the mother rushed towards
him. She saw the reptile gliding along the
path, and turned sharply away, calling the colt
to her.

So Skewbald learned to avoid a snake, and incidentally
that he could jump. He practised this
on occasion, leaping over fallen stumps, across
streamlets and shallow pits, not knowing how
useful an accomplishment it might prove to him
in after-life.

The waning of September, with its sunny days,
cold nights, and morning mists, made little difference
to the poniesâ daily routine. Apparently
they were as free to go where they listed as any
wild Western herd. But their owners kept an
eye on them, and left them there or had them
âcaught in,â as they pleased.

Later in the year strings of ponies would
wend their way to the Brockenhurst sales, but it
chanced that the owner of the bay leader of the
herd in which Skewbald ran, decided to have him
in before he got busy catching other peopleâs
ponies, which was always the case towards the
end of the year, as he was an adept at the game.

The shadows of a golden afternoon were
lengthening, and the herd, scattered over a mile
of valley bottom, was getting to work after the
midday siesta, when a horseman appeared on the
skyline at the head of the valley. It was the colt-hunter
seeking his property. A moment later
another rider came down one of the slopes, and a
third emerged from the woods bordering the
ridge on the other side of the valley. This last
was Mollie, a girl of fifteen, and the other a lad
of thirteen, her brother Tom. They had come to
help their father to capture the pony. This was
not the first time they had taken part in the chase.

The mares heard the thud of hoofs, threw up
their heads, and whinnied to their foals and yearlings.
Then a call came from their leader a good
way down the valley, and at once the ponies made
off towards the summons, increasing their pace
as the boy and girl riders came down upon them,
shouting and waving, in the hope of driving them
back, so that the stallion could be dealt with
alone. But the girl had to check, as she came to
a boggy patch, and they swept on to join their
leader. âGet along, Tom,â called the father,
following behind. âUp the hill, Mollie, and
head them off.â Tom, on a rough pony, and
riding like a centaur, raced after the fugitives,
which with one accord stretched into a gallop,
stringing out along the valley, according to their
ability; the stallion at the head, and putting his
best foot forward, as if he knew that out of all
the lot he was the one wanted. The ground
resounded with the thud of hoofs, manes and tails
waved in the air, and mares called to their foals,
the youngsters responding gallantly.

The stallion was making for a wood, and to
reach this the ponies had to skirt a swamp. As
the leader rounded the wet land, and made for the
upland shelter, Mollie came directly towards him,
screeching and waving. It was too much for the
ponyâs nerves; he turned and fled up the valley,
making for the higher ground, and followed by
the herd, somewhat confused and bunched together
by the check. Some of the foals began
to tire, and, with their mothers, slackened and
fell out. Among them was the chestnut mare,
who retired with her foal to the shelter of a clump
of hollies, whence, with twitching ears and distended
nostrils, they watched the pursuit. The
stallion, with some faithful companions, now encountered
Tom, who turned him again, and then
the man took up the running. Their aim was to
tire out the stallion, âto run him off his legs,â
for in this waste was no friendly farmyard or
paddock into which he could be driven. Grass
and heather fed, as he was, he was not likely to
have the staying power of stable-fed ponies. On
the other hand, he had no weight to carry, and,
if allowed to get into the woods, might elude his
pursuers until nightfall made it impossible to
continue the chase.

The mares, yearlings, and two-year-olds
dropped out one by one. In little groups they
watched the chase, pursued and pursuers rapidly
dwindling in size as they raced down the valley,
then thundering back along the ridge, black
against the evening sky. The bay had no rest,
and was turned time after time. Now and then
one rider slowed down, but the others kept inexorably
on the heels of their prey.

The chase was not without its dangers, for the
hillsides were dry and slippery. Once the stallion
fell, and rolled clean over, but was up and away in
a moment. The girlâs pony slipped twice, but
she stuck to him like a burr. The ridden ponies
had been on the business before, and were as keen
as their riders. They were quick to see the signs
of deflection on the part of their quarry, and
would of their own accord cut off corners to where
the stallion was heading. More than once the
boyâs pony, going straight for his objective, went
under a gnarled holly, and the rider had to flatten
himself, with his head buried in the ponyâs mane,
or he would have been swept off by the lower
branches, and hung aloft. But it was all in the
dayâs work. Perhaps the man took it the most
quietly. He was there to secure his ponyâhis
children were out for a good run.

The end came when the bay visibly tired, and
could no longer keep ahead. He was alone, for
all his companions had deserted him. The man
forged alongside, and the two ran almost touching,
when suddenly the rider, a halter in his hand,
jumped from his mount, and flung himself on the
stallionâs neck, bearing him to the ground. In a
trice the halter was slipped on, and the man was
up and on his pony, before the shaken bay knew
what had happened. It was a feat of strength
and agility of which few of the forest men were
capable.

The others rode up exulting in their fatherâs
prowess. âKeep clear of his heels, Tom,â was
the caution. As the stallion turned to make off,
the manâs mount leaned against the rope, bracing
herself against the coming jerk, which brought
the would-be fugitive up short, pulling him off
his feet. He was up in a twinkling, and lashed
out with his heels, but all were prepared, and
stinging whips warned him against these tactics.
When he hung back the two behind chivied him
on. Once he lay down and was dragged along
the turf a few paces, but the whips again drove
him up. Then, with ears depressed, the red of
his eyes showing, and bared teeth, he tried
biting, but a slash across the face intimated that
such an assault would not pay.

Finally, the stallion, dead tired as he was, lost
heart, dropped his ears dejectedly, and trudged
along, while his captors, almost as weary, went
homewards across the moors, now and then
breaking into speech, as they recalled the more
exciting moments of the hunt.

Of the stallionâs life in the coal-pits there is not
much to tell. This was a good mine, and the
ponies were well looked after. Their stalls were
lit with electricity, and they were properly fed
and groomed. When at work they wore leather
hats, so that in the low places a bump would not
injure them.

Once at least the stallion, who gained the
good-will of the drivers by his willingness and
activity, had a good rest, beside his weekly one,
for when the great strike was decreed and the
pony-men were called out, the ponies had to be
brought to the surface. The bay was among the
first batch, no longer bright of coat, and his eyes
dazzled by the light of day. But when he reached
the field of dingy grass, so unlike the clean
heather of his native soil, he lay down, and rolled
to his heartâs content, then got up and whinnied
long and loud, as if calling across the great open
spaces of the forest.

The ponies were changing pasture one bright
September day. They had eaten the grass from
a bottom sward, and the old white mare was leading
the party to another, a mile to the south.
Up the hill they went, in single file, the mares
with drooping heads, looking neither to left nor
right, the yearlings nearly as soberly, and the
colts wandering on either side to examine things,
like scouts on the flanks of a column. The ridge
attained, they followed the turf by the road. The
Isle of Wight, mostly cerulean blue with touches
of pink and gold where the sun caught it, lay
along the southern horizon; its hilltops alone
showed, the sea being out of sight, so that the
island seemed merely the last folds of mainland
hill country.

The old mare took the road, and the long string
of ponies, as they came on the hard, gritty
surface, suddenly became audible, the pounding
of their hoofs contrasting with their noiseless
progress on the turf. The road was straight, and
behind them a green-covered lorry approached
rapidly. It lurched somewhat, as if the driverâs
hand was none too steady. He had met an old
acquaintance in Hythe, and they had celebrated
the occasion. He held to his speed, being in a
foolhardy mood. Why should he make way for
ponies when they had all the forest on both sides
of the road? They must get out of his way, or all
the worse for them. But the ways of ponies were
fixed long before motor-lorries or any other of
manâs contrivances were in being, and the pace
of a car was beyond their calculation. Skewbald
was ambling behind his little brown friend on the
left hand of the road. The man kept to his side,
grinning in anticipation of the poniesâ sudden
dart to safety.

Some quickness of perception beyond the
ordinary, some electric rapidity of movement,
alone saved Skewbald. The increasing noise
and vibration warned him, and without stopping
to bend his hind-legs for a leap, he jumped with
all four feet sideways. The lorry, rushing on and
missing him by inches, caught the poor little
brown foal and hurled it into the ditch, its mother
in front escaping with a severe bruise on her
flank. The man involuntarily put on his brakes,
and the other ponies had time to get off the road.
He leaned out, and looked back. There was no
car, nor anyone in sight. âBetter get out of
this,â he muttered, and set off, cursing, accelerating
to top speed.

But he had looked only along the road. Tom,
on pony-back, was going shopping for his mother,
and, with his empty bags hanging from his saddle,
had taken a short cut across the moor, and by a
path through the trees on the hill. As he came to
the top the swaying lorry caught his eye. He saw
its check and the scattering of the ponies, then
its hurried departure. He cantered along until
he reached the spot where the brown mare stood,
and shrank in horror from the foalâs injuries, far
beyond his help, then with a hot urge within him
to bring the culprit to justice, he set off along the
road as fast as his pony could go.

A little later, a car with two officers and a
chauffeur came tearing along in the same direction.
As they neared the spot where the foal was
struck, the brown mare was seen standing in the
road. âSlow down,â ordered the senior officer
peremptorily, remarking to his companion that
there had been too many accidents to ponies that
summer. âPony hurt, sir,â said the chauffeur,
stopping the car of his own accord. One glance
at the foal showed that nothing could be done for
it, save freeing it from pain. The younger officer
got a revolver from the car, while the elder and
his man examined the tracks of the lorry before its
stoppage, and the pattern of the tyre impressions.
Then a shot rang out, and the mare moved away in
fright, but returned to the body as the car started.

When Tom reached the town he saw the lorry
outside a public-house. He looked up the street;
the policeman strolling along was an old acquaintance
of his fatherâs, and the lad went up to him.
âPlease, Mr. Jones, that lorry ran over a foal
back on the road.â âOh!â exclaimed the
constable; âsure? Whereâs the driver? In
there, I suppose. What happened?â At that
moment the man emerged, wiping his mouth on
his sleeve, and went to the lorry. âWhatâs this
about a foal?â asked the policeman. âYou
ran into it.â The boy burst in with, âYou
ran it down! You know you did!â âYouâre
a lying little rascal,â retorted the man surlily;
âI never went within a mile of a pony.â âI
know this boy well,â said the constable, âand
he wouldnât make trouble for nothing. I want
your name and address.â A few idlers strolled
up, and the man began to bluff; he was in
Government employ, and if his lorry with its load
wasnât in Ringwood by midday, someone would
have to answer for it. Just then the car with the
two officers came up. They jumped out and
looked at the lorry tyres. âThis is the car,â
said the senior officer. âWhereâs the chauffeur?â
Tom, the policeman, and the bystanders all
nodded accusingly at the driver. The officer
turned on him. âYouâre an inhuman brute,
running down harmless creatures. No, sir; donât
bluster,â as the driver opened his mouth. âWe
came up after you, marked your tyre tracks, put
the foal out of its misery, and we shall certainly
attend to give evidence against you. Take my
name, constableâGeneral ââ,â mentioning a
famous name, which made the crowd gape and
the miserable driver shiver in his shoes.

And later when he appeared in court, the
General, his subordinate officer, and the chauffeur
attended, as well as Tom, who was complimented
on the way in which he gave his evidence; and
the driver was severely punished, as a warning to
other brutal or careless people.

Wandering over moor and heath, and through
the deep woods, Skewbald while yet a foal got to
know the wild life of the forest, for, as with all
young things, life to him was more than mere
eating, and he was full of curiosity about everything
that went on around him.

In the evenings he would see the rabbits, first
little and then big, come out of their holes, their
white scuts flashing as they gambolled. If they
âfroze,â their quiet umber tint assimilated with
the surrounding hues, so that their outline was
lost, and sometimes the colt, going towards a
patch of herbage, saw nothing but a great black
eye gazing at him, until, on a nearer approach, a
young rabbit materialized, and loped away. On
summer mornings when the dew was heavy, the
bunnies looked almost black because of their
drenched fur. They would have all day to comb
and smooth it out underground. Early one
morning he saw a doe rabbit with a mouthful of
grass, sticking out on both sides of her muzzle,
like a great green moustache; she went below
with it, her two little ones following.

Hares he did not see so often, and they sat so
quietly in their âforms,â that he was not aware
of their presence until he nosed up against them.
But he once saw a hare anything but quiet. On
a bare patch of gravel near the railway, where
hares were in the habit of crossing, a big jack hare
was writhing and squirming without moving from
the spot, and Skewbald went up to see this
strange sight. The creature, of course, was in a
gin, though the foal was not to know that. Not
being afraid of hares, he got quite close, and, as
the entrapped one did not move off, but still
strained and struggled, he gave a mischievous
little stamp to drive him away. Now, the poor
hare was caught by a fore toenail only, and
Skewbald happening to press with his hoof on the
spring the jaw opened, and the prisoner was set
free; but his fore-leg was so strained by the
tension, that when he put weight on it, he fell
over, and squirmed as before.

Skewbald, very interested, touched him, and
the hare made off on to the track, where again
he fell and writhed, Skewbald watching through
the railings, until the noise of an oncoming train
reminded the stricken one that he still had three
legs to run on. The following spring Skewbald
again witnessed the hare in motion, and this time
there were two. The pair were on a level stretch,
and indulging in an orgy of violent movement.
They chased one another, turning and doubling,
taking turns to be pursued and pursuer, till one
stopped and crouched, the other jumping over its
back. Then they ran apart in tangential circles
which brought them face to face, whereupon they
stood up on their hind-legs, and thumped one
another with their forepaws like boxers. They
acted as madly as any other pair of March hares.

Instinct and his mother taught Skewbald to
notice all that was going on, to keep his eyes
âskinned.â When they were in the woods, the
harsh notes of the jays made him start, and from
his motherâs movements, he learned that someone
was about. Once in spring, browsing on the
young shoots of a hawthorn-bush, he almost
nosed against two dormice fresh from their long
rest, sleek and tawny bright, among the green
tufts.

The squirrels he could not help seeing, and
when he stopped, and looked at them sitting on
the low boughs of a fir, making short work of the
cones, they stamped peevishly with their hind-feet,
making quite a noise, as the rabbits did on
the ground. Once he witnessed a curious and
beautiful sight which lasted but a moment. A
squirrel pursued another, going round and round
a tree-trunk as they descended, so quickly that
they left on the eye the impression of a reddish
streak, drawn spirally round the trunk. This
again was in spring, and, like the mad antics of
the hares, a love chase.

Sometimes a fox trotted by, or sat up and
looked at him impudently, and, as it happened,
he got tolerably familiar with a family of foxes.
The lair was in a bank between the roots of an
old oak. Skewbaldâs mother, as she went by,
snuffed the air, and indeed, the smell, whether of
fox or high viands, was perceptible even to human
nostrils. So Skewbald snuffed too, and whenever
he passed the hole, the odour reminded him
of what dwelt there. One fine evening, as he
idled at a little distance, he perceived movement
outside the hole. It was not rabbits, so he went
closer, and saw the little fox cubs, lithe and furry.
One lay on its back gnawing at a moorhenâs wing,
two were engaged in a tussle, and one curled into
a ball with his tail over his nose, pretending to be
asleep; but when the vixen came up, and, after
looking round, sat down calmly amidst her
family, the mischievous cub got up, came behind
her and worried her tail, until she turned, and
seized him in her jaws, so that he yelped.

After this, Skewbald, when his company came
that way, looked out for the cubs, but he saw
little more of them, for the older they grew, the
later they came out, until it was night before they
emerged, and then it was not for play but work,
learning to hunt for their living.

Skewbald and his mother sometimes sunned
themselves by a bank crowned with lichened
thorns. It was quite a badger fortress, being
honeycombed with passages. A certain family
which camped by it one August must have occasioned
the badger some inconvenience, for they
used the great holes as dustbins, stuffing down
newspapers, tins, tea-leaves and coffee grounds,
and other rubbish. But they never set eyes on
him, not even on moonlight nights. Probably he
used an exit on the other side of the bank while
the campers were about. But Skewbald sometimes
saw him after dusk, coming or going with
his rolling gait, or appearing at the mouth of his
den with sniffing snout and uplifted paw. Once
the foal came upon him in broad day, and sunny
at that. He was fast asleep, nearly hidden in a
great nest of dried grass and bracken in a
sheltered corner.

Sometimes, though probably he was unaware
of it, the colt walked over little sharply pitted
tracks which were the slots of the deer. Only
once did he see that rare and shy British mammal,
the roedeer. Skewbald was strolling in a forest
ride, when, all at once, a delicate fawn-coloured
shape with two uplifted sharp horn spikes
emerged from a fern brake, and paused with
raised fore-foot and twitching ears before venturing
across the grassy space, and like a shadow his
mate followed him.

In the thick woods, he sometimes saw the other
deer, mostly fallow, the buck with widely branching
palmate antlers, but occasionally a great red
deer.

One September midday, mother and foal were
wandering down a wide drive in the woods, when
strange noises came to the foalâs ears, people
shouting, baying of hounds and blowing of horns.
He ran close to his mother, who, though not
alarmed, raised her head and snuffed the air with
interest. People with horns no longer hunted
ponies, and she had no apprehensions of capture.

Presently a buck topped the bank, and shot
across the drive, a mere rusty brown streak, gone
as soon as seen. The noise of the hounds wavered,
and grew fainter. The buck had eluded them.
Then in the distance a huntsman appeared
coming up the drive on a tall white horse. He
was a fine sight in his black velvet cap, dark green
coat with brass buttons, and his horn ready to
hand. He stopped by a gate watching the drive,
not knowing he was too late. On the hill out of
sight were the three men in brown velveteen, each
holding a team of the leashed hounds; young and
swift these, waiting to be put on the track of the
quarry when the slow old hounds, or âtufters,â
had got the scent, and mounted hunting folk waiting
or patrolling the forest glades. But the noise
and the sight of the buck was all that Skewbald
experienced, that day, of a forest buck-hunt.

After being warned by his mother, Skewbald
kept as respectful a distance from harmless grass-snakes
and slow-worms as from vipers. He even
jumped when the little brown lizard ran across
the path in front of him. And doubtless he sometimes
found the open door of the home of the
underground wasp, and quickly removed his nose
and himself from its proximity. More rarely he
saw the brown paperish globe of the wood-wasp
hung from a low branch, with a hovering swarm
of wasps like a yellow halo round it.

As for âstoats,â heathflies, and the tickling,
crawling New Forest fly, they are, in hot
weather, the torment of a forest ponyâs life, and
the less said about them the better.

Of birds, he knew most familiarly the stonechat,
always on the topmost spray of a gorsebush, both
in summer and in winter, with his little jerking
tail and monotonous âtick-tackâ note. Sometimes
he would see the stonechatâs relative, the
wheatear, standing on a stone or clod of earth,
with the same flirting of the tail; the attitude alert
and vigilant, his black eye-streak emphasizing his
suspicious glance.

In the evening he heard the âhoo-hooâ of the
tawny owl, and might have seen him sitting upright
on the low branch of a willow, close to the
trunk; and once in broad daylight, as he was
nibbling at the bark of the branches of a stubby
hollow holly, a blotched form appeared at the
opening as if in response to the noise he made
before her door; then with a couple of wing-beats,
the little owl flew up into the higher branches and
looked at him with fierce gold-rimmed eyes, and
irritable movements of her head.

Now and then he came across a small covey of
partridges dusting themselves in a sandy patch,
or sunning on a bank. Once in May, as he put his
nose to a tussock, a sitting partridge gave it a sharp
peck. All that season he looked into tussocks
warily, and one day he came upon what looked like
two partridges sitting together; but the one outside
the nest was a cock-bird, as could be seen by
his red ear-lobes and absence of cross-bars on his
wings. As Skewbald looked, a little head peeped
out from under his fatherâs wing and piped. Then
there was more chirping, and from under the
mother emerged a tiny chick, and in a moment
was lost in his male parentâs feathery recesses.
That faithful husband and father was on duty,
receiving each little chick as it hatched, and âdrying
them off.â

One of Skewbaldâs most interesting glimpses
of his bird neighbours concerned another family
party. He was standing one evening in June by
a great brake of gorse on a bank, near a little
stream, when he heard a flutter of wings, and a
great bird alighted, a shelduck, glorious in her
black, white, and chestnut plumage, crimson neb,
and coral legsâa bird which one associates with
the sandy shores of North Wales or the dunes of
Norfolk. Yet here she was, and after looking
round, she walked towards a rabbit-hole at the foot
of a gorsebush, put her head in, and vanished.

A little later the foal and his mother were drinking
at the stream very early in the morning, when
a subdued but anxious croaking was heard, accompanied
by a âcheepingâ from tiny throats, and
the shelduck came into view marshalling a long
line of the prettiest, fluffy, pied little ducklings,
negotiating all sorts of obstacles. And not one
parent only, for the father, larger and still more
resplendent than his mate, and quite as concerned
and anxious, brought up the rear of the procession.
Once or twice he whistled shrilly, as he
intercepted an errant ball of down, and sent it
into the right path. When they tumbled into the
tiny stream, at once the youngsters were at home
and self-confident. The drake saw them all afloat,
and again the procession re-formed to paddle
down-stream to the sea. What adventures were
they to meet with, and how many would the
parents bring safely to the seashore, to run along
the margin of the tide, in their pied down indistinguishable
from the foamy froth washing over
the seaweed? It was perhaps ten miles to their
destination, with many enemies in waitâhawks,
foxes, badgers, pike, and man.

Later in the season a naturalist, not a sportsman
or collector, armed only with his monocular prismatic,
passed the shelduckâs burrow, and a feather
caught his eye. He stooped, and picking it up,
scrutinized it closely. By its white, black and
chestnut, he knew at once from what bird it had
fallen and that doubtless this was her nesting site.

But perhaps one of the most thrilling sights to
be seen in the forest by a lover of birds was what
Skewbald first beheld one cold April morning. A
rough untidy yearling after his winter outdoors,
he wandered down to the brook, where on a
muddy patch broad three-toed footprints had been
freshly impressed. Loose feathers, white, black,
and brown, caught his eye, and as he sniffed at
them he heard a strange musical phrase, with a
humming vibratory timbreâ

Skewbald looked around, and on a little rise
crowned by a grove of birches were several birds
about the size of pheasants. Two were a deep
blue-black, and there were several smaller,
mottled grey and brown. The black grouse still
lives in the New Forest, though sadly depleted
in numbers, and what the yearling saw was
the spring assembly, or âlekking.â The two
cock-birds were going through some strange
manÅuvres. One which had been sitting in the
fork of a tree, with his beautiful lyre-shaped tail
showing to advantage, flew to the ground. He
drooped his wings, lowered his outstretched neck,
which, with every feather on end, looked twice its
usual size, then brought up his middle tail vertically
with the curved extremities hanging down,
so that from the front it looked somewhat like an
admiralâs cocked hat. His silvery-white undertail
coverts were raised, and expanded like a fan.
It was this view he displayed to the presumably
admiring hens, though as far as one could see,
they took not the least notice of their admirers.
Meanwhile he hummed the song already indicated.
Then the other bird came forward, got up
like the first, and the real business commenced.
With outstretched necks and distended crimson
eyebrows, they fenced with each other, until one,
taking courage, flew at his rival, and there was a
rough-and-tumble struggle, only ended when one
had had enough. Then the victor strutted about,
and renewed his song.

It was midwinter and âbad pony weatherââthat
is, the atmospheric conditions were likely to
upset the less hardy and the younger members of
the herds. For a month there had been a succession
of torrential gales from the south-west blotting
out the âWight,â so that the thickest pony
thatch was drenched, and when, as had happened
several times, a hard frost followed a heavy downpour,
the ponies suffered severely from cold, and
the youngstersâ constitutions were sorely tried.

Skewbaldâs mother sheltered herself and him
all ways that an old forest pony knew. In the
heaviest storms she took him to the shelter of
thick hollies or dense spruce groves, but even a
forest pony must eat, and in spite of wet, they had
to leave the protection of the woods for the open
ground, where most of their provender was
to be obtained. Skewbald, from some inherited
strength of fibre, suffered less than other
youngsters, many of whom were âcaught inâ
with their mothers by the more careful owners,
and given food and shelter.

The chestnut and her foal were among those
left out all the winter. Continued frost meant
little to them, protected as they were by their
thick coats. Skewbald, especially, had done his
best to keep himself warm. A great shock of hair
came over his eyes, his mane hung in a thick mass
on his neck, his tail nearly reached the ground and
kept his thighs warm, while his body and legs
looked half as thick again, from the growth of long
hair which covered him right down to the hoofs.
Only his nose was soft and velvety much as in
summer.

After a heavy fall of snow, the mare showed her
son how to kick and scrape away until the herbage
was reached. She taught him to nibble at the
gorse, hard and prickly though nutritious; with
retracted lips nipping off the spikes full of
aromatic buds, and grinding the prickles to shreds
before swallowing. When the foresters cut down
hollies, she was soon on the spot, showing the
youngster how to tear off the sweet bark of the
branches hacked from the poles.

On sunny mornings after sharp frost, he would
lie down in the bracken, tuck his legs under him,
and doze, warm and comfortable, for hours. If it
rained, he followed his mother, and learned the
trick of keeping his back to the wind, thus lessening
the surface exposed.

The agister riding across the moorland heard a
mare neighing, and when she repeated her call
several times, trotted his mount towards her. She
was a bay roan, and after another plaint ran a
little way, and stopped. As the rider came to a
clump of high gorse, he saw a foal lying in a
sheltered nook. One glance showed him it was
dead, a poor thin âsuckerâ with legs outstretched
stiffly. âShould have been taken in before,â he
muttered to himself; âthatâs the youngster I told
Sam Evett about a week ago. Some people arenât
to be trusted with animals.â On his way back he
came across first one and then another young pony
looking âseedy,â and these with their mothers
were gently guided to the nearest farmyard, where
they would be taken care of until their owners
fetched them away.

That night the weather became worse than
ever. The storm raged through the woods,
roaring in the pines and swaying the birches
and beeches, while dead branches snapped off
with cracks like rifle-fire. Skewbald and his
mother were sheltering on the lee side of a
giant beech. If it had been day, the trail of dead
oyster fungus up its trunk would have told its tale
of inner decay. The mare became uneasy, and
moved away from the shelter of the vast column.
She called to Skewbald, who followed, but feeling
the bite of the freezing wind, backed behind the
trunk again. There was a tremendous crack, a
tearing and rending, and the great bole snapped
off above the coltâs head, and crashed to the
ground, the trunk still poised at its line of fracture,
held by bark and sound wood, so that Skewbald
was untouched and unhurt.

A cold north-easter blew across the moor. The
old thorns were budding, the daffodils were peeping
from the turf, and the yellow of the gorse was
beginning to show, so spring was at hand, but
there were few other signs of it, for the season was
late. If the chiffchaff had come, he had no time
to make his presence known by song, his food was
all too rare.

The chestnut mare and her son wandered on
the sheltered side of holly and tall gorse, picking
up what they could. Skewbald, now termed a
yearling though not yet a year old, showed conspicuously
in the landscape in his chestnut and
white. But he was ragged and untidy to the last
degree. His doormat-like coat was torn and
tangled by conflict with the thorns. His face and
neck had the same patchy appearance. But for
the coarseness of his covering, his ribs would have
shown, for, apart from his not yet having filled
out, the severe weather had kept him âlight.â
His legs were still bony and ungainly, and he was
plainly in the hobbledehoy stage. But he had a
good gait, the bones of his shoulders and hind-quarters
were of great strength, with plenty of
room for muscular attachments, and when he
walked, he covered plenty of ground.

The ponies wanderedâwandered because they
had not time to stand back to the wind as do stall-fed
cattle, for both day and night was wanted for
finding sustenance.

The mare had joined a herd led by a small but
energetic stallion, whose shade of blackish-brown,
and âmealyâ or light-coloured nose, proclaimed
his streak of Exmoor blood. Unlike Skewbald and
other ponies, he had been looked after during the
winter, and having only lately been turned out
into the forest, was in splendid condition. He was
full of spirit, alert, and mistrustful of the unusual,
while as master of the herd he brooked no disobedience.
One day after the herd had drunk at
a favourite shallow, they were moving to another
feeding-ground, and the stallion, looking over his
company, noted the chestnut mare still standing
motionless. Either she had not fully slaked her
thirst or some old association made her reluctant
to leave. The leader walked to her and snorted.
She turned her head, but made no other sign of
acquiescence, whereupon he lost patience, bared
his teeth, depressed his ears, and made a little run
at her as if to bite, when she at once made haste
to comply with his command.

On the way, the party was joined by a young
stallion of a blue roan hue, with white forehead
blaze and pink nose, accompanied by an old bay
mare with her yearling. For a time, the three
having fallen in at the rear, all went well, but
presently the grey left his place, and went forward
as if for the express purpose of creating trouble
for himself, for the leader, by his depressed ears
and backward glance, showed that he considered
he had a rival in the field, and was ready to take up
the implied challenge. The grey was taller, but
not in such good condition, having been left out
during the winter.

The mealy-nosed stallion took to making little
rushes at the interloper with extended neck and
bared teeth. The younger at first contented himself
by retreating or swerving, but at last the touch
of teeth on his neck aroused his resentment and
combativeness. He turned sharply, and flinging
out his heels, kicked the leader on the shoulder.
It was the first real blow, and as if by signal, the
two reared up, and with fore-feet striking vigorously,
tried to bite one another on the face and
neck, until they had to come down to rest. Then
the little stallion in his turn reversed, and let out a
kick which took effect on his opponentâs hind-quarter.
The grey screamed with pain and fury.
Rearing, he threw himself at his enemy, knocked
him down, and, unable to keep his balance, rolled
right over him. The leader was up first, and
standing on his prostrate opponent, belaboured
him with his hoofs. The grey cried out under this
treatment, and when he succeeded in getting to
his feet, his adversary rushed at him with jaws
agape and bristling mane, so that he fairly turned
tail. Then the mealy-nosed one trumpeted shrilly,
shook himself, pushed past the waiting herd to
the head, and resumed the journey.

They crossed a road, and went down a rutted
path, and this for a few yards became a causeway
across an obviously boggy patch. The road had
been made by dumping gravel into the swamp,
its sides being strengthened by balks of timber.
Near the edges of the bog, patches of lush grass,
emerald of hue, were beginning to sprout. Skewbald
strolled down to sample this luxury, but was
recalled to her side by his motherâs sharp whinny.
She knew the temptation this verdant growth had
for youngsters, and its danger. A moment later,
a tragedy occurred. A poor-looking, black yearling,
motherless for some reason, strayed from the
path, to nibble at a tempting patch, a yard or so
from the edge. He walked confidently to it, but
after a mouthful, sank below his knees, and a cry
of fright broke from him. The herd showed signs
of distress, and shrill whinnyings came from the
mares as they plunged to and fro along the
margin; but the coltâs efforts to reach his companions
only involved him the more surely in the
morass.

A few bubbles rising to the surface of what was
now a muddy pool told of the disaster which had
occurred. The bog keeps its secrets, and no one
knows how many ponies have been engulfed in it.

Spring had come at last. The cold east winds had
been followed by warm south-westerly gales with
soft rain, making the grass grow and filling the
bogs also. The golden-yellow of the marsh-marigold
at the streamâs edge was repeated in a
lighter key by the stunted wild daffodils in the
forest meadows, and again in higher but more
diluted tone by the primroses on the banks outside
the woods. The blackthorn was past its prime,
but the bushes were still covered with blossom now
looking like soiled snow. The oaks and beeches
were still in bud only. The thorns had put out
tufts of vivid green, drowning the grey-green of
their lichened branches. In the swampy spots the
catkins of the bog myrtle shone in the sun with
extraordinary brilliance, presenting great patches
of that rare colour in wild floral natureâdeep
orange and orange-scarlet.

Of course, the birds were here. Not only the
residents, the stonechat and the little hedge and
field birds, and the rook, crow, kestrel, and heron,
but the migrants also. The chiffchaff uttered his
name continually as he hunted in the scraggy
budding oaks, the willow-warbler repeated his
wavering refrain, crescendo and diminuendo, very
like the bends in the âtailâ in âAlice in Wonderland;â
and the whitethroat was beginning to
throw himself in ecstasy above the bushes. The
blackcap flew from bough to bough, as he shrilled
his wild, inconsequent, yet melodious and captivating
song, while the garden-warbler skulked in the
bushes, chuckling and fluting throatily at great
length; the nightingale began to âjug,â while
his shorter but more richly coloured mate industriously
collected oak-leaves for her nest. In the
beechwoods the woodwren flitted from bough to
bough, repeating his clear call, followed by a
twittering cadence like ice tinkling in a glass,
while his wings quivered in time with his tune.

Above the moor the cock lapwing made occasional
flights to amuse his sitting partner, flapping
his rounded wings vigorously as he flew all ways,
curving downwards to the ground without alighting
and up again in another sweep, then âreversingâ
in his characteristic way. Meanwhile
the redshank stood on the bog bobbing his head
nervously, or whistled shrilly to his mate, if a crow
or a man appeared on the horizon. The redshank
likes to nest near the lapwing, which is as brave as
the other is timid, dashing threateningly down on
an intruder, especially its ancient enemiesâcrow,
jackdaw, and harrier.

Out on the moor lawns of green grass showed
amongst the heather, and in the bogs, amidst the
bleached tussock grass, were patches of new grass
of the most vivid emerald, looking, and most deceptively
so, like firm sward.

There are many bogs in the forest, varying from
patches a few yards square to huge ones covering
many acres. In Denny Bog still lie the
remains of an aeroplane which landed on the
smooth and, to an eye looking from above, apparently
firm surface. The pilot, on getting out
of the fuselage, was soon up to his waist; and
in spite of repeated efforts, it was found impossible
to extricate the plane, and the salvers
had to content themselves with removing the
engine.

To the human visitor the bog has no terrors, for
its dead yellowish grass with green patches and
occasional pools proclaim its nature. Moreover,
causeways of gravel have been made across
narrower parts where necessary.

Skewbald and his mother were wandering as
usual on the moor, the rest of the herd strung out
over a square mile of forest, hillside, and grass
bottom, too intent on making up for their scanty
winter fare to desire the close companionship of
their fellows.

Skewbald was much the same as a month before,
perhaps a little more ragged, as his loosening
winter dress got carded out by the thorns.

The two were on the outskirts of a great bog,
to the south of which extensive woods filled the
horizon. They were not alone. A little distance
away two gipsies, a man and a boy, were following
the edge of the bog, striding from tussock to
tussock and probing with their sticks for bad
places which might let them in.

There was no difficulty in divining what they
wanted. The lapwings screaming overhead, the
redshanks wailing as they flew right away, knew
also that their eggs were in danger. Ploversâ eggs
are part of the gipsyâs livelihoodâto sell, because
they are too precious for him to eat. He would
say that he found far more in a henâs egg.

As the egg-hunters quartered the ground, they
approached the ponies, which, judging from their
movements that they themselves were not likely
to be molested, ignored their proximity. The
boy, when abreast of Skewbald, suddenly raised
his stick, and from pure mischief or rather fun,
ran at the yearling, which, startled, bounded off,
but in the direction of the bog. He plunged about
and sank deeply, while his strenuous efforts to
extricate himself only caused him to become more
firmly embedded. Soon he could no longer move
his legs, the mud reached his flanks, and he was
still sinking, though now more slowly.

The man stormed at the boy standing open-mouthed
in dismay, then looking round began to
run, calling to the other to follow. He was
making for a promontory of firm ground stretching
into the bog. Here stood a few stunted pines
which a fire had caught, for they were black and
dead, some already lying on the ground. Both
loaded themselves with the fallen logs, staggered
back to the yearling, and began to throw the wood
on the bog towards him. Skewbald, incapable of
motion save for frenzied movements of his head
and neck, was aghast at his plight, and called
piteously to his mother, who plunged backwards
and forwards along the edge of the bog, whinnying
distractedly.

The man waded out and pushed log after log
under the yearlingâs belly. Then he got a pole
under him behind the fore-legs. His next action
was to bend down and feel in the mud to ascertain
if the ponyâs legs were straight. A forcible pull
on a bent leg might cause a fracture. His preparations
made, he put all his strength into levering
up the pole, calling: âNow, Jarge, let âun have
what for;â and the boy, with a stick, belaboured
the yearlingâs hind-quarters. Skewbald felt himself
moved by the manâs force, and, under the
added stimulus of pain, made tremendous exertions.
The man made another effort, and a fore-leg
came up. âAt âun again, lad;â and the
harassed yearling, with a great heave and an explosive
âsuck,â came out of the mud and began to
flounder towards the firm ground, leaving the two
half-bogged themselves. The man reached out
and pulled the boy towards him, and they worked
their way out.

They were covered with mud from head to foot,
and regarded each other doubtfully, until the
man laughed (a smile would not have been perceived),
whereupon the boy exploded in peals of
merriment. Their hearts were warm within
them, with the pleasure of success, for horseflesh
or ponyflesh is dear to the gipsy. Then, picking
up the eggs they had collected, which, being
gipsies, they had carefully deposited in a tussock,
they departed.

But Skewbald carried a long scar on his belly,
caused by a sharp pine knot, to the day of his
death.

It was full spring. For nearly a month May had
flooded the forest with sunlight. The gold of the
gorse was blinding to the eye, and almost intoxicating
with its strong scent of burnt almonds. The
powdery snow of the blackthorn had been followed
by the ropy, pinkish bloom of the hawthorn. The
foliage of the scraggy oaks was Italian pink (which
is a greenish yellow), while the silver birches and
the beeches had burst into leaf and emerald
tassels had succeeded the crimson buds of the
larches. The brambles had two distinct sets of
leafage, those of last year, old and tattered,
but magnificently blotched with crimson and
orange, and edged with sienna, while from
their axils sprays of tender green unfolded
themselves.

This is the month of song, and everywhere the
larks and meadow-pipits rose in the air, the former
to go up out of sight still trilling, while the latter
ceased singing, and came floating down silently
like parachutes of brown paper.

The lapwing chicks peeped from their motherâs
wings, or crawled over her back like the young of
the domestic hen. If an enemy flew over, the
male bird rose in the air in a frenzy of militant
defence, while at the parentsâ warning call, the
chicks crouched and became, to the casual glance,
invisible.

As for the pony population of the forest, it
seemed to have doubled in numbers all at once, for
everywhere the young foals followed the mares,
or lay basking among the heather. The early foals
were now tall and long-legged, though here and
there a late arrival stood unsteadily with bent
hind-legs, or trotted a few paces with a stiff-legged
gait. It might even essay a gallop, a curiously
mechanical action, reminding one of a rocking-horse.

One mare, at least, had two little suckers, and
here and there quite a family procession passed,
of mare, two-year-old, yearling, and foal, the
property of someone who had not troubled to sell
the youngsters, preferring to leave them in
the forest to breed. Parties of threeâmare,
yearling, and suckerâwere quite common, the
two youngsters on the best of terms.

The hues of the new-comers were sometimes
exactly those of their mothers, but often quite
different. An old mare, once a grey but now dirty
white, was followed by a black foal; if the latter
were closely scrutinized its eyebrows might be
seen to be grey, and that would mean the foal
would turn grey like its mother, and again white
in old ageâfrom black to white. But if the eyebrows
were black like the rest of the body, then
probably the hue would remain black or very dark,
for black is rare in the forest, and as some think
due to importation of alien blood. In the case of
one chestnut foal, its darker eyebrows showed
that when adult its coat would be of a rich liver
colour.

The majority of the foals bid fair to be like their
parents, a dark brown with blackish mane and tail,
and the same similarity existed with bays and
chestnuts, though generally the foals were darker
in hue than their mothers.

But there were exceptions to this. A dappled
grey mare, for instance, instead of the more usual
black-coated offspring, might be accompanied by
a foal, light fawn as to ground tint, with black
markings round its eyes and muzzle; or a dark
mare be seen with a light-coloured youngster.

The yearlings, among whom Skewbald was one,
had shed their winter coat by dint of rubbing
against bushes below and overhanging branches
above. The bay and chestnut showed clearly, and
the lights began to appear on their coats, golden
in the sun, blue in the shade, though they could
scarcely be said to âripple,â for the youngsters
were still bony, with unfilled barrels.

Young Skewbald was not amongst the dullest
hued of his fellows. There were few whose chestnut
was brighter than his, while his white could
not be matched anywhere among the ponies
except for an occasional âsockâ or forehead blaze
too small in area to tell at a distance.

Like the others of his year, he walked sedately,
for his hours of coltish play were over. Never
again would he gambol on the lawns with a playmate
in the golden evenings, though occasionally
he would lie down and roll, a pleasure every horse
and pony indulges in till the end of its days.
Sufficient for the day was the labour of filling his
belly, although the forest fare increased daily in
bulk and sweetness.

Three ponies were grazing on a long level stretch
of moorland one perfect evening in early September.
To the north were low hills, their sides
covered with purple heather and fern, the latter
already showing orange amongst the green. Here
and there an old thorn or holly dotted the hillside,
the ridge itself serrated by groups of firs. Along
the southern border of the moor flowed a tiny
stream, a few feet across, which, a few miles
farther down, would expand into a wide estuary
dotted with yachts.

As the sun declined, the moor fell into shade,
but on the hill the red trunks of the firs and the
orange of the fern glowed with richer hues, while
the heather added a ruddy tone to its purple. The
foliage took on that rich golden-green which landscape
painters love, while the shadows, deriving
their colour from the blue of the eastern sky, were
glaucous green.

Skewbald, still a yearling although some sixteen
months old, was with his mother, who had also by
her side her last foal, a brown filly. She was well
grown, for she had been born early in April.

As they grazed, Tom and Molly, followed by
their father, rode through the gate which led to
the little farm beyond the river. âThere they
are,â said the boyââmare, yearling, and colt.â
(New Forest folk have a way of referring to a foal
as a colt, even speaking of âhorse coltsâ and
âfilly colts.â) âYes, close at hand,â said his
father; âpush the gate wide open. I hope,â he
continued, âas we havenât all day to catch the
yearling in, that youâll just get quickly to work,
and remember catching ponies is one thing, and
running races with them quite another.â Tom
grinned, but in his heart hoped the ponies would
not let themselves be driven in without a run.

The father sent his boy along by the river, while
he himself made a detour to get behind the ponies.
Molly was to go up the moor to be in readiness
in case of a break-away. The ponies were to be
driven through the gate over the wooden bridge
into the paddock, and, if it could be managed that
evening, right into the stable yard. The boy and
girl were to watch them, while the father drove
them towards the gate. All went well at first.
As the man emerged from the trees in view of the
ponies, the mare stopped feeding, looked at the
intruder, snorted, and trotted away with her offspring.
The rider followed, gently shepherding
them towards the gate, his assistants closing in on
either side. Unfortunately, the youngest boy of
the family, who, with a small sister, was fishing in
the stream, had succeeded in bringing a minnow
to land, and signalized his triumph with a yell of
delight, just as the ponies came towards the opening.
The mare pricked up her ears, swerved
sharply, and, followed by her youngsters, made
off at full speed across the moor in spite of all that
the hunters could do. The man laughed ruefully,
calling, âYouâll get your run, Tom; we must
try and get them in before night.â Tom went
like the wind, in shirt and trousers, and barebacked,
on a little rough pony, which knew every
foot of the ground. The fugitives got to a boggy
place, and had to pick their way, so Tom, running
wide, got behind a patch of firs, and came upon
the ponies suddenlyâtoo suddenly, for they went
away up the moor, the mare shaking her mane
and tail, Skewbald keeping pace easily, and the
foal doing wonderfully well. They went right
past the girl, though she tore off her hat, whirled
it above her head, and let off blood-curdling
shrieks. âAfter them, Molly,â called her father,
and the thunder of hoofs resounded, while the
setting sun gilded the heather, firs, and fern with
a deeper glory than before, and enhanced Skewbald,
as he emerged with the mare and foal on the
hilltop, then disappeared behind clumps of hollies,
or, a moment in shade, told dark on the skyline.
The wide, open situation, the sense of space, as
the retreating ponies diminished rapidly to mere
dots, the sweet scent of bruised bog myrtle, and
the clear light, made a scene less like rural England
than the setting of some cowboy story of
vast upland country in, say, Idaho or Arizona.
Only the great sierra background was lacking.

Molly managed to drive the ponies off the
moor, up the hill, along the ridge, and then turning
them, drove them down the steep forest road
across the moor towards the farm, Tom and her
father on either side, waving and shouting to
prevent a break-away. There was no trouble this
time at the gate, for with man and boy to right
and left, and the girl thundering behind, the ponies
were glad to dash through. âGot âem,â chuckled
Tom as he closed the gate. The others followed
at the poniesâ heels over the bridge. The gates
leading to the yard were open, and all was quiet,
for Mother had looked out to see how things were
going, and had taken charge of her two small
children. As it happened, the fugitives, instead
of turning off into the meadow, as they might
have done, went up the road, dashed through the
opening, and found themselves in the stable yard.
Molly closed the great sliding-door, while Tom
and his father, jumping from their mounts,
attended to Skewbald. As he was a lusty
youngster, and with his shaking mane and depressed
ears looked mischievous, they paid him
the compliment of treating him like a full-grown
stallion, and Tom was given the job of haltering
him, for practice. The halter was hung on the
end of a six-foot rod, and while his father drove
the yearling into a corner, distracting his attention,
Tom quietly slipped the loop over his head
and fastened the rope to a ring in the wall, before
Skewbald had time to show resentment at being
tied up.

âFetch the branding-iron, Tom,â said his
father. Mother had it on the kitchen fire in readiness.
Meanwhile the man got a sack from the
shed, and watching his opportunity, dropped it
over Skewbaldâs head, who, while objecting to it
very much, was so puzzled by the darkness, that
he ceased his straining and backing, and was
reduced to quietude. This bandaging the eyes is
not often done, only when it is feared a pony may
become obstreperous. Sometimes the yearlings
are driven into a stable with no space to kick in,
when the brander will reach over one pony to
brand the next.

Tom brought out the iron, which was like a
poker with a ring handle for hanging up, and the
branding device or letters welded to the other end,
and of course in reverse. Several such irons were
hanging in the stable.

There need be no shuddering at visions of red-hot
iron and sizzling flesh, for the iron when it
reached the yard was black, and to all appearance
cold. Yet it was hotâhot enough to destroy hair
growth where it was pressed, and leave a permanent
mark.

The man took the iron and held it for a moment
an inch from his cheek to test its heat. âJust
right,â he said; âhold him, Tom;â then firmly
pressed the iron against the shoulderâthe
shoulder, not the saddle, for Skewbald was one
day to go to the mines, where appearances do not
count for much, hard pulling and quick turning
being more highly rated. Skewbald did nothing
out of the way when the iron bit into his skin, did
not kick or try to rear; he just winced, and that
was all.

Then the yearling was released and turned out
into the paddock, where his mother and her foal
were awaiting him. The agister would be along
shortly, and Skewbald would be on hand for the
tail-cutting. This is also a delicate operation,
as a pony may launch an unexpected kick.
Generally, a large pair of scissors in hand, the
cutter quietly draws the lower tail hair towards
him with the crook of a stick. In a stable into
which a dozen ponies may have been driven,
perhaps for the first time in their lives, the agister
will venture fearlessly, and cut tail after tail without
mishap, trusting to the good sense of the
ponies, which will not kick in the confined space,
for fear of hurting their fellow-prisoners.

Occasionally, half a dozen commoners will agree
to meet on a Saturday afternoon, for the purpose
of collecting their ponies. The harness of the
ridden ponies varies in style, and is often more
homely than elegant. A man may be riding a
horse or pony whose accoutrements consist of
mere scraps of leather held together by string
and rope. The boys of the party ride barebacked,
or make an old rug serve as saddle.

Some time may be spent in rounding up the
ponies, which, after much hard riding and shouting,
are driven into a convenient farmyard, in a
bunch of twenty or thirty.

The quiet enclosure, tenanted only by a few
pigs and poultry, becomes a place of tumult as
the hunted ponies surge in, snorting, neighing,
and tossing manes, the pursuers close on their
heels to prevent a break-away. In a moment all
is life and movement. The poultry and pigs dash
hither and thither from beneath the trampling
hoofs. The riders jump from their mounts, which
with drooping heads stand passive as if glad to
rest, strangely contrasting with the restless movements
of the wild ponies, which, cowed and bewildered,
crowd into a corner, penned up so
closely that they have no room to kick, even if
they have the inclination; foals wander about,
seeking their dams; men and boys, leaning against
their steeds, chat with the daughters of the farm,
while dogs and children appear as if by magic, the
tiniest tot seeming to bear a charmed life. The
unwanted ponies are now sorted out, an operation
somewhat troublesome and delicate, and given
their liberty; the unbranded ones are tied up and
marked with their respective ownersâ branding-irons.

Then the company takes the farm road, leading
the freshly caught ponies. Most of the captives,
after a few skirmishes, submit to their fate, and go
quietly, but some, more resentful of their treatment
and unwelcome bondage, give much trouble,
both to their captors and to themselves. They
put down their fore-feet stubbornly, refusing to
budge, and when prodded by those behind, may
fling themselves down, to be dragged along the
stony road. An obstinate pony will try sorely the
patience of those in charge of it, and instances
have occurred of an animal causing its own death
by its violent resistance; but, generally, after half
a mile of rough treatment, the pony realizes that
further opposition is useless, and follows more or
less submissively.

October had been wet. Rain in the forest is, at
all times of the year, depressing. When the sun
shines on purple heather, emerald fern, and the
ruddy stems of fir-trees, moorland and hillside are
gay enough, but in wet and stormy weather the
landscape is the more gloomy by contrast; the
lowering clouds, the black sobbing pines, the
pools of water, the soggy tussocks squelching
underfoot, make up a dull and cheerless scene,
although in the eyes of the forest lover it is
perhaps then at its best. The damp atmosphere
intensifies the local colour, and gives a sense of
vastness and distance to the perspectives.

The forest ponies dislike rain. They have to
seek food most of their day, and cannot afford to
stand idly in shelter like their more favoured
relations. Also the boggy ground gets still more
shaky and uncertain, and the wary creature is cut
off from the areas which might supply him with
food. In long continued rain the ponies leave the
open moor or hillside, and betake themselves to
the woods, where, under the umbrellas formed by
the great oaks, beeches, and firs, they find shelter,
especially from what most living creatures detestâa
cold driving rain.

Skewbald, therefore, was with his companions
in the woods, nosing round for clumps of sweet
grass, or, in the wettest spells, taking shelter
under overhanging trunks. His coat had grown
thick during the autumn, and with his dense mane
and tail he was as well protected as a pony
could be.

The colt-hunter also disliked rain, for apart from
the discomforts of the chase in wet weather, rounding
up the ponies is vastly more difficult in the
woods. On the open moor the chase is not always
successful. Not seldom one may drive ponies
from miles away to within sight of the open gate,
and then something may arouse their mistrust,
may cause them to break away, and the work has
to be done over again. But, all things considered,
the chase on the moor is a picnic compared with
driving ponies out of the woods. In the open one
has the great advantage of being able to view oneâs
quarry from a distance, and formulate beforehand
a plan of campaign. But in the woods one must
search and search until the ponies are chanced
upon, and then stick tenaciously to their heels
until a capture is effected. In the denser parts,
one may beat about all day, and although the
ponies may be near, and even heard and seen, yet
they may change their ground so evasively that
night may fall and still find them uncaptured.

It was not raining much when the colt-hunter
and his boy rode out one morning, but the sky
gave every promise of a downpour later on.
âWet skins for us to-day, Tom,â said his father,
as he donned an old mackintosh, and a wide-brimmed
hat, which would divert the rain from
his neck. Like other people who are out in all
weathers, he had no use for caps, which in heavy
rain let the water trickle down oneâs back. Both
riders had bread and cheese in their pockets, for
they might be out all day, if they were not
fortunate in the chase. It had been arranged that
they should meet the agister, who wished their
help in locating and catching some yearlings and
older ponies. At this time of the year ponies are
caught in some numbers, and sent to the autumn
and winter sales.

The colt-hunter, by long experience and a
good memory for the forms and hues of ponies,
knew most of the many hundreds in the forest,
and their pedigrees. He was acquainted also with
the likely places where a wanted pony might be
found at any time of the year.

The hunters, with a cheery good-bye to Mother
and Molly, rode some distance across the moorland
and through the rides in the woods, skirted bogs,
and then made their way up a stone-strewn hillpath
to the south, past the spot where the young
airman, flying from the training-ground on Beaulieu
Heath, had stooped at a great white cross of
gravel, marked out on the hillside, and had nose-dived
to the ground, crumpling up his machine
and breathing his last in the arms of a visitor
camping near by. Father and son rode across the
barren plateau of Blackdown; to the east the
great tumulus stood dark and plain on the skyline,
but in front of them Wood Fidley was almost
obscured by driving clouds of rain-mist coming
from the south-west.

When they reached the main road, they found
the agister waiting for them. He had on his
buckled hat, but his official coat was hidden under
his horsemanâs cloak. He also foreboded bad
weather and a long drive through the woods.
They crossed the roadânow firm and smooth,
very unlike its stone-strewn surface during a dry
summerâtook a winding path over the moors,
and so into the woods.

The colt-hunter led the way into the deepest
recesses, where great oaks and beeches leaned
one against the other, while the ground was encumbered
with undergrowth. As they slowed
down to a walk, they saw ponies, half-hidden by
the bushes, stealing away. âThereâs one of
those weâre after,â said the agister, âand thereâs
another.â

Skewbald was not one of the wanted animals,
but of course he was not to know that, and made
off with the rest. It was now raining hard, the
wood full of driving mist, and the going very
heavy. The fugitives had the best of it, for the
ridden ponies sank below their fetlocks in the
wetter parts, while fallen branches, tangles of
briers and brambles, and drooping holly boughs
impeded their progress.

Tomâs pony, as keen as her rider, and not so
heavily weighted, made but little of the heavy
ground. She made straight for the fugitives
directly she heard or saw them, without waiting
for Tomâs directing hand on the reins, and several
times he was literally pulled from the saddle by
projecting boughs of holly, thorn, or oak. But
he held on to his mount, though torn, scratched,
and wet through. Then, when separated from
the other riders, he saw his opportunity, for he
came upon Skewbald and a wanted yearling which
had got away from them earlier in the day,
sheltering behind some dense holly bushes. Off
they went, with Tom close on their heels, and
after some amount of twisting and turning, the
fugitives came out on a grassy drive, with a gate
at the far end.

Skewbald made the pace for his companion, and
Tom put on a last spurt, trying to get even with
his quarry. Skewbald, as he approached the
barrier, glanced back at his pursuer, then, acting
under an overmastering impulse to escape, went
at the gate, cleared it, and was at once lost to
sight in a forest enclosure. Tom went right on,
charging full tilt into the other pony, which he
pinned against the gate, nearly knocking the wind
out of both animals. Before the yearling had
recovered himself Tom had him haltered, and a
safe prisoner.

In the New Year Skewbald again used his
jumping powers, and this time saved his life thereby.
He was feeding with two other young ponies
in a rough part of the forest, when a stray hound,
a deserter from the kennels, alarmed them. The
intruder, perhaps wishing for company, ran towards
them, but the ponies, not relishing his
advances, set off at a trot. The hound followed,
and the trot became a gallop. It chanced that
an artillery company, training in the forest, had
dug some pits which had not yet been filled in.
The ponies are, as a rule, quite able to take care
of themselves. They have a good sense of geography
and know the dangerous spots, as bogs
and pits, but, being driven away from the
training-ground, they were unaware of the existence
of the excavations.

As Skewbald fled, through gorse, tall heather,
and bog myrtle, the pony in front of him disappeared
with a cry, and, the next moment, he
found himself at the edge of a deep and wide pit,
with no time to turn. But the accident to his
companion had given him that fraction of a second
of preparation which was enough for his nerve
and muscle. He made a spasmodic leap, and just
managed to land his heels on the far side. The
third also leapt, but fell short.

When the hound, hearing the poniesâ moans,
looked down, he fled with a yelp of dismay. Later,
the huntsmen, searching for the truant, found
the two ponies, one dead and the other
grievously hurt.

In the rougher corners of the forest are the tents
of the gipsies, kept by authority as far as possible
from the more frequented beauty spots. One
comes across these encampments in little groups
of two or three wigwams, each being built on the
same principleâa framework of rods bent semi-circularly,
over which are thrown blankets and
any odd lengths of stuff that can be so used. At
one end is the âbaulkââa square tapering tower
of blanket or canvas open to the sky. This is the
chimney, the fire being built on the ground inside,
so that the inmates can prepare their food in the
dry, and enjoy the heat radiating into the tent
proper. Generally there is another tent beyond
the fire, so that the baulk is in the middle of the
erection.

On a fine Sunday, one sees the weekly wash
drying and bleaching on the bushes, children playing
with the dogs, the women cooking and the
men in their best clothes. Many before and after
Borrow, looking at the gipsy, have been impressed
by his fixity of type, his adherence to his mode of
life in a country gradually losing its open spaces,
and maintaining himself in face of restrictive and
sometimes oppressive regulations. To many the
standing marvel is that he can live at all outdoors,
not only in summer heat, but when frost is in
the earth, or when the ground shakes like a quagmire
and the ditches run like rivers. But nowadays
millions of men who came through the war
remember how in the course of their training, or
under the actual conditions of warfare, they slept
outdoors without even a gipsy tent, by fair and
foul, in wet and cold, and remember, too, their
astonishment that they suffered no harm, and,
bullets apart, thrived on the rÃ©gime.

But the gipsy has this in common with the town
dweller, that he, too, gets his living there; to the
town he must go to sell his produce or manufacture,
his flower or fern roots, his brooms, mats,
baskets, etc., and therefore a cart of some sort
is almost a necessity, and to draw the cart, a pony.
The forest pony is thus of great importance to the
forest gipsy; she is hardy, gets her own living, is
cheap to buy when young, and is a source of
wealth. Every forest gipsy is a potential breeder
and dealer; the pony is at once his passion and his
temptation. If he has no ponies to sell at the
autumn sales, there is less money to tide over the
winter.

Therefore the ponies wandering at will, unnoted
by their owners, as free to wander as the
wild creatures, have a great interest for the gipsy,
who regards the products of the forest as his lawful
tribute. The ploverâs eggs, the rabbit, hedgehog
and squirrel, the flowers and ferns, either
supply him with food or put money in his
pocket. But the pony is marked and tail-cut,
plain signs that it is the acknowledged and registered
property of its owner, and not to be appropriated
with impunity. Of course, by far the
greater number of gipsies are strictly honest in
regard to ponies, having learned like the rest of
us, from experience, that honesty is the best
policy; but to some an unmarked yearling pony
must be a temptation, when a branding-iron is
always present in the shape of any iron bar handy,
to be thrust in the fire kept constantly burning.

One autumn, on the edge of the forest just
outside a sheltering wood a small encampment
consisting of three gipsy tents and a caravan
nestled. As night fell the noise of people talking
and children playing ceased, for the gipsies go
early to bed, and rise betimes. The evening meal
had been eaten, the youngsters snuggled to sleep
in corners, and only a few men and women sat
around their fires smoking, for most had had a
long day going to town to sell their wares, and
were glad to seek repose.

Behind the tents, in a little blind lane with high
hedges ending at a gate, a mare was tethered.
She had been deprived of her foal and grieved
noisily, whinnying loudly ever and again. Away
on the moor ponies were grazing, and hearing the
repeated call of the bereaved mother, they put up
their heads for a moment. At last Skewbald,
now a two-year-old, and another pony of the same
age, a dull bay, could stand it no longer, and
sidled away from the herd in the direction of the
call. As they approached the silent tents, the
bay whinnied, and the mare responded so appealingly
that the two quickened their pace to a trot.
A big lad, lounging by the fire in the nearest tent,
looked out as they passed, and then crawled away
silently.

Skewbald and his companion went right up to
the mare, which tried hard to get away from her
tether, whinnying repeatedly, so that the two-year-olds
did not notice several dark figures creeping
towards them in the obscurity of the ditch.
But when a man stumbled, the two ponies made
off up the lane, only to be brought up short by
the gate. Their pursuers, close at their heels,
threw themselves at their necks, and soon the two
were haltered and secured.

An older man came out and examined the
captives. Then in no measured terms he abused
the captors for troubling to tie up a pony marked
like the skewbald, an animal of such striking
colour and pattern, and probably well known to
commoner, keeper, and agister. It was as good
as giving themselves up to the police to have it in
their possession for a moment, and he ordered the
crestfallen young fellows to release it at once.
This was done, and, with a stripe on his flank to
help him along, Skewbald was turned loose, and
made off towards the herd. Then the man gave
his attention to the bay, and pronounced him
ordinary enough to keep. But what were the
marks, if any? A lantern was brought, and the
capitals C. F. were found on the shoulder. A bar
was heated and it was not difficult to convert the
marks into O. E., though much to the discomfort
of the young bay. His tail marks were cut right
away as well. Then it was mooted whether the
pony should not be taken off at once, but this was
pronounced against, as likely to arouse the suspicion
of the police, if met with on the way. In
a day or two a huckster would come along with a
string of ponies, and among them the bay would
not attract notice.

But unfortunately for the gipsies, the agister of
the district, in tall hat with buckle in front, and
green coat with brass buttons, happened to ride by
next morning, on his way to clip the tails of some
ponies lately caught in.

As he passed, he noticed a young bay tied up
behind a tent. Now, the agister knew all the
ponies of his district, and many others in the other
districts as well. Ponies were a passion with him.
He knew them not only by their brands and their
colours, but by their shapes, gait, and size. A
pony once seen by him was never forgotten, and
he could recognize a wanted animal more than
half a mile away. He paused and scrutinized the
bay. Yes, that was Charles Finchâs two-year-old.
He had known it since its birth, and could not be
mistaken. Its tail was short, but not cut after the
fashion of any of the three forest districtsâin
itself a suspicious circumstance. He went closer
and read the letters O. E. No one he knew of in
the forest used such a brand. He got off his pony
and pressed his thumb in the lowest arm of the E,
and the pony winced.

That was enough for the agister, who turned to
several lowering but silent lads and men collected
in a group. âWho claims this pony?â he asked.
There was no answer. âI am positive itâs Charles
Finchâs pony. I shall take it with me if no one
objects;â and he tied the pony to his own, and
trotted away.

After he had done his business, he took the
pony to its owner, who, of course, recognized it
at once. âNow,â said the agister, âthis must
be stopped, or some rogues will give the gipsies
a bad name. Itâs your duty to prosecute the men
where I found the pony.â More he urged of
similar argument on old Finch, who heard him in
silence, and then flatly declined to take any proceedings
whatever, âI got the pony back, thanks
to ye; and much obleeged, Iâm sure. But I does
business with the gipsies, and most of âem are a
pretty good sort, and stick to their bargain. If I
prosecuted eâer a one of them, we should never get
on again. Iâm out for peace and quietness with
my neighbours, and I shanât let a pony come
between us.â And though the agister, having to
take an official view of the matter, protested, at
heart he felt there was much to be said for the
old manâs decision.

One wet afternoon towards the end of September,
the colt-hunter was in his stable mending some
harness. A yell from his youngest boy made him
jump, and he half-rose to see what was the matter,
but turned to his work again, as the boyâs little
sister let forth a shriek of delight. âUp to some
lark,â he muttered, then started, as both children
shouted at the top of their voices, âPeter!
Peter!â At the same instant the gate slammed,
the sound of a heavy boot was heard, and the man
tumbled outside, with the harness in his hand, to
find himself face to face with his eldest son in full
kit, tin hat, rifle and bandolier, and slung around
with billycans, etc., his boots still coated with
the white slime of the French hills.

âPeter!â âFather!â came out at one breath,
and as they grasped hands, their faces came together,
and they kissedâan odd thing, perhaps,
for forest men to do, but a son coming home from
the war unexpectedly was a thrilling moment, and
apt to break down even the reserve of a lifetime.
Peter, never forgotten for a single day, though
not always mentioned by his parents, suddenly
appearing, as if from the skies, was enough to
make his father gasp, unable to utter more than,
âWell, lad!â Then Mother, apprised, came
rushing forth, full of joy, and yet of wrath at not
being the first to salute her firstborn. She hugged
and kissed him until he begged for mercy. âThe
ladâs tired, Mother,â said the father; âletâs in,
soâs he can get his things off, and have a wash;â
and Peter wanted this last badly. How the
youngsters revelled in the tin hat and its dents,
while the father spent some time cleaning his sonâs
boots. âQuite a bit of France,â he said, as he
carefully swept the chalk off the bench into an
empty matchbox.

You should have seen Peter eat, when he got
among his motherâs tarts and cakes. It appeared
that he had the usual fourteen daysâ leave, of
which some time had already expired since he left
Havre. âWhat a shame!â exclaimed his mother.
âHowever, we wonât think of going away yet;â
and everyone was happy, though later on, as Peter
inquired for first one and then another of his old
schoolfellows, faces fell, and answer was made
sadly. After tea Peter felt a bit sleepy, so the
youngsters were sent off to play elsewhere, while
he stretched himself on a couch before the fire.
He had to be wakened for supper, but he didnât
mind, and said he would rather be called anything
than late for meals.

The next morning, of course, Peter wanted a
mount, and inquired what ponies were about.
âYou know the three in the stable,â said his
father; âand thereâs a blue roan mare in the
paddock, but sheâs not properly broken in yet, and
youâll find her rather skittish.â Whereupon
Peter, like a true forest lad, declared she would
be just the thing for him, and with the aid of his
two brothers, drove her into the yard and secured
her.

When he mounted in the paddock, the mare
treated him to a few plunges, which he did not
repress too sternly; and once out in the open,
went off at a great pace, her rider leaving her to go
where she listed, sure that she would keep away
from unsafe ground. But after letting off her
steam with a good run over the heavy ground, the
mare slackened her speed, and Peter could take
stock of the old familiar sights and sounds. Perhaps
the forest never looks so lovely as in autumn,
and especially when well soaked. The heather
still purpled the moorâa rich purplish-brown
flecked here and there with jewel-like pools. Towards
the uplands, and in the woods, the wet
bracken had changed its usual autumnal orange
for a rich sienna. Once Peter glimpsed a pony,
all deep chestnut, with mane and tail of the same,
a âself-colouredâ animal, hardly visible against
a bank of bracken. Only its movements betrayed
it, and then its foal, dark of hue, was discovered
where before it had been âlostâ in the obscurity
of a holly-brake.

Out in the open, the lad took all to his heart,
its beauty and its appeal. A green woodpecker
loped away from an ant heap where it had been
probing, and a covey of partridges scattered from
the ponyâs hoofs. The forest ponies, singly or in
groups, gave life and focus to the landscape, and
Peter saw that it was good.

Then as the mare started to run again, his hat
was twitched from his head by a holly-branch. He
reined the pony in, and essayed to pick up the hat
with his whip, but having no crook to the butt,
could not manage it. âHold on, old girl,â he
said, dismounting. But it was precisely at this
moment that Skewbald, now a three-year-old,
grazing at a little distance by himself, and feeling
lonely, gave vent to a loud call. The grey
whinnied, and began to move off, just as Peter
retrieved his hat, then, as he pulled on the reins,
she kicked sharply, getting the lad on the right
shin. There was a sharp crack, and Peter let go
the reins with a grunt, stood motionless a moment,
and then slithered gently to the ground. As he
did so and disturbed the broken leg, he shouted
with pain, and the mare, already making off, increased
her pace, the reins dangling from her
neck.

A girl was bowling along a forest road on a
bicycle. Joan Barton, V.A.D. nurse in the forest
hospital, had changed out of her uniform, and was
taking advantage of her spell off to get some open-air
exercise. She admitted to herself, as she spun
along, that her own Surrey commons, beautiful as
they are, could not compare in extent and wildness
with the forest. She noted how the road
wound, and led the eye over the moors and hills,
and what a fine surface mere sand and gravel
made, resilient and mudless in spite of recent heavy
rain. As the forest people say, the more it rains,
the better the going. Much better than in dry
weather, when the surface gets loose and covered
with stones.

Presently a grey pony, saddled yet riderless,
and standing by a dead tree a little from the road,
caught her eye.

She looked right and left for a rider, but saw
no one. Then, acting on an impulse, she got off
her bicycle, and went up to the pony. It moved
as she came close, and she saw that the reins were
held on a snag. âFunny way to tie up a pony,â
she said half-aloud; she knew something about
horses, and had acted as groom in a remount
stable while waiting for a vacancy in a hospital.

Some distance away was a herd of ponies
scattered over the moor. Among them she noticed
one patterned in bright chestnut and white, with
the passing thought, that she had not before seen
this striking coloration among all the forest pony
hues. She went to her bicycle and stood scrutinizing
the landscape, but she saw no one. Then her
attention was drawn to a patch of white like a
piece of paper dangling on a bush. But as she
looked she saw the white patch wave to and fro
like a flag, and with a sudden jump of the heart
she realized that it was a flag, and spelling out
letters. She knew the code, being an enthusiastic
leader of Girl Guides, and watched the flag spell
out the letters h-e-l-p. That was enough for Joan.
Close to where she stood, a pony track meandered
in the direction of the signal, and mounting her
bicycle she bumped along it, almost falling off in
her anxiety to watch the flag. It disappeared, but
again showed itself wagging to and fro, then
wavered and fell. She had to get off her bicycle,
and pushed it hurriedly along. There behind a bush
lay Peter, his face wrinkled with pain, yet full of
relief at the welcome sound of the girlâs approach.
He was the first to speak. âMorning, miss;â
and he made shift to smile. âMy pony got me
on the right tibia. But a clean fracture, I think.â
Peter got this out all in a breath. He had had
enough warning of the girlâs approach to concoct
his speech, and was rather proud of his knowledge
of anatomy picked up in the first-aid class. Joan
smiled too, pleased to find her new patient collected
and cheerful. âBeen here long?â she
asked. âNot more than an hour, miss. I live
over there,â he went on, âbut itâs a matter of
three or four miles away.â âAll right,â said
Joan, âbut your leg had better go in some sort
of splints before we can think of your being
moved.â

Then in response to a certain shade of anxiety
on Peterâs face, she added, âItâs all right, I wonât
hurt you more than I can help. Iâm a nurse at a
V.A.D. hospital.â âA nurse,â chortled Peter;
âit seems Iâm having all the luck.â

âWell,â she laughed, âit doesnât seem like it.
I donât think Iâll take the puttee off. Iâll look
for some stuff for splints.â She hunted round for
some straight sticks, and Peter lent her his great
knife, which he had to open for her, so that she
could remove the knots. Then she put on the
splints, using Peterâs other puttee. âDonât be
afraid to make a noise if I hurt you,â she said,
but Peter made no sign of pain except for a grunt
or two. As she worked she talked. âIt was
clever of you to signal,â she remarked. âCleverer
of you, miss, to see and understand,â responded
Peter; ââ¯âtwas a good job Mother put out white
hankies for me this morning. My khaki ones went
into the washtub.â

Joan told him of the grey pony on the hill, and
Peter recounted the cause of his accident. âHow
long, nurse, before Iâm able to go back?â he
asked.

âYouâll not be much use under two months.
Your stay in Blighty will be longer than you
expected.â

âWhatâll my sergeant say?â chuckled Peter.
Joan made a cushion of bracken for the injured
leg and put another armful under his head.
âNow,â she said, âIâll go back to the road for
help.â

âBut whatâs that, nurse?â exclaimed Peter,
and Joan also heard a manâs call. A moment later
a waggon laden with logs emerged from a wood,
some distance away, a man and a boy in attendance.
Joan ran across to them, and explained the
situation. âWhy, that must be young Peter,â
said the man; âI met him yesterday, all loaded
up, on his way home. Weâll do what we can,
miss, but our wood-waggon ainât no use, you see,
for itâs got no bottom. Whatâll we do about
shifting him on to the road?â

But the boy was not a Scout for nothing. This
was his moment, and he made the most of it.
âWhy, dad,â he said, âthatâs easy. You cuts
down two poles, and I gets them two sacks weâve
got on the seat, and makes holes in the corners.
Then we puts the poles through the holes to make
a stretcher, and carries him up to the road.â The
elders agreed that this was feasible, but without
enthusiasm, for fear of engendering pride in the
young.

The man got his axe and cut down two young
birches, remarking that he sâposed âtheyâ
wouldnât mind his cutting green wood for once,
while Joan and the boy prepared the sacks. When
the stretcher was ready, they laid it on the ground
beside Peter, and carefully placed him in it, packing
his legs and feet with bracken, so that the
injured limb should not be jolted.

Then the man taking the poles at the head, and
Joan and the boy a pole each at the other end,
they marched slowly up the hill, Peter insisting
on their keeping step, and giving an imitation of
his sergeantâs pronunciation. Once, as they
crossed a little forest bridge, he gave the order,
âBreak step,â but they refused, for fear of jarring
his leg, whereupon he promised them all C.B.

When nearly at the road, they heard the noise
of an approaching car, and all shouted together,
the boy nearly letting go in the excitement of the
moment. The driver both heard and saw. He
stopped, and matters were soon arranged. The
patient was carefully deposited in the car with
Joan as attendant. The boy was to go back to
fetch Joanâs bicycle and ride it to the hospital,
then, returning, would ride the grey mare back to
Peterâs home. Joan was much averse to this
arrangement, protesting that the pony had done
enough mischief already that day. But the boy
grinned, for he could ride anything in the forest
barebacked, and his family mantelpiece was
adorned with cups and trophies won in the forest
junior competitions. Remarking that he wouldnât
âcome to no harm,â he dashed down the hill
for the bicycle, while the man, after seeing that
the grey pony was properly tied, returned to his
waiting team.

Then came Armistice Day, or rather, in this
quiet corner of Britain, Armistice Night, for in
the forest was not to be seen such ebullition of
spirits as in Regent Street, where, for instance,
two middle-aged clergymen, with ribbons in their
clerical hats, danced along the pavement playing
tin whistle-pipes. But a great fire was to be lit
on the hill above Peterâs home, and all that afternoon
men and boys had been carting up logs and
branches gleaned from the woods.

Most of the local forest people were there, including
Tom, Molly, and the two small children.
Peter, now getting about with a stick, having discarded
his crutches, was sent up in the pony-trap,
the hill being deemed too steep for him.

When the fire died down and people were beginning
to disperse, a girl wheeling a bicycle
passed Peter and his family. Tom let out a shout:
âMiss Barton!â and she stopped. She had seen
Peter several times since he had left hospital;
indeed, he said his leg wouldnât get well unless
she continued to take a friendly interest in his case.
So she had paid visits, when not on duty, Peter
and she sitting in the porch, looking on to the
forest, talking and reading.

Peter was saying that the hill was too steep and
rough to cycle down at night, and his leg felt well
enough for him to walk down if Miss Barton would
lend him an arm in case he stumbled. Tom would
walk the bicycle down, which he was glad to do,
though directly he was out of sight he got on, and
nearly came a cropper avoiding some people going
home.

So Joan and Peter went down together, taking
a little path he knew of, and on the way they saw
the dim forms of ponies on either side, all with
heads down, browsing. Only one, the nearest,
looked up, and snorted as they passed. It was
Skewbald, and Peter suddenly found his tongue,
for neither he nor Joan had had much to say to
one another.

âWhy, thatâs the beggar that upset my applecart,â
he said, and proceeded to narrate for the
twentieth time how the call of the three-year-old
had caused his accident. Then with a flash of
inspiration he continued: âLucky for me that he
called when he did.â

âYes,â said Joan, though she felt in her bones
what was coming; âyou mean he got you a long
leave.â

âI mean,â declared Peter, though his heart
thumped, and he had a strange difficulty in articulating,
âthat if it hadnât happened, we might
never have met.â And so on, but as this is a tale
about ponies and not people, it will suffice to say
that before they reached the bottom of the hill,
they were Joan and Peter to one another, and that
soon after Peter was demobilized the wedding
took place.

The summer had been hot and rainless, and the
beginning of August found the moorland of the
forest drier than the oldest commoner had known
it. Boggy places which had formerly to be skirted
with care were now firm under foot. The tussock
grass was white and sear, the fern orange and
brown, while the leaves of the oaks were eaten
by myriads of caterpillars into delicate lace-like
filigree.

The blackberries withered without ripening,
except where they grew in the meadow bottoms,
still green, though the streams dwindled, until in
the gravelly, quick-running parts, there was
hardly enough water for the troutlets to scuttle
past into the deeper pools.

One midday, on the road between Southampton
and Lymington, a tramping sailor was resting by
the roadside. He lit his pipe, and being a careful
man, blew at the match before he threw it down.
Then he rose, and continued his journey. But
the end of the match still glowed, and the dry
grass in contact with it, fanned by the wind, began
to smoke, and then to ignite with a tiny flame,
which crawled along the ground, until it came to
the dry stump of a fir, its base littered with bits
of bark and dead branches. These sputtered, and
the fire began to spread. The wayfarer had passed
on unheeding, for he was facing the wind, and
therefore received no warning of what was happening
behind him.

Down under the big trees the colt-hunter and
his two boys were cutting the fern for stable
bedding. He had the right to get all he wanted,
though authority decreed that he was not to pick
and choose, not to cut only where the fern grew
thick and tall. He must clear his way steadily,
even where it was sparse and stunted. This year
it was pretty short everywhere. The man used a
scythe, the boys were armed with sickles. At
intervals they drew the fodder into small heaps
for carting.

The father straightened himself and sniffed.
âSeems like burning. Another heath fire, I
expect. Glad if it burnt up the gorse, but sometimes
it burns up other things.â âWhat things,
dad?â asked the younger boy. âTrees which we
want for firewood, and barns, ricks, and sometimes
homes. Run up the hill, sonny, and see if you can
make out whereabouts the fire is.â The boy did
not run; it was too hot. As he walked away, a
shrill whinny was heard, then repeated again and
again. âMy word!â exclaimed the man; âthat
pony is some excited. Seems as if it came from
the farm. Whatâs a forest stallion doing there?â
Just then in the quiet air a prolonged whistle was
heard. The father laid his scythe at the foot of a
tree. âCome on, Tom. Somethingâs the matter,
or mother wouldnât have blown the whistle.â It
was an agreed-on signal. Back the two went, and
the younger boy caught them up, saying he had
seen a great cloud of smoke, and it seemed right
over the house.

âNonsense,â said his father; âmore like five
miles away.â They walked quickly along the
forest avenue of gnarled oaks, tall beeches, and
odds and ends of hollies of no especial shape.
âLook at all those ponies outside the gate!â exclaimed
Tom. There was a restless, pawing, snorting,
whinnying troop of mares and youngsters,
but all with head over or turned towards the closed
gate. When the three reached the farm, they saw
Skewbald standing on the straw heap, surrounded
by pigs, poultry, and ducks. Mother was standing
at the garden gate with the baby in her arms. The
skewbald whinnied when he saw the arrivals and
stamped impatiently. The man sniffed again
and muttered: âThat fire seems closer than I
thought. Howâd he get in?â he called. âHe
jumped it,â his wife replied. âI saw him.â

They opened the gate, and the ponies surged
in after them. Tom ran to slide back the big
door, and had just time to flatten himself against
the wall, when Skewbald thundered past, followed
by the herd, right across the meadow to the ford,
which they crossed. Then they turned, faced the
wind, and snuffed the air.

âBoys,â the father was saying, âthis fire must
be nearer than we want. The smokeâs getting
thicker every minute. Both of you get a broom,
and letâs get beyond the wood.â

The homestead was enclosed to the south-west
by groves of hollies and a plantation of firs. If
these began to burn, sparks might set the thatched
roof and hayricks on fire. Beyond the wood was
a level tract of heather and gorse. The fire might
not have caught this, and there might yet be time
to stop it spreading to the wood. When they got
beyond the trees, the gorse bushes at the far end
of the open space were burning with a loud crackling,
and on the ground a line of smoke, with here
and there a sputter of flame, showed that the fire
was crawling towards them.

Then commenced a fight with the advancing
enemy, in the face of sparks and thick, pungent
smoke. The boys worked bravely, but the wind
fanned the embers, and, often, after they had
beaten down the flames they had to run back, and
put out a fresh outburst. Then, where the grass
and heather was longer, the fire began to burn
more vigorously.

âGet back, boys; weâll wait and fight it where
itâs shorter,â said the father. âHooray!â Tom
exclaimed; âhere they come!â First a man on
a pony, then a boy on a bicycle, two more friendly
helpers in a trap, all coming to help as fast as they
could; and later, a motor-car from the big house
on a hill miles away, and crammed with helpers,
hooted its arrival.

Some had brooms or beaters, and some took
branches, but all fell to with a will, yet as
they worked, the cloud of smoke seemed to get
blacker and heavier. Instead of mounting into
the sky like a pillar of cloud, it hung about their
heads until they could hardly breathe. The sky
became black, and still the fire defied their efforts.

A boy looked up and yelled, âRain!â He had
felt a drop on his face. Someone felt another, but
they were not leaving anything to chance, and
smacked steadily away at the smouldering
herbage.

Then the rain began to come down steadily until
everyone had a wet shirt. When the danger was
over the volunteers began to move off, saying they
must be going, in spite of entreaties to come back
to the farmstead. They knew that the wife with
her baby would be sore put to it to entertain so
many. But one or two who lived farther off were
persuaded to come along, and to these the colt-hunter
expatiated a dozen times on the fortunate
circumstance of the ponies running from the fire,
and taking the road through the wood to the farm.
As Tom said, the skewbald rang the firebell for
them.

Skewbald, now a four-year-old, had in late
August succeeded to the leadership of the company
with which he had been running. The
stallion which had lorded it over the herd had
been âcaught in,â and Skewbald had stepped
into his place as the acknowledged superior of the
young males. It was destined to be a temporary
supremacy, for, as a skewbald, he could not be
welcomed as a breeding stallion; his coloration
was too pronounced. Self-coloured browns and
bays were considered to be truer to the forest type.
Skewbaldâs lot was to be that of a pit pony.

No young stallion challenged him to battle
twice, for Skewbald possessed, besides strength,
a spirit, a quickness of movement together with a
power of deciding rapidly, and when roused, a
fighting temper which boded ill for an enemy.

As a future pit pony he had the merit of not
being too tall, but he was perfectly proportioned,
and his carriage and ease of movement proclaimed
his fitness as an instrument of strength and speed.

Patterned as he was in bold chestnut and cream-white,
his coat did not show the high lights
rippling over the muscles of a bay or black, but the
slinging of his barrel between his shoulders and
flanks, the arch of his neck and withers, the action
of his fore-legs, and the tension of his hocks,
marked him as beyond the ordinary.

His mane, very bushy, and like his tail waved
as with a ladyâs curling-irons, was white nearly to
the regions of his ears, where it turned to chestnut
with an intervening streak of purplish-black. His
long, ample tail, carried in a drooping curve, was
white above and dark below. His on-side had one
great chestnut patch covering most of his barrel
and flank, and extending below the hock. From
a distance, this side was deceptive, because the
great brown blotch looked like a pony standing
end on. The offside had the neck and face chestnut,
and a spot of the same on his barrel smaller in
area than on the other side, and leaving his hind-leg
white.

But although he looked and acted like a born
leader, kept the yearlings and two-year-olds in
their places, rounded up the mares and saw that
all were on the move when the herd was changing
quarters, and, last but not least, glanced continually
round the horizon for enemies in the shape of
agisters or other colt-hunters, it must not be supposed
that he decided all the movements of his
company.

Some of the mares were years older than he, and
knew the forest infinitely betterâthe grassy lawns
and bottoms, the bare âplains,â wind-swept in
hot weather, and the great woods with sheltered
recesses in drenching rain. So they, as a rule,
took the initiative and decided when to move and
where to go. But the direction once indicated,
Skewbald took charge and acted as convoy.

In the herd was an old rusty-black mare with
white forehead blaze and off hind-sock. She had
been broken in for riding and was shod, as might
be seen by her footprints, the imprint of the
double line of the shoe showing out among the
single, nearly circular curves of the unshod
ponies.

In her time she had assisted in the âcatching
inâ of many a pony, and now that she was again
in the forest, although she had lost the timidity
of the uncaught beasts, she made up for this by
the wiliness of one who knew the ways of man.
Time and time again the colt-hunters wished her
far away, when they found her in company with
ponies they wanted. They might manÅuvre the
group at a gentle trot across the moor, but just as
they approached a tempting open gateway, the
mare would check, toss her head, snort, and break
away at a gallop, followed by the rest, in spite of
shouts and cracking of whips.

She was also a persistent wanderer, a âlane
haunter,â âlane creeperâ or âromeoâ (an
atrocious Forest pun)âthat is, a pony which
escapes from the forest into the lanes to munch
the sweet grass of the hedgerows. This is considered
one of the worst vices in a forest pony,
because she leads others with her. Then the
agister may impound the culprits, and the owners
have to pay for any depredations, as fence-breaking
and crop-spoiling, that may have been committed.
Prizes are offered for well-bred ponies
in good condition, but are likely to be withheld
unless the agister certifies that the selected beasts
are no âlane haunters.â Some think that the
introduction of alien blood has brought into
existence a type of animal unsuited to the rigours
of the forest, too delicate to flourish on the meagre
fare, and therefore inclined to wander away in
search of richer food.

By a mischance, the mareâs last foal had died
soon after birth, and because of this, perhaps, she
was this season unsettled, restless, and still more
inclined to wander. The summer, too, had been
hot and dry, so the forest pasturage was meagre
and scanty, the ponies having to search continually
for their fare.

Whereas a herd keeps usually within an area of
four or five square miles, this mare, whether owing
to the above reasons or her innate tendency to
wander, during this season kept the company on
the move by her restlessness and persistence, so
that without hurry, or causing fatigue to the
youngest, and feeding as they went, the forest
was explored from end to end. She was Skewbaldâs
favourite mare; when she went ahead, he
followed, and the herd fell in behind, in the usual
column of route.

She knew the forest roads and lanes both as a
riding pony and a âlane creeper,â the short-cuts,
the hunting bridges, the deep recesses of the
woods, and the narrow winding pony paths across
the upland âplains,â as if she had the ordnance
map in her head.

After whiling away a hot afternoon cooling
their fetlocks at Potterne Ford, the herd spent
the evening on Blackdown near the great round
barrow, and in the early morning, before dawn,
the mare led the way southward over bare ridge
and through thick woods, until coming out on
the Beaulieu road they found the manor gate left
open by a sleepy carter, and trooped down in the
early morning, past Beaulieu Abbey gateway,
pausing at the margin of the beautiful estuary
with its wooded banks, and yachts anchored at
the bend. All was quiet except for the yelping
of a few black-headed gulls questing for food
among the pools, fringed with tawny seaweed left
by the tide.

Skewbald advanced to sample the water, then
snorted with disgust, and retreated, driving his
company on to the road again. The old mare had
a good drinking-place in mind, and led them
up the street until they were stopped by Hatchet
Gate. The gatekeeper, just getting up, heard the
clatter of hoofs. âMore lane haunters,â she
said; âI must let them into the forest again, or
they will get into trouble.â She hastened down,
the herd passed through, trotted on to Hatchet
Pond and slaked their thirst.

They spent some days on the great aerodrome
of Beaulieu Heath, whence, in the days of war,
the aeroplanes buzzed on their way across Blackdown
to attack an imaginary enemy plane marked
as a cross of white gravel on the ground. Now all
was quiet, rows of huts and buildings stood silent
and deserted. The lane creeper took the road
again and led the troop towards Lymington.
Down the hill they went, past the monument to
the gallant admiral of the many virtues duly set
forth, and hesitated at the toll-bridge, where the
collector, waiting awhile to see if any human was
following with the toll dues, drove them back.
They turned up the road bordering the left bank
of the Lymington River, and soon found themselves
in the forest again, but on the other side,
for they forded the river, went over Sandy Down
and crossed the Brockenhurst road, where a sorrel
mare nearly lost her foal, which insisted on nosing
a chunk of bread oblivious of a charabanc of excursionists.
They scattered over Setley Plain,
where are the two tumuli with intersecting rings,
and crossing under the railway, wandered about
the uplands above Sway, with its tall tower, a
landmark visible far out to sea. Here, sunning
themselves by a narrow forest railway bridge,
they encountered another herd, a mere group,
with that rarest of forest poniesâa white stallionâin
charge. He was white, of course, because
of his age; his backbone stood up and his ribs
showed; but though he snuffed the air, there was
no trouble, for the old fellow had no thought of
showing fight, nor was this the season for dissension.
All Skewbald wanted, for his part, was to
get his company over the bridge, and when the
others understood this, they made way willingly
enough.

The wanderers straggled with many stoppages
over the great open moors and uplands of the
Rhinefield Walk. In the forest a âwalkâ is not
a pathway, but a district of several square miles,
formerly presided over by a ranger, an office now
abolished.

They crossed Black Knowl, forded the pretty
stream gurgling over its gravelled bed, and were
soon cropping the fine greensward of beautiful
Balmer Lawn. Here Skewbald had a tussle with
a young iron grey who thought the lawn belonged
to him. After a short passage of arms, Skewbald
disabused him of this notion, and the youngster
retired hurriedly.

The herd wandered through the picturesque
drives leading from the lawn, and drank at the
little pond on the golf-links, set like a jewel on
the breast of the moor.

The young grey stallion had some cause for
jealousy, for Skewbald noticed a white mare with
a great blotch of jet black on her neck and fore-quarters,
and she took his eye, being spotted himself;
but she refused to leave her beloved pastures;
she was no wanderer, and never had been known
to stray more than half a mile from her birthplace,
a field by the lawn.

Then rain came at last, and the mare crossed
the river again and led her party into the woods.
They wandered through the glade of the Queen
Bower, with its great beeches, crossed the Blackwater,
and so into the thick woods of Vinney
Ridge. Here they had a fright one midday, for
the baying of hounds, tootling of horns, and
tramping of hoofs dismayed all but the old mare,
who had often ridden with the buck-hounds. She
led her party, which were inclined to scatter,
down a drive away from the noise. Later in the
week the rain ceased, and leaving the woods, they
crossed the Ober and slowly climbed the hill to
Wilverley Post, the young foals even daring to
rub themselves against the âNaked Manââa
dead tree reduced to a bare trunk and a couple
of armlike branches stretched out imploringly.
Here they crossed the black tarred road between
Southampton and Bournemouth. It was Sunday
afternoon and the cars were almost in procession,
so numerous were they, the noisy little sidecar
predominating; but the ponies took small account
of wheels. Horns might blow and chauffeurs
curse, but the mares, and especially the foals,
were not to be hurried. As the herd crossed head
to tail, so that there was not room for even a
motor-cycle to pass, the road looked like Piccadilly
at its narrowest part, when the policemen
stop the traffic. All sorts of cars were there,
from Fords to a Rolls-Royce; great charabancs
full of trippers, who threw crumpled paper balls
at the ponies to hurry them up, but without avail,
and the drivers, remembering the warning signs
put up by the R.S.P.C.A., had to curb their
impatience until the last foal had crossed.

The ponies spread themselves over Clay Hill,
went down into the bottoms and up by the steep
road from Holmsley Station into Burley, and
drank at the pond fringed with hollies, on the
golf-links, where one Christmas the scarlet berries
hid the leaves, as the golfers, if they notice such
things, can testify.

They cropped the lawn outside the school,
until the noise of the children coming out sent
them into the woods. They missed Burley,
fortunately, for one of the old forest pounds
stands close by, crossed the road at Vereley,
passed the gipsy encampment, and then reaching
another black road leading to Ringwood, spread
out over the open ground of Picket Post, one of
the finest spots in the forest, because of its altitude
and its views towards the sea. Here one can
see clearly the flanks of the forest hills rising from
the level bottom like hills out of a lake. The
ponies munched the sweet grass on the lawn with
its beautiful little tumulus crowned with hollies,
but unfortunately dwarfed by the great modern
house close by.

Then the unsatisfied maternal instincts of the
old mare surged up within her, an irresistible
impulse to action, and she did what horses, dogs,
and other animals will doâset her face towards
her birthplace. She had been born at Brook, and
old memories of her present surroundings may
have suggested to her the route to the village.
At any rate, the herd were soon travelling slowly
to the north-east. Over Handy Cross Plain they
went, through Kingâs Garden and so to Stoney
Cross, where, from the hill leading down to the
dell of the Rufus Stone, one gets the fine view
across to Brook and beyond.

The mare wandered about several days visiting
the haunts of her youth; then again her
loss came upon her, and she started off across
country, for the spot where last she had seen
her foal.

All this time the wanderings of the ponies had
not been unnoted. People owning ponies had
seen them here and there, and in passing a friendâs
house would call and remark, âI saw your chestnut
mare over by Castle Malwood the other day,â
or the owner of Skewbald might be greeted with,
âYour four-year-old seems a bit of a wanderer.â
If the herd strayed on to a public road where
the agisters might catch them, and involve their
owners in expense, a forest man would spend a
little time chivying them back into the forest.
So they had committed no damage in their fleeting
disappearances from the forest proper. They
had not been impounded, and apparently they
were free as air, yet the owner of any pony there,
with a little trouble and inquiry, could ascertain
its whereabouts and could get it either personally
or by deputy.

The herd came back over Emery Down, the
great gaps in its wooded sides showing where the
Canadian gangs had cleared the timber during
the war. Cleared it in a lazy way, the forest
men remarked, for instead of bending to cut
the tree at its base, they had left many stumps
waist-high. But then, timber is cheap in the
West.

Missing Lyndhurst, by devious ways the ponies
came out on the golf-links, where a yearling got
a smack on the flank from the ball of an impatient
golfer. They crossed the road, and tried the
sweet grass of Pondhead. It was a bright Saturday
afternoon, and a boy with a camera, catching
sight of Skewbald, tried for a snapshot. He
stalked him backwards and forwards, manÅuvring
for a good pose and lighting, until the stallion got
suspicious and annoyed. Disdaining the bridge,
he jumped the streamlet, mounted the hill a few
paces, and called loudly. The mares, not unmindful
of the intruder with his flashing camera,
understood. Without undue haste they gathered
their foals, crossed the little bridge and took the
path up the hill, Skewbald standing sentinel until
he saw they were all on the move, then, pressing
forward, he overtook the head of the column, and
led the way.

Soon there was a quarter of a mile of ponies of
all colours, following the meanderings of the
path, the mares with lowered heads, foals trotting
to left and right. Last of all went an old white
mare with a black sucker silhouetted against her
side. It was a pretty picture. Even in the distance
the energetic action of Skewbald could be
noted; his tossing mane proclaimed him the
leader. It was a picture, and the boy could not
help snapping it, although he knew the distance
was too great.

The old mare no longer led the way, for the
herd had reached its home pasturage. Indeed,
Skewbaldâs owner had already noted his return.
The ponies crossed the road looking down on
Longwater, and passed a night among the lush
bottoms. The next day they wandered eastwards
over Matley Heath. As they approached
the railway embankment to cross under the forest
viaduct, they passed an area of a few acres, which
would have looked strangely familiar to millions
of men of military age. During the war the
trench mortar force had used the place as a training-ground,
and at every few yards a hole gaped,
several feet across and a yard deep.

It was early in September, and Skewbaldâs
owner, who had seen him only once during the
summer, but had had reports of his having been
found in various parts of the forest from agisters
and keepers, decided that he would âcatch inâ
the four-year-old, and get a good price for him
as a pit pony. He settled to do the job himself,
and, with two neighbours who volunteered
to give up a Saturday afternoon, started off in
the direction where the herd had been seen last.
It was fine and clear (âvisibility very goodâ),
and Skewbald was plainly in view more than a
mile away. The ponies were scattered along a
ridge above a narrow valley, the floor of which
was largely occupied by a deep bog.

It was decided to keep out of sight as long as
possible, and come at the stallion from over the
hill, in the hope that he could be driven down to
the bog and surrounded.

But if the horsemen could see Skewbald at a
distance, because of his bold colouring, he could
detect them by reason of his good sight, and
though they had apparently gone right away, he
remained uneasy, marching from one mare to
another. Presently he heard the muffled beat of
hoofs on turf, and called loudly to his companions.
When the three hunters reached the crest of
the hill and looked down, Skewbald and several
mares, with their offspring, were trotting away
towards the head of the valley.

There was nothing for the hunters to do but to
go for it at their best speed. Skewbald, they
knew, like any stallion true to his herd, would not
leave the mares, if he could help it. When they
tired was the chance to get him. But as the
horsemen galloped, the trot of the fugitives
changed to the quicker step also, and though the
riders gained on the herd, Skewbald was always
on the far side, protected, as it were, by the
column of mares, foals, and younger ponies.

Some of the foals soon stopped, and, with their
mothers, fell out of the chase. The other mares
and youngsters carried on, and the pursuit went
on along the ridge, until the bog was turned, and
Skewbald led the way back on the other side.
Then the ponies with him began to slacken, and
the pursuersâ hopes ran high, but Skewbald increased
his speed, and leaving his fatigued company,
galloped on alone. Some little distance
ahead, the bog narrowed considerably, and here a
causeway of gravel had been constructed. Along
this the stallion dashed, and ascended the hill to
where the rest of his leaderless herd had collected.
They began to move as he approached, and
stretching into a gallop, they went with him, this
time down the valley, and being untired, began
to increase the distance from their pursuers.
âHang it!â cried the owner; âwhen these
are tired, and he gets to the other lot after
theyâve breathed, he may keep this up all the
evening.â

Then things happened. One of the riders
essayed to cut off a corner by crossing a marshy
bit. His pony hesitated, and when struck, put
her feet together and shot her rider into the bog.
The others halted, and with shouts of laughter,
watched the muddy figure thrashing about, then,
as he sank deeper, hastily took measures to help
him out. They tossed him a rope and fastened
their end to one of the ponies. Then chaffing
him about keeping his legs straight, they shouted,
âHold tight, Jim!â and setting the pony going,
out came the man with a great squelch. âWell,â
said Jim, as he looked at himself ruefully, âmy
own fault entirely. I ought to have known better
than beat a forest pony baulking at boggy
ground.â

It was getting late, and Skewbald was out of
sight. They decided to abandon the chase and
try again another day.

Then the rain came, filling the bogs and flooding
the streams, and the ponies, according to their
habit, left the open moorlands for the woods,
where they were invisible, save to the forest
keepers, clad in khaki with brass buttons bearing
the crown and stirrup, the latter device derived
from the gigantic stirrup hanging in the court hall
at Lyndhurst.

Skewbaldâs owner made inquiries. A keeper
had seen the stallion in a great wood of oaks and
beeches. The next Saturday afternoon the three
riders again set off. The rain had ceased, and the
sun shone, although the going was heavy. In
the woods the forest paths were churned into
quagmires, but on pony-back it does not matter
if the forest be a bit damp. The ponyâs legs get
the mud.

Skewbaldâs company were grazing in the open,
but in the shelter of the wood, bordered with
groves of silver birches. From afar the hunters
thought out a plan of action. âBest go back,â
said one, âand come at them from behind.
Pâraps we can drive them down the moor and
away from the woods.â As the riders, after a
long detour, were approaching their quarry,
having got almost to the confines of the wood,
a party of jays set up a clamour. âNo use going
quietly now,â grumbled the leader; âbetter
push on as fast as we can.â The ponies had heard
the raucous noise of the jays, and then the trample
of hoofs. When the hunters emerged from the
wood, they were in time to see the last of the herd
dashing in among the trees, hundreds of yards
ahead.

âCome on, lads,â was the cry, and the pursuers
did their best to overtake the fugitives,
who had chosen their country with skill, for they
had fled into a great wood with plenty of undergrowth,
and trees so thick that no background of
sky gave the ponies away. Hollies grew in dense
masses, and clinging honeysuckle and brier impeded
progress. Quick going was impossible, and
every dense brake had to be examined for a lurking
beast. Mares and colts they overtook, and
once they thought they had found Skewbald, but
it was an old white mare running among the trees.
As they got nearer the river, the wood grew wilder
and more difficult, while their ponies sunk below
the fetlocks in the soft stuff. âLetâs go into the
drive and see if we can head them off,â suggested
a faint-hearted one. In the sticky drive were
more ponies, but no Skewbald. With the old
black mare he was sheltering behind a thick clump
of hollies, ready, if he heard the riders approaching,
to move quietly off.

Night came on and the riders gave up the chase in
disgust, vowing that they had had the worst of luck.

After this, the services of the colt-hunter were
sought. He listened to the tale of Skewbaldâs
evasions. âSeems a speedy one, and artful.
Iâll get him, never fear.â

The next morning, the colt-hunter, going out
to shoot a rabbit for dinner, was delighted to see
Skewbald with his mares, placidly wandering on
the moor outside his holding. The rabbit must
wait, and he returned to collect his two helpers
and get the ponies ready. When the three were
mounted, he sent the boy and girl by a circuitous
route to get behind the herd. He himself rode
through the gate which opened on the moor, and
went towards the woods, as being the most
difficult part of the country.

Presently, as he watched the herd, he saw the
stallion raise his head, and a moment later Tom
appeared on the ridge beyond the moor, and came
down the hill at a trot. Skewbald called to his
mares, and set off at a gallop towards the far end
of the moor, where it was crossed by the stream.
The man saw the herd rapidly dwindling in the
distance, and noted with satisfaction that the boy
made no attempt to rush the fugitives, but contented
himself with trotting along the edge of the
moor in the direction they had taken. âSaving
his mount,â the father muttered, and then heard
faint sounds in the distance, which he knew came
from Molly, who had crossed the stream, and with
shouts and gestures was stopping the fugitives.
The ponies halted; then, as their new pursuer
rode at them, they turned, and fled in the opposite
direction. Skewbald had an eye to the hill, its
summit covered with trees, but Tom on guard
saw a suggestion of breaking away, and stopped
it with waving arms and fiendish yells. As the
ponies, apparently free from strenuous pursuit,
slackened to a trot, the colt-hunter met them,
and turning them, quietly followed. Tom and his
sister closed in, and the ponies, in an invisible
net, were shepherded towards the gate, left wide
open. Skewbald, restless and suspicious, turned
and faced the riders gently trotting towards him
at some distance. This left the old âlane
haunterâ in front, and as she approached the
opening, she shied, and broke away, keeping near
the hedge, where there was no rider to forestall
her. The herd turned also, and prepared to
follow, but an unexpected intervention checked
them. The two smallest children had been
awakened by the bustle of getting the ponies
ready, and guessed what was afoot. They had
not been asked to help, but thinking there might
be some fun, they dressed, slipped out, and hid
in the hollies a hundred feet from the gate. As
the mare came towards them they darted out,
and, brandishing sticks, rushed at the herd, meanwhile
letting off blood-curdling shrieks. The old
mare, indeed, used to children, brushed past, but
the ponies following were brought to a standstill,
and as the youngsters jumped into the air, their
arms and legs going all ways at once, making of
themselves frantic instruments of movement and
sound, the nerves of the ponies failed them, Skewbald
turning tail with the rest, and the three
riders, closing in, had no difficulty in passing their
quarry through the gate and into the paddock.
âWell done, kids!â called the father. âClose
the gate! Letâs ride âem into the yard before
they know where they are.â But Skewbald had
turned after passing through the gate, and the
herd was now at the far end of the field. The
hunters tried all ways to get the ponies into the
stable yard, but in vain; they tore past the inviting
opening, but enter they would not. Then
the mare left outside, hearing the trampling of
hoofs, and feeling lonely, gave a loud whinny.
Skewbald caught it amid the noise of tumult. He
broke from the herd, dashed across the field,
through the gravelly ford, then, as he neared the
gate, collected himself, cleared it at a bound, and
joined his partner.

âMy word!â exclaimed the colt-hunter, with
a rueful laugh. âCanât that skewbald jump!
One of you open the gate so that the other ponies
can get back into the forest again. All our
trouble for nothing. Well, weâd better go and
have breakfast.â

The colt-hunter began to fear that his old skill
was deserting him, for in spite of his efforts, the
four-year-old was not yet in the stable yard. At
the first opportunity, the man went out again, this
time alone. The old mare gave the alarm, on
seeing him, and the whole herd was soon trotting
away from their pursuer, who, as they were going
directly from his open gate, refrained from pressing
them too closely, hoping that he might be
able to turn them before long. But the mare led
the way right across the open ground towards the
river where it flowed between densely wooded
banks. They entered the wood, and the pursuer
increased his pace, for in such country unridden
ponies can move much more quickly than a rider.
Directly he got into the deep wood, he had to
twist, and break back for feasible routes, and go
slowly for fear of being wiped off his seat by a
branch. He passed several of the ponies, but
they were not what he sought, and as he got
deeper in the recesses of the wood, he became
puzzled. After some tedious wandering, scratched
and torn by holly, brier, and bramble, he confessed
himself at a loss. âThey may have crossed
the stream again,â he considered. âThis thick
stuff is the worst of all to find him in. I wish I
had my old dog.â Nell had had to be destroyed,
after an accident, but when in her prime had
shown a capacity for following the fugitives as
they threaded through the woods, and on reaching
them, by barking loudly, indicated their
position to the pursuers. The man gave up the
chase reluctantly, promising himself to try again.

He did so the next evening with his boy and
girl. The herd was in sight a mile down the moor.
âWhen we get near them,â said the father, âwe
must hustle, and head them off from the woods.â
But the ponies took the alarm at sight of the
riders, and the old mare, without waiting for the
chase to become hot, set off at full speed for the
woods, followed by Skewbald and a few other
ponies. âWe shall lose them,â said the colt-hunter,
and sure enough, after much wandering
and thrashing the woods, darkness set in, and the
hunters returned, weary and empty-handed.

Again and again they tried to head off Skewbald
from his protector. The mare, from being
disturbed, got so nervous that, at the first sight
of the hunters, she would dart for the coverts,
followed by Skewbald. The colt-hunter cudgelled
his brains in vain for a plan to secure the stallion,
and began to sigh for the good old days when the
forest men, mounted and blowing horns, encircled
a wide area, then with outcry and galloping,
drove all the ponies grazing therein into a
great pound. But, as he said, that would have
made an end of his bread and cheese.

The sun, breaking through the mist of a September
morning, shone on a grassy knoll by a
great wood, where a man was cooking his breakfast.
He was tall, ruddy, with a clear-cut profile
and black hair cut close at the back. He wore a
soft shirt, breeches, and stout boots. His wide-brimmed
hat, jacket, and a towel hung on a bush
close by. As he made his preparations he whistled
âThe Star-Spangled Banner.â

Breakfast in the woods presupposes camping;
no tent, however, showed itself, but a few paces
off was an erection in the form of a lean-to, of
dead branches interlaced with brushwood, and the
whole well thatched with heather and bracken.
Looking up from within, no peep of sky could be
seen; the shack was, in fact, watertight.

The breakfast utensils were placed on a newspaper
spread on the turf. A fire of sticks crackled
in a hollow. Three aluminium saucepans were on
the fire, and the man was stirring porridge in one.
âNearly ready,â he muttered; ânow for the
bacon.â He opened a package, took out two
rashers, placed them in a small frying-pan, took
the porridge-pan off the fire, removed the detachable
handle and fitted the latter to the frying-pan,
which he placed on the fire, now a mass of
glowing embers.

Then he found sugar, poured in milk from an
aluminium milk-can, and ate his porridge out of
the pan while watching the rashers. When these
were turned, he took an egg from each of two
egg-shaped aluminium cases, broke the shells,
and poured the contents on the rashers. When
cooked to a turn, he took the frying-pan off the
fire, and ate the bacon and eggs out of it. Then
one of the remaining saucepans boiled, and he
made coffee. The bread and coffee he took out
of waterproof bags, butter from a small aluminium
box. His first course had been of blackberries
picked from a bush near by. Blackberries are not
plentiful in the New Forest, but occasionally they
are found of a size and lusciousness rarely equalled
elsewhere.

After finishing his breakfast, he took out a
cigar, and began to smoke. As he mused he
talked to himself for company. âGuess this is
some quiet spot: not many birds except woodpeckers,
jays, stonechats, and meadow-pipits,
though I saw a whinchat, a redstart, and two
wheatears yesterday. But I expect they were on
migration. Nothing much to be heard in English
woods after the first week in June. And except
for the kingfisher, they canât hold a candle for
colour against our cardinals and bluebirds.

âAnd no beasts worth mentioning. No bears,
wolves, moose, or porcupines, and only rarely
one sees a fox or a hedgehog. Of course, the deer
show themselves now and then, and there are
always the ponies. A viper here and there, perhaps,
but no rattlers.

âWell, thank goodness, there are no mosquitoes,
and however warm it is, the heat doesnât
amount to much. And the views! Superb!
That walk over Emery Down was delightful. I
wish Sadie was here. Plenty of room in that shack,
and how she would enjoy it. Hard lines, marrying,
and having to leave oneâs wife almost on the
church step.â Here he broke off, and took out
a letter, which he read as one does when there is
no need to hurry, turning back occasionally to
earlier passages, though the letter already seemed
well thumbed. Then he replaced the missiveâwhich
was a long one, and called forth a smile
now and thenâin its envelope, and set himself to
wash up, grumbling at the tenacity of the
remnant of porridge; for once he had forgotten to
fill the pan with water. The bacon rinds and
crumbs he left for any furred or feathered epicures
which might be about; the egg-shells, tea-leaves,
and other rubbish he put down a hole.

Then he began to pack. He had no blankets,
heavy and not too efficient conservators of heat.
His only bed covering was an eiderdown quilt,
which went into marvellously small compass. He
had no less than three air-pillowsâa tiny one for
his head, one in the form of a ring for his hip, and
a pleated one for his shoulder. These and a pair
of plimsolls, with his sleeping suit, went into his
ground-sheet, which he rolled into a long bundle
round a light fishing-rod, with a strap attached to
either end so that he could sling it like a rifle.

The other details of his equipmentâbath and
bucket, of the thinnest and lightest material,
which had been emptied of water and hung up to
dry; milk-can, collapsible cup, plates, saucepans,
each of which he wrapped in paper before putting
one within the other, not forgetting to place the
handle insideâwent into his waterproof knapsack
with food-bag, tins, etc. In a little bag he
put comb, brush, and mirror, all of diminutive
proportions, from which the greater part of the
handles had been removed, in order to reduce
weight, for this was a walking tour, where every
ounce makes a difference. Even a pocket Primus
would have added too much to the burden of the
day. And in the forest, firewood is plentiful.

Once he ceased packing and raised a tiny prism
glass of the most recent pattern, which was slung
round his neck, quickly to his eye, in order to
identify a passing bird. âHave learned quite a
lot about English birds,â he said to himself.
âWhen I go back I shall be able to tell the
Western Reserve Ornithological something about
the English warblers. The nightingaleâs song is
very fine, Iâll admit, especially at night, but give
me the blackcap in clear daylight. He beats the
band.â

When everything was packed, he turned towards
the shack. âBetter leave it as it is,â he
muttered; âI might come back this way and put
in another night.â

As he turned into the woodland path, the
bushes parted and a man dressed in tattered khaki
emerged. He carried a coil of rope over his
shoulder and in his hand a stout cudgel. âGot
the time on ye, sir?â he asked. The camper took
out a gold watch. âI make it nine oâclock. But
I should have thought that you forest men were
in no need of watches with the sun shining.â
âOh, ay!â muttered the man in khaki evasively.
âAh, whatâs this?â he exclaimed, pointing to
the shack. âSleeping rough? Why, thatâs
punishable at the magistratesâ court,â he added
with a grin. âNot at all,â said the other. âI
have my permission, duly signed from Lyndhurst,
to camp in the forest, also a licence to fish in the
streams, although up to the present Iâve caught
nothing but minnows. This is how we camp out
West. Saves lugging a tent about.â âOh,â
said the man in khaki, âyou be an Amurrican;
I thought so, by your twang. What puzzles me,â
he continued, âis why you should be tramping
about here. Most of the Yankees at Winchester
never set foot in the forest. They see it all from
the car. But,â with a sneer, âpâraps you canât
afford it?â The American noticed, but answered
with a smile: âWhy, friend, I could afford it
very well, but all my life I have loved open spaces
and fresh air, and I like to do things for myself.
I am what you might call a cattle-farmer, and
have a ranch in the West.â

âIndeed,â said the other, âand how many
cattle might ye own?â âWell, I am not sure,
anyway,â answered the American, âbut I suppose,
if things are going all right, that my men
have charge of 10,000 head of stock.â âWell,
Iâm ââ,â exclaimed his questioner. âAnd to
think, if youâre worth all that money, you care
to sleep on damp ground with a bit of brushwood
overhead.â

âI said just now,â laughed the other, âthat
Iâm used to outdoor life. When I came over with
my regiment, we were sent to the camp at Winchester.
You know that city?â and the other
nodded. He did not deem it necessary to say that
the last stay he put in there was in the city gaol.
âWell, I got interested in this locality, because
there seemed room to move in it, as there is at
home; and in my spare time I used to come down
here and look about me. Then one afternoon
when I was sitting in the cathedral, while
hundreds of our men, from all over the States,
were being taken round in parties to see the
sights, I had some talk with a man and a boy who
looked in. They were cycling with camping
luggage, and were to spend a holiday in the forest.
I guess they were some novices, for I went outside
to see them off. Never saw such poor, ill-used,
overladen bicycles before or since. Afterwards
I got my knock in the big push, and they
sent me to the hospital at Brockenhurst, where
I saw more of the forest. Just now family
business is keeping me in London, so I thought I
would spend a few days down here, in my own
way.â

The man in khaki became effusive. He thrust
out a dirty tattered sleeve. âWe ought to be
pals, mister. See my wound stripes? Wipers,
Loos. Been through the lot and glad to be back
for good. I suppose you canât raise a drink for a
pore comrade? You gentlemen generally have
a whisky-flask on you.â

âNo, my friend,â replied the American.
âYouâll find no intoxicating liquor in this outfit.
Iâm a prohibitionist, what you call a teetotaller.â
Then, as waves of incredulity, derision, and horror
crossed the otherâs face, he added: âYouâll find
a lot more of us across the Pond. And now,
friend,â he continued, âIâve told you as much
about myself as if you were an agister, as I think
you call him. Why do you appear, like a jack-in-the-box,
and so anxious to know the time?â

âNot much of an agister,â grumbled the man.
âMiserable cusses, I calls âem, interfering with
a pore manâs living. I comes from Romsey way,
but settled down here since the war. A suspicious
lot,â he added surlily. âI drives cattle, carts
wood, breaks in horses, and thatâs what Iâm going
to do this morning,â and he held out the rope.
âAh,â said the American, âthat reminds me of
home. None of my cowboys ride anywhere without
a coil hanging to their saddles. They never
know when they may want to rope a steer or a
mustang.â âWell,â said the man in khaki,
âIâve heerâd tell that the forest people used ropes
in the old days, but they never do now.â

While talking, they had reached the edge of
the wood, and the road, thick with dust, lay before
them. âWell, friend,â said the American,
âyouâll be taking the road; I wish you good-day.
I am keeping to the forest paths.â

âWhy, mister,â said the man with the rope,
âyouâll lose yourself.â âNot with a good English
ordnance map,â answered the other, taking
from his breast pocket a folded map. As he did
so, a bulky pocket-book fell to the ground.
âThanks, donât trouble,â as the man in khaki
made a movement, and bending down himself,
picked up and restored his property to his pocket.

But the man with the cudgel was not to be
shaken off. In spite of the Americanâs obvious
reluctance to have his company, he declared that
he had plenty of time and that he would see him
a piece of the way. Once started, the intruder
on the visitorâs privacy became boastful of his
prowess and that of his companions in arms, and
began to decry the American forces, but his
hearer good-humouredly parried his clumsy onslaughts.

As they passed over the moor they came upon
a group of ponies. It was Skewbaldâs herd. He
was grazing, and as the two men passed within a
short distance, he raised his head and looked at
them. But, as they were on foot, and seemed to
have no ill designs on ponies, he turned again to
his own business.

âNow, mister,â said the man with the rope,
âyou Amurricans talk very big about lassooing
wild steers and hosses. What about giving us a
show of your skill? Letâs see you catch one of
these ponies.â

âNo, friend,â replied the American, putting
aside the proffered coil; âI donât rope other
peopleâs beasts without their permission, nor do
I wish to show off.â âAll right, mister, donât be
huffy about it,â said the man; âbut that there
stallionââindicating Skewbaldââis worth five
bob to me, if you can rope him. Joe Smith has
been wild to get him for weeks past, but the
skewbald has gone away every time. Only a rope
will get him. You might help a pore man,â he
urged with garrulous earnestness.

âWell,â hesitated the other, âthe ground is
soft, and I am not likely to hurt him, but this
rope is all wrong and may put me off. However,
I can try.â They walked on a little and the
American stopped and deposited his luggage at
the foot of a holly. He tied the noose and re-coiled
the rope to his liking. Then they walked back so
as to pass within a few yards of the stallion. The
man in khaki walked a pace or so behind the
other, gripping his cudgel. He breathed heavily,
looked around him and seemed excited. The
stallion raised his head suspiciously, turned, and
at the same moment the rope shot out and encircled
his neck. Before the pony knew what was
happening to him, the American, bending down,
was taking several turns of the rope round a
stump.

Then two things happened. The stallion,
making off, was brought up short and fell on his
side, half-choked by the tightening of the rope,
and at the same moment, the cudgel fell with a
thud on the head of the man bending at the rope.
He fell forward on his face without a cry. His
assailant looked around hurriedly, then took the
gold watch, pocket-book and loose cash, and
having picked up his stick, was making off without
a second glance at his victim.

But Skewbald struggling on the ground caught
his eye. âWhy,â he muttered, âI nearly forgot
the rope. Good job I didnât quite. Might have
give me away.â He dropped the cudgel, unwound
the rope from the stump, and approached
the stallion.

Directly the pressure of the noose was removed
from the ponyâs windpipe, he revived, and rose
to his feet breathing hard. Then as the man
reached him and took hold of the noose, he reared,
pulling his liberator off his feet, to fall beneath the
plunging hoofs. The stallion, seeing a persecutor
lying prostrate, and being full of anger at his
treatment, with a scream of fury, flew at him,
kicking and biting. Then he seized an arm in his
teeth and savaged it. Launching a final kick, he
galloped to his herd, the rope trailing on the
ground.

The American groaned. He thought himself
again in the trenches, with the enemy âputting
some hot stuff over.â He was sure he had received
a wound at the back of his head, and was
lying face down in mud and blood, dying, yet no
one came to his aid. Then his nose tickled, he
sneezed, and sat up. He felt the back of his head
and looked at the blood on his fingers. He remembered
roping the pony, but rope and stallion were
both gone. What was that lying in a trampled
bush of bog myrtle? He got up and walked unsteadily
to the prostrate form. The face was
marked with cuts and bruises, while one sleeve
was torn, the arm bleeding and hanging oddly.
The American turned him over carefully, and as
he did so, his gold watch fell out of a pocket, its
glass smashed, and here was his pocket-book lying
on the ground. Then he began to understand
somewhat of what had happened to himself and to
the man, for the hoof-marks around told their
own tale. His face set hard, but this ruffian was
in a bad way, perhaps dying. He would do what
he could for him. He went to his knapsack and
took out a first-aid outfit. He bandaged the torn
and broken arm, using sticks for splints. The
pain roused the patient and he began to groan
and curse disjointedly, the phrase âââ skewbaldâ
recurring like a refrain.

The American carried the man to the shade of
a tree. He heard the chink of coin, which he
divined to be his own property, especially when
he found his pockets empty. Then he waited.
The man opened his eyes, and looked at his preserver.
âWhat?â he spluttered, having lost
some front teeth. âYes, my friend,â said the
other, âI am still here, and a good job for you.
I might have left you to bleed to death, and serve
you right. I think you took rather more risk than
you knew,â producing a revolver from a hip
pocket and replacing it. âWell, your legs and
back seem all right, and after a rest you should be
able to make the road and get help. You donât
deserve it, but I think I had better see you there.
No, donât worry,â as the manâs eyes narrowed.
âIâm not going to give you up. You seem to
have been well beaten about, without my trying
to get you more punishment.â

The man sat motionless; the double shock of
the stallionâs attack, and being confronted by the
victim of his brutal violence, for the moment
bereft him of speech and power to stir.

After a while, he attempted to rise, stammering
that it was time he made a move. His rescuer
helped him up, and the man tried to feel in his
pockets. âAll right, friend,â said the American,
âI have got my own back.â

As the injured man proceeded, his strength
failed and he began to stumble. The other had
to support him, to prevent further injury to the
shattered arm. The road reached, the man sank
by the wayside, exhausted.

A cart drawn by a forest pony came along.
The driver stopped. âWhy, who be this? Not
Bill Nokes again? Whatâs he been up to this
time?â he asked with emphasis. The American
hastily explained that he had found the man lying
injured in the forest. âPut him in. Iâll soon
have him in the hospital at Lyndhurst.â

They laid the man on the floor and made him
as comfortable as possible. âYou coming, sir?ââto
the American. âNo,â he replied. âI
cannot be of any further use, and I have to return
for my property.â

He walked back with a splitting headache, a
sore head, and a wonder in his heart that among
the kindly forest folk he should have encountered
an alien, and a black sheep at that. He found his
goods where he had left them, and seeing the
cudgel lying near, added it to his burden as a
memento. He spied also a lock of chestnut and
white hair, sawn from the skewbaldâs mane by
the rope, and put it into an envelope. Then he
said to himself: âBetter get out of this. My
scalp wants seeing to, and the people may wonder
how I came by a broken head.â

He consulted a time-table and estimated (there
were no hands to his watch) that he could catch
a train by walking across country, to Southampton.
âIâll hunt up that doctor who treated me
before, and get my head patched up.â

When the American went to the surgery two
days later for a final inspection the doctor held
out a local paper, saying, âHere are some items
which may interest you.â A pencil mark stood
against a paragraph entitled, âStrange Death of
a Forest Pony,â which related how Skewbald had
been found by a keeper. The rope had caught in
a snag near a deep pit, and in his efforts to free
himself, the pony had fallen down, and broken
his neck. âWell, doc.,â said the patient, âI
did more mischief than I expected, when I fooled
around with that rope, but I will put it right when
I get to town.â

âLook at the next page,â said the other.
This item was headed, âForest Man injured by
a Pony?â and narrated that a man picked up
grievously injured, was doing well in hospital and
pronounced out of danger. It went on to say:
âHe is a somewhat notorious character and well
known to the police. Curiously, after his injuries
had been seen to, and while in a state of delirium,
he frequently muttered imprecations on âthat ââ
skewbald.â Elsewhere we detail particulars of
the mysterious death of a fine skewbald forest
stallion belonging to a well-known forest commoner,
Mr. J. Smith. It is conjectured that the
man may have lassooed the pony (though it is not
known that he possessed any such skill with a
rope), and in some way was taken at a disadvantage
by the animal, which attacked him, and
escaped, only to meet its death shortly afterwards.
The manâs injuries are such as might have been
caused by a stallionâs teeth and hoofs. Such
aggressive behaviour on the part of a forest pony
is of the rarest.â

A few days later, Skewbaldâs owner received a
letter with a London postmark. âDang me!â
he said, turning it over; âwho be this from?â and
getting no answer from the envelope, opened it,
when out came a draft for Â£40, and a letter in
business terminology from a firm of solicitors
intimating that a client of theirs, having heard
through the Press of the death of his pony, hoped
that the owner would accept the enclosed sum
as indemnity for his loss. âWell, well!â exclaimed
the delighted but bewildered man, âthis
beats all. The thing gets stranger and stranger.
Iâm sure that varmint Bill Nokes never roped the
poor beast. Now, these people write as if someone
owed me the money. Iâd better harness the
pony and get this in the bank before anything else
happens.â And not until he had got the draft
safely to the bank, and had seen the clerk initial
it, did he really believe that the skewbaldâs loss
had been made good.

-- Update content for 'The Story of the Late Mr. Elvesham'
UPDATE stories SET original_text = 'The enterprise of Messrs. T. Nelson & Sons and the friendly
      accommodation of Messrs. Macmillan render possible this collection in one
      cover of all the short stories by me that I care for any one to read
      again. Except for the two series of linked incidents that make up the bulk
      of the book called Tales of Space and Time, no short story of mine
      of the slightest merit is excluded from this volume. Many of very
      questionable merit find a place; it is an inclusive and not an exclusive
      gathering. And the task of selection and revision brings home to me with
      something of the effect of discovery that I was once an industrious writer
      of short stories, and that I am no longer anything of the kind. I have not
      written one now for quite a long time, and in the past five or six years I
      have made scarcely one a year. The bulk of the fifty or sixty tales from
      which this present three-and-thirty have been chosen dates from the last
      century. This edition is more definitive than I supposed when first I
      arranged for it. In the presence of so conclusive an ebb and cessation an
      almost obituary manner seems justifiable.

I find it a little difficult to disentangle the causes that have
      restricted the flow of these inventions. It has happened, I remark, to
      others as well as to myself, and in spite of the kindliest encouragement
      to continue from editors and readers. There was a time when life bubbled
      with short stories; they were always coming to the surface of my mind, and
      it is no deliberate change of will that has thus restricted my production.
      It is rather, I think, a diversion of attention to more sustained and more
      exacting forms. It was my friend Mr. C.L. Hind who set that spring going.
      He urged me to write short stories for the Pall Mall Budget, and
      persuaded me by his simple and buoyant conviction that I could do what he
      desired. There existed at the time only the little sketch, "The Jilting of
      Jane," included in this volume—at least, that is the only tolerable
      fragment of fiction I find surviving from my pre-Lewis-Hind period. But I
      set myself, so encouraged, to the experiment of inventing moving and
      interesting things that could be given vividly in the little space of
      eight or ten such pages as this, and for a time I found it a very
      entertaining pursuit indeed. Mr. Hind''s indicating finger had shown me an
      amusing possibility of the mind. I found that, taking almost anything as a
      starting-point and letting my thoughts play about it, there would
      presently come out of the darkness, in a manner quite inexplicable, some
      absurd or vivid little incident more or less relevant to that initial
      nucleus. Little men in canoes upon sunlit oceans would come floating out
      of nothingness, incubating the eggs of prehistoric monsters unawares;
      violent conflicts would break out amidst the flower-beds of suburban
      gardens; I would discover I was peering into remote and mysterious worlds
      ruled by an order logical indeed but other than our common sanity.

The ''nineties was a good and stimulating period for a short-story writer.
      Mr. Kipling had made his astonishing advent with a series of little
      blue-grey books, whose covers opened like window-shutters to reveal the
      dusty sun-glare and blazing colours of the East; Mr. Barrie had
      demonstrated what could be done in a little space through the panes of his
      Window in Thrums. The National Observer was at the climax of
      its career of heroic insistence upon lyrical brevity and a vivid finish,
      and Mr. Frank Harris was not only printing good short stories by other
      people, but writing still better ones himself in the dignified pages of
      the Fortnightly Review. Longman''s Magazine, too, represented a clienthle
      of appreciative short-story readers that is now scattered. Then came the
      generous opportunities of the Yellow Book, and the National
      Observer died only to give birth to the New Review. No short
      story of the slightest distinction went for long unrecognised. The
      sixpenny popular magazines had still to deaden down the conception of what
      a short story might be to the imaginative limitation of the common reader—and
      a maximum length of six thousand words. Short stories broke out
      everywhere. Kipling was writing short stories; Barrie, Stevenson,
      Frank-Harris; Max Beerbohm wrote at least one perfect one, "The Happy
      Hypocrite"; Henry James pursued his wonderful and inimitable bent; and
      among other names that occur to me, like a mixed handful of jewels drawn
      from a bag, are George Street, Morley Roberts, George Gissing, Ella
      d''Arcy, Murray Gilchrist, E. Nesbit, Stephen Crane, Joseph Conrad, Edwin
      Pugh, Jerome K. Jerome, Kenneth Graham, Arthur Morrison, Marriott Watson,
      George Moore, Grant Allen, George Egerton, Henry Harland, Pett Ridge, W.
      W. Jacobs (who alone seems inexhaustible). I dare say I could recall as
      many more names with a little effort. I may be succumbing to the
      infirmities of middle age, but I do not think the present decade can
      produce any parallel to this list, or what is more remarkable, that the
      later achievements in this field of any of the survivors from that time,
      with the sole exception of Joseph Conrad, can compare with the work they
      did before 1900. It seems to me this outburst of short stories came not
      only as a phase in literary development, but also as a phase in the
      development of the individual writers concerned.

It is now quite unusual to see any adequate criticism of short stories in
      English. I do not know how far the decline in short-story writing may not
      be due to that. Every sort of artist demands human responses, and few men
      can contrive to write merely for a publisher''s cheque and silence, however
      reassuring that cheque may be. A mad millionaire who commissioned
      masterpieces to burn would find it impossible to buy them. Scarcely any
      artist will hesitate in the choice between money and attention; and it was
      primarily for that last and better sort of pay that the short stories of
      the ''nineties were written. People talked about them tremendously,
      compared them, and ranked them. That was the thing that mattered.

It was not, of course, all good talk, and we suffered then, as now, from
      the ` priori critic. Just as nowadays he goes about declaring that
      the work of such-and-such a dramatist is all very amusing and delightful,
      but "it isn''t a Play," so we'' had a great deal of talk about the
      short story, and found ourselves measured by all kinds of arbitrary
      standards. There was a tendency to treat the short story as though it was
      as definable a form as the sonnet, instead of being just exactly what any
      one of courage and imagination can get told in twenty minutes'' reading or
      so. It was either Mr. Edward Garnett or Mr. George Moore in a violently
      anti-Kipling mood who invented the distinction between the short story and
      the anecdote. The short story was Maupassant; the anecdote was damnable.
      It was a quite infernal comment in its way, because it permitted no
      defence. Fools caught it up and used it freely. Nothing is so destructive
      in a field of artistic effort as a stock term of abuse. Anyone could say
      of any short story, "A mere anecdote," just as anyone can say
      "Incoherent!" of any novel or of any sonata that isn''t studiously
      monotonous. The recession of enthusiasm for this compact, amusing form is
      closely associated in my mind with that discouraging imputation. One felt
      hopelessly open to a paralysing and unanswerable charge, and one''s ease
      and happiness in the garden of one''s fancies was more and more marred by
      the dread of it. It crept into one''s mind, a distress as vague and
      inexpugnable as a sea fog on a spring morning, and presently one shivered
      and wanted to go indoors...It is the absurd fate of the imaginative writer
      that he should be thus sensitive to atmospheric conditions.

But after one has died as a maker one may still live as a critic, and I
      will confess I am all for laxness and variety in this as in every field of
      art. Insistence upon rigid forms and austere unities seems to me the
      instinctive reaction of the sterile against the fecund. It is the tired
      man with a headache who values a work of art for what it does not contain.
      I suppose it is the lot of every critic nowadays to suffer from
      indigestion and a fatigued appreciation, and to develop a self-protective
      tendency towards rules that will reject, as it were, automatically the
      more abundant and irregular forms. But this world is not for the weary,
      and in the long-run it is the new and variant that matter. I refuse
      altogether to recognise any hard and fast type for the Short Story, any
      more than I admit any limitation upon the liberties of the Small Picture.
      The short story is a fiction that may be read in something under an hour,
      and so that it is moving and delightful, it does not matter whether it is
      as "trivial" as a Japanese print of insects seen closely between grass
      stems, or as spacious as the prospect of the plain of Italy from Monte
      Mottarone. It does not matter whether it is human or inhuman, or whether
      it leaves you thinking deeply or radiantly but superficially pleased. Some
      things are more easily done as short stories than others and more
      abundantly done, but one of the many pleasures of short-story writing is
      to achieve the impossible.

At any rate, that is the present writer''s conception of the art of the
      short story, as the jolly art of making something very bright and moving;
      it may be horrible or pathetic or funny or beautiful or profoundly
      illuminating, having only this essential, that it should take from fifteen
      to fifty minutes to read aloud. All the rest is just whatever invention
      and imagination and the mood can give—a vision of buttered slides on
      a busy day or of unprecedented worlds. In that spirit of miscellaneous
      expectation these stories should be received. Each is intended to be a
      thing by itself; and if it is not too ungrateful to kindly and
      enterprising publishers, I would confess I would much prefer to see each
      printed expensively alone, and left in a little brown-paper cover to lie
      about a room against the needs of a quite casual curiosity. And I would
      rather this volume were found in the bedrooms of convalescents and in
      dentists'' parlours and railway trains than in gentlemen''s studies. I would
      rather have it dipped in and dipped in again than read severely through.
      Essentially it is a miscellany of inventions, many of which were very
      pleasant to write; and its end is more than attained if some of them are
      refreshing and agreeable to read. I have now re-read them all, and I am
      glad to think I wrote them. I like them, but I cannot tell how much the
      associations of old happinesses gives them a flavour for me. I make no
      claims for them and no apology; they will be read as long as people read
      them. Things written either live or die; unless it be for a place of
      judgment upon Academic impostors, there is no apologetic intermediate
      state.

I may add that I have tried to set a date to most of these stories, but
      that they are not arranged in strictly chronological order.

As I sit writing in my study, I can hear our Jane bumping her way
      downstairs with a brush and dust-pan. She used in the old days to sing
      hymn tunes, or the British national song for the time being, to these
      instruments, but latterly she has been silent and even careful over her
      work. Time was when I prayed with fervour for such silence, and my wife
      with sighs for such care, but now they have come we are not so glad as we
      might have anticipated we should be. Indeed, I would rejoice secretly,
      though it may be unmanly weakness to admit it, even to hear Jane sing
      "Daisy," or, by the fracture of any plate but one of Euphemia''s best green
      ones, to learn that the period of brooding has come to an end.

Yet how we longed to hear the last of Jane''s young man before we heard the
      last of him! Jane was always very free with her conversation to my wife,
      and discoursed admirably in the kitchen on a variety of topics—so
      well, indeed, that I sometimes left my study door open—our house is
      a small one—to partake of it. But after William came, it was always
      William, nothing but William; William this and William that; and when we
      thought William was worked out and exhausted altogether, then William all
      over again. The engagement lasted altogether three years; yet how she got
      introduced to William, and so became thus saturated with him, was always a
      secret. For my part, I believe it was at the street corner where the Rev.
      Barnabas Baux used to hold an open-air service after evensong on Sundays.
      Young Cupids were wont to flit like moths round the paraffin flare of that
      centre of High Church hymn-singing. I fancy she stood singing hymns there,
      out of memory and her imagination, instead of coming home to get supper,
      and William came up beside her and said, "Hello!" "Hello yourself!" she
      said; and etiquette being satisfied, they proceeded to talk together.

As Euphemia has a reprehensible way of letting her servants talk to her,
      she soon heard of him. "He is such a respectable young man, ma''am,"
      said Jane, "you don''t know." Ignoring the slur cast on her acquaintance,
      my wife inquired further about this William.

"He is second porter at Maynard''s, the draper''s," said Jane, "and gets
      eighteen shillings—nearly a pound—a week, m''m; and when the
      head porter leaves he will be head porter. His relatives are quite
      superior people, m''m. Not labouring people at all. His father was a
      greengrosher, m''m, and had a churnor, and he was bankrup'' twice. And one
      of his sisters is in a Home for the Dying. It will be a very good match
      for me, m''m," said Jane, "me being an orphan girl."

"Well, Jane, when you are properly engaged to him you may ask him round
      here on Sunday afternoons, and have tea with him in the kitchen;" for my
      Euphemia has a motherly conception of her duty towards her maid-servants.
      And presently the amethystine ring was being worn about the house, even
      with ostentation, and Jane developed a new way of bringing in the joint so
      that this gage was evident. The elder Miss Maitland was aggrieved by it,
      and told my wife that servants ought not to wear rings. But my wife looked
      it up in Enquire Within and Mrs. Motherly''s Book of Household
      Management, and found no prohibition. So Jane remained with this
      happiness added to her love.

The treasure of Jane''s heart appeared to me to be what respectable people
      call a very deserving young man. "William, ma''am," said Jane one day
      suddenly, with ill-concealed complacency, as she counted out the beer
      bottles, "William, ma''am, is a teetotaller. Yes, m''m; and he don''t smoke.
      Smoking, ma''am," said Jane, as one who reads the heart, "do make
      such a dust about. Beside the waste of money. And the smell.
      However, I suppose they got to do it—some of them..."

William was at first a rather shabby young man of the ready-made black
      coat school of costume. He had watery gray eyes, and a complexion
      appropriate to the brother of one in a Home for the Dying. Euphemia did
      not fancy him very much, even at the beginning. His eminent respectability
      was vouched for by an alpaca umbrella, from which he never allowed himself
      to be parted.

"His papa, ma''am, was Church: but Mr. Maynard is a Plymouth Brother, and
      William thinks it Policy, ma''am, to go there too. Mr. Maynard comes and
      talks to him quite friendly when they ain''t busy, about using up all the
      ends of string, and about his soul. He takes a lot of notice, do Mr.
      Maynard, of William, and the way he saves his soul, ma''am."

Presently we heard that the head porter at Maynard''s had left, and that
      William was head porter at twenty-three shillings a week. "He is really
      kind of over the man who drives the van," said Jane, "and him married,
      with three children." And she promised in the pride of her heart to make
      interest for us with William to favour us so that we might get our parcels
      of drapery from Maynard''s with exceptional promptitude.

After this promotion a rapidly-increasing prosperity came upon Jane''s
      young man. One day we learned that Mr. Maynard had given William a book.
      "''Smiles'' ''Elp Yourself,'' it''s called," said Jane; "but it ain''t comic. It
      tells you how to get on in the world, and some what William read to me was
      lovely, ma''am."

Euphemia told me of this, laughing, and then she became suddenly grave.
      "Do you know, dear," she said, "Jane said one thing I did not like. She
      had been quiet for a minute, and then she suddenly remarked, ''William is a
      lot above me, ma''am, ain''t he?''"

One Sunday afternoon about that time I was sitting at my writing-desk—
      possibly I was reading a good book—when a something went by the
      window. I heard a startled exclamation behind me, and saw Euphemia with
      her hands clasped together and her eyes dilated. "George," she said in an
      awe-stricken whisper, "did you see?"

Then we both spoke to one another at the same moment, slowly and solemnly:
      "A silk hat! Yellow gloves! A new umbrella!"

"It may be my fancy, dear," said Euphemia; "but his tie was very like
      yours. I believe Jane keeps him in ties. She told me a little while ago,
      in a way that implied volumes about the rest of your costume, ''The master
      do wear pretty ties, ma''am.'' And he echoes all your novelties."

The young couple passed our window again on their way to their customary
      walk. They were arm in arm. Jane looked exquisitely proud, happy, and
      uncomfortable, with new white cotton gloves, and William, in the silk hat,
      singularly genteel!

That was the culmination of Jane''s happiness. When she returned, "Mr.
      Maynard has been talking to William, ma''am," she said, "and he is to serve
      customers, just like the young shop gentlemen, during the next sale. And
      if he gets on, he is to be made an assistant, ma''am, at the first
      opportunity. He has got to be as gentlemanly as he can, ma''am; and if he
      ain''t, ma''am, he says it won''t be for want of trying. Mr. Maynard has took
      a great fancy to him."

That next Sunday as I drank my tea I interrogated my wife. "How is this
      Sunday different from all other Sundays, little woman? What has happened?
      Have you altered the curtains, or re-arranged the furniture, or where is
      the indefinable difference of it? Are you wearing your hair in a new way
      without warning me? I perceive a change clearly, and I cannot for the life
      of me say what it is."

Then my wife answered in her most tragic voice, "George," she said, "that
      William has not come near the place to-day! And Jane is crying her heart
      out upstairs."

There followed a period of silence. Jane, as I have said, stopped singing
      about the house, and began to care for our brittle possessions, which
      struck my wife as being a very sad sign indeed. The next Sunday, and the
      next, Jane asked to go out, "to walk with William," and my wife, who never
      attempts to extort confidences, gave her permission, and asked no
      questions. On each occasion Jane came back looking flushed and very
      determined. At last one day she became communicative.

"William is being led away," she remarked abruptly, with a catching of the
      breath, apropos of tablecloths. "Yes, m''m. She is a milliner, and she can
      play on the piano."

"Not out with him, m''m—after him. I walked along by the side of
      them, and told her he was engaged to me."

"I wish," said Jane, "I could play the piano, ma''am. But anyhow, I don''t
      mean to let her get him away from me. She''s older than him, and her
      hair ain''t gold to the roots, ma''am."

It was on the August Bank Holiday that the crisis came. We do not clearly
      know the details of the fray, but only such fragments as poor Jane let
      fall. She came home dusty, excited, and with her heart hot within her.

The milliner''s mother, the milliner, and William had made a party to the
      Art Museum at South Kensington, I think. Anyhow, Jane had calmly but
      firmly accosted them somewhere in the streets, and asserted her right to
      what, in spite of the consensus of literature, she held to be her
      inalienable property. She did, I think, go so far as to lay hands on him.
      They dealt with her in a crushingly superior way. They "called a cab."
      There was a "scene," William being pulled away into the four-wheeler by
      his future wife and mother-in-law from the reluctant hands of our
      discarded Jane. There were threats of giving her "in charge."

"My poor Jane!" said my wife, mincing veal as though she was mincing
      William. "It''s a shame of them. I would think no more of him. He is not
      worthy of you."

"But it''s that woman has done it," said Jane. She was never known to bring
      herself to pronounce "that woman''s" name or to admit her girlishness. "I
      can''t think what minds some women must have—to try and get a girl''s
      young man away from her. But there, it only hurts to talk about it," said
      Jane.

Thereafter our house rested from William. But there was something in the
      manner of Jane''s scrubbing the front doorstep or sweeping out the rooms, a
      certain viciousness, that persuaded me that the story had not yet ended.

"My dear," said my wife, fluttering into my room about twenty minutes
      after Jane had started, "Jane has been to the boot-hole and taken all the
      left-off boots and shoes, and gone off to the wedding with them in a bag.
      Surely she cannot mean—"

Jane came back with a pale, hard face. All the boots seemed to be still in
      her bag, at which my wife heaved a premature sigh of relief. We heard her
      go upstairs and replace the boots with considerable emphasis.

"Quite a crowd at the wedding, ma''am," she said presently, in a purely
      conversational style, sitting in our little kitchen, and scrubbing the
      potatoes; "and such a lovely day for them." She proceeded to numerous
      other details, clearly avoiding some cardinal incident.

"It was all extremely respectable and nice, ma''am; but her father
      didn''t wear a black coat, and looked quite out of place, ma''am. Mr.
      Piddingquirk—"

"Mr. Piddingquirk—William that was, ma''am—had white gloves,
      and a coat like a clergyman, and a lovely chrysanthemum. He looked so
      nice, ma''am. And there was red carpet down, just like for gentlefolks. And
      they say he gave the clerk four shillings, ma''am. It was a real kerridge
      they had—not a fly. When they came out of church there was
      rice-throwing, and her two little sisters dropping dead flowers. And
      someone threw a slipper, and then I threw a boot—"

"Yes, ma''am. Aimed at her. But it hit him. Yes, ma''am, hard. Gev
      him a black eye, I should think. I only threw that one. I hadn''t the heart
      to try again. All the little boys cheered when it hit him."

Another pause. The potatoes were being scrubbed violently. "He always was
      a bit above me, you know, ma''am. And he was led away."

The potatoes were more than finished. Jane rose sharply with a sigh, and
      rapped the basin down on the table.

"I don''t care," she said. "I don''t care a rap. He will find out his
      mistake yet. It serves me right. I was stuck up about him. I ought not to
      have looked so high. And I am glad things are as things are."

My wife was in the kitchen, seeing to the higher cookery. After the
      confession of the boot-throwing, she must have watched poor Jane fuming
      with a certain dismay in those brown eyes of hers. But I imagine they
      softened again very quickly, and then Jane''s must have met them.

"Oh, ma''am," said Jane, with an astonishing change of note, "think of all
      that might have been! Oh, ma''am, I could have been so happy!
      I ought to have known, but I didn''t know...You''re very kind to let me talk
      to you, ma''am...for it''s hard on me, ma''am...it''s har-r-r-r-d—"

And I gather that Euphemia so far forgot herself as to let Jane sob out
      some of the fullness of her heart on a sympathetic shoulder. My Euphemia,
      thank Heaven, has never properly grasped the importance of "keeping up her
      position." And since that fit of weeping, much of the accent of bitterness
      has gone out of Jane''s scrubbing and brush work.

Indeed, something passed the other day with the butcher-boy—but that
      scarcely belongs to this story. However, Jane is young still, and time and
      change are at work with her. We all have our sorrows, but I do not believe
      very much in the existence of sorrows that never heal.

The night was hot and overcast, the sky red-rimmed with the lingering
      sunset of midsummer. They sat at the open window, trying to fancy the air
      was fresher there. The trees and shrubs of the garden stood stiff and
      dark; beyond in the roadway a gas-lamp burnt, bright orange against the
      hazy blue of the evening. Farther were the three lights of the railway
      signal against the lowering sky. The man and woman spoke to one another in
      low tones.

"Not he," she said peevishly, as though that too irritated her. "He thinks
      of nothing but the works and the prices of fuel. He has no imagination, no
      poetry."

"He has not," she said. She turned her discontented face towards
      the window. The distant sound of a roaring and rushing drew nearer and
      grew in volume; the house quivered; one heard the metallic rattle of the
      tender. As the train passed, there was a glare of light above the cutting
      and a driving tumult of smoke; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
      eight black oblongs—eight trucks—passed across the dim grey of
      the embankment, and were suddenly extinguished one by one in the throat of
      the tunnel, which, with the last, seemed to swallow down train, smoke, and
      sound in one abrupt gulp.

"This country was all fresh and beautiful once," he said; "and now—it
      is Gehenna. Down that way—nothing but pot-banks and chimneys
      belching fire and dust into the face of heaven...But what does it matter?
      An end comes, an end to all this cruelty...To-morrow." He spoke the
      last word in a whisper.

She turned with a start, and their eyes searched one another''s. Hers
      softened to his gaze. "My dear one!" she said, and then: "It seems so
      strange—that you should have come into my life like this—to
      open—" She paused.

"All this wonderful world"—she hesitated, and spoke still more
      softly— "this world of love to me."

Then suddenly the door clicked and closed. They turned their heads, and he
      started violently back. In the shadow of the room stood a great shadowy
      figure-silent. They saw the face dimly in the half-light, with
      unexpressive dark patches under the pent-house brows. Every muscle in
      Raut''s body suddenly became tense. When could the door have opened? What
      had he heard? Had he heard all? What had he seen? A tumult of questions.

"I was afraid I had missed you, Horrocks," said the man at the window,
      gripping the window-ledge with his hand. His voice was unsteady.

The clumsy figure of Horrocks came forward out of the shadow. He made no
      answer to Raut''s remark. For a moment he stood above them.

The woman''s heart was cold within her. "I told Mr. Raut it was just
      possible you might come back," she said in a voice that never quivered.

Horrocks, still silent, sat down abruptly in the chair by her little
      work-table. His big hands were clenched; one saw now the fire of his eyes
      under the shadow of his brows. He was trying to get his breath. His eyes
      went from the woman he had trusted to the friend he had trusted, and then
      back to the woman.

By this time and for the moment all three half understood one another. Yet
      none dared say a word to ease the pent-up things that choked them.

"I promised to show you some fine effects of moonlight and smoke,"
      repeated Horrocks in a colourless voice.

"And I thought I might catch you to-night before you went down to the
      works," proceeded Raut, "and come with you."

There was another pause. Did the man mean to take the thing coolly? Did
      he, after all, know? How long had he been in the room? Yet even at the
      moment when they heard the door, their attitudes ... Horrocks glanced at
      the profile of the woman, shadowy pallid in the half-light. Then he
      glanced at Raut, and seemed to recover himself suddenly. "Of course," he
      said, "I promised to show you the works under their proper dramatic
      conditions. It''s odd how I could have forgotten."

Horrocks started again. A new light had suddenly come into the sultry
      gloom of his eyes. "Not in the least." he said.

"Have you been telling Mr. Raut of all these contrasts of flame and shadow
      you think so splendid?" said the woman, turning now to her husband for the
      first time, her confidence creeping back again, her voice just one
      half-note too high—"that dreadful theory of yours that machinery is
      beautiful, and everything else in the world ugly. I thought he would not
      spare you, Mr. Raut. It''s his great theory, his one discovery in art."

"I am slow to make discoveries," said Horrocks grimly, damping her
      suddenly. "But what I discover ..." He stopped.

"I promised to show you the works," he said to Raut, and put his big,
      clumsy hand on his friend''s shoulder. "And you are ready to go?"

There was another pause. Each of them peered through the indistinctness of
      the dusk at the other two.

Horrocks'' hand still rested on Raut''s shoulder. Raut half fancied still
      that the incident was trivial after all. But Mrs. Horrocks knew her
      husband better, knew that grim quiet in his voice, and the confusion in
      her mind took a vague shape of physical evil. "Very well," said Horrocks,
      and, dropping his hand, turned towards the door.

"That''s my work-basket," said Mrs. Horrocks with a gust of hysterical
      laughter. Their hands came together on the back of the chair. "Here it
      is!" he said. She had an impulse to warn him in an undertone, but she
      could not frame a word. "Don''t go!" and "Beware of him!" struggled in her
      mind, and the swift moment passed.

Raut stepped towards him. "Better say goodbye to Mrs. Horrocks," said the
      ironmaster, even more grimly quiet in his tone than before.

Horrocks held the door open with a ceremonial politeness unusual in him
      towards men. Raut went out, and then, after a wordless look at her, her
      husband followed. She stood motionless while Raut''s light footfall and her
      husband''s heavy tread, like bass and treble, passed down the passage
      together. The front door slammed heavily. She went to the window, moving
      slowly, and stood watching, leaning forward. The two men appeared for a
      moment at the gateway in the road, passed under the street lamp, and were
      hidden by the black masses of the shrubbery. The lamplight fell for a
      moment on their faces, showing only unmeaning pale patches, telling
      nothing of what she still feared, and doubted, and craved vainly to know.
      Then she sank down into a crouching attitude in the big arm-chair, her
      eyes-wide open and staring out at the red lights from the furnaces that
      flickered in the sky. An hour after she was still there, her attitude
      scarcely changed.

The oppressive stillness of the evening weighed heavily upon Raut. They
      went side by side down the road in silence, and in silence turned into the
      cinder-made byway that presently opened out the prospect of the valley.

A blue haze, half dust, half mist, touched the long valley with mystery.
      Beyond were Hanley and Etruria, grey and dark masses, outlined thinly by
      the rare golden dots of the street lamps, and here and there a gas-lit
      window, or the yellow glare of some late-working factory or crowded
      public-house. Out of the masses, clear and slender against the evening
      sky, rose a multitude of tall chimneys, many of them reeking, a few
      smokeless during a season of "play." Here and there a pallid patch and
      ghostly stunted beehive shapes showed the position of a pot-bank or a
      wheel, black and sharp against the hot lower sky, marked some colliery
      where they raise the iridescent coal of the place. Nearer at hand was the
      broad stretch of railway, and half-invisible trains shunted—a steady
      puffing and rumbling, with every run a ringing concussion and a rhymthic
      series of impacts, and a passage of intermittent puffs of white steam
      across the further view. And to the left, between the railway and the dark
      mass of the low hill beyond, dominating the whole view, colossal,
      inky-black, and crowned with smoke and fitful flames, stood the great
      cylinders of the Jeddah Company Blast Furnaces, the central edifices of
      the big ironworks of which Horrocks was the manager. They stood heavy and
      threatening, full of an incessant turmoil of flames and seething molten
      iron, and about the feet of them rattled the rolling-mills, and the
      steam-hammer beat heavily and splashed the white iron sparks hither and
      thither. Even as they looked, a truckful of fuel was shot into one of the
      giants, and the red flames gleamed out, and a confusion of smoke and black
      dust came boiling upwards towards the sky.

"Certainly you get some colour with your furnaces," said Raut, breaking a
      silence that had become apprehensive.

Horrocks grunted. He stood with his hands in his pockets, frowning down at
      the dim steaming railway and the busy ironworks beyond, frowning as if he
      were thinking out some knotty problem.

Raut glanced at him and away again. "At present your moonlight effect is
      hardly ripe," he continued, looking upward; "the moon is still smothered
      by the vestiges of daylight."

Horrocks stared at him with the expression of a man who has suddenly
      awakened. "Vestiges of daylight? ... Of course, of course." He too looked
      up at the moon, pale still in the midsummer sky. "Come along," he said
      suddenly, and gripping Raut''s arm in his hand, made a move towards the
      path that dropped from them to the railway.

Raut hung back. Their eyes met and saw a thousand things in a moment that
      their lips came near to say. Horrocks''s hand tightened and then relaxed.
      He let go, and before Raut was aware of it, they were arm in arm, and
      walking, one unwillingly enough, down the path.

"You see the fine effect of the railway signals towards Burslem," said
      Horrocks, suddenly breaking into loquacity, striding fast and tightening
      the grip of his elbow the while—"little green lights and red and
      white lights, all against the haze. You have an eye for effect, Raut. It''s
      fine. And look at those furnaces of mine, how they rise upon us as we come
      down the hill. That to the right is my pet—seventy feet of him. I
      packed him myself, and he''s boiled away cheerfully with iron in his guts
      for five long years. I''ve a particular fancy for him. That line of
      red there—a lovely bit of warm orange you''d call it, Raut—that''s
      the puddlers'' furnaces, and there, in the hot light, three black figures—did
      you see the white splash of the steam-hammer then?—that''s the
      rolling mills. Come along! Clang, clatter, how it goes rattling across the
      floor! Sheet tin, Raut,—amazing stuff. Glass mirrors are not in it
      when that stuff comes from the mill. And, squelch! there goes the hammer
      again. Come along!"

He had to stop talking to catch at his breath. His arm twisted into Raut''s
      with benumbing tightness. He had come striding down the black path towards
      the railway as though he was possessed. Raut had not spoken a word, had
      simply hung back against Horrocks''s pull with all his strength.

"I say," he said now, laughing nervously, but with an undertone of snarl
      in his voice, "why on earth are you nipping my arm off, Horrocks, and
      dragging me along like this?"

At length Horrocks released him. His manner changed again. "Nipping your
      arm off?" he said. "Sorry. But it''s you taught me the trick of walking in
      that friendly way."

"You haven''t learnt the refinements of it yet then," said Raut, laughing
      artificially again. "By Jove! I''m black and blue." Horrocks offered no
      apology. They stood now near the bottom of the hill, close to the fence
      that bordered the railway. The ironworks had grown larger and spread out
      with their approach. They looked up to the blast furnaces now instead of
      down; the further view of Etruria and Hanley had dropped out of sight with
      their descent. Before them, by the stile, rose a notice-board, bearing,
      still dimly visible, the words, "BEWARE OF THE TRAINS," half hidden by
      splashes of coaly mud.

"Fine effects," said Horrocks, waving his arm. "Here comes a train. The
      puffs of smoke, the orange glare, the round eye of light in front of it,
      the melodious rattle. Fine effects! But these furnaces of mine used to be
      finer, before we shoved cones in their throats, and saved the gas."

"Cones, my man, cones. I''ll show you one nearer. The flames used to flare
      out of the open throats, great—what is it?—pillars of cloud by
      day, red and black smoke, and pillars of fire by night. Now we run it off—in
      pipes, and burn it to heat the blast, and the top is shut by a cone.
      You''ll be interested in that cone."

"The cone''s not fixed, it''s hung by a chain from a lever, and balanced by
      an equipoise. You shall see it nearer. Else, of course, there''d be no way
      of getting fuel into the thing. Every now and then the cone dips, and out
      comes the flare."

"Come along," said Horrocks abruptly, gripping his shoulder again, and
      moving him suddenly towards the railway crossing. And then came one of
      those swift incidents, vivid, but so rapid that they leave one doubtful
      and reeling. Half-way across, Horrocks''s hand suddenly clenched upon him
      like a vice, and swung him backward and through a half-turn, so that he
      looked up the line. And there a chain of lamp-lit carriage windows
      telescoped swiftly as it came towards them, and the red and yellow lights
      of an engine grew larger and larger, rushing down upon them. As he grasped
      what this meant, he turned his face to Horrocks, and pushed with all his
      strength against the arm that held him back between the rails. The
      struggle did not last a moment. Just as certain as it was that Horrocks
      held him there, so certain was it that he had been violently lugged out of
      danger.

"Out of the way," said Horrocks with a gasp, as the train came rattling
      by, and they stood panting by the gate into the ironworks.

"I did not see it coming," said Raut, still, even in spite of his own
      apprehensions, trying to keep up an appearance of ordinary intercourse.

Horrocks answered with a grunt. "The cone," he said, and then, as one who
      recovers himself, "I thought you did not hear."

Horrocks stood for half a minute, then turned abruptly towards the
      ironworks again. "See how fine these great mounds of mine, these
      clinker-heaps, look in the night! That truck yonder, up above there! Up it
      goes, and out-tilts the slag. See the palpitating red stuff go sliding
      down the slope. As we get nearer, the heap rises up and cuts the blast
      furnaces. See the quiver up above the big one. Not that way! This way,
      between the heaps. That goes to the puddling furnaces, but I want to show
      you the canal first." He came and took Raut by the elbow, and so they went
      along side by side. Raut answered Horrocks vaguely. What, he asked
      himself, had really happened on the line? Was he deluding himself with his
      own fancies, or had Horrocks actually held him back in the way of the
      train? Had he just been within an ace of being murdered?

Suppose this slouching, scowling monster did know anything? For a
      minute or two then Raut was really afraid for his life, but the mood
      passed as he reasoned with himself. After all, Horrocks might have heard
      nothing. At any rate, he had pulled him out of the way in time. His odd
      manner might be due to the mere vague jealousy he had shown once before.
      He was talking now of the ash-heaps and the canal. "Eigh?" said Horrocks.

"Our canal," said Horrocks, stopping suddenly. "Our canal by moonlight and
      firelight is immense. You''ve never seen it? Fancy that! You''ve spent too
      many of your evenings philandering up in Newcastle there. I tell you, for
      real florid quality——But you shall see. Boiling water ..."

As they came out of the labyrinth of clinker-heaps and mounds of coal and
      ore, the noises of the rolling-mill sprang upon them suddenly, loud, near,
      and distinct. Three shadowy workmen went by and touched their caps to
      Horrocks. Their faces were vague in the darkness. Raut felt a futile
      impulse to address them, and before he could frame his words they passed
      into the shadows. Horrocks pointed to the canal close before them now: a
      weird-looking place it seemed, in the blood-red reflections of the
      furnaces. The hot water that cooled the tuyhres came into it, some fifty
      yards up—a tumultuous, almost boiling affluent, and the steam rose
      up from the water in silent white wisps and streaks, wrapping damply about
      them, an incessant succession of ghosts coming up from the black and red
      eddies, a white uprising that made the head swim. The shining black tower
      of the larger blast-furnace rose overhead out of the mist, and its
      tumultuous riot filled their ears. Raut kept away from the edge of the
      water, and watched Horrocks.

"Here it is red," said Horrocks, "blood-red vapour as red and hot as sin;
      but yonder there, where the moonlight falls on it, and it drives across
      the clinker-heaps, it is as white as death."

Raut turned his head for a moment, and then came back hastily to his watch
      on Horrocks. "Come along to the rolling-mills," said Horrocks. The
      threatening hold was not so evident that time, and Raut felt a little
      reassured. But all the same, what on earth did Horrocks mean about "white
      as death" and "red as sin"? Coincidence, perhaps?

They went and stood behind the puddlers for a little while, and then
      through the rolling-mills, where amidst an incessant din the deliberate
      steam-hammer beat the juice out of the succulent iron, and black,
      half-naked Titans rushed the plastic bars, like hot sealing-wax, between
      the wheels, "Come on," said Horrocks in Raut''s ear; and they went and
      peeped through the little glass hole behind the tuyhres, and saw the
      tumbled fire writhing in the pit of the blast-furnace. It left one eye
      blinded for a while. Then, with green and blue patches dancing across the
      dark, they went to the lift by which the trucks of ore and fuel and lime
      were raised to the top of the big cylinder.

And out upon the narrow rail that overhung the furnace Raut''s doubts came
      upon him again. Was it wise to be here? If Horrocks did know—everything!
      Do what he would, he could not resist a violent trembling. Right under
      foot was a sheer depth of seventy feet. It was a dangerous place. They
      pushed by a truck of fuel to get to the railing that crowned the thing.
      The reek of the furnace, a sulphurous vapour streaked with pungent
      bitterness, seemed to make the distant hillside of Hanley quiver. The moon
      was riding out now from among a drift of clouds, half-way up the sky above
      the undulating wooded outlines of Newcastle. The steaming canal ran away
      from below them under an indistinct bridge, and vanished into the dim haze
      of the flat fields towards Burslem.

"That''s the cone I''ve been telling you of," shouted Horrocks; "and, below
      that, sixty feet of fire and molten metal, with the air of the blast
      frothing through it like gas in soda-water."

Raut gripped the hand-rail tightly, and stared down at the cone. The heat
      was intense. The boiling of the iron and the tumult of the blast made a
      thunderous accompaniment to Horrocks''s voice. But the thing had to be gone
      through now. Perhaps, after all...

"In the middle," bawled Horrocks, "temperature near a thousand degrees. If
      you were dropped into it ... flash into flame like a pinch of
      gunpowder in a candle. Put your hand out and feel the heat of his breath.
      Why, even up here I''ve seen the rain-water boiling off the trucks. And
      that cone there. It''s a damned sight too hot for roasting cakes. The top
      side of it''s three hundred degrees."

"Three hundred centigrade, mind!" said Horrocks. "It will boil the blood
      out of you in no time."

With one hand he clutched at the hand-rail, then with both. For a moment
      the two men stood swaying. Then suddenly, with a violent jerk, Horrocks
      had twisted him from his hold. He clutched at Horrocks and missed, his
      foot went back into empty air; in mid-air he twisted himself, and then
      cheek and shoulder and knee struck the hot cone together.

He clutched the chain by which the cone hung, and the thing sank an
      infinitesimal amount as he struck it. A circle of glowing red appeared
      about him, and a tongue of flame, released from the chaos within,
      flickered up towards him. An intense pain assailed him at the knees, and
      he could smell the singeing of his hands. He raised himself to his feet,
      and tried to climb up the chain, and then something struck his head. Black
      and shining with the moonlight, the throat of the furnace rose about him.

Horrocks, he saw, stood above him by one of the trucks of fuel on the
      rail. The gesticulating figure was bright and white in the moonlight, and
      shouting, "Fizzle, you fool! Fizzle, you hunter of women! You hot-blooded
      hound! Boil! boil! boil!"

Suddenly he caught up a handful of coal out of the truck, and flung it
      deliberately, lump after lump, at Raut.

He clung, crying, to the chain, pulling himself up from the burning of the
      cone. Each missile Horrocks flung hit him. His clothes charred and glowed,
      and as he struggled the cone dropped, and a rush of hot, suffocating gas
      whooped out and burned round him in a swift breath of flame.

His human likeness departed from him. When the momentary red had passed,
      Horrocks saw a charred, blackened figure, its head streaked with blood,
      still clutching and fumbling with the chain, and writhing in agony—a
      cindery animal, an inhuman, monstrous creature that began a sobbing,
      intermittent shriek.

Abruptly at the sight the ironmaster''s anger passed. A deadly sickness
      came upon him. The heavy odour of burning flesh came drifting up to his
      nostrils. His sanity returned to him.

He knew the thing below him, save that it still moved and felt, was
      already a dead man—that the blood of the poor wretch must be boiling
      in his veins. An intense realisation of that agony came to his mind, and
      overcame every other feeling. For a moment he stood irresolute, and then,
      turning to the truck, he hastily tilted its contents upon the struggling
      thing that had once been a man. The mass fell with a thud, and went
      radiating over the cone. With the thud the shriek ended, and a boiling
      confusion of smoke, dust, and flame came rushing up towards him. As it
      passed, he saw the cone clear again.

Then he staggered back, and stood trembling, clinging to the rail with
      both hands. His lips moved, but no words came to them.

Down below was the sound of voices and running steps. The clangour of
      rolling in the shed ceased abruptly.

"This again," said the Bacteriologist, slipping a glass slide under the
      microscope, "is well,—a preparation of the Bacillus of cholera—the
      cholera germ."

The pale-faced man peered down the microscope. He was evidently not
      accustomed to that kind of thing, and held a limp white hand over his
      disengaged eye. "I see very little," he said.

"Touch this screw," said the Bacteriologist; "perhaps the microscope is
      out of focus for you. Eyes vary so much. Just the fraction of a turn this
      way or that."

"Ah! now I see," said the visitor. "Not so very much to see after all.
      Little streaks and shreds of pink. And yet those little particles, those
      mere atomies, might multiply and devastate a city! Wonderful!"

He stood up, and releasing the glass slip from the microscope, held it in
      his hand towards the window. "Scarcely visible," he said, scrutinising the
      preparation. He hesitated. "Are these—alive? Are they dangerous
      now?"

"Those have been stained and killed," said the Bacteriologist. "I wish,
      for my own part, we could kill and stain every one of them in the
      universe."

"I suppose," the pale man said, with a slight smile, ''that you scarcely
      care to have such things about you in the living—in the active
      state?"

"On the contrary, we are obliged to," said the Bacteriologist. "Here, for
      instance—" He walked across the room and took up one of several
      sealed tubes. "Here is the living thing. This is a cultivation of the
      actual living disease bacteria." He hesitated. "Bottled cholera, so to
      speak."

A slight gleam of satisfaction appeared momentarily in the face of the
      pale man. "It''s a deadly thing to have in your possession," he said,
      devouring the little tube with his eyes. The Bacteriologist watched the
      morbid pleasure in his visitor''s expression. This man, who had visited him
      that afternoon with a note of introduction from an old friend, interested
      him from the very contrast of their dispositions. The lank black hair and
      deep grey eyes, the haggard expression and nervous manner, the fitful yet
      keen interest of his visitor were a novel change from the phlegmatic
      deliberations of the ordinary scientific worker with whom the
      Bacteriologist chiefly associated. It was perhaps natural, with a hearer
      evidently so impressionable to the lethal nature of; his topic, to take
      the most effective aspect of the matter.

He held the tube in his hand thoughtfully. "Yes, here is the pestilence
      imprisoned. Only break such a little tube as this into a supply of
      drinking-water, say to these minute particles of life that one must needs
      stain and examine with the highest powers of the microscope even to see,
      and that one can neither smell nor taste—say to them, ''Go forth,
      increase and multiply, and replenish the cisterns,'' and death—mysterious,
      untraceable death, death swift and terrible, death full of pain and
      indignity—would be released upon this city, and go hither and
      thither seeking his victims. Here he would take the husband from the wife,
      here the child from its mother, here the statesman from his duty, and here
      the toiler from his trouble. He would follow the water-mains, creeping
      along streets, picking out and punishing a house here and a house there
      where they did not boil their drinking-water, creeping into the wells of
      the mineral water makers, getting washed into salad, and lying dormant in
      ices. He would wait ready to be drunk in the horse-troughs, and by unwary
      children in the public fountains. He would soak into the soil, to reappear
      in springs and wells at a thousand unexpected places. Once start him at
      the water supply, and before we could ring him in, and catch him again, he
      would have decimated the metropolis."

The pale-faced man nodded. His eyes shone. He cleared his throat. "These
      Anarchist—rascals," said he, "are fools, blind fools—to use
      bombs when this kind of thing is attainable. I think——"

A gentle rap, a mere light touch of the finger-nails, was heard at the
      door. The Bacteriologist opened it. "Just a minute, dear," whispered his
      wife.

When he re-entered the laboratory his visitor was looking at his watch. "I
      had no idea I had wasted an hour of your time," he said. "Twelve minutes
      to four. I ought to have left here by half-past three. But your things
      were really too interesting. No, positively I cannot stop a moment longer.
      I have an engagement at four."

He passed out of the room reiterating his thanks, and the Bacteriologist
      accompanied him to the door, and then returned thoughtfully along the
      passage to his laboratory. He was musing on the ethnology of his visitor.
      Certainly the man was not a Teutonic type nor a common Latin one. "A
      morbid product, anyhow, I am afraid," said the Bacteriologist to himself.
      "How he gloated over those cultivations of disease germs!" A disturbing
      thought struck him. He turned to the bench by the vapour bath, and then
      very quickly to his writing-table. Then he felt hastily in his pockets and
      then rushed to the door. "I may have put it down on the hall table," he
      said.

"Blue ruin!" cried the Bacteriologist, and incontinently ran to the front
      door and down the steps of his house to the street.

Minnie, hearing the door slam violently, ran in alarm to the window. Down
      the street a slender man was getting into a cab. The Bacteriologist,
      hatless, and in his carpet slippers, was running and gesticulating wildly
      towards this group. One slipper came off, but he did not wait for it. "He
      has gone mad!" said Minnie; "it''s that horrid science of his"; and,
      opening the window, would have called after him. The slender man, suddenly
      glancing round, seemed struck with the same idea of mental disorder. He
      pointed hastily to the Bacteriologist, said something to the cabman, the
      apron of the cab slammed, the whip swished, the horse''s feet clattered,
      and in a moment cab and Bacteriologist hotly in pursuit, had receded up
      the vista of the roadway and disappeared round the corner.

Minnie remained straining out of the window for a minute. Then she drew
      her head back into the room again. She was dumbfounded. "Of course he is
      eccentric," she meditated. "But running about London—in the height
      of the season, too—in his socks!" A happy thought struck her. She
      hastily put her bonnet on, seized his shoes, went into the hall, took down
      his hat and light overcoat from the pegs, emerged upon the doorstep, and
      hailed a cab that opportunely crawled by. "Drive me up the road and round
      Havelock Crescent, and see if we can find a gentleman running about in a
      velveteen coat and no hat."

"Velveteen coat, ma''am, and no ''at. Very good, ma''am." And the cabman
      whipped up at once in the most matter-of-fact way, as if he drove to this
      address every day in his life.

Some few minutes later the little group of cabmen and loafers that
      collects round the cabman''s shelter at Haverstock Hill were startled by
      the passing of a cab with a ginger-coloured screw of a horse, driven
      furiously.

They were silent as it went by, and then as it receded—"That''s ''Arry
      ''Icks. Wot''s he got?" said the stout gentleman known as Old
      Tootles.

"Hullo!" said poor old Tommy Byles; "here''s another bloomin'' loonatic.
      Blowed if there ain''t."

"It''s old George," said Old Tootles, "and he''s drivin'' a loonatic, as
      you say. Ain''t he a-clawin'' out of the keb? Wonder if he''s after ''Arry
      ''Icks?"

The group round the cabman''s shelter became animated. Chorus: "Go it,
      George!" "It''s a race." "You''ll ketch ''em!" "Whip up!"

"Strike me giddy!" cried Old Tootles. "Here! I''m a-goin'' to begin
      in a minute. Here''s another comin''. If all the cabs in Hampstead ain''t
      gone mad this morning!"

Minnie went by in a perfect roar of applause. She did not like it, but she
      felt that she was doing her duty, and whirled on down Haverstock Hill and
      Camden Town High Street with her eyes ever intent on the animated back
      view of old George, who was driving her vagrant husband so
      incomprehensibly away from her.

The man in the foremost cab sat crouched in the corner, his arms tightly
      folded, and the little tube that contained such vast possibilities of
      destruction gripped in his hand. His mood was a singular mixture of fear
      and exultation. Chiefly he was afraid of being caught before he could
      accomplish his purpose, but behind this was a vaguer but larger fear of
      the awfulness of his crime. But his exultation far exceeded his fear. No
      Anarchist before him had ever approached this conception of his. Ravachol,
      Vaillant, all those distinguished persons whose fame he had envied
      dwindled into insignificance beside him. He had only to make sure of the
      water supply, and break the little tube into a reservoir. How brilliantly
      he had planned it, forged the letter of introduction and got into the
      laboratory, and how brilliantly he had seized his opportunity! The world
      should hear of him at last. All those people who had sneered at him,
      neglected him, preferred other people to him, found his company
      undesirable, should consider him at last. Death, death, death! They had
      always treated him as a man of no importance. All the world had been in a
      conspiracy to keep him under. He would teach them yet what it is to
      isolate a man. What was this familiar street? Great Saint Andrew''s Street,
      of course! How fared the chase? He craned out of the cab. The
      Bacteriologist was scarcely fifty yards behind. That was bad. He would be
      caught and stopped yet. He felt in his pocket for money, and found half a
      sovereign. This he thrust up through the trap in the top of the cab into
      the man''s face. "More," he shouted, "if only we get away."

The money was snatched out of his hand. "Right you are," said the cabman,
      and the trap slammed, and the lash lay along the glistening side of the
      horse. The cab swayed, and the Anarchist, half-standing under the trap,
      put the hand containing the little glass tube upon the apron to preserve
      his balance. He felt the brittle thing crack, and the broken half of it
      rang upon the floor of the cab. He fell back into the seat with a curse,
      and stared dismally at the two or three drops of moisture on the apron.

"Well, I suppose I shall be the first. Phew! Anyhow, I shall be a
      Martyr. That''s something. But it is a filthy death, nevertheless. I wonder
      if it hurts as much as they say."

Presently a thought occurred to him—he groped between his feet. A
      little drop was still in the broken end of the tube, and he drank that to
      make sure. It was better to make sure. At any rate, he would not fail.

Then it dawned upon him that there was no further need to escape the
      Bacteriologist. In Wellington Street he told the cabman to stop, and got
      out. He slipped on the step, and his head felt queer. It was rapid stuff,
      this cholera poison. He waved his cabman out of existence, so to speak,
      and stood on the pavement with his arms folded upon his breast awaiting
      the arrival of the Bacteriologist. There was something tragic in his pose.
      The sense of imminent death gave him a certain dignity. He greeted his
      pursuer with a defiant laugh.

The Bacteriologist from his cab beamed curiously at him through his
      spectacles. "You have drunk it! An Anarchist! I see now." He was about to
      say something more, and then checked himself. A smile hung in the corner
      of his mouth. He opened the apron of his cab as if to descend, at which
      the Anarchist waved him a dramatic farewell and strode off towards
      Waterloo Bridge, carefully jostling his infected body against as many
      people as possible. The Bacteriologist was so preoccupied with the vision
      of him that he scarcely manifested the slightest surprise at the
      appearance of Minnie upon the pavement with his hat and shoes and
      overcoat. "Very good of you to bring my things," he said, and remained
      lost in contemplation of the receding figure of the Anarchist.

"You had better get in," he said, still staring. Minnie felt absolutely
      convinced now that he was mad, and directed the cabman home on her own
      responsibility. "Put on my shoes? Certainly, dear," said he, as the cab
      began to turn, and hid the strutting black figure, now small in the
      distance, from his eyes. Then suddenly something grotesque struck him, and
      he laughed. Then he remarked, "It is really very serious, though.

"You see, that man came to my house to see me, and he is an Anarchist. No—don''t
      faint, or I cannot possibly tell you the rest. And I wanted to astonish
      him, not knowing he was an Anarchist, and took up a cultivation of that
      new species of Bacterium I was telling you of that infest, and I think
      cause, the blue patches upon various monkeys; and, like a fool, I said it
      was Asiatic cholera. And he ran away with it to poison the water of
      London, and he certainly might have made things look blue for this
      civilised city. And now he has swallowed it. Of course, I cannot say what
      will happen, but you know it turned that kitten blue, and the three
      puppies—in patches, and the sparrow—bright blue. But the
      bother is, I shall have all the trouble and expense of preparing some
      more.

"Put on my coat on this hot day! Why? Because we might meet Mrs. Jabber.
      My dear, Mrs. Jabber is not a draught. But why should I wear a coat on a
      hot day because of Mrs.——-. Oh! very well."

The buying of orchids always has in it a certain speculative flavour. You
      have before you the brown shrivelled lump of tissue, and for the rest you
      must trust your judgment, or the auctioneer, or your good luck, as your
      taste may incline. The plant may be moribund or dead, or it may be just a
      respectable purchase, fair value for your money, or perhaps—for the
      thing has happened again and again—there slowly unfolds before the
      delighted eyes of the happy purchaser, day after day, some new variety,
      some novel richness, a strange twist of the labellum, or some subtler
      colouration or unexpected mimicry. Pride, beauty, and profit blossom
      together on one delicate green spike, and, it may be, even immortality.
      For the new miracle of nature may stand in need of a new specific name,
      and what so convenient as that of its discoverer? "John-smithia"! There
      have been worse names.

It was perhaps the hope of some such happy discovery that made Winter
      Wedderburn such a frequent attendant at these sales—that hope, and
      also, maybe, the fact that he had nothing else of the slightest interest
      to do in the world. He was a shy, lonely, rather ineffectual man, provided
      with just enough income to keep off the spur of necessity, and not enough
      nervous energy to make him seek any exacting employments. He might have
      collected stamps or coins, or translated Horace, or bound books, or
      invented new species of diatoms. But, as it happened, he grew orchids, and
      had one ambitious little hothouse.

"I have a fancy," he said over his coffee, "that something is going to
      happen to me to-day." He spoke—as he moved and thought—slowly.

"Oh, don''t say that!" said his housekeeper—who was also his
      remote cousin. For "something happening" was a euphemism that meant only
      one thing to her.

"To-day," he continued, after a pause, "Peters'' are going to sell a batch
      of plants from the Andamans and the Indies. I shall go up and see what
      they have. It may be I shall buy something good unawares. That may be it."

"Are these the things collected by that poor young fellow you told me of
      the other day?" asked his cousin, as she filled his cup.

"Nothing ever does happen to me," he remarked presently, beginning to
      think aloud. "I wonder why? Things enough happen to other people. There is
      Harvey. Only the other week; on Monday he picked up sixpence, on Wednesday
      his chicks all had the staggers, on Friday his cousin came home from
      Australia, and on Saturday he broke his ankle. What a whirl of excitement!—compared
      to me."

"I think I would rather be without so much excitement," said his
      housekeeper. "It can''t be good for you."

"I suppose it''s troublesome. Still ... you see, nothing ever happens to
      me. When I was a little boy I never had accidents. I never fell in love as
      I grew up. Never married... I wonder how it feels to have something happen
      to you, something really remarkable.

"That orchid-collector was only thirty-six—twenty years younger than
      myself—when he died. And he had been married twice and divorced
      once; he had had malarial fever four times, and once he broke his thigh.
      He killed a Malay once, and once he was wounded by a poisoned dart. And in
      the end he was killed by jungle-leeches. It must have all been very
      troublesome, but then it must have been very interesting, you know—except,
      perhaps, the leeches."

"Perhaps not." And then Wedderburn looked at his watch. "Twenty-three
      minutes past eight. I am going up by the quarter to twelve train, so that
      there is plenty of time. I think I shall wear my alpaca jacket—it is
      quite warm enough—and my grey felt hat and brown shoes. I suppose—"

He glanced out of the window at the serene sky and sunlit garden, and then
      nervously at his cousin''s face.

"I think you had better take an umbrella if you are going to London," she
      said in a voice that admitted of no denial. "There''s all between here and
      the station coming back."

When he returned he was in a state of mild excitement. He had made a
      purchase. It was rare that he could make up his mind quickly enough to
      buy, but this time he had done so.

"There are Vandas," he said, "and a Dendrobe and some Palaeonophis." He
      surveyed his purchases lovingly as he consumed his soup. They were laid
      out on the spotless tablecloth before him, and he was telling his cousin
      all about them as he slowly meandered through his dinner. It was his
      custom to live all his visits to London over again in the evening for her
      and his own entertainment.

"I knew something would happen to-day. And I have bought all these. Some
      of them—some of them—I feel sure, do you know, that some of
      them will be remarkable. I don''t know how it is, but I feel just as sure
      as if some one had told me that some of these will turn out remarkable.

"That one "—he pointed to a shrivelled rhizome—"was not
      identified. It may be a Palaeonophis—or it may not. It may be a new
      species, or even a new genus. And it was the last that poor Batten ever
      collected."

Wedderburn smiled and surveyed the root with his head on one side. "It is
      certainly not a pretty lump of stuff. But you can never judge of these
      things from their dry appearance. It may turn out to be a very beautiful
      orchid indeed. How busy I shall be to-morrow! I must see to-night just
      exactly what to do with these things, and to-morrow I shall set to work."

"They found poor Batten lying dead, or dying, in a mangrove swamp—I
      forget which," he began again presently, "with one of these very orchids
      crushed up under his body. He had been unwell for some days with some kind
      of native fever, and I suppose he fainted. These mangrove swamps are very
      unwholesome. Every drop of blood, they say, was taken out of him by the
      jungle-leeches. It may be that very plant that cost him his life to
      obtain."

"Fancy dying away from every comfort in a nasty swamp! Fancy being ill of
      fever with nothing to take but chlorodyne and quinine—if men were
      left to themselves they would live on chlorodyne and quinine—and no
      one round you but horrible natives! They say the Andaman islanders are
      most disgusting wretches—and, anyhow, they can scarcely make good
      nurses, not having the necessary training. And just for people in England
      to have orchids!"

"I don''t suppose it was comfortable, but some men seem to enjoy that kind
      of thing," said Wedderburn. "Anyhow, the natives of his party were
      sufficiently civilised to take care of all his collection until his
      colleague, who was an ornithologist, came back again from the interior;
      though they could not tell the species of the orchid, and had let it
      wither. And it makes these things more interesting."

"It makes them disgusting. I should be afraid of some of the malaria
      clinging to them. And just think, there has been a dead body lying across
      that ugly thing! I never thought of that before. There! I declare I cannot
      eat another mouthful of dinner."

"I will take them off the table if you like, and put them in the
      window-seat. I can see them just as well there."

The next few days he was indeed singularly busy in his steamy little
      hothouse, fussing about with charcoal, lumps of teak, moss, and all the
      other mysteries of the orchid cultivator. He considered he was having a
      wonderfully eventful time. In the evening he would talk about these new
      orchids to his friends, and over and over again he reverted to his
      expectation of something strange.

Several of the Vandas and the Dendrobium died under his care, but
      presently the strange orchid began to show signs of life. He was
      delighted, and took his housekeeper right away from jam-making to see it
      at once, directly he made the discovery.

"That is a bud," he said, "and presently there will be a lot of leaves
      there, and those little things coming out here are aerial rootlets."

"They look to me like little white fingers poking out of the brown," said
      his housekeeper. "I don''t like them."

"I don''t know. They look like fingers trying to get at you. I can''t help
      my likes and dislikes."

"I don''t know for certain, but I don''t think there are any orchids
      I know that have aerial rootlets quite like that. It may be my fancy, of
      course. You see they are a little flattened at the ends."

"I don''t like ''em," said his housekeeper, suddenly shivering and turning
      away. "I know it''s very silly of me—and I''m very sorry, particularly
      as you like the thing so much. But I can''t help thinking of that corpse."

Wedderburn felt a little hurt at her dislike to the plant. But that did
      not prevent his talking to her about orchids generally, and this orchid in
      particular, whenever he felt inclined.

"There are such queer things about orchids," he said one day; "such
      possibilities of surprises. You know, Darwin studied their fertilisation,
      and showed that the whole structure of an ordinary orchid flower was
      contrived in order that moths might carry the pollen from plant to plant.
      Well, it seems that there are lots of orchids known the flower of which
      cannot possibly be used for fertilisation in that way. Some of the
      Cypripediums, for instance; there are no insects known that can possibly
      fertilise them, and some of them have never been found with seed."

"By runners and tubers, and that kind of outgrowth. That is easily
      explained. The puzzle is, what are the flowers for?

"Very likely," he added, "my orchid may be something extraordinary
      in that way. If so I shall study it. I have often thought of making
      researches as Darwin did. But hitherto I have not found the time, or
      something else has happened to prevent it. The leaves are beginning to
      unfold now. I do wish you would come and see them!"

But she said that the orchid-house was so hot it gave her the headache.
      She had seen the plant once again, and the aerial rootlets, which were now
      some of them more than a foot long, had unfortunately reminded her of
      tentacles reaching out after something; and they got into her dreams,
      growing after her with incredible rapidity. So that she had settled to her
      entire satisfaction that she would not see that plant again, and
      Wedderburn had to admire its leaves alone. They were of the ordinary broad
      form, and a deep glossy green, with splashes and dots of deep red towards
      the base He knew of no other leaves quite like them. The plant was placed
      on a low bench near the thermometer, and close by was a simple arrangement
      by which a tap dripped on the hot-water pipes and kept the air steamy. And
      he spent his afternoons now with some regularity meditating on the
      approaching flowering of this strange plant.

And at last the great thing happened. Directly he entered the little glass
      house he knew that the spike had burst out, although his great Paloeonophis
      Lowii hid the corner where his new darling stood. There was a new
      odour in the air, a rich, intensely sweet scent, that overpowered every
      other in that crowded, steaming little greenhouse.

Directly he noticed this he hurried down to the strange orchid. And,
      behold! the trailing green spikes bore now three great splashes of
      blossom, from which this overpowering sweetness proceeded. He stopped
      before them in an ecstasy of admiration.

The flowers were white, with streaks of golden orange upon the petals; the
      heavy labellum was coiled into an intricate projection, and a wonderful
      bluish purple mingled there with the gold. He could see at once that the
      genus was altogether a new one. And the insufferable scent! How hot the
      place was! The blossoms swam before his eyes.

He would see if the temperature was right. He made a step towards the
      thermometer. Suddenly everything appeared unsteady. The bricks on the
      floor were dancing up and down. Then the white blossoms, the green leaves
      behind them, the whole greenhouse, seemed to sweep sideways, and then in a
      curve upward.

At half-past four his cousin made the tea, according to their invariable
      custom. But Wedderburn did not come in for his tea.

"He is worshipping that horrid orchid," she told herself, and waited ten
      minutes. "His watch must have stopped. I will go and call him."

She went straight to the hothouse, and, opening the door, called his name.
      There was no reply. She noticed that the air was very close, and loaded
      with an intense perfume. Then she saw something lying on the bricks
      between the hot-water pipes.

He was lying, face upward, at the foot of the strange orchid. The
      tentacle-like aerial rootlets no longer swayed freely in the air, but were
      crowded together, a tangle of grey ropes, and stretched tight, with their
      ends closely applied to his chin and neck and hands.

She did not understand. Then she saw from under one of the exultant
      tentacles upon his cheek there trickled a little thread of blood.

With an inarticulate cry she ran towards him, and tried to pull him away
      from the leech-like suckers. She snapped two of these tentacles, and their
      sap dripped red.

Then the overpowering scent of the blossom began to make her head reel.
      How they clung to him! She tore at the tough ropes, and he and the white
      inflorescence swam about her. She felt she was fainting, knew she must
      not. She left him and hastily opened the nearest door, and, after she had
      panted for a moment in the fresh air, she had a brilliant inspiration. She
      caught up a flower-pot and smashed in the windows at the end of the
      greenhouse. Then she re-entered. She tugged now with renewed strength at
      Wedderburn''s motionless body, and brought the strange orchid crashing to
      the floor. It still clung with the grimmest tenacity to its victim. In a
      frenzy, she lugged it and him into the open air.

Then she thought of tearing through the sucker rootlets one by one, and in
      another minute she had released him and was dragging him away from the
      horror.

The odd-job man was coming up the garden, amazed at the smashing of glass,
      and saw her emerge, hauling the inanimate body with red-stained hands. For
      a moment he thought impossible things.

"Bring some water!" she cried, and her voice dispelled his fancies. When,
      with unnatural alacrity, he returned with the water, he found her weeping
      with excitement, and with Wedderburn''s head upon her knee, wiping the
      blood from his face.

"What''s the matter?" said Wedderburn, opening his eyes feebly, and closing
      them again at once.

"Go and tell Annie to come out here to me, and then go for Dr. Haddon at
      once," she said to the odd-job man so soon as he brought the water; and
      added, seeing he hesitated, "I will tell you all about it when you come
      back."

Presently Wedderburn opened his eyes again, and, seeing that he was
      troubled by the puzzle of his position, she explained to him, "You fainted
      in the hothouse."

Wedderburn had lost a good deal of blood, but beyond that he had suffered
      no very great injury. They gave him brandy mixed with some pink extract of
      meat, and carried him upstairs to bed. His housekeeper told her incredible
      story in fragments to Dr. Haddon. "Come to the orchid-house and see," she
      said.

The cold outer air was blowing in through the open door, and the sickly
      perfume was almost dispelled. Most of the torn aerial rootlets lay already
      withered amidst a number of dark stains upon the bricks. The stem of the
      inflorescence was broken by the fall of the plant, and the flowers were
      growing limp and brown at the edges of the petals. The doctor stooped
      towards it, then saw that one of the aerial rootlets still stirred feebly,
      and hesitated.

The next morning the strange orchid still lay there, black now and
      putrescent. The door banged intermittently in the morning breeze, and all
      the array of Wedderburn''s orchids was shrivelled and prostrate. But
      Wedderburn himself was bright and garrulous upstairs in the glory of his
      strange adventure.

The observatory at Avu, in Borneo, stands on the spur of the mountain. To
      the north rises the old crater, black at night against the unfathomable
      blue of the sky. From the little circular building, with its mushroom
      dome, the slopes plunge steeply downward into the black mysteries of the
      tropical forest beneath. The little house in which the observer and his
      assistant live is about fifty yards from the observatory, and beyond this
      are the huts of their native attendants.

Thaddy, the chief observer, was down with a slight fever. His assistant,
      Woodhouse, paused for a moment in silent contemplation of the tropical
      night before commencing his solitary vigil. The night was very still. Now
      and then voices and laughter came from the native huts, or the cry of some
      strange animal was heard from the midst of the mystery of the forest.
      Nocturnal insects appeared in ghostly fashion out of the darkness, and
      fluttered round his light. He thought, perhaps, of all the possibilities
      of discovery that still lay in the black tangle beneath him; for to the
      naturalist the virgin forests of Borneo are still a wonderland full of
      strange questions and half-suspected discoveries. Woodhouse carried a
      small lantern in his hand, and its yellow glow contrasted vividly with the
      infinite series of tints between lavender-blue and black in which the
      landscape was painted. His hands and face were smeared with ointment
      against the attacks of the mosquitoes.

Even in these days of celestial photography, work done in a purely
      temporary erection, and with only the most primitive appliances in
      addition to the telescope, still involves a very large amount of cramped
      and motionless watching. He sighed as he thought of the physical fatigues
      before him, stretched himself, and entered the observatory.

The reader is probably familiar with the structure of an ordinary
      astronomical observatory. The building is usually cylindrical in shape,
      with a very light hemispherical roof capable of being turned round from
      the interior. The telescope is supported upon a stone pillar in the
      centre, and a clockwork arrangement compensates for the earth''s rotation,
      and allows a star once found to be continuously observed. Besides this,
      there is a compact tracery of wheels and screws about its point of
      support, by which the astronomer adjusts it. There is, of course, a slit
      in the movable roof which follows the eye of the telescope in its survey
      of the heavens. The observer sits or lies on a sloping wooden arrangement,
      which he can wheel to any part of the observatory as the position of the
      telescope may require. Within it is advisable to have things as dark as
      possible, in order to enhance the brilliance of the stars observed.

The lantern flared as Woodhouse entered his circular den, and the general
      darkness fled into black shadows behind the big machine, from which it
      presently seemed to creep back over the whole place again as the light
      waned. The slit was a profound transparent blue, in which six stars shone
      with tropical brilliance, and their light lay, a pallid gleam, along the
      black tube of the instrument. Woodhouse shifted the roof, and then
      proceeding to the telescope, turned first one wheel and then another, the
      great cylinder slowly swinging into a new position. Then he glanced
      through the finder, the little companion telescope, moved the roof a
      little more, made some further adjustments, and set the clockwork in
      motion. He took off his jacket, for the night was very hot, and pushed
      into position the uncomfortable seat to which he was condemned for the
      next four hours. Then with a sigh he resigned himself to his watch upon
      the mysteries of space.

There was no sound now in the observatory, and the lantern waned steadily.
      Outside there was the occasional cry of some animal in alarm or pain, or
      calling to its mate, and the intermittent sounds of the Malay and Dyak
      servants. Presently one of the men began a queer chanting song, in which
      the others joined at intervals. After this it would seem that they turned
      in for the night, for no further sound came from their direction, and the
      whispering stillness became more and more profound.

The clockwork ticked steadily. The shrill hum of a mosquito explored the
      place and grew shriller in indignation at Woodhouse''s ointment. Then the
      lantern went out and all the observatory was black.

Woodhouse shifted his position presently, when the slow movement of the
      telescope had carried it beyond the limits of his comfort.

He was watching a little group of stars in the Milky Way, in one of which
      his chief had seen or fancied a remarkable colour variability. It was not
      a part of the regular work for which the establishment existed, and for
      that reason perhaps Woodhouse was deeply interested. He must have
      forgotten things terrestrial. All his attention was concentrated upon the
      great blue circle of the telescope field—a circle powdered, so it
      seemed, with an innumerable multitude of stars, and all luminous against
      the blackness of its setting. As he watched he seemed to himself to become
      incorporeal, as if he too were floating in the ether of space. Infinitely
      remote was the faint red spot he was observing.

Suddenly the stars were blotted out. A flash of blackness passed, and they
      were visible again.

The thing happened again, and immediately after the great tube shivered as
      though it had been struck. Then the dome of the observatory resounded with
      a series of thundering blows. The stars seemed to sweep aside as the
      telescope—which had been unclamped—swung round and away from
      the slit in the roof.

Some huge vague black shape, with a flapping something like a wing, seemed
      to be struggling in the aperture of the roof. In another moment the slit
      was clear again, and the luminous haze of the Milky Way shone warm and
      bright.

The interior of the roof was perfectly black, and only a scraping sound
      marked the whereabouts of the unknown creature.

Woodhouse had scrambled from the seat to his feet. He was trembling
      violently and in a perspiration with the suddenness of the occurrence. Was
      the thing, whatever it was, inside or out? It was big, whatever else it
      might be. Something shot across the skylight, and the telescope swayed. He
      started violently and put his arm up. It was in the observatory, then,
      with him. It was clinging to the roof apparently. What the devil was it?
      Could it see him?

He stood for perhaps a minute in a state of stupefaction. The beast,
      whatever it was, clawed at the interior of the dome, and then something
      flapped almost into his face, and he saw the momentary gleam of starlight
      on a skin like oiled leather. His water-bottle was knocked off his little
      table with a smash.

The sense of some strange bird-creature hovering a few yards from his face
      in the darkness was indescribably unpleasant to Woodhouse. As his thought
      returned he concluded that it must be some night-bird or large bat. At any
      risk he would see what it was, and pulling a match from his pocket, he
      tried to strike it on the telescope seat. There was a smoking streak of
      phosphorescent light, the match flared for a moment, and he saw a vast
      wing sweeping towards him, a gleam of grey-brown fur, and then he was
      struck in the face and the match knocked out of his hand. The blow was
      aimed at his temple, and a claw tore sideways down to his cheek. He reeled
      and fell, and he heard the extinguished lantern smash. Another blow
      followed as he fell. He was partly stunned, he felt his own warm blood
      stream out upon his face. Instinctively he felt his eyes had been struck
      at, and, turning over on his face to save them, tried to crawl under the
      protection of the telescope.

He was struck again upon the back, and he heard his jacket rip, and then
      the thing hit the roof of the observatory. He edged as far as he could
      between the wooden seat and the eyepiece of the instrument, and turned his
      body round so that it was chiefly his feet that were exposed. With these
      he could at least kick. He was still in a mystified state. The strange
      beast banged about in the darkness, and presently clung to the telescope,
      making it sway and the gear rattle. Once it flapped near him, and he
      kicked out madly and felt a soft body with his feet. He was horribly
      scared now. It must be a big thing to swing the telescope like that. He
      saw for a moment the outline of a head black against the starlight, with
      sharply-pointed upstanding ears and a crest between them. It seemed to him
      to be as big as a mastiff''s. Then he began to bawl out as loudly as he
      could for help.

At that the thing came down upon him again. As it did so his hand touched
      something beside him on the floor. He kicked out, and the next moment his
      ankle was gripped and held by a row of keen teeth. He yelled again, and
      tried to free his leg by kicking with the other. Then he realised he had
      the broken water-bottle at his hand, and, snatching it, he struggled into
      a sitting posture, and feeling in the darkness towards his foot, gripped a
      velvety ear, like the ear of a big cat. He had seized the water-bottle by
      its neck and brought it down with a shivering crash upon the head of the
      strange beast. He repeated the blow, and then stabbed and jabbed with the
      jagged end of it, in the darkness, where he judged the face might be.

The small teeth relaxed their hold, and at once Woodhouse pulled his leg
      free and kicked hard. He felt the sickening feel of fur and bone giving
      under his boot. There was a tearing bite at his arm, and he struck over it
      at the face, as he judged, and hit damp fur.

There was a pause; then he heard the sound of claws; and the dragging of a
      heavy body away from him over the observatory floor. Then there was
      silence, broken only by his own sobbing breathing, and a sound like
      licking. Everything was black except the parallelogram of the blue
      skylight with the luminous dust of stars, against which the end of the
      telescope now appeared in silhouette. He waited, as it seemed, an
      interminable time.

Was the thing coming on again? He felt in his trouser-pocket for some
      matches, and found one remaining. He tried to strike this, but the floor
      was wet, and it spat and went out. He cursed. He could not see where the
      door was situated. In his struggle he had quite lost his bearings. The
      strange beast, disturbed by the splutter of the match, began to move
      again. "Time!" called Woodhouse, with a sudden gleam of mirth, but the
      thing was not coming at him again. He must have hurt it, he thought, with
      the broken bottle. He felt a dull pain in his ankle. Probably he was
      bleeding there. He wondered if it would support him if he tried to stand
      up. The night outside was very still. There was no sound of any one
      moving. The sleepy fools had not heard those wings battering upon the
      dome, nor his shouts. It was no good wasting strength in shouting. The
      monster flapped its wings and startled him into a defensive attitude. He
      hit his elbow against the seat, and it fell over with a crash. He cursed
      this, and then he cursed the darkness.

Suddenly the oblong patch of starlight seemed to sway to and fro. Was he
      going to faint? It would never do to faint. He clenched his fists and set
      his teeth to hold himself together. Where had the door got to? It occurred
      to him he could get his bearings by the stars visible through the
      skylight. The patch of stars he saw was in Sagittarius and south-eastward;
      the door was north—or was it north by west? He tried to think. If he
      could get the door open he might retreat. It might be the thing was
      wounded. The suspense was beastly. "Look here!" he said, "if you don''t
      come on, I shall come at you."

Then the thing began clambering up the side of the observatory, and he saw
      its black outline gradually blot out the skylight. Was it in retreat? He
      forgot about the door, and watched as the dome shifted and creaked.
      Somehow he did not feel very frightened or excited now. He felt a curious
      sinking sensation inside him. The sharply-defined patch of light, with the
      black form moving across it, seemed to be growing smaller and smaller.
      That was curious. He began to feel very thirsty, and yet he did not feel
      inclined to get anything to drink. He seemed to be sliding down a long
      funnel.

He felt a burning sensation in his throat, and then he perceived it was
      broad daylight, and that one of the Dyak servants was looking at him with
      a curious expression. Then there was the top of Thaddy''s face upside down.
      Funny fellow, Thaddy, to go about like that! Then he grasped the situation
      better, and perceived that his head was on Thaddy''s knee, and Thaddy was
      giving him brandy. And then he saw the eyepiece of the telescope with a
      lot of red smears on it. He began to remember.

The Dyak boy was beating up an egg in brandy. Woodhouse took this and sat
      up. He felt a sharp twinge of pain. His ankle was tied up, so were his arm
      and the side of his face. The smashed glass, red-stained, lay about the
      floor, the telescope seat was overturned, and by the opposite wall was a
      dark pool. The door was open, and he saw the grey summit of the mountain
      against a brilliant background of blue sky.

"You know that best," said Thaddy. "But, anyhow, don''t worry
      yourself now about it. Have some more to drink."

Thaddy, however, was curious enough, and it was a hard struggle between
      duty and inclination to keep Woodhouse quiet until he was decently put
      away in bed, and had slept upon the copious dose of meat extract Thaddy
      considered advisable. They then talked it over together.

"It was," said Woodhouse, "more like a big bat than anything else in the
      world. It had sharp, short ears, and soft fur, and its wings were
      leathery. Its teeth were little but devilish sharp, and its jaw could not
      have been very strong or else it would have bitten through my ankle."

"It seemed to me to hit out with its claws pretty freely. That is about as
      much as I know about the beast. Our conversation was intimate, so to
      speak, and yet not confidential."

"The Dyak chaps talk about a Big Colugo, a Klang-utang—whatever that
      may be. It does not often attack man, but I suppose you made it nervous.
      They say there is a Big Colugo and a Little Colugo, and a something else
      that sounds like gobble. They all fly about at night. For my own part, I
      know there are flying foxes and flying lemurs about here, but they are
      none of them very big beasts."

"There are more things in heaven and earth," said Woodhouse—and
      Thaddy groaned at the quotation—"and more particularly in the
      forests of Borneo, than are dreamt of in our philosophies. On the whole,
      if the Borneo fauna is going to disgorge any more of its novelties upon
      me, I should prefer that it did so when I was not occupied in the
      observatory at night and alone."

"Chiefly," said I. — "Anything new? I thought not. I did
      these islands twenty-five— twenty-seven years ago. If you find
      anything new here—well, it''s brand new. I didn''t leave much."

"I''m not a collector," said I. — "I was young then," he went on.
      "Lord! how I used to fly round." He seemed to take my measure. "I was in
      the East Indies two years, and in Brazil seven. Then I went to
      Madagascar."

"Butcher—Butcher?" The name seemed vaguely present in my memory;
      then I recalled Butcher v. Dawson. "Why!" said I, "you are
      the man who sued them for four years'' salary—got cast away on a
      desert island..."

"Your servant," said the man with the scar, bowing. "Funny case, wasn''t
      it? Here was me, making a little fortune on that island, doing nothing for
      it neither, and them quite unable to give me notice. It often used to
      amuse me thinking over it while I was there. I did calculations of it—big—all
      over the blessed atoll in ornamental figuring."

"Rather. Andrews was telling me of a new species he was working on only a
      month or so ago. Just before I sailed. They''ve got a thigh bone, it seems,
      nearly a yard long. Monster the thing must have been!"

"I believe you," said the man with the scar. "It was a monster.
      Sindbad''s roc was just a legend of ''em. But when did they find these
      bones?"

"Why? Because I found them—Lord!—it''s nearly twenty
      years ago. If Dawson''s hadn''t been silly about that salary they might have
      made a perfect ring in ''em... I couldn''t help the infernal boat
      going adrift."

He paused. "I suppose it''s the same place. A kind of swamp about ninety
      miles north of Antananarivo. Do you happen to know? You have to go to it
      along the coast by boats. You don''t happen to remember, perhaps?"

"It must be the same. It''s on the east coast. And somehow there''s
      something in the water that keeps things from decaying. Like creosote it
      smells. It reminded me of Trinidad. Did they get any more eggs? Some of
      the eggs I found were a foot-and-a-half long. The swamp goes circling
      round, you know, and cuts off this bit. It''s mostly salt, too. Well...
      What a time I had of it! I found the things quite by accident. We went for
      eggs, me and two native chaps, in one of those rum canoes all tied
      together, and found the bones at the same time. We had a tent and
      provisions for four days, and we pitched on one of the firmer places. To
      think of it brings that odd tarry smell back even now. It''s funny work.
      You go probing into the mud with iron rods, you know. Usually the egg gets
      smashed. I wonder how long it is since these AEpyornises really lived. The
      missionaries say the natives have legends about when they were alive, but
      I never heard any such stories myself.[*] But certainly those eggs we got
      were as fresh as if they had been new laid. Fresh! Carrying them down to
      the boat one of my nigger chaps dropped one on a rock and it smashed. How
      I lammed into the beggar! But sweet it was, as if it was new laid, not
      even smelly, and its mother dead these four hundred years, perhaps. Said a
      centipede had bit him. However, I''m getting off the straight with the
      story. It had taken us all day to dig into the slush and get these eggs
      out unbroken, and we were all covered with beastly black mud, and
      naturally I was cross. So far as I knew they were the only eggs that have
      ever been got out not even cracked. I went afterwards to see the ones they
      have at the Natural History Museum in London; all of them were cracked and
      just stuck together like a mosaic, and bits missing. Mine were perfect,
      and I meant to blow them when I got back. Naturally I was annoyed at the
      silly duffer dropping three hours'' work just on account of a centipede. I
      hit him about rather."

[ No European is known to
      have seen a live AEpyornis, with the doubtful exception of MacAndrew, who
      visited Madagascar in 1745.—H.G.W.]

The man with the scar took out a clay pipe. I placed my pouch before him.
      He filled up absent-mindedly.

"That''s the queer part of the story. I had three others. Perfectly fresh
      eggs. Well, we put ''em in the boat, and then I went up to the tent to make
      some coffee, leaving my two heathens down by the beach—the one
      fooling about with his sting and the other helping him. It never occurred
      to me that the beggars would take advantage of the peculiar position I was
      in to pick a quarrel. But I suppose the centipede poison and the kicking I
      had given him had upset the one—he was always a cantankerous sort—and
      he persuaded the other.

"I remember I was sitting and smoking and boiling up the water over a
      spirit-lamp business I used to take on these expeditions. Incidentally I
      was admiring the swamp under the sunset. All black and blood-red it was,
      in streaks—a beautiful sight. And up beyond the land rose grey and
      hazy to the hills, and the sky behind them red, like a furnace mouth. And
      fifty yards behind the back of me was these blessed heathen—quite
      regardless of the tranquil air of things—plotting to cut off with
      the boat and leave me all alone with three days'' provisions and a canvas
      tent, and nothing to drink whatsoever beyond a little keg of water. I
      heard a kind of yelp behind me, and there they were in this canoe affair—it
      wasn''t properly a boat—and, perhaps, twenty yards from land. I
      realised what was up in a moment. My gun was in the tent, and, besides, I
      had no bullets—only duck shot. They knew that. But I had a little
      revolver in my pocket, and I pulled that out as I ran down to the beach.

"They jabbered something at me, and the man that broke the egg jeered. I
      aimed at the other—because he was unwounded and had the paddle, and
      I missed. They laughed. However, I wasn''t beat. I knew I had to keep cool,
      and I tried him again and made him jump with the whang of it. He didn''t
      laugh that time. The third time I got his head, and over he went, and the
      paddle with him. It was a precious lucky shot for a revolver. I reckon it
      was fifty yards. He went right under. I don''t know if he was shot, or
      simply stunned and drowned. Then I began to shout to the other chap to
      come back, but he huddled up in the canoe and refused to answer. So I
      fired out my revolver at him and never got near him.

"I felt a precious fool, I can tell you. There I was on this rotten, black
      beach, flat swamp all behind me, and the flat sea, cold after the sun set,
      and just this black canoe drifting steadily out to sea. I tell you I
      damned Dawson''s and Jamrach''s and Museums and all the rest of it just to
      rights. I bawled to this nigger to come back, until my voice went up into
      a scream.

"There was nothing for it but to swim after him and take my luck with the
      sharks. So I opened my clasp-knife and put it in my mouth, and took off my
      clothes and waded in. As soon as I was in the water I lost sight of the
      canoe, but I aimed, as I judged, to head it off. I hoped the man in it was
      too bad to navigate it, and that it would keep on drifting in the same
      direction. Presently it came up over the horizon again to the
      south-westward about. The afterglow of sunset was well over now and the
      dim of night creeping up. The stars were coming through the blue. I swum
      like a champion, though my legs and arms were soon aching.

"However, I came up to him by the time the stars were fairly out. As it
      got darker I began to see all manner of glowing things in the water—
      phosphorescence, you know. At times it made me giddy. I hardly knew which
      was stars and which was phosphorescence, and whether I was swimming on my
      head or my heels. The canoe was as black as sin, and the ripple under the
      bows like liquid fire. I was naturally chary of clambering up into it. I
      was anxious to see what he was up to first. He seemed to be lying cuddled
      up in a lump in the bows, and the stern was all out of water. The thing
      kept turning round slowly as it drifted—-kind of waltzing, don''t you
      know. I went to the stern and pulled it down, expecting him to wake up.
      Then I began to clamber in with my knife in my hand, and ready for a rush.
      But he never stirred. So there I sat in the stern of the little canoe,
      drifting away over the calm phosphorescent sea, and with all the host of
      the stars above me, waiting for something to happen.

"After a long time I called him by name, but he never answered. I was too
      tired to take any risks by going along to him. So we sat there. I fancy I
      dozed once or twice. When the dawn came I saw he was as dead as a doornail
      and all puffed up and purple. My three eggs and the bones were lying in
      the middle of the canoe, and the keg of water and some coffee and biscuits
      wrapped in a Cape Argus by his feet, and a tin of methylated spirit
      underneath him. There was no paddle, nor, in fact, anything except the
      spirit-tin that I could use as one, so I settled to drift until I was
      picked up. I held an inquest on him, brought in a verdict against some
      snake, scorpion, or centipede unknown, and sent him overboard.

"After that I had a drink of water and a few biscuits, and took a look
      round. I suppose a man low down as I was don''t see very far; leastways,
      Madagascar was clean out of sight, and any trace of land at all. I saw a
      sail going south-westward—looked like a schooner but her hull never
      came up. Presently the sun got high in the sky and began to beat down upon
      me. Lord! it pretty near made my brains boil. I tried dipping my head in
      the sea, but after a while my eye fell on the Cape Argus, and I lay
      down flat in the canoe and spread this over me. Wonderful things these
      newspapers! I never read one through thoroughly before, but it''s odd what
      you get up to when you''re alone, as I was. I suppose I read that blessed
      old Cape Argus twenty times. The pitch in the canoe simply reeked
      with the heat and rose up into big blisters.

"I drifted ten days," said the man with the scar. "It''s a little thing in
      the telling, isn''t it? Every day was like the last. Except in the morning
      and the evening I never kept a look-out even—the blaze was so
      infernal. I didn''t see a sail after the first three days, and those I saw
      took no notice of me. About the sixth night a ship went by scarcely half a
      mile away from me, with all its lights ablaze and its ports open, looking
      like a big firefly. There was music aboard. I stood up and shouted and
      screamed at it. The second day I broached one of the AEpyornis eggs,
      scraped the shell away at the end bit by bit, and tried it, and I was glad
      to find it was good enough to eat. A bit flavoury—not bad, I mean—but
      with something of the taste of a duck''s egg. There was a kind of circular
      patch, about six inches across, on one side of the yoke, and with streaks
      of blood and a white mark like a ladder in it that I thought queer, but I
      did not understand what this meant at the time, and I wasn''t inclined to
      be particular. The egg lasted me three days, with biscuits and a drink of
      water. I chewed coffee berries too—invigorating stuff. The second
      egg I opened about the eighth day, and it scared me."

"I daresay you find it hard to believe. I did, with the thing
      before me. There the egg had been, sunk in that cold black mud, perhaps
      three hundred years. But there was no mistaking it. There was the—what
      is it?—embryo, with its big head and curved back, and its heart
      beating under its throat, and the yolk shrivelled up and great membranes
      spreading inside of the shell and all over the yolk. Here was I hatching
      out the eggs of the biggest of all extinct birds, in a little canoe in the
      midst of the Indian Ocean. If old Dawson had known that! It was worth four
      years'' salary. What do you think?

"However, I had to eat that precious thing up, every bit of it, before I
      sighted the reef, and some of the mouthfuls were beastly unpleasant. I
      left the third one alone. I held it up to the light, but the shell was too
      thick for me to get any notion of what might be happening inside; and
      though I fancied I heard blood pulsing, it might have been the rustle in
      my own ears, like what you listen to in a seashell.

"Then came the atoll. Came out of the sunrise, as it were, suddenly, close
      up to me. I drifted straight towards it until I was about half a mile from
      shore, not more, and then the current took a turn, and I had to paddle as
      hard as I could with my hands and bits of the AEpyornis shell to make the
      place. However, I got there. It was just a common atoll about four miles
      round, with a few trees growing and a spring in one place, and the lagoon
      full of parrot-fish. I took the egg ashore and put it in a good place,
      well above the tide lines and in the sun, to give it all the chance I
      could, and pulled the canoe up safe, and loafed about prospecting. It''s
      rum how dull an atoll is. As soon as I had found a spring all the interest
      seemed to vanish. When I was a kid I thought nothing could be finer or
      more adventurous than the Robinson Crusoe business, but that place was as
      monotonous as a book of sermons. I went round finding eatable things and
      generally thinking; but I tell you I was bored to death before the first
      day was out. It shows my luck—the very day I landed the weather
      changed. A thunderstorm went by to the north and flicked its wing over the
      island, and in the night there came a drencher and a howling wind slap
      over us. It wouldn''t have taken much, you know, to upset that canoe.

"I was sleeping under the canoe, and the egg was luckily among the sand
      higher up the beach, and the first thing I remember was a sound like a
      hundred pebbles hitting the boat at once, and a rush of water over my
      body. I''d been dreaming of Antananarivo, and I sat up and holloaed to
      Intoshi to ask her what the devil was up, and clawed out at the chair
      where the matches used to be. Then I remembered where I was. There were
      phosphorescent waves rolling up as if they meant to eat me, and all the
      rest of the night as black as pitch. The air was simply yelling. The
      clouds seemed down on your head almost, and the rain fell as if heaven was
      sinking and they were baling out the waters above the firmament. One great
      roller came writhing at me, like a fiery serpent, and I bolted. Then I
      thought of the canoe, and ran down to it as the water went hissing back
      again; but the thing had gone. I wondered about the egg then, and felt my
      way to it. It was all right and well out of reach of the maddest waves, so
      I sat down beside it and cuddled it for company. Lord! what a night that
      was!

"The storm was over before the morning. There wasn''t a rag of cloud left
      in the sky when the dawn came, and all along the beach there were bits of
      plank scattered—which was the disarticulated skeleton, so to speak,
      of my canoe. However, that gave me something to do, for, taking advantage
      of two of the trees being together, I rigged up a kind of storm-shelter
      with these vestiges. And that day the egg hatched.

"Hatched, sir, when my head was pillowed on it and I was asleep. I heard a
      whack and felt a jar and sat up, and there was the end of the egg pecked
      out and a rum little brown head looking out at me. ''Lord!'' I said, ''you''re
      welcome''; and with a little difficulty he came out.

"He was a nice friendly little chap at first, about the size of a small
      hen—very much like most other young birds, only bigger. His plumage
      was a dirty brown to begin with, with a sort of grey scab that fell off it
      very soon, and scarcely feathers—a kind of downy hair. I can hardly
      express how pleased I was to see him. I tell you, Robinson Crusoe don''t
      make near enough of his loneliness. But here was interesting company. He
      looked at me and winked his eye from the front backwards, like a hen, and
      gave a chirp and began to peck about at once, as though being hatched
      three hundred years too late was just nothing. ''Glad to see you, Man
      Friday!'' says I, for I had naturally settled he was to be called Man
      Friday if ever he was hatched, as soon as ever I found the egg in the
      canoe had developed. I was a bit anxious about his feed, so I gave him a
      lump of raw parrot-fish at once. He took it, and opened his beak for more.
      I was glad of that for, under the circumstances, if he''d been at all
      fanciful, I should have had to eat him after all.

"You''d be surprised what an interesting bird that AEpyornis chick was. He
      followed me about from the very beginning. He used to stand by me and
      watch while I fished in the lagoon, and go shares in anything I caught.
      And he was sensible, too. There were nasty green warty things, like
      pickled gherkins, used to lie about on the beach, and he tried one of
      these and it upset him. He never even looked at any of them again.

"And he grew. You could almost see him grow. And as I was never much of a
      society man, his quiet, friendly ways suited me to a T. For nearly two
      years we were as happy as we could be on that island. I had no business
      worries, for I knew my salary was mounting up at Dawsons''. We would see a
      sail now and then, but nothing ever came near us. I amused myself, too, by
      decorating the island with designs worked in sea-urchins and fancy shells
      of various kinds. I put AEPYORNIS ISLAND all round the place very nearly,
      in big letters, like what you see done with coloured stones at railway
      stations in the old country, and mathematical calculations and drawings of
      various sorts. And I used to lie watching the blessed bird stalking round
      and growing, growing; and think how I could make a living out of him by
      showing him about if I ever got taken off. After his first moult he began
      to get handsome, with a crest and a blue wattle, and a lot of green
      feathers at the behind of him. And then I used to puzzle whether Dawsons''
      had any right to claim him or not. Stormy weather and in the rainy season
      we lay snug under the shelter I had made out of the old canoe, and I used
      to tell him lies about my friends at home. And after a storm we would go
      round the island together to see if there was any drift. It was a kind of
      idyll, you might say. If only I had had some tobacco it would have been
      simply just like heaven.

"It was about the end of the second year our little paradise went wrong.
      Friday was then about fourteen feet high to the bill of him, with a big,
      broad head like the end of a pickaxe, and two huge brown eyes with yellow
      rims, set together like a man''s—not out of sight of each other like
      a hen''s. His plumage was fine—none of the half-mourning style of
      your ostrich—more like a cassowary as far as colour and texture go.
      And then it was he began to cock his comb at me and give himself airs, and
      show signs of a nasty temper ...

"At last came a time when my fishing had been rather unlucky, and he began
      to hang about me in a queer, meditative way. I thought he might have been
      eating sea-cucumbers or something, but it was really just discontent on
      his part. I was hungry too, and when at last I landed a fish I wanted it
      for myself. Tempers were short that morning on both sides. He pecked at it
      and grabbed it, and I gave him a whack on the head to make him leave go.
      And at that he went for me. Lord! ...

"He gave me this in the face." The man indicated his scar. "Then he kicked
      me. It was like a carthorse. I got up, and seeing he hadn''t finished, I
      started off full tilt with my arms doubled up over my face. But he ran on
      those gawky legs of his faster than a racehorse, and kept landing out at
      me with sledgehammer kicks, and bringing his pickaxe down on the back of
      my head. I made for the lagoon, and went in up to my neck. He stopped at
      the water, for he hated getting his feet wet, and began to make a shindy,
      something like a peacock''s, only hoarser. He started strutting up and down
      the beach. I''ll admit I felt small to see this blessed fossil lording it
      there. And my head and face were all bleeding, and—well, my body
      just one jelly of bruises.

"I decided to swim across the lagoon and leave him alone for a bit, until
      the affair blew over. I shinned up the tallest palm-tree, and sat there
      thinking of it all. I don''t suppose I ever felt so hurt by anything before
      or since. It was the brutal ingratitude of the creature. I''d been more
      than a brother to him. I''d hatched him, educated him. A great gawky,
      out-of-date bird! And me a human being—heir of the ages and all
      that.

"I thought after a time he''d begin to see things in that light himself,
      and feel a little sorry for his behaviour. I thought if I was to catch
      some nice little bits of fish, perhaps, and go to him presently in a
      casual kind of way, and offer them to him, he might do the sensible thing.
      It took me some time to learn how unforgiving and cantankerous an extinct
      bird can be. Malice!

"I won''t tell you all the little devices I tried to get that bird round
      again, I simply can''t. It makes my cheek burn with shame even now to think
      of the snubs and buffets I had from this infernal curiosity. I tried
      violence. I chucked lumps of coral at him from a safe distance, but he
      only swallowed them. I shied my open knife at him and almost lost it,
      though it was too big for him to swallow. I tried starving him out and
      struck fishing, but he took to picking along the beach at low water after
      worms, and rubbed along on that. Half my time I spent up to my neck in the
      lagoon, and the rest up the palm-trees. One of them was scarcely high
      enough, and when he caught me up it he had a regular Bank Holiday with the
      calves of my legs. It got unbearable. I don''t know if you have ever tried
      sleeping up a palm-tree. It gave me the most horrible nightmares. Think of
      the shame of it, too! Here was this extinct animal mooning about my island
      like a sulky duke, and me not allowed to rest the sole of my foot on the
      place. I used to cry with weariness and vexation. I told him straight that
      I didn''t mean to be chased about a desert island by any damned
      anachronisms. I told him to go and peck a navigator of his own age. But he
      only snapped his beak at me. Great ugly bird, all legs and neck!

"I shouldn''t like to say how long that went on altogether. I''d have killed
      him sooner if I''d known how. However, I hit on a way of settling him at
      last. It is a South American dodge. I joined all my fishing-lines together
      with stems of seaweed and things, and made a stoutish string, perhaps
      twelve yards in length or more, and I fastened two lumps of coral rock to
      the ends of this. It took me some time to do, because every now and then I
      had to go into the lagoon or up a tree as the fancy took me. This I
      whirled rapidly round my head, and then let it go at him. The first time I
      missed, but the next time the string caught his legs beautifully, and
      wrapped round them again and again. Over he went. I threw it standing
      waist-deep in the lagoon, and as soon as he went down I was out of the
      water and sawing at his neck with my knife ...

"I don''t like to think of that even now. I felt like a murderer while I
      did it, though my anger was hot against him. When I stood over him and saw
      him bleeding on the white sand, and his beautiful great legs and neck
      writhing in his last agony ... Pah!

"With that tragedy loneliness came upon me like a curse. Good Lord! you
      can''t imagine how I missed that bird. I sat by his corpse and sorrowed
      over him, and shivered as I looked round the desolate, silent reef. I
      thought of what a jolly little bird he had been when he was hatched, and
      of a thousand pleasant tricks he had played before he went wrong. I
      thought if I''d only wounded him I might have nursed him round into a
      better understanding. If I''d had any means of digging into the coral rock
      I''d have buried him. I felt exactly as if he was human. As it was, I
      couldn''t think of eating him, so I put him in the lagoon, and the little
      fishes picked him clean. I didn''t even save the feathers. Then one day a
      chap cruising about in a yacht had a fancy to see if my atoll still
      existed.

"He didn''t come a moment too soon, for I was about sick enough of the
      desolation of it, and only hesitating whether I should walk out into the
      sea and finish up the business that way, or fall back on the green
      things...

"I sold the bones to a man named Winslow—a dealer near the British
      Museum, and he says he sold them to old Havers. It seems Havers didn''t
      understand they were extra large, and it was only after his death they
      attracted attention. They called ''em AEpyornis—what was it?"

"AEpyornis vastus," said I. "It''s funny, the very thing was
      mentioned to me by a friend of mine. When they found an AEpyornis, with a
      thigh a yard long, they thought they had reached the top of the scale, and
      called him AEpyornis maximus. Then some one turned up another
      thigh-bone four feet six or more, and that they called AEpyornis Titan.
      Then your vastus was found after old Havers died, in his
      collection, and then a vastissimus turned up."

"Winslow was telling me as much," said the man with the scar. "If they get
      any more AEpyornises, he reckons some scientific swell will go and burst a
      blood-vessel. But it was a queer thing to happen to a man; wasn''t it—
      altogether?"

I. — The transitory mental aberration of Sidney Davidson, remarkable
      enough in itself, is still more remarkable if Wade''s explanation is to be
      credited. It sets one dreaming of the oddest possibilities of
      intercommunication in the future, of spending an intercalary five minutes
      on the other side of the world, or being watched in our most secret
      operations by unsuspected eyes. It happened that I was the immediate
      witness of Davidson''s seizure, and so it falls naturally to me to put the
      story upon paper.

When I say that I was the immediate witness of his seizure, I mean that I
      was the first on the scene. The thing happened at the Harlow Technical
      College, just beyond the Highgate Archway. He was alone in the larger
      laboratory when the thing happened. I was in a smaller room, where the
      balances are, writing up some notes. The thunderstorm had completely upset
      my work, of course. It was just after one of the louder peals that I
      thought I heard some glass smash in the other room. I stopped writing, and
      turned round to listen. For a moment I heard nothing; the hail was playing
      the devil''s tattoo on the corrugated zinc of the roof. Then came another
      sound, a smash—no doubt of it this time. Something heavy had been
      knocked off the bench. I jumped up at once and went and opened the door
      leading into the big laboratory.

I was surprised to hear a queer sort of laugh, and saw Davidson standing
      unsteadily in the middle of the room, with a dazzled look on his face. My
      first impression was that he was drunk. He did not notice me. He was
      clawing out at something invisible a yard in front of his face. He put out
      his hand, slowly, rather hesitatingly, and then clutched nothing. "What''s
      come to it?" he said. He held up his hands to his face, fingers spread
      out. "Great Scott!" he said. The thing happened three or four years ago,
      when every one swore by that personage. Then he began raising his feet
      clumsily, as though he had expected to find them glued to the floor.

"Davidson!" cried I. "What''s the matter with you?" He turned round in my
      direction and looked about for me. He looked over me and at me and on
      either side of me, without the slightest sign of seeing me. "Waves," he
      said; "and a remarkably neat schooner. I''d swear that was Bellow''s voice.
      Hullo!" He shouted suddenly at the top of his voice.

I thought he was up to some foolery. Then I saw littered about his feet
      the shattered remains of the best of our electrometers. "What''s up, man?"
      said I. "You''ve smashed the electrometer!"

"Bellows again!" said he. "Friends left, if my hands are gone. Something
      about electrometers. Which way are you, Bellows?" He suddenly came
      staggering towards me. "The damned stuff cuts like butter," he said. He
      walked straight into the bench and recoiled. "None so buttery that!" he
      said, and stood swaying.

He looked round him in every direction. "I could swear that was Bellows.
      Why don''t you show yourself like a man, Bellows?"

It occurred to me that he must be suddenly struck blind. I walked round
      the table and laid my hand upon his arm. I never saw a man more startled
      in my life. He jumped away from me, and came round into an attitude of
      self-defence, his face fairly distorted with terror. "Good God!" he cried.
      "What was that?"

He jumped when I answered him and stared—how can I express it?—right
      through me. He began talking, not to me, but to himself. "Here in broad
      daylight on a clear beach. Not a place to hide in." He looked about him
      wildly. "Here! I''m off." He suddenly turned and ran headlong into
      the big electro-magnet—so violently that, as we found afterwards, he
      bruised his shoulder and jawbone cruelly. At that he stepped back a pace,
      and cried out with almost a whimper, "What, in Heaven''s name, has come
      over me?" He stood, blanched with terror and trembling violently, with his
      right arm clutching his left, where that had collided with the magnet.

He was startled at my voice, but not so excessively as before. I repeated
      my words in as clear and as firm a tone as I could assume. "Bellows," he
      said, "is that you?"

"The laboratory!" he answered in a puzzled tone, and put his hand to his
      forehead. "I was in the laboratory—till that flash came, but
      I''m hanged if I''m there now. What ship is that?"

"No ship!" he repeated, and seemed to forget my denial forthwith. "I
      suppose," said he slowly, "we''re both dead. But the rummy part is I feel
      just as though I still had a body. Don''t get used to it all at once, I
      suppose. The old shop was struck by lightning, I suppose. Jolly quick
      thing, Bellows—eigh?"

"Don''t talk nonsense. You''re very much alive. You are in the laboratory,
      blundering about. You''ve just smashed a new electrometer. I don''t envy you
      when Boyce arrives."

He stared away from me towards the diagrams of cryohydrates. "I must be
      deaf," said he. "They''ve fired a gun, for there goes the puff of smoke,
      and I never heard a sound."

I put my hand on his arm again, and this time he was less alarmed. "We
      seem to have a sort of invisible bodies," said he. "By Jove! there''s a
      boat coming round the headland. It''s very much like the old life after all—in
      a different climate."

II. — It was just then that Boyce came in. So soon as he spoke
      Davidson exclaimed: "Old Boyce! Dead too! What a lark!" I hastened to
      explain that Davidson was in a kind of somnambulistic trance. Boyce was
      interested at once. We both did all we could to rouse the fellow out of
      his extraordinary state. He answered our questions, and asked us some of
      his own, but his attention seemed distracted by his hallucination about a
      beach and a ship. He kept interpolating observations concerning some boat
      and the davits, and sails filling with the wind. It made one feel queer,
      in the dusky laboratory, to hear him saying such things.

He was blind and helpless. We had to walk him down the passage, one at
      each elbow, to Boyce''s private room, and while Boyce talked to him there,
      and humoured him about this ship idea, I went along the corridor and asked
      old Wade to come and look at him. The voice of our Dean sobered him a
      little, but not very much. He asked where his hands were, and why he had
      to walk about up to his waist in the ground. Wade thought over him a long
      time—you know how he knits his brows—and then made him feel
      the couch, guiding his hands to it. "That''s a couch," said Wade. "The
      couch in the private room of Professor Boyce. Horse-hair stuffing."

Davidson felt about, and puzzled over it, and answered presently that he
      could feel it all right, but he couldn''t see it.

"What do you see?" asked Wade. Davidson said he could see nothing
      but a lot of sand and broken-up shells. Wade gave him some other things to
      feel, telling him what they were, and watching him keenly.

"Never mind the ship," said Wade. "Listen to me, Davidson. Do you know
      what hallucination means?"

"Don''t mistake me," said Wade. "You are alive and in this room of Boyce''s.
      But something has happened to your eyes. You cannot see; you can feel and
      hear, but not see. Do you follow me?"

"It seems to me that I see too much." Davidson rubbed his knuckles into
      his eyes. "Well?" he said.

"Wait a bit." Davidson thought. "Help me to sit down," said he presently;
      "and now—I''m sorry to trouble you—but will you tell me all
      that over again?"

Wade repeated it very patiently. Davidson shut his eyes, and pressed his
      hands upon his forehead. "Yes," said he. "It''s quite right. Now my eyes
      are shut I know you''re right. That''s you, Bellows, sitting by me on the
      couch. I''m in England again. And we''re in the dark."

Then he opened his eyes. "And there," said he, "is the sun just rising,
      and the yards of the ship, and a tumbled sea, and a couple of birds
      flying. I never saw anything so real. And I''m sitting up to my neck in a
      bank of sand."

He bent forward and covered his face with his hands. Then he opened his
      eyes again. "Dark sea and sunrise! And yet I''m sitting on a sofa in old
      Boyce''s room!... God help me!"

III. — That was the beginning. For three weeks this strange
      affection of Davidson''s eyes continued unabated. It was far worse than
      being blind. He was absolutely helpless, and had to be fed like a
      newly-hatched bird, and led about and undressed. If he attempted to move,
      he fell over things or struck himself against walls or doors. After a day
      or so he got used to hearing our voices without seeing us, and willingly
      admitted he was at home, and that Wade was right in what he told him. My
      sister, to whom he was engaged, insisted on coming to see him, and would
      sit for hours every day while he talked about this beach of his. Holding
      her hand seemed to comfort him immensely. He explained that when we left
      the College and drove home—he lived in Hampstead village—it
      appeared to him as if we drove right through a sandhill—it was
      perfectly black until he emerged again—and through rocks and trees
      and solid obstacles, and when he was taken to his own room it made him
      giddy and almost frantic with the fear of falling, because going upstairs
      seemed to lift him thirty or forty feet above the rocks of his imaginary
      island. He kept saying he should smash all the eggs. The end was that he
      had to be taken down into his father''s consulting room and laid upon a
      couch that stood there.

He described the island as being a bleak kind of place on the whole, with
      very little vegetation, except some peaty stuff, and a lot of bare rock.
      There were multitudes of penguins, and they made the rocks white and
      disagreeable to see. The sea was often rough, and once there was a
      thunderstorm, and he lay and shouted at the silent flashes. Once or twice
      seals pulled up on the beach, but only on the first two or three days. He
      said it was very funny the way in which the penguins used to waddle right
      through him, and how he seemed to lie among them without disturbing them.

I remember one odd thing, and that was when he wanted very badly to smoke.
      We put a pipe in his hands—he almost poked his eye out with it—and
      lit it. But he couldn''t taste anything. I''ve since found it''s the same
      with me—I don''t know if it''s the usual case—that I cannot
      enjoy tobacco at all unless I can see the smoke.

But the queerest part of his vision came when Wade sent him out in a
      Bath-chair to get fresh air. The Davidsons hired a chair, and got that
      deaf and obstinate dependant of theirs, Widgery, to attend to it.
      Widgery''s ideas of healthy expeditions were peculiar. My sister, who had
      been to the Dogs'' Home, met them in Camden Town, towards King''s Cross,
      Widgery trotting along complacently, and Davidson, evidently most
      distressed, trying in his feeble, blind way to attract Widgery''s
      attention.

He positively wept when my sister spoke to him. "Oh, get me out of this
      horrible darkness!" he said, feeling for her hand. "I must get out of it,
      or I shall die." He was quite incapable of explaining what was the matter,
      but my sister decided he must go home, and presently, as they went uphill
      towards Hampstead, the horror seemed to drop from him. He said it was good
      to see the stars again, though it was then about noon and a blazing day.

"It seemed," he told me afterwards, "as if I was being carried
      irresistibly towards the water. I was not very much alarmed at first. Of
      course it was night there—a lovely night."

"Of course," said he. "It''s always night there when it is day here...
      Well, we went right into the water, which was calm and shining under the
      moonlight—just a broad swell that seemed to grow broader and flatter
      as I came down into it. The surface glistened just like a skin—it
      might have been empty space underneath for all I could tell to the
      contrary. Very slowly, for I rode slanting into it, the water crept up to
      my eyes. Then I went under and the skin seemed to break and heal again
      about my eyes. The moon gave a jump up in the sky and grew green and dim,
      and fish, faintly glowing, came darting round me—and things that
      seemed made of luminous glass; and I passed through a tangle of seaweeds
      that shone with an oily lustre. And so I drove down into the sea, and the
      stars went out one by one, and the moon grew greener and darker, and the
      seaweed became a luminous purple-red. It was all very faint and
      mysterious, and everything seemed to quiver. And all the while I could
      hear the wheels of the Bath-chair creaking, and the footsteps of people
      going by, and a man in the distance selling the special Pall Mall.

"I kept sinking down deeper and deeper into the water. It became inky
      black about me, not a ray from above came down into that darkness, and the
      phosphorescent things grew brighter and brighter. The snaky branches of
      the deeper weeds flickered like the flames of spirit-lamps; but, after a
      time, there were no more weeds. The fishes came staring and gaping towards
      me, and into me and through me. I never imagined such fishes before. They
      had lines of fire along the sides of them as though they had been outlined
      with a luminous pencil. And there was a ghastly thing swimming backwards
      with a lot of twining arms. And then I saw, coming very slowly towards me
      through the gloom, a hazy mass of light that resolved itself as it drew
      nearer into multitudes of fishes, struggling and darting round something
      that drifted. I drove on straight towards it, and presently I saw in the
      midst of the tumult, and by the light of the fish, a bit of splintered
      spar looming over me, and a dark hull tilting over, and some glowing
      phosphorescent forms that were shaken and writhed as the fish bit at them.
      Then it was I began to try to attract Widgery''s attention. A horror came
      upon me. Ugh! I should have driven right into those half-eaten—things.
      If your sister had not come! They had great holes in them, Bellows, and
      ... Never mind. But it was ghastly!"

IV. — For three weeks Davidson remained in this singular state,
      seeing what at the time we imagined was an altogether phantasmal world,
      and stone blind to the world around him. Then, one Tuesday, when I called
      I met old Davidson in the passage. "He can see his thumb!" the old
      gentleman said, in a perfect transport. He was struggling into his
      overcoat. "He can see his thumb, Bellows!" he said, with the tears in his
      eyes. "The lad will be all right yet."

I rushed in to Davidson. He was holding up a little book before his face,
      and looking at it and laughing in a weak kind of way.

"It''s amazing," said he. "There''s a kind of patch come there." He pointed
      with his finger. "I''m on the rocks as usual, and the penguins are
      staggering and flapping about as usual, and there''s been a whale showing
      every now and then, but it''s got too dark now to make him out. But put
      something there, and I see it—I do see it. It''s very dim and
      broken in places, but I see it all the same, like a faint spectre of
      itself. I found it out this morning while they were dressing me. It''s like
      a hole in this infernal phantom world. Just put your hand by mine. No—not
      there. Ah! Yes! I see it. The base of your thumb and a bit of cuff! It
      looks like the ghost of a bit of your hand sticking out of the darkling
      sky. Just by it there''s a group of stars like a cross coming out."

From that time Davidson began to mend. His account of the change, like his
      account of the vision, was oddly convincing. Over patches of his field of
      vision, the phantom world grew fainter, grew transparent, as it were, and
      through these translucent gaps he began to see dimly the real world about
      him. The patches grew in size and number, ran together and spread until
      only here and there were blind spots left upon his eyes. He was able to
      get up and steer himself about, feed himself once more, read, smoke, and
      behave like an ordinary citizen again. At first it was very confusing to
      him to have these two pictures overlapping each other like the changing
      views of a lantern, but in a little while he began to distinguish the real
      from the illusory.

At first he was unfeignedly glad, and seemed only too anxious to complete
      his cure by taking exercise and tonics. But as that odd island of his
      began to fade away from him, he became queerly interested in it. He wanted
      particularly to go down into the deep sea again, and would spend half his
      time wandering about the low-lying parts of London, trying to find the
      water-logged wreck he had seen drifting. The glare of real daylight very
      soon impressed him so vividly as to blot out everything of his shadowy
      world, but of a night-time, in a darkened room, he could still see the
      white-splashed rocks of the island, and the clumsy penguins staggering to
      and fro. But even these grew fainter and fainter, and, at last, soon after
      he married my sister, he saw them for the last time.

V. — And now to tell of the queerest thing of all. About two years
      after his cure I dined with the Davidsons, and after dinner a man named
      Atkins called in. He is a lieutenant in the Royal Navy, and a pleasant,
      talkative man. He was on friendly terms with my brother-in-law, and was
      soon on friendly terms with me. It came out that he was engaged to
      Davidson''s cousin, and incidentally he took out a kind of pocket
      photograph case to show us a new rendering of his fiancie. "And,
      by-the-by," said he, "here''s the old Fulmar."

Davidson looked at it casually. Then suddenly his face lit up. "Good
      heavens!" said he. "I could almost swear——"

"Don''t see how you can have. She hasn''t been out of the South Seas for six
      years, and before then——"

"But," began Davidson, and then, "Yes—that''s the ship I dreamt of;
      I''m sure that''s the ship I dreamt of. She was standing off an island that
      swarmed with penguins, and she fired a gun."

"Good Lord!" said Atkins, who had now heard the particulars of the
      seizure. "How the deuce could you dream that?"

And then, bit by bit, it came out that on the very day Davidson was
      seized, H.M.S. Fulmar had actually been off a little rock to the
      south of Antipodes Island. A boat had landed overnight to get penguins''
      eggs, had been delayed, and a thunderstorm drifting up, the boat''s crew
      had waited until the morning before rejoining the ship. Atkins had been
      one of them, and he corroborated, word for word, the descriptions Davidson
      had given of the island and the boat. There is not the slightest doubt in
      any of our minds that Davidson has really seen the place. In some
      unaccountable way, while he moved hither and thither in London, his sight
      moved hither and thither in a manner that corresponded, about this distant
      island. How is absolutely a mystery.

That completes the remarkable story of Davidson''s eyes. It''s perhaps the
      best authenticated case in existence of real vision at a distance.
      Explanation there is none forthcoming, except what Professor Wade has
      thrown out. But his explanation invokes the Fourth Dimension, and a
      dissertation on theoretical kinds of space. To talk of there being "a kink
      in space" seems mere nonsense to me; it may be because I am no
      mathematician. When I said that nothing would alter the fact that the
      place is eight thousand miles away, he answered that two points might be a
      yard away on a sheet of paper, and yet be brought together by bending the
      paper round. The reader may grasp his argument, but I certainly do not.
      His idea seems to be that Davidson, stooping between the poles of the big
      electro-magnet, had some extraordinary twist given to his retinal elements
      through the sudden change in the field of force due to the lightning.

He thinks, as a consequence of this, that it may be possible to live
      visually in one part of the world, while one lives bodily in another. He
      has even made some experiments in support of his views; but, so far, he
      has simply succeeded in blinding a few dogs. I believe that is the net
      result of his work, though I have not seen him for some weeks. Latterly I
      have been so busy with my work in connection with the Saint Pancras
      installation that I have had little opportunity of calling to see him. But
      the whole of his theory seems fantastic to me. The facts concerning
      Davidson stand on an altogether different footing, and I can testify
      personally to the accuracy of every detail I have given.

The chief attendant of the three dynamos that buzzed and rattled at
      Camberwell, and kept the electric railway going, came out of Yorkshire,
      and his name was James Holroyd. He was a practical electrician, but fond
      of whisky, a heavy, red-haired brute with irregular teeth. He doubted the
      existence of the Deity, but accepted Carnot''s cycle, and he had read
      Shakespeare and found him weak in chemistry. His helper came out of the
      mysterious East, and his name was Azuma-zi. But Holroyd called him
      Pooh-bah. Holroyd liked a nigger help because he would stand kicking—a
      habit with Holroyd—and did not pry into the machinery and try to
      learn the ways of it. Certain odd possibilities of the negro mind brought
      into abrupt contact with the crown of our civilisation Holroyd never fully
      realised, though just at the end he got some inkling of them.

To define Azuma-zi was beyond ethnology. He was, perhaps, more negroid
      than anything else, though his hair was curly rather than frizzy, and his
      nose had a bridge. Moreover, his skin was brown rather than black, and the
      whites of his eyes were yellow. His broad cheekbones and narrow chin gave
      his face something of the viperine V. His head, too, was broad behind, and
      low and narrow at the forehead, as if his brain had been twisted round in
      the reverse way to a European''s. He was short of stature and still shorter
      of English. In conversation he made numerous odd noises of no known
      marketable value, and his infrequent words were carved and wrought into
      heraldic grotesqueness. Holroyd tried to elucidate his religious beliefs,
      and—especially after whisky—lectured to him against
      superstition and missionaries. Azuma-zi, however, shirked the discussion
      of his gods, even though he was kicked for it.

Azuma-zi had come, clad in white but insufficient raiment, out of the
      stoke-hole of the Lord Clive, from the Straits Settlements and
      beyond, into London. He had heard even in his youth of the greatness and
      riches of London, where all the women are white and fair, and even the
      beggars in the streets are white, and he had arrived, with newly-earned
      gold coins in his pocket, to worship at the shrine of civilisation. The
      day of his landing was a dismal one; the sky was dun, and a wind-worried
      drizzle filtered down to the greasy streets, but he plunged boldly into
      the delights of Shadwell, and was presently cast up, shattered in health,
      civilised in costume, penniless, and, except in matters of the direst
      necessity, practically a dumb animal, to toil for James Holroyd, and to be
      bullied by him in the dynamo shed at Camberwell. And to James Holroyd
      bullying was a labour of love.

There were three dynamos with their engines at Camberwell. The two that
      have been there since the beginning are small machines; the larger one was
      new. The smaller machines made a reasonable noise; their straps hummed
      over the drums, every now and then the brushes buzzed and fizzled, and the
      air churned steadily, whoo! whoo! whoo! between their poles. One was loose
      in its foundations and kept the shed vibrating. But the big dynamo drowned
      these little noises altogether with the sustained drone of its iron core,
      which somehow set part of the ironwork humming. The place made the
      visitor''s head reel with the throb, throb, throb of the engines, the
      rotation of the big wheels, the spinning ball-valves, the occasional
      spittings of the steam, and over all the deep, unceasing, surging note of
      the big dynamo. This last noise was from an engineering point of view a
      defect, but Azuma-zi accounted it unto the monster for mightiness and
      pride.

If it were possible we would have the noises of that shed always about the
      reader as he reads, we would tell all our story to such an accompaniment.
      It was a steady stream of din, from which the ear picked out first one
      thread and then another; there was the intermittent snorting, panting, and
      seething of the steam engines, the suck and thud of their pistons, the
      dull beat on the air as the spokes of the great driving wheels came round,
      a note the leather straps made as they ran tighter and looser, and a
      fretful tumult from the dynamos; and, over all, sometimes inaudible, as
      the ear tired of it, and then creeping back upon the senses again, was
      this trombone note of the big machine. The floor never felt steady and
      quiet beneath one''s feet, but quivered and jarred. It was a confusing,
      unsteady place, and enough to send anyone''s thoughts jerking into odd
      zigzags. And for three months, while the big strike of the engineers was
      in progress, Holroyd, who was a blackleg, and Azuma-zi, who was a mere
      black, were never out of the stir and eddy of it, but slept and fed in the
      little wooden shanty between the shed and the gates.

Holroyd delivered a theological lecture on the text of his big machine
      soon after Azuma-zi came. He had to shout to be heard in the din. "Look at
      that," said Holroyd; "where''s your ''eathen idol to match ''im?" And
      Azuma-zi looked. For a moment Holroyd was inaudible, and then Azuma-zi
      heard: "Kill a hundred men. Twelve per cent, on the ordinary shares," said
      Holroyd, "and that''s something like a Gord."

Holroyd was proud of his big dynamo, and expatiated upon its size and
      power to Azuma-zi until heaven knows what odd currents of thought that and
      the incessant whirling and shindy set up within the curly black cranium.
      He would explain in the most graphic manner the dozen or so ways in which
      a man might be killed by it, and once he gave Azuma-zi a shock as a sample
      of its quality. After that, in the breathing-times of his labour—it
      was heavy labour, being not only his own, but most of Holroyd''s—Azuma-zi
      would sit and watch the big machine. Now and then the brushes would
      sparkle and spit blue flashes, at which Holroyd would swear, but all the
      rest was as smooth and rhythmic as breathing. The band ran shouting over
      the shaft, and ever behind one as one watched was the complacent thud of
      the piston. So it lived all day in this big airy shed, with him and
      Holroyd to wait upon it; not prisoned up and slaving to drive a ship as
      the other engines he knew—mere captive devils of the British Solomon—had
      been, but a machine enthroned. Those two smaller dynamos Azuma-zi by force
      of contrast despised; the large one he privately christened the Lord of
      the Dynamos. They were fretful and irregular, but the big dynamo was
      steady. How great it was! How serene and easy in its working! Greater and
      calmer even than the Buddhas he had seen at Rangoon, and yet not
      motionless, but living! The great black coils spun, spun, spun, the rings
      ran round under the brushes, and the deep note of its coil steadied the
      whole. It affected Azuma-zi queerly.

Azuma-zi was not fond of labour. He would sit about and watch the Lord of
      the Dynamos while Holroyd went away to persuade the yard porter to get
      whisky, although his proper place was not in the dynamo shed but behind
      the engines, and, moreover, if Holroyd caught him skulking he got hit for
      it with a rod of stout copper wire. He would go and stand close to the
      colossus, and look up at the great leather band running overhead. There
      was a black patch on the band that came round, and it pleased him somehow
      among all the clatter to watch this return again and again. Odd thoughts
      spun with the whirl of it. Scientific people tell us that savages give
      souls to rocks and trees,—and a machine is a thousand times more
      alive than a rock or a tree. And Azuma-zi was practically a savage still;
      the veneer of civilisation lay no deeper than his slop suit, his bruises,
      and the coal grime on his face and hands. His father before him had
      worshipped a meteoric stone, kindred blood, it may be, had splashed the
      broad wheels of Juggernaut.

He took every opportunity Holroyd gave him of touching and handling the
      great dynamo that was fascinating him. He polished and cleaned it until
      the metal parts were blinding in the sun. He felt a mysterious sense of
      service in doing this. He would go up to it and touch its spinning coils
      gently. The gods he had worshipped were all far away. The people in London
      hid their gods.

At last his dim feelings grew more distinct, and took shape in thoughts,
      and at last in acts. When he came into the roaring shed one morning he
      salaamed to the Lord of the Dynamos, and then, when Holroyd was away, he
      went and whispered to the thundering machine that he was its servant, and
      prayed it to have pity on him and save him from Holroyd. As he did so a
      rare gleam of light came in through the open archway of the throbbing
      machine-shed, and the Lord of the Dynamos, as he whirled and roared, was
      radiant with pale gold. Then Azuma-zi knew that his service was acceptable
      to his Lord. After that he did not feel so lonely as he had done, and he
      had indeed been very much alone in London. And even when his work-time was
      over, which was rare, he loitered about the shed.

Then, the next time Holroyd maltreated him, Azuma-zi went presently to the
      Lord of the Dynamos and whispered, "Thou seest, O my Lord!" and the angry
      whirr of the machinery seemed to answer him. Thereafter it appeared to him
      that whenever Holroyd came into the shed a different note came into the
      sounds of the dynamo. "My Lord bides his time," said Azuma-zi to himself.
      "The iniquity of the fool is not yet ripe." And he waited and watched for
      the day of reckoning. One day there was evidence of short circuiting, and
      Holroyd, making an unwary examination—it was in the afternoon—got
      a rather severe shock. Azuma-zi from behind the engine saw him jump off
      and curse at the peccant coil.

Holroyd had at first initiated his "nigger" into such elementary
      conceptions of the dynamo''s working as would enable him to take temporary
      charge of the shed in his absence. But when he noticed the manner in which
      Azuma-zi hung about the monster he became suspicious. He dimly perceived
      his assistant was "up to something," and connecting him with the anointing
      of the coils with oil that had rotted the varnish in one place, he issued
      an edict, shouted above the confusion of the machinery, "Don''t ''ee go nigh
      that big dynamo any more, Pooh-bah, or a''ll take thy skin off!" Besides,
      if it pleased Azuma-zi to be near the big machine, it was plain sense and
      decency to keep him away from it.

Azuma-zi obeyed at the time, but later he was caught bowing before the
      Lord of the Dynamos. At which Holroyd twisted his arm and kicked him as he
      turned to go away. As Azuma-zi presently stood behind the engine and
      glared at the back of the hated Holroyd, the noises of the machinery took
      a new rhythm, and sounded like four words in his native tongue.

It is hard to say exactly what madness is. I fancy Azuma-zi was mad. The
      incessant din and whirl of the dynamo shed may have churned up his little
      store of knowledge and big store of superstitious fancy, at last, into
      something akin to frenzy. At any rate, when the idea of making Holroyd a
      sacrifice to the Dynamo Fetich was thus suggested to him, it filled him
      with a strange tumult of exultant emotion.

That night the two men and their black shadows were alone in the shed
      together. The shed was lit with one big arc light that winked and
      flickered purple. The shadows lay black behind the dynamos, the ball
      governors of the engines whirled from light to darkness, and their pistons
      beat loud and steady. The world outside seen through the open end of the
      shed seemed incredibly dim and remote. It seemed absolutely silent, too,
      since the riot of the machinery drowned every external sound. Far away was
      the black fence of the yard with grey shadowy houses behind, and above was
      the deep blue sky and the pale little stars. Azuma-zi suddenly walked
      across the centre of the shed above which the leather bands were running,
      and went into the shadow by the big dynamo. Holroyd heard a click, and the
      spin of the armature changed.

Then he saw the set expression of Azuma-zi''s eyes as the Asiatic came out
      of the shadow towards him.

"You coffee-headed fool!" gasped Holroyd, with a brown hand at his throat.
      "Keep off those contact rings." In another moment he was tripped and
      reeling back upon the Lord of the Dynamos. He instinctively loosened his
      grip upon his antagonist to save himself from the machine.

The messenger, sent in furious haste from the station to find out what had
      happened in the dynamo shed, met Azuma-zi at the porter''s lodge by the
      gate. Azuma-zi tried to explain something, but the messenger could make
      nothing of the black''s incoherent English, and hurried on to the shed. The
      machines were all noisily at work, and nothing seemed to be disarranged.
      There was, however, a queer smell of singed hair. Then he saw an
      odd-looking crumpled mass clinging to the front of the big dynamo, and,
      approaching, recognised the distorted remains of Holroyd.

The man stared and hesitated a moment. Then he saw the face, and shut his
      eyes convulsively. He turned on his heel before he opened them, so that he
      should not see Holroyd again, and went out of the shed to get advice and
      help.

When Azuma-zi saw Holroyd die in the grip of the Great Dynamo he had been
      a little scared about the consequences of his act. Yet he felt strangely
      elated, and knew that the favour of the Lord Dynamo was upon him. His plan
      was already settled when he met the man coming from the station, and the
      scientific manager who speedily arrived on the scene jumped at the obvious
      conclusion of suicide. This expert scarcely noticed Azuma-zi, except to
      ask a few questions. Did he see Holroyd kill himself? Azuma-zi explained
      he had been out of sight at the engine furnace until he heard a difference
      in the noise from the dynamo. It was not a difficult examination, being
      untinctured by suspicion.

The distorted remains of Holroyd, which the electrician removed from the
      machine, were hastily covered by the porter with a coffee-stained
      table-cloth. Somebody, by a happy inspiration, fetched a medical man. The
      expert was chiefly anxious to get the machine at work again, for seven or
      eight trains had stopped midway in the stuffy tunnels of the electric
      railway. Azuma-zi, answering or misunderstanding the questions of the
      people who had by authority or impudence come into the shed, was presently
      sent back to the stoke-hole by the scientific manager. Of course a crowd
      collected outside the gates of the yard—a crowd, for no known
      reason, always hovers for a day or two near the scene of a sudden death in
      London—two or three reporters percolated somehow into the
      engine-shed, and one even got to Azuma-zi; but the scientific expert
      cleared them out again, being himself an amateur journalist.

Presently the body was carried away, and public interest departed with it.
      Azuma-zi remained very quietly at his furnace, seeing over and over again
      in the coals a figure that wriggled violently and became still. An hour
      after the murder, to any one coming into the shed it would have looked
      exactly as if nothing remarkable had ever happened there. Peeping
      presently from his engine-room the black saw the Lord Dynamo spin and
      whirl beside his little brothers, and the driving wheels were beating
      round, and the steam in the pistons went thud, thud, exactly as it had
      been earlier in the evening. After all, from the mechanical point of view,
      it had been a most insignificant incident—the mere temporary
      deflection of a current. But now the slender form and slender shadow of
      the scientific manager replaced the sturdy outline of Holroyd travelling
      up and down the lane of light upon the vibrating floor under the straps
      between the engines and the dynamos.

"Have I not served my Lord?" said Azuma-zi inaudibly, from his shadow, and
      the note of the great dynamo rang out full and clear. As he looked at the
      big whirling mechanism the strange fascination of it that had been a
      little in abeyance since Holroyd''s death resumed its sway.

Never had Azuma-zi seen a man killed so swiftly and pitilessly. The big
      humming machine had slain its victim without wavering for a second from
      its steady beating. It was indeed a mighty god.

The unconscious scientific manager stood with his back to him, scribbling
      on a piece of paper. His shadow lay at the foot of the monster.

Azuma-zi made a stealthy step forward; then stopped. The scientific
      manager suddenly ceased his writing, walked down the shed to the endmost
      of the dynamos, and began to examine the brushes.

Azuma-zi hesitated, and then slipped across noiselessly into the shadow by
      the switch. There he waited. Presently the manager''s footsteps could be
      heard returning. He stopped in his old position, unconscious of the stoker
      crouching ten feet away from him. Then the big dynamo suddenly fizzled,
      and in another moment Azuma-zi had sprung out of the darkness upon him.

First, the scientific manager was gripped round the body and swung towards
      the big dynamo, then, kicking with his knee and forcing his antagonist''s
      head down with his hands, he loosened the grip on his waist and swung
      round away from the machine. Then the black grasped him again, putting a
      curly head against his chest, and they swayed and panted as it seemed for
      an age or so. Then the scientific manager was impelled to catch a black
      ear in his teeth and bite furiously. The black yelled hideously.

They rolled over on the floor, and the black, who had apparently slipped
      from the vice of the teeth or parted with some ear—the scientific
      manager wondered which at the time—tried to throttle him. The
      scientific manager was making some ineffectual efforts to claw something
      with his hands and to kick, when the welcome sound of quick footsteps
      sounded on the floor. The next moment Azuma-zi had left him and darted
      towards the big dynamo. There was a splutter amid the roar.

The officer of the company who had entered stood staring as Azuma-zi
      caught the naked terminals in his hands, gave one horrible convulsion, and
      then hung motionless from the machine, his face violently distorted.

"I''m jolly glad you came in when you did," said the scientific manager,
      still sitting on the floor.

He looked at the still quivering figure. "It is not a nice death to die,
      apparently—but it is quick."

The scientific manager got up on his feet rather awkwardly. He ran his
      fingers along his collar thoughtfully, and moved his head to and fro
      several times.

"Poor Holroyd! I see now." Then almost mechanically he went towards the
      switch in the shadow and turned the current into the railway circuit
      again. As he did so the singed body loosened its grip upon the machine and
      fell forward on its face. The core of the dynamo roared out loud and
      clear, and the armature beat the air.

So ended prematurely the worship of the Dynamo Deity, perhaps the most
      short-lived of all religions. Yet withal it could at least boast a
      Martyrdom and a Human Sacrifice.

Probably you have heard of Hapley—not W. T. Hapley, the son, but the
      celebrated Hapley, the Hapley of Periplaneta Hapliia, Hapley the
      entomologist.

If so you know at least of the great feud between Hapley and Professor
      Pawkins, though certain of its consequences may be new to you. For those
      who have not, a word or two of explanation is necessary, which the idle
      reader may go over with a glancing eye, if his indolence so incline him.

It is amazing how very widely diffused is the ignorance of such really
      important matters as this Hapley-Pawkins feud. Those epoch-making
      controversies, again, that have convulsed the Geological Society are, I
      verily believe, almost entirely unknown outside the fellowship of that
      body. I have heard men of fair general education even refer to the great
      scenes at these meetings as vestry-meeting squabbles. Yet the great hate
      of the English and Scotch geologists has lasted now half a century, and
      has "left deep and abundant marks upon the body of the science." And this
      Hapley-Pawkins business, though perhaps a more personal affair, stirred
      passions as profound, if not profounder. Your common man has no conception
      of the zeal that animates a scientific investigator, the fury of
      contradiction you can arouse in him. It is the odium theologicum in
      a new form. There are men, for instance, who would gladly burn Professor
      Ray Lankester at Smithfield for his treatment of the Mollusca in the
      Encyclopaedia. That fantastic extension of the Cephalopods to cover the
      Pteropods ... But I wander from Hapley and Pawkins.

It began years and years ago, with a revision of the Microlepidoptera
      (whatever these may be) by Pawkins, in which he extinguished a new species
      created by Hapley. Hapley, who was always quarrelsome, replied by a
      stinging impeachment of the entire classification of Pawkins.[A] Pawkins
      in his "Rejoinder"[B] suggested that Hapley''s microscope was as defective
      as his power of observation, and called him an "irresponsible meddler"—
      Hapley was not a professor at that time. Hapley in his retort,[C] spoke of
      "blundering collectors," and described, as if inadvertently, Pawkins''
      revision as a "miracle of ineptitude." It was war to the knife. However,
      it would scarcely interest the reader to detail how these two great men
      quarrelled, and how the split between them widened until from the
      Microlepidoptera they were at war upon every open question in entomology.
      There were memorable occasions. At times the Royal Entomological Society
      meetings resembled nothing so much as the Chamber of Deputies. On the
      whole, I fancy Pawkins was nearer the truth than Hapley. But Hapley was
      skilful with his rhetoric, had a turn for ridicule rare in a scientific
      man, was endowed with vast energy, and had a fine sense of injury in the
      matter of the extinguished species; while Pawkins was a man of dull
      presence, prosy of speech, in shape not unlike a water-barrel, over
      conscientious with testimonials, and suspected of jobbing museum
      appointments. So the young men gathered round Hapley and applauded him. It
      was a long struggle, vicious from the beginning and growing at last to
      pitiless antagonism. The successive turns of fortune, now an advantage to
      one side and now to another—now Hapley tormented by some success of
      Pawkins, and now Pawkins outshone by Hapley, belong rather to the history
      of entomology than to this story.

[A  "Remarks on a Recent
      Revision of Microlepidoptera." Quart. Journ. Entomological Soc.,
      1863.]

But in 1891 Pawkins, whose health had been bad for some time, published
      some work upon the "mesoblast" of the Death''s Head Moth. What the
      mesoblast of the Death''s Head Moth may be does not matter a rap in this
      story. But the work was far below his usual standard, and gave Hapley an
      opening he had coveted for years. He must have worked night and day to
      make the most of his advantage.

In an elaborate critique he rent Pawkins to tatters—one can fancy
      the man''s disordered black hair, and his queer dark eyes flashing as he
      went for his antagonist—and Pawkins made a reply, halting,
      ineffectual, with painful gaps of silence, and yet malignant. There was no
      mistaking his will to wound Hapley, nor his incapacity to do it. But few
      of those who heard him—I was absent from that meeting—realised
      how ill the man was.

Hapley got his opponent down, and meant to finish him. He followed with a
      simply brutal attack upon Pawkins, in the form of a paper upon the
      development of moths in general, a paper showing evidence of a most
      extraordinary amount of mental labour, and yet couched in a violently
      controversial tone. Violent as it was, an editorial note witnesses that it
      was modified. It must have covered Pawkins with shame and confusion of
      face. It left no loophole; it was murderous in argument, and utterly
      contemptuous in tone; an awful thing for the declining years of a man''s
      career.

The world of entomologists waited breathlessly for the rejoinder from
      Pawkins. He would try one, for Pawkins had always been game. But when it
      came it surprised them. For the rejoinder of Pawkins was to catch
      influenza, proceed to pneumonia, and die.

It was perhaps as effectual a reply as he could make under the
      circumstances, and largely turned the current of feeling against Hapley.
      The very people who had most gleefully cheered on those gladiators became
      serious at the consequence. There could be no reasonable doubt the fret of
      the defeat had contributed to the death of Pawkins. There was a limit even
      to scientific controversy, said serious people. Another crushing attack
      was already in the press and appeared on the day before the funeral. I
      don''t think Hapley exerted himself to stop it. People remembered how
      Hapley had hounded down his rival, and forgot that rival''s defects.
      Scathing satire reads ill over fresh mould. The thing provoked comment in
      the daily papers. This it was that made me think that you had probably
      heard of Hapley and this controversy. But, as I have already remarked,
      scientific workers live very much in a world of their own; half the
      people, I dare say, who go along Piccadilly to the Academy every year,
      could not tell you where the learned societies abide. Many even think that
      research is a kind of happy-family cage in which all kinds of men lie down
      together in peace.

In his private thoughts Hapley could not forgive Pawkins for dying. In the
      first place, it was a mean dodge to escape the absolute pulverisation
      Hapley had in hand for him, and in the second, it left Hapley''s mind with
      a queer gap in it. For twenty years he had worked hard, sometimes far into
      the night, and seven days a week, with microscope, scalpel,
      collecting-net, and pen, and almost entirely with reference to Pawkins.
      The European reputation he had won had come as an incident in that great
      antipathy. He had gradually worked up to a climax in this last
      controversy. It had killed Pawkins, but it had also thrown Hapley out of
      gear, so to speak, and his doctor advised him to give up work for a time,
      and rest. So Hapley went down into a quiet village in Kent, and thought
      day and night of Pawkins, and good things it was now impossible to say
      about him.

At last Hapley began to realise in what direction the pre-occupation
      tended. He determined to make a fight for it, and started by trying to
      read novels. But he could not get his mind off Pawkins, white in the face
      and making his last speech—every sentence a beautiful opening for
      Hapley. He turned to fiction—and found it had no grip on him. He
      read the "Island Nights'' Entertainments" until his "sense of causation"
      was shocked beyond endurance by the Bottle Imp. Then he went to Kipling,
      and found he "proved nothing," besides being irreverent and vulgar. These
      scientific people have their limitations. Then unhappily, he tried
      Besant''s "Inner House," and the opening chapter set his mind upon learned
      societies and Pawkins at once.

So Hapley turned to chess, and found it a little more soothing. He soon
      mastered the moves and the chief gambits and commoner closing positions,
      and began to beat the Vicar. But then the cylindrical contours of the
      opposite king began to resemble Pawkins standing up and gasping
      ineffectually against check-mate, and Hapley decided to give up chess.

Perhaps the study of some new branch of science would after all be better
      diversion. The best rest is change of occupation. Hapley determined to
      plunge at diatoms, and had one of his smaller microscopes and Halibut''s
      monograph sent down from London. He thought that perhaps if he could get
      up a vigorous quarrel with Halibut, he might be able to begin life afresh
      and forget Pawkins. And very soon he was hard at work in his habitual
      strenuous fashion, at these microscopic denizens of the way-side pool.

It was on the third day of the diatoms that Hapley became aware of a novel
      addition to the local fauna. He was working late at the microscope, and
      the only light in the room was the brilliant little lamp with the special
      form of green shade. Like all experienced microscopists, he kept both eyes
      open. It is the only way to avoid excessive fatigue. One eye was over the
      instrument, and bright and distinct before that was the circular field of
      the microscope, across which a brown diatom was slowly moving. With the
      other eye Hapley saw, as it were, without seeing. He was only dimly
      conscious of the brass side of the instrument, the illuminated part of the
      table-cloth, a sheet of notepaper, the foot of the lamp, and the darkened
      room beyond.

Suddenly his attention drifted from one eye to the other. The table-cloth
      was of the material called tapestry by shopmen, and rather brightly
      coloured. The pattern was in gold, with a small amount of crimson and pale
      blue upon a greyish ground. At one point the pattern seemed displaced, and
      there was a vibrating movement of the colours at this point.

Hapley suddenly moved his head back and looked with both eyes. His mouth
      fell open with astonishment.

It was strange it should be in the room at all, for the windows were
      closed. Strange that it should not have attracted his attention when
      fluttering to its present position. Strange that it should match the
      table-cloth. Stranger far that to him, Hapley, the great entomologist, it
      was altogether unknown. There was no delusion. It was crawling slowly
      towards the foot of the lamp.

Then he suddenly thought of Pawkins. Nothing would have maddened Pawkins
      more...And Pawkins was dead!

Something about the head and body of the insect became singularly
      suggestive of Pawkins, just as the chess king had been.

"Confound Pawkins!" said Hapley. "But I must catch this." And looking
      round him for some means of capturing the moth, he rose slowly out of his
      chair. Suddenly the insect rose, struck the edge of the lampshade—Hapley
      heard the "ping"—and vanished into the shadow.

In a moment Hapley had whipped off the shade, so that the whole room was
      illuminated. The thing had disappeared, but soon his practised eye
      detected it upon the wall-paper near the door. He went towards it poising
      the lamp-shade for capture. Before he was within striking distance,
      however, it had risen and was fluttering round the room. After the fashion
      of its kind, it flew with sudden starts and turns, seeming to vanish here
      and reappear there. Once Hapley struck, and missed; then again.

The third time he hit his microscope. The instrument swayed, struck and
      overturned the lamp, and fell noisily upon the floor. The lamp turned over
      on the table and, very luckily, went out. Hapley was left in the dark.
      With a start he felt the strange moth blunder into his face.

It was maddening. He had no lights. If he opened the door of the room the
      thing would get away. In the darkness he saw Pawkins quite distinctly
      laughing at him. Pawkins had ever an oily laugh. He swore furiously and
      stamped his foot on the floor.

Then it opened, perhaps a foot, and very slowly. The alarmed face of the
      landlady appeared behind a pink candle flame; she wore a night-cap over
      her grey hair and had some purple garment over her shoulders. "What was
      that fearful smash?" she said. "Has anything——" The strange
      moth appeared fluttering about the chink of the door. "Shut that door!"
      said Hapley, and suddenly rushed at her.

The door slammed hastily. Hapley was left alone in the dark. Then in the
      pause he heard his landlady scuttle upstairs, lock her door, and drag
      something heavy across the room and put against it.

It became evident to Hapley that his conduct and appearance had been
      strange and alarming. Confound the moth! and Pawkins! However, it was a
      pity to lose the moth now. He felt his way into the hall and found the
      matches, after sending his hat down upon the floor with a noise like a
      drum. With the lighted candle he returned to the sitting-room. No moth was
      to be seen. Yet once for a moment it seemed that the thing was fluttering
      round his head. Hapley very suddenly decided to give up the moth and go to
      bed. But he was excited. All night long his sleep was broken by dreams of
      the moth, Pawkins, and his landlady. Twice in the night he turned out and
      soused his head in cold water.

One thing was very clear to him. His landlady could not possibly
      understand about the strange moth, especially as he had failed to catch
      it. No one but an entomologist would understand quite how he felt. She was
      probably frightened at his behaviour, and yet he failed to see how he
      could explain it. He decided to say nothing further about the events of
      last night. After breakfast he saw her in her garden, and decided to go
      out and talk to reassure her. He talked to her about beans and potatoes,
      bees, caterpillars, and the price of fruit. She replied in her usual
      manner, but she looked at him a little suspiciously, and kept walking as
      he walked, so that there was always a bed of flowers, or a row of beans,
      or something of the sort, between them. After a while he began to feel
      singularly irritated at this, and to conceal his vexation went indoors and
      presently went out for a walk.

The moth, or butterfly, trailing an odd flavour of Pawkins with it, kept
      coming into that walk, though he did his best to keep his mind off it.
      Once he saw it quite distinctly, with its wings flattened out, upon the
      old stone wall that runs along the west edge of the park, but going up to
      it he found it was only two lumps of grey and yellow lichen. "This," said
      Hapley, "is the reverse of mimicry. Instead of a butterfly looking like a
      stone, here is a stone looking like a butterfly!" Once something hovered
      and fluttered round his head, but by an effort of will he drove that
      impression out of his mind again.

In the afternoon Hapley called upon the Vicar, and argued with him upon
      theological questions. They sat in the little arbour covered with briar,
      and smoked as they wrangled. "Look at that moth!" said Hapley, suddenly,
      pointing to the edge of the wooden table.

Hapley was thunderstruck. He gasped. The Vicar was staring at him. Clearly
      the man saw nothing. "The eye of faith is no better than the eye of
      science," said Hapley awkwardly.

That night Hapley found the moth crawling over his counterpane. He sat on
      the edge of the bed in his shirt sleeves and reasoned with himself. Was it
      pure hallucination? He knew he was slipping, and he battled for his sanity
      with the same silent energy he had formerly displayed against Pawkins. So
      persistent is mental habit, that he felt as if it were still a struggle
      with Pawkins. He was well versed in psychology. He knew that such visual
      illusions do come as a result of mental strain. But the point was, he did
      not only see the moth, he had heard it when it touched the edge of
      the lampshade, and afterwards when it hit against the wall, and he had
      felt it strike his face in the dark.

He looked at it. It was not at all dreamlike, but perfectly clear and
      solid-looking in the candle-light. He saw the hairy body, and the short
      feathery antennae, the jointed legs, even a place where the down was
      rubbed from the wing. He suddenly felt angry with himself for being afraid
      of a little insect.

His landlady had got the servant to sleep with her that night, because she
      was afraid to be alone. In addition she had locked the door, and put the
      chest of drawers against it. They listened and talked in whispers after
      they had gone to bed, but nothing occurred to alarm them. About eleven
      they had ventured to put the candle out, and had both dozed off to sleep.
      They woke up with a start, and sat up in bed, listening in the darkness.

Then they heard slippered feet going to and fro in Hapley''s room. A chair
      was overturned, and there was a violent dab at the wall. Then a china
      mantel ornament smashed upon the fender. Suddenly the door of the room
      opened, and they heard him upon the landing. They clung to one another,
      listening. He seemed to be dancing upon the staircase. Now he would go
      down three or four steps quickly, then up again, then hurry down into the
      hall. They heard the umbrella stand go over, and the fanlight break. Then
      the bolt shot and the chain rattled. He was opening the door.

They hurried to the window. It was a dim grey night; an almost unbroken
      sheet of watery cloud was sweeping across the moon, and the hedge and
      trees in front of the house were black against the pale roadway. They saw
      Hapley, looking like a ghost in his shirt and white trousers, running to
      and fro in the road, and beating the air. Now he would stop, now he would
      dart very rapidly at something invisible, now he would move upon it with
      stealthy strides. At last he went out of sight up the road towards the
      down. Then, while they argued who should go down and lock the door, he
      returned. He was walking very fast, and he came straight into the house,
      closed the door carefully, and went quietly up to his bedroom. Then
      everything was silent.

"Mrs. Colville," said Hapley, calling down the staircase next morning, "I
      hope I did not alarm you last night."

"The fact is, I am a sleep-walker, and the last two nights I have been
      without my sleeping mixture. There is nothing to be alarmed about, really.
      I am sorry I made such an ass of myself. I will go over the down to
      Shoreham, and get some stuff to make me sleep soundly. I ought to have
      done that yesterday."

But half-way over the down, by the chalk pits, the moth came upon Hapley
      again. He went on, trying to keep his mind upon chess problems, but it was
      no good. The thing fluttered into his face, and he struck at it with his
      hat in self-defence. Then rage, the old rage—the rage he had so
      often felt against Pawkins—came upon him again. He went on, leaping
      and striking at the eddying insect. Suddenly he trod on nothing, and fell
      headlong.

There was a gap in his sensations, and Hapley found himself sitting on the
      heap of flints in front of the opening of the chalk-pits, with a leg
      twisted back under him. The strange moth was still fluttering round his
      head. He struck at it with his hand, and turning his head saw two men
      approaching him. One was the village doctor. It occurred to Hapley that
      this was lucky. Then it came into his mind with extraordinary vividness,
      that no one would ever be able to see the strange moth except himself, and
      that it behoved him to keep silent about it.

Late that night, however, after his broken leg was set, he was feverish
      and forgot his self-restraint. He was lying flat on his bed, and he began
      to run his eyes round the room to see if the moth was still about. He
      tried not to do this, but it was no good. He soon caught sight of the
      thing resting close to his hand, by the night-light, on the green
      table-cloth. The wings quivered. With a sudden wave of anger he smote at
      it with his fist, and the nurse woke up with a shriek. He had missed it.

All the time he could see quite clearly the insect going round the cornice
      and darting across the room, and he could also see that the nurse saw
      nothing of it and looked at him strangely. He must keep himself in hand.
      He knew he was a lost man if he did not keep himself in hand. But as the
      night waned the fever grew upon him, and the very dread he had of seeing
      the moth made him see it. About five, just as the dawn was grey, he tried
      to get out of bed and catch it, though his leg was afire with pain. The
      nurse had to struggle with him.

On account of this, they tied him down to the bed. At this the moth grew
      bolder, and once he felt it settle in his hair. Then, because he struck
      out violently with his arms, they tied these also. At this the moth came
      and crawled over his face, and Hapley wept, swore, screamed, prayed for
      them to take it off him, unavailingly.

The doctor was a blockhead, a just-qualified general practitioner, and
      quite ignorant of mental science. He simply said there was no moth. Had he
      possessed the wit, he might still, perhaps, have saved Hapley from his
      fate by entering into his delusion, and covering his face with gauze, as
      he prayed might be done. But, as I say, the doctor was a blockhead, and
      until the leg was healed Hapley was kept tied to his bed, and with the
      imaginary moth crawling over him. It never left him while he was awake and
      it grew to a monster in his dreams. While he was awake he longed for
      sleep, and from sleep he awoke screaming.

So now Hapley is spending the remainder of his days in a padded room,
      worried by a moth that no one else can see. The asylum doctor calls it
      hallucination; but Hapley, when he is in his easier mood, and can talk,
      says it is the ghost of Pawkins, and consequently a unique specimen and
      well worth the trouble of catching.

The canoe was now approaching the land. The bay opened out, and a gap in
      the white surf of the reef marked where the little river ran out to the
      sea; the thicker and deeper green of the virgin forest showed its course
      down the distant hill slope. The forest here came close to the beach. Far
      beyond, dim and almost cloudlike in texture, rose the mountains, like
      suddenly frozen waves. The sea was still save for an almost imperceptible
      swell. The sky blazed.

The man with the carved paddle stopped. "It should be somewhere here," he
      said. He shipped the paddle and held his arms out straight before him.

The other man had been in the fore part of the canoe, closely scrutinising
      the land. He had a sheet of yellow paper on his knee.

The man called Evans came swaying along the canoe until he could look over
      his companion''s shoulder.

The paper had the appearance of a rough map. By much folding it was
      creased and worn to the pitch of separation, and the second man held the
      discoloured fragments together where they had parted. On it one could
      dimly make out, in almost obliterated pencil, the outline of the bay.

"This curved and twisting line is the river—I could do with a drink
      now!—and this star is the place."

"You see this dotted line," said the man with the map; "it is a straight
      line, and runs from the opening of the reef to a clump of palm-trees. The
      star comes just where it cuts the river. We must mark the place as we go
      into the lagoon."

"It''s queer," said Evans, after a pause, "what these little marks down
      here are for. It looks like the plan of a house or something; but what all
      these little dashes, pointing this way and that, may mean I can''t get a
      notion. And what''s the writing?"

They both sat for some minutes staring at the land, while the canoe
      drifted slowly. Then Evans looked towards the paddle.

And his companion quietly folded up his map, put it in his pocket, passed
      Evans carefully, and began to paddle. His movements were languid, like
      those of a man whose strength was nearly exhausted.

Evans sat with his eyes half closed, watching the frothy breakwater of the
      coral creep nearer and nearer. The sky was like a furnace, for the sun was
      near the zenith. Though they were so near the Treasure he did not feel the
      exaltation he had anticipated. The intense excitement of the struggle for
      the plan, and the long night voyage from the mainland in the unprovisioned
      canoe had, to use his own expression, "taken it out of him." He tried to
      arouse himself by directing his mind to the ingots the Chinamen had spoken
      of, but it would not rest there; it came back headlong to the thought of
      sweet water rippling in the river, and to the almost unendurable dryness
      of his lips and throat. The rhythmic wash of the sea upon the reef was
      becoming audible now, and it had a pleasant sound in his ears; the water
      washed along the side of the canoe, and the paddle dripped between each
      stroke. Presently he began to doze.

He was still dimly conscious of the island, but a queer dream texture
      interwove with his sensations. Once again it was the night when he and
      Hooker had hit upon the Chinamen''s secret; he saw the moonlit trees, the
      little fire burning, and the black figures of the three Chinamen—silvered
      on one side by moonlight, and on the other glowing from the firelight—and
      heard them talking together in pigeon-English—for they came from
      different provinces. Hooker had caught the drift of their talk first, and
      had motioned to him to listen. Fragments of the conversation were
      inaudible, and fragments incomprehensible. A Spanish galleon from the
      Philippines hopelessly aground, and its treasure buried against the day of
      return, lay in the background of the story; a shipwrecked crew thinned by
      disease, a quarrel or so, and the needs of discipline, and at last taking
      to their boats never to be heard of again. Then Chang-hi, only a year
      since, wandering ashore, had happened upon the ingots hidden for two
      hundred years, had deserted his junk, and reburied them with infinite
      toil, single-handed but very safe. He laid great stress on the safety—it
      was a secret of his. Now he wanted help to return and exhume them.
      Presently the little map fluttered and the voices sank. A fine story for
      two, stranded British wastrels to hear! Evans'' dream shifted to the moment
      when he had Chang-hi''s pigtail in his hand. The life of a Chinaman is
      scarcely sacred like a European''s. The cunning little face of Chang-hi,
      first keen and furious like a startled snake, and then fearful,
      treacherous, and pitiful, became overwhelmingly prominent in the dream. At
      the end Chang-hi had grinned, a most incomprehensible and startling grin.
      Abruptly things became very unpleasant, as they will do at times in
      dreams. Chang-hi gibbered and threatened him. He saw in his dream heaps
      and heaps of gold, and Chang-hi intervening and struggling to hold him
      back from it. He took Chang-hi by the pig-tail—how big the yellow
      brute was, and how he struggled and grinned! He kept growing bigger, too.
      Then the bright heaps of gold turned to a roaring furnace, and a vast
      devil, surprisingly like Chang-hi, but with a huge black tail, began to
      feed him with coals. They burnt his mouth horribly. Another devil was
      shouting his name: "Evans, Evans, you sleepy fool!"—or was it
      Hooker?

"There are the three palm-trees. It must be in a line with that clump of
      bushes," said his companion. "Mark that. If we, go to those bushes and
      then strike into the bush in a straight line from here, we shall come to
      it when we come to the stream."

They could see now where the mouth of the stream opened out. At the sight
      of it Evans revived. "Hurry up, man," he said, "or by heaven I shall have
      to drink sea water!" He gnawed his hand and stared at the gleam of silver
      among the rocks and green tangle.

So they reached the river mouth. A little way up Hooker took some water in
      the hollow of his hand, tasted it, and spat it out. A little further he
      tried again. "This will do," he said, and they began drinking eagerly.

"Curse this!" said Evans suddenly. "It''s too slow." And, leaning
      dangerously over the fore part of the canoe, he began to suck up the water
      with his lips.

Presently they made an end of drinking, and, running the canoe into a
      little creek, were about to land among the thick growth that overhung the
      water.

"We shall have to scramble through this to the beach to find our bushes
      and get the line to the place," said Evans.

So they pushed out again into the river and paddled back down it to the
      sea, and along the shore to the place where the clump of bushes grew. Here
      they landed, pulled the light canoe far up the beach, and then went up
      towards the edge of the jungle until they could see the opening of the
      reef and the bushes in a straight line. Evans had taken a native implement
      out of the canoe. It was L-shaped, and the transverse piece was armed with
      polished stone. Hooker carried the paddle. "It is straight now in this
      direction," said he; "we must push through this till we strike the stream.
      Then we must prospect."

They pushed through a close tangle of reeds, broad fronds, and young
      trees, and at first it was toilsome going, but very speedily the trees
      became larger and the ground beneath them opened out. The blaze of the
      sunlight was replaced by insensible degrees by cool shadow. The trees
      became at last vast pillars that rose up to a canopy of greenery far
      overhead. Dim white flowers hung from their stems, and ropy creepers swung
      from tree to tree. The shadow deepened. On the ground, blotched fungi and
      a red-brown incrustation became frequent.

Presently they saw, far ahead, a gap in the sombre darkness where white
      shafts of hot sunlight smote into the forest. There also was brilliant
      green undergrowth and coloured flowers. Then they heard the rush of water.

The vegetation was thick by the river bank. Great plants, as yet unnamed,
      grew among the roots of the big trees, and spread rosettes of huge green
      fans towards the strip of sky. Many flowers and a creeper with shiny
      foliage clung to the exposed stems. On the water of the broad, quiet pool
      which the treasure-seekers now overlooked there floated big oval leaves
      and a waxen, pinkish-white flower not unlike a water-lily. Further, as the
      river bent away from them, the water suddenly frothed and became noisy in
      a rapid.

He turned and looked into the dim cool shadows of the silent forest behind
      them. "If we beat a little way up and down the stream we should come to
      something."

They advanced slowly, looking curiously about them. Suddenly Evans
      stopped. "What the devil''s that?" he said.

Hooker followed his finger. "Something blue," he said. It had come into
      view as they topped a gentle swell of the ground. Then he began to
      distinguish what it was.

He advanced suddenly with hasty steps, until the body that belonged to the
      limp hand and arm had become visible. His grip tightened on the implement
      he carried. The thing was the figure of a Chinaman lying on his face. The
      abandon of the pose was unmistakable.

The two men drew closer together, and stood staring silently at this
      ominous dead body. It lay in a clear space among the trees. Near by was a
      spade after the Chinese pattern, and further off lay a scattered heap of
      stones, close to a freshly dug hole.

Hooker turned white but said nothing. He advanced towards the prostrate
      body. He saw the neck was puffed and purple, and the hands and ankles
      swollen. "Pah!" he said, and suddenly turned away and went towards the
      excavation. He gave a cry of surprise. He shouted to Evans, who was
      following him slowly.

"You fool! It''s all right. It''s here still." Then he turned again and
      looked at the dead Chinaman, and then again at the hole.

Evans hurried to the hole. Already half exposed by the ill-fated wretch
      beside them lay a number of dull yellow bars. He bent down in the hole,
      and, clearing off the soil with his bare hands, hastily pulled one of the
      heavy masses out. As he did so a little thorn pricked his hand. He pulled
      the delicate spike out with his fingers and lifted the ingot.

"He stole a march on his friends," he said at last. "He came here alone,
      and some poisonous snake has killed him... I wonder how he found the
      place."

Evans stood with the ingot in his hands. What did a dead Chinaman signify?
      "We shall have to take this stuff to the mainland piecemeal, and bury it
      there for a while. How shall we get it to the canoe?"

He took his jacket off and spread it on the ground, and flung two or three
      ingots into it. Presently he found that another little thorn had punctured
      his skin.

"This is as much as we can carry," said he. Then suddenly, with a queer
      rush of irritation, "What are you staring at?"

Hooker looked into his face. "I''m going to bury that, anyhow,
      before I lend a hand with this stuff."

Hooker hesitated, and then his eye went carefully over the brown soil
      about them. "It scares me somehow," he said.

"The thing is," said Evans, "what to do with these ingots. Shall we
      re-bury them over here, or take them across the strait in the canoe?"

Hooker thought. His puzzled gaze wandered among the tall tree-trunks, and
      up into the remote sunlit greenery overhead. He shivered again as his eye
      rested upon the blue figure of the Chinaman. He stared searchingly among
      the grey depths between the trees.

He took the ends of the collar of the coat in his hands, and Evans took
      the opposite corners, and they lifted the mass. "Which way?" said Evans.
      "To the canoe?"

"It''s queer," said Evans, when they had advanced only a few steps, "but my
      arms ache still with that paddling."

They let the coat down, Evans'' face was white, and little drops of sweat
      stood out upon his forehead. "It''s stuffy, somehow, in this forest."

Then with an abrupt transition to unreasonable anger: "What is the good of
      waiting here all the day? Lend a hand, I say! You have done nothing but
      moon since we saw the dead Chinaman."

Hooker was looking steadfastly at his companion''s face. He helped raise
      the coat bearing the ingots, and they went forward perhaps a hundred yards
      in silence. Evans began to breathe heavily. "Can''t you speak?" he said.

Evans stumbled, and then with a sudden curse flung the coat from him. He
      stood for a moment staring at Hooker, and then with a groan clutched at
      his own throat.

"Don''t come near me," he said, and went and leant against a tree. Then in
      a steadier voice, "I''ll be better in a minute."

Presently his grip upon the trunk loosened, and he slipped slowly down the
      stem of the tree until he was a crumpled heap at its foot. His hands were
      clenched convulsively. His face became distorted with pain. Hooker
      approached him.

"Don''t touch me! Don''t touch me!" said Evans in a stifled voice. "Put the
      gold back on the coat."

As Hooker handled the ingots he felt a little prick on the ball of his
      thumb. He looked at his hand and saw a slender thorn, perhaps two inches
      in length.

Hooker''s jaw dropped. He stared at the thorn for a moment with dilated
      eyes. Then he looked at Evans, who was now crumpled together on the
      ground, his back bending and straightening spasmodically. Then he looked
      through the pillars of the trees and net-work of creeper stems, to where
      in the dim grey shadow the blue-clad body of the Chinaman was still
      indistinctly visible. He thought of the little dashes in the corner of the
      plan, and in a moment he understood.

"God help me!" he said. For the thorns were similar to those the Dyaks
      poison and use in their blowing-tubes. He understood now what Chang-hi''s
      assurance of the safety of his treasure meant. He understood that grin
      now.

But Evans was silent and motionless, save for a horrible spasmodic
      twitching of his limbs. A profound silence brooded over the forest.

Then Hooker began to suck furiously at the little pink spot on the ball of
      his thumb—sucking for dear life. Presently he felt a strange aching
      pain in his arms and shoulders, and his fingers seemed difficult to bend.
      Then he knew that sucking was no good.

Abruptly he stopped, and sitting down by the pile of ingots, and resting
      his chin upon his hands and his elbows upon his knees, stared at the
      distorted but still quivering body of his companion. Chang-hi''s grin came
      into his mind again. The dull pain spread towards his throat and grew
      slowly in intensity. Far above him a faint breeze stirred the greenery,
      and the white petals of some unknown flower came floating down through the
      gloom.

I set this story down, not expecting it will be believed, but, if
      possible, to prepare a way of escape for the next victim. He, perhaps, may
      profit by my misfortune. My own case, I know, is hopeless, and I am now in
      some measure prepared to meet my fate.

My name is Edward George Eden. I was born at Trentham, in Staffordshire,
      my father being employed in the gardens there. I lost my mother when I was
      three years old, and my father when I was five, my uncle, George Eden,
      then adopting me as his own son. He was a single man, self-educated, and
      well-known in Birmingham as an enterprising journalist; he educated me
      generously, fired my ambition to succeed in the world, and at his death,
      which happened four years ago, left me his entire fortune, a matter of
      about five hundred pounds after all outgoing charges were paid. I was then
      eighteen. He advised me in his will to expend the money in completing my
      education. I had already chosen the profession of medicine, and through
      his posthumous generosity and my good fortune in a scholarship
      competition, I became a medical student at University College, London. At
      the time of the beginning of my story I lodged at 11A University Street in
      a little upper room, very shabbily furnished and draughty, overlooking the
      back of Shoolbred''s premises. I used this little room both to live in and
      sleep in, because I was anxious to eke out my means to the very last
      shillings-worth.

I was taking a pair of shoes to be mended at a shop in the Tottenham Court
      Road when I first encountered the little old man with the yellow face,
      with whom my life has now become so inextricably entangled. He was
      standing on the kerb, and staring at the number on the door in a doubtful
      way, as I opened it. His eyes—they were dull grey eyes, and reddish
      under the rims—fell to my face, and his countenance immediately
      assumed an expression of corrugated amiability.

"You come," he said, "apt to the moment. I had forgotten the number of
      your house. How do you do, Mr. Eden?"

I was a little astonished at his familiar address, for I had never set
      eyes on the man before. I was a little annoyed, too, at his catching me
      with my boots under my arm. He noticed my lack of cordiality.

"Wonder who the deuce I am, eh? A friend, let me assure you. I have seen
      you before, though you haven''t seen me. Is there anywhere where I can talk
      to you?"

I hesitated. The shabbiness of my room upstairs was not a matter for every
      stranger. "Perhaps," said I, "we might walk down the street. I''m
      unfortunately prevented—" My gesture explained the sentence before I
      had spoken it.

"The very thing," he said, and faced this way, and then that. "The street?
      Which way shall we go?" I slipped my boots down in the passage. "Look
      here!" he said abruptly; "this business of mine is a rigmarole. Come and
      lunch with me, Mr. Eden. I''m an old man, a very old man, and not good at
      explanations, and what with my piping voice and the clatter of the traffic——"

I was not so old that an old man might not treat me to a lunch. Yet at the
      same time I was not altogether pleased by this abrupt invitation. "I had
      rather——" I began. "But I had rather," he said, catching me
      up, "and a certain civility is surely due to my grey hairs."

He took me to Blavitiski''s; I had to walk slowly to accommodate myself to
      his paces; and over such a lunch as I had never tasted before, he fended
      off my leading question, and I took a better note of his appearance. His
      clean-shaven face was lean and wrinkled, his shrivelled, lips fell over a
      set of false teeth, and his white hair was thin and rather long; he seemed
      small to me,—though indeed, most people seemed small to me,—and
      his shoulders were rounded and bent. And watching him, I could not help
      but observe that he too was taking note of me, running his eyes, with a
      curious touch of greed in them, over me, from my broad shoulders to my
      suntanned hands, and up to my freckled face again. "And now," said he, as
      we lit our cigarettes, "I must tell you of the business in hand.

"I must tell you, then, that I am an old man, a very old man." He paused
      momentarily. "And it happens that I have money that I must presently be
      leaving, and never a child have I to leave it to." I thought of the
      confidence trick, and resolved I would be on the alert for the vestiges of
      my five hundred pounds. He proceeded to enlarge on his loneliness, and the
      trouble he had to find a proper disposition of his money. "I have weighed
      this plan and that plan, charities, institutions, and scholarships, and
      libraries, and I have come to this conclusion at last,"—he fixed his
      eyes on my face,—"that I will find some young fellow, ambitious,
      pure-minded, and poor, healthy in body and healthy in mind, and, in short,
      make him my heir, give him all that I have." He repeated, "Give him all
      that I have. So that he will suddenly be lifted out of all the trouble and
      struggle in which his sympathies have been educated, to freedom and
      influence."

I tried to seem disinterested. With a transparent hypocrisy I said, "And
      you want my help, my professional services maybe, to find that person."

He smiled, and looked at me over his cigarette, and I laughed at his quiet
      exposure of my modest pretence.

"What a career such a man might have!" he said. "It fills me with envy to
      think how I have accumulated that another man may spend——

"But there are conditions, of course, burdens to be imposed. He must, for
      instance, take my name. You cannot expect everything without some return.
      And I must go into all the circumstances of his life before I can accept
      him. He must be sound. I must know his heredity, how his parents
      and grandparents died, have the strictest inquiries made into his private
      morals."

I answered never a word. My imagination was dancing wildly, my innate
      scepticism was useless to modify its transports. There was not a particle
      of gratitude in my mind—I did not know what to say nor how to say
      it. "But why me in particular?" I said at last.

He had chanced to hear of me from Professor Haslar; he said, as a
      typically sound and sane young man, and he wished, as far as possible, to
      leave his money where health and integrity were assured.

That was my first meeting with the little old man. He was mysterious about
      himself; he would not give his name yet, he said, and after I had answered
      some questions of his, he left me at the Blavitiski portal. I noticed that
      he drew a handful of gold coins from his pocket when it came to paying for
      the lunch. His insistence upon bodily health was curious. In accordance
      with an arrangement we had made I applied that day for a life policy in
      the Loyal Insurance Company for a large sum, and I was exhaustively
      overhauled by the medical advisers of that company in the subsequent week.
      Even that did not satisfy him, and he insisted I must be re-examined by
      the great Doctor Henderson.

It was Friday in Whitsun week before he came to a decision. He called me
      down, quite late in the evening,—nearly nine it was,—from
      cramming chemical equations for my Preliminary Scientific examination. He
      was standing in the passage under the feeble gas-lamp, and his face was a
      grotesque interplay of shadows. He seemed more bowed than when I had first
      seen him, and his cheeks had sunk in a little.

His voice shook with emotion. "Everything is satisfactory, Mr. Eden," he
      said. "Everything is quite, quite satisfactory. And this night of all
      nights, you must dine with me and celebrate your—accession." He was
      interrupted by a cough. "You won''t have long to wait, either," he said,
      wiping his handkerchief across his lips, and gripping my hand with his
      long bony claw that was disengaged. "Certainly not very long to wait."

We went into the street and called a cab. I remember every incident of
      that drive vividly, the swift, easy motion, the vivid contrast of gas and
      oil and electric light, the crowds of people in the streets, the place in
      Regent Street to which we went, and the sumptuous dinner we were served
      with there. I was disconcerted at first by the well-dressed waiter''s
      glances at my rough clothes, bothered by the stones of the olives, but as
      the champagne warmed my blood, my confidence revived. At first the old man
      talked of himself. He had already told me his name in the cab; he was
      Egbert Elvesham, the great philosopher, whose name I had known since I was
      a lad at school. It seemed incredible to me that this man, whose
      intelligence had so early dominated mine, this great abstraction, should
      suddenly realise itself as this decrepit, familiar figure. I daresay every
      young fellow who has suddenly fallen among celebrities has felt something
      of my disappointment. He told me now of the future that the feeble streams
      of his life would presently leave dry for me, houses, copyrights,
      investments; I had never suspected that philosophers were so rich. He
      watched me drink and eat with a touch of envy. "What a capacity for living
      you have!" he said; and then with a sigh, a sigh of relief I could have
      thought it, "it will not be long."

"Ay," said I, my head swimming now with champagne; "I have a future
      perhaps—of a passing agreeable sort, thanks to you. I shall now have
      the honour of your name. But you have a past. Such a past as is worth all
      my future."

He shook his head and smiled, as I thought, with half sad appreciation of
      my flattering admiration. "That future," he said, "would you in truth
      change it?" The waiter came with liqueurs. "You will not perhaps mind
      taking my name, taking my position, but would you indeed—willingly—take
      my years?"

He smiled again. "Kummel—both," he said to the waiter, and turned
      his attention to a little paper packet he had taken from his pocket. "This
      hour," said he, "this after-dinner hour is the hour of small things. Here
      is a scrap of my unpublished wisdom." He opened the packet with his
      shaking yellow fingers, and showed a little pinkish powder on the paper.
      "This," said he—"well, you must guess what it is. But Kummel—put
      but a dash of this powder in it—is Himmel."

It was a bit of a shock to me to find this great teacher gave his mind to
      the flavour of liqueurs. However, I feigned an interest in his weakness,
      for I was drunk enough for such small sycophancy.

He parted the powder between the little glasses, and, rising suddenly,
      with a strange unexpected dignity, held out his hand towards me. I
      imitated his action, and the glasses rang. "To a quick succession," said
      he, and raised his glass towards his lips.

"To a long life," said I. — He hesitated. "To a long life," said he,
      with a sudden bark of laughter, and with eyes fixed on one another we
      tilted the little glasses. His eyes looked straight into mine, and as I
      drained the stuff off, I felt a curiously intense sensation. The first
      touch of it set my brain in a furious tumult; I seemed to feel an actual
      physical stirring in my skull, and a seething humming filled my ears. I
      did not notice the flavour in my mouth, the aroma that filled my throat; I
      saw only the grey intensity of his gaze that burnt into mine. The draught,
      the mental confusion, the noise and stirring in my head, seemed to last an
      interminable time. Curious vague impressions of half-forgotten things
      danced and vanished on the edge of my consciousness. At last he broke the
      spell. With a sudden explosive sigh he put down his glass.

My head was spinning. I sat down. My brain was chaos. Then my perception
      grew clear and minute as though I saw things in a concave mirror. His
      manner seemed to have changed into something nervous and hasty. He pulled
      out his watch and grimaced at it. "Eleven-seven! And to-night I must—
      Seven-twenty-five. Waterloo! I must go at once." He called for the bill,
      and struggled with his coat. Officious waiters came to our assistance. In
      another moment I was wishing him good-bye, over the apron of a cab, and
      still with an absurd feeling of minute distinctness, as though—how
      can I express it?—I not only saw but felt through an inverted
      opera-glass.

"That stuff," he said. He put his hand to his forehead. "I ought not to
      have given it to you. It will make your head split to-morrow. Wait a
      minute. Here." He handed me out a little flat thing like a
      seidlitz-powder. "Take that in water as you are going to bed. The other
      thing was a drug. Not till you''re ready to go to bed, mind. It will clear
      your head. That''s all. One more shake—Futurus!"

I gripped his shrivelled claw. "Good-bye," he said, and by the droop of
      his eyelids I judged he too was a little under the influence of that
      brain-twisting cordial.

He recollected something else with a start, felt in his breast-pocket, and
      produced another packet, this time a cylinder the size and shape of a
      shaving-stick. "Here," said he. "I''d almost forgotten. Don''t open this
      until I come to-morrow—but take it now."

It was so heavy that I wellnigh dropped it. "All ri''!" said I, and he
      grinned at me through the cab window as the cabman flicked his horse into
      wakefulness. It was a white packet he had given me, with red seals at
      either end and along its edge. "If this isn''t money," said I, "it''s
      platinum or lead."

I stuck it with elaborate care into my pocket, and with a whirling brain
      walked home through the Regent Street loiterers and the dark back streets
      beyond Portland Road. I remember the sensations of that walk very vividly,
      strange as they were. I was still so far myself that I could notice my
      strange mental state, and wonder whether this stuff I had had was opium—a
      drug beyond my experience. It is hard now to describe the peculiarity of
      my mental strangeness—mental doubling vaguely expresses it. As I was
      walking up Regent Street I found in my mind a queer persuasion that it was
      Waterloo Station, and had an odd impulse to get into the Polytechnic as a
      man might get into a train. I put a knuckle in my eye, and it was Regent
      Street. How can I express it? You see a skilful actor looking quietly at
      you, he pulls a grimace, and lo!—another person. Is it too
      extravagant if I tell you that it seemed to me as if Regent Street had,
      for the moment, done that? Then, being persuaded it was Regent Street
      again, I was oddly muddled about some fantastic reminiscences that cropped
      up. "Thirty years ago," thought I, "it was here that I quarrelled with my
      brother." Then I burst out laughing, to the astonishment and encouragement
      of a group of night prowlers. Thirty years ago I did not exist, and never
      in my life had I boasted a brother. The stuff was surely liquid folly, for
      the poignant regret for that lost brother still clung to me. Along
      Portland Road the madness took another turn. I began to recall vanished
      shops, and to compare the street with what it used to be. Confused,
      troubled thinking is comprehensible enough after the drink I had taken,
      but what puzzled me were these curiously vivid phantasm memories that had
      crept into my mind, and not only the memories that had crept in, but also
      the memories that had slipped out. I stopped opposite Stevens'', the
      natural history dealer''s, and cudgelled my brains to think what he had to
      do with me. A ''bus went by, and sounded exactly like the rumbling of a
      train. I seemed to be dipping into some dark, remote pit for the
      recollection. "Of course," said I, at last, "he has promised me three
      frogs to-morrow. Odd I should have forgotten."

Do they still show children dissolving views? In those I remember one view
      would begin like a faint ghost, and grow and oust another. In just that
      way it seemed to me that a ghostly set of new sensations was struggling
      with those of my ordinary self.

I went on through Euston Road to Tottenham Court Road, puzzled, and a
      little frightened, and scarcely noticed the unusual way I was taking, for
      commonly I used to cut through the intervening network of back streets. I
      turned into University Street, to discover that I had forgotten my number.
      Only by a strong effort did I recall 11A, and even then it seemed to me
      that it was a thing some forgotten person had told me. I tried to steady
      my mind by recalling the incidents of the dinner, and for the life of me I
      could conjure up no picture of my host''s face; I saw him only as a shadowy
      outline, as one might see oneself reflected in a window through which one
      was looking. In his place, however, I had a curious exterior vision of
      myself, sitting at a table, flushed, bright-eyed, and talkative.

I tried the wrong side of the hall for my candle and the matches, and had
      a doubt of which landing my room might be on. "I''m drunk," I said, "that''s
      certain," and blundered needlessly on the staircase to sustain the
      proposition.

At the first glance my room seemed unfamiliar. "What rot!" I said, and
      stared about me. I seemed to bring myself back by the effort, and the odd
      phantasmal quality passed into the concrete familiar. There was the old
      glass still, with my notes on the albumens stuck in the corner of the
      frame, my old everyday suit of clothes pitched about the floor. And yet it
      was not so real after all. I felt an idiotic persuasion trying to creep
      into my mind, as it were, that I was in a railway carriage in a train just
      stopping, that I was peering out of the window at some unknown station. I
      gripped the bed-rail firmly to reassure myself. "It''s clairvoyance,
      perhaps," I said. "I must write to the Psychical Research Society."

I put the rouleau on my dressing-table, sat on my bed, and began to take
      off my boots. It was as if the picture of my present sensations was
      painted over some other picture that was trying to show through. "Curse
      it!" said I; "my wits are going, or am I in two places at once?"
      Half-undressed, I tossed the powder into a glass and drank it off. It
      effervesced, and became a fluorescent amber colour. Before I was in bed my
      mind was already tranquillised. I felt the pillow at my cheek, and
      thereupon I must have fallen asleep.

I awoke abruptly out of a dream of strange beasts, and found myself lying
      on my back. Probably every one knows that dismal, emotional dream from
      which one escapes, awake indeed, but strangely cowed. There was a curious
      taste in my mouth, a tired feeling in my limbs, a sense of cutaneous
      discomfort. I lay with my head motionless on my pillow, expecting that my
      feeling of strangeness and terror would pass away, and that I should then
      doze off again to sleep. But instead of that, my uncanny sensations
      increased. At first I could perceive nothing wrong about me. There was a
      faint light in the room, so faint that it was the very next thing to
      darkness, and the furniture stood out in it as vague blots of absolute
      darkness. I stared with my eyes just over the bedclothes.

It came into my mind that some one had entered the room to rob me of my
      rouleau of money, but after lying for some moments, breathing regularly to
      simulate sleep, I realised this was mere fancy. Nevertheless, the uneasy
      assurance of something wrong kept fast hold of me. With an effort I raised
      my head from the pillow, and peered about me at the dark. What it was I
      could not conceive. I looked at the dim shapes around me, the greater and
      lesser darknesses that indicated curtains, table, fireplace, bookshelves,
      and so forth. Then I began to perceive something unfamiliar in the forms
      of the darkness. Had the bed turned round? Yonder should be the
      bookshelves, and something shrouded and pallid rose there, something that
      would not answer to the bookshelves, however I looked at it. It was far
      too big to be my shirt thrown on a chair.

Overcoming a childish terror, I threw back the bedclothes and thrust my
      leg out of bed. Instead of coming out of my truckle-bed upon the floor, I
      found my foot scarcely reached the edge of the mattress. I made another
      step, as it were, and sat up on the edge of the bed. By the side of my bed
      should be the candle, and the matches upon the broken chair. I put out my
      hand and touched—nothing. I waved my hand in the darkness, and it
      came against some heavy hanging, soft and thick in texture, which gave a
      rustling noise at my touch. I grasped this and pulled it; it appeared to
      be a curtain suspended over the head of my bed.

I was now thoroughly awake, and beginning to realise that I was in a
      strange room. I was puzzled. I tried to recall the overnight
      circumstances, and I found them now, curiously enough, vivid in my memory:
      the supper, my reception of the little packages, my wonder whether I was
      intoxicated, my slow undressing, the coolness to my flushed face of my
      pillow. I felt a sudden distrust. Was that last night, or the night
      before? At any rate, this room was strange to me, and I could not imagine
      how I had got into it. The dim, pallid outline was growing paler, and I
      perceived it was a window, with the dark shape of an oval toilet-glass
      against the weak intimation of the dawn that filtered through the blind. I
      stood up, and was surprised by a curious feeling of weakness and
      unsteadiness. With trembling hands outstretched, I walked slowly towards
      the window, getting, nevertheless, a bruise on the knee from a chair by
      the way. I fumbled round the glass, which was large, with handsome brass
      sconces, to find the blind cord. I could not find any. By chance I took
      hold of the tassel, and with the click of a spring the blind ran up.

I found myself looking out upon a scene that was altogether strange to me.
      The night was overcast, and through the flocculent grey of the heaped
      clouds there filtered a faint half-light of dawn. Just at the edge of the
      sky the cloud-canopy had a blood-red rim. Below, everything was dark and
      indistinct, dim hills in the distance, a vague mass of buildings running
      up into pinnacles, trees like spilt ink, and below the window a tracery of
      black bushes and pale grey paths. It was so unfamiliar that for the moment
      I thought myself still dreaming. I felt the toilet-table; it appeared to
      be made of some polished wood, and was rather elaborately furnished—there
      were little cut-glass bottles and a brush upon it. There was also a queer
      little object, horse-shoe shape it felt, with smooth, hard projections,
      lying in a saucer. I could find no matches nor candlestick.

I turned my eyes to the room again. Now the blind was up, faint spectres
      of its furnishing came out of the darkness. There was a huge curtained
      bed, and the fireplace at its foot had a large white mantel with something
      of the shimmer of marble.

I leant against the toilet-table, shut my eyes and opened them again, and
      tried to think. The whole thing was far too real for dreaming. I was
      inclined to imagine there was still some hiatus in my memory, as a
      consequence of my draught of that strange liqueur; that I had come into my
      inheritance perhaps, and suddenly lost my recollection of everything since
      my good fortune had been announced. Perhaps if I waited a little, things
      would be clearer to me again. Yet my dinner with old Elvesham was now
      singularly vivid and recent. The champagne, the observant waiters, the
      powder, and the liqueurs—I could have staked my soul it all happened
      a few hours ago.

And then occurred a thing so trivial and yet so terrible to me that I
      shiver now to think of that moment. I spoke aloud. I said, "How the devil
      did I get here?" ... And the voice was not my own.

It was not my own, it was thin, the articulation was slurred, the
      resonance of my facial bones was different. Then, to reassure myself I ran
      one hand over the other, and felt loose folds of skin, the bony laxity of
      age. "Surely," I said, in that horrible voice that had somehow established
      itself in my throat, "surely this thing is a dream!" Almost as quickly as
      if I did it involuntarily, I thrust my fingers into my mouth. My teeth had
      gone. My finger-tips ran on the flaccid surface of an even row of
      shrivelled gums. I was sick with dismay and disgust.

I felt then a passionate desire to see myself, to realise at once in its
      full horror the ghastly change that had come upon me. I tottered to the
      mantel, and felt along it for matches. As I did so, a barking cough sprang
      up in my throat, and I clutched the thick flannel nightdress I found about
      me. There were no matches there, and I suddenly realised that my
      extremities were cold. Sniffing and coughing, whimpering a little,
      perhaps, I fumbled back to bed. "It is surely a dream," I whispered to
      myself as I clambered back, "surely a dream." It was a senile repetition.
      I pulled the bedclothes over my shoulders, over my ears, I thrust my
      withered hand under the pillow, and determined to compose myself to sleep.
      Of course it was a dream. In the morning the dream would be over, and I
      should wake up strong and vigorous again to my youth and studies. I shut
      my eyes, breathed regularly, and, finding myself wakeful, began to count
      slowly through the powers of three.

But the thing I desired would not come. I could not get to sleep. And the
      persuasion of the inexorable reality of the change that had happened to me
      grew steadily. Presently I found myself with my eyes wide open, the powers
      of three forgotten, and my skinny fingers upon my shrivelled gums, I was,
      indeed, suddenly and abruptly, an old man. I had in some unaccountable
      manner fallen through my life and come to old age, in some way I had been
      cheated of all the best of my life, of love, of struggle, of strength, and
      hope. I grovelled into the pillow and tried to persuade myself that such
      hallucination was possible. Imperceptibly, steadily, the dawn grew
      clearer.

At last, despairing of further sleep, I sat up in bed and looked about me.
      A chill twilight rendered the whole chamber visible. It was spacious and
      well-furnished, better furnished than any room I had ever slept in before.
      A candle and matches became dimly visible upon a little pedestal in a
      recess. I threw back the bedclothes, and, shivering with the rawness of
      the early morning, albeit it was summer-time, I got out and lit the
      candle. Then, trembling horribly, so that the extinguisher rattled on its
      spike, I tottered to the glass and saw—Elvesham''s face! It
      was none the less horrible because I had already dimly feared as much. He
      had already seemed physically weak and pitiful to me, but seen now,
      dressed only in a coarse flannel nightdress, that fell apart and showed
      the stringy neck, seen now as my own body, I cannot describe its desolate
      decrepitude. The hollow cheeks, the straggling tail of dirty grey hair,
      the rheumy bleared eyes, the quivering, shrivelled lips, the lower
      displaying a gleam of the pink interior lining, and those horrible dark
      gums showing. You who are mind and body together, at your natural years,
      cannot imagine what this fiendish imprisonment meant to me. To be young
      and full of the desire and energy of youth, and to be caught, and
      presently to be crushed in this tottering ruin of a body...

But I wander from the course of my story. For some time I must have been
      stunned at this change that had come upon me. It was daylight when I did
      so far gather myself together as to think. In some inexplicable way I had
      been changed, though how, short of magic, the thing had been done, I could
      not say. And as I thought, the diabolical ingenuity of Elvesham came home
      to me. It seemed plain to me that as I found myself in his, so he must be
      in possession of my body, of my strength, that is, and my future.
      But how to prove it? Then, as I thought, the thing became so incredible,
      even to me, that my mind reeled, and I had to pinch myself, to feel my
      toothless gums, to see myself in the glass, and touch the things about me,
      before I could steady myself to face the facts again. Was all life
      hallucination? Was I indeed Elvesham, and he me? Had I been dreaming of
      Eden overnight? Was there any Eden? But if I was Elvesham, I should
      remember where I was on the previous morning, the name of the town in
      which I lived, what happened before the dream began. I struggled with my
      thoughts. I recalled the queer doubleness of my memories overnight. But
      now my mind was clear. Not the ghost of any memories but those proper to
      Eden could I raise.

"This way lies insanity!" I cried in my piping voice. I staggered to my
      feet, dragged my feeble, heavy limbs to the washhand-stand, and plunged my
      grey head into a basin of cold water. Then, towelling myself, I tried
      again. It was no good. I felt beyond all question that I was indeed Eden,
      not Elvesham. But Eden in Elvesham''s body!

Had I been a man of any other age, I might have given myself up to my fate
      as one enchanted. But in these sceptical days miracles do not pass
      current. Here was some trick of psychology. What a drug and a steady stare
      could do, a drug and a steady stare, or some similar treatment, could
      surely undo. Men have lost their memories before. But to exchange memories
      as one does umbrellas! I laughed. Alas! not a healthy laugh, but a
      wheezing, senile titter. I could have fancied old Elvesham laughing at my
      plight, and a gust of petulant anger, unusual to me, swept across my
      feelings. I began dressing eagerly in the clothes I found lying about on
      the floor, and only realised when I was dressed that it was an evening
      suit I had assumed. I opened the wardrobe and found some more ordinary
      clothes, a pair of plaid trousers, and an old-fashioned dressing-gown. I
      put a venerable smoking-cap on my venerable head, and, coughing a little
      from my exertions, tottered out upon the landing.

It was then, perhaps, a quarter to six, and the blinds were closely drawn
      and the house quite silent. The landing was a spacious one, a broad,
      richly-carpeted staircase went down into the darkness of the hall below,
      and before me a door ajar showed me a writing-desk, a revolving bookcase,
      the back of a study chair, and a fine array of bound books, shelf upon
      shelf.

"My study," I mumbled, and walked across the landing. Then at the sound of
      my voice a thought struck me, and I went back to the bedroom and put in
      the set of false teeth. They slipped in with the ease of old, habit.
      "That''s better," said I, gnashing them, and so returned to the study.

The drawers of the writing-desk were locked. Its revolving top was also
      locked. I could see no indications of the keys, and there were none in the
      pockets of my trousers. I shuffled back at once to the bedroom, and went
      through the dress suit, and afterwards the pockets of all the garments I
      could find. I was very eager, and one might have imagined that burglars
      had been at work, to see my room when I had done. Not only were there no
      keys to be found, but not a coin, nor a scrap of paper—save only the
      receipted bill of the overnight dinner.

A curious weariness asserted itself. I sat down and stared at the garments
      flung here and there, their pockets turned inside out. My first frenzy had
      already flickered out. Every moment I was beginning to realise the immense
      intelligence of the plans of my enemy, to see more and more clearly the
      hopelessness of my position. With an effort I rose and hurried hobbling
      into the study again. On the staircase was a housemaid pulling up the
      blinds. She stared, I think, at the expression of my face. I shut the door
      of the study behind me, and, seizing a poker, began an attack upon the
      desk. That is how they found me. The cover of the desk was split, the lock
      smashed, the letters torn out of the pigeon-holes, and tossed about the
      room. In my senile rage I had flung about the pens and other such light
      stationery, and overturned the ink. Moreover, a large vase upon the mantel
      had got broken—I do not know how. I could find no cheque-book, no
      money, no indications of the slightest use for the recovery of my body. I
      was battering madly at the drawers, when the butler, backed by two
      women-servants, intruded upon me.

That simply is the story of my change. No one will believe my frantic
      assertions. I am treated as one demented, and even at this moment I am
      under restraint. But I am sane, absolutely sane, and to prove it I have
      sat down to write this story minutely as the things happened to me. I
      appeal to the reader, whether there is any trace of insanity in the style
      or method, of the story he has been reading. I am a young man locked away
      in an old man''s body. But the clear fact is incredible to everyone.
      Naturally I appear demented to those who will not believe this, naturally
      I do not know the names of my secretaries, of the doctors who come to see
      me, of my servants and neighbours, of this town (wherever it is) where I
      find myself. Naturally I lose myself in my own house, and suffer
      inconveniences of every sort. Naturally I ask the oddest questions.
      Naturally I weep and cry out, and have paroxysms of despair. I have no
      money and no cheque-book. The bank will not recognise my signature, for I
      suppose that, allowing for the feeble muscles I now have, my handwriting
      is still Eden''s. These people about me will not let me go to the bank
      personally. It seems, indeed, that there is no bank in this town, and that
      I have an account in some part of London. It seems that Elvesham kept the
      name of his solicitor secret from all his household. I can ascertain
      nothing. Elvesham was, of course, a profound student of mental science,
      and all my declarations of the facts of the case merely confirm the theory
      that my insanity is the outcome of overmuch brooding upon psychology.
      Dreams of the personal identity indeed! Two days ago I was a healthy
      youngster, with all life before me; now I am a furious old man, unkempt,
      and desperate, and miserable, prowling about a great, luxurious, strange
      house, watched, feared, and avoided as a lunatic by everyone about me. And
      in London is Elvesham beginning life again in a vigorous body, and with
      all the accumulated knowledge and wisdom of threescore and ten. He has
      stolen my life.

What has happened I do not clearly know. In the study are volumes of
      manuscript notes referring chiefly to the psychology of memory, and parts
      of what may be either calculations or ciphers in symbols absolutely
      strange to me. In some passages there are indications that he was also
      occupied with the philosophy of mathematics. I take it he has transferred
      the whole of his memories, the accumulation that makes up his personality,
      from this old withered brain of his to mine, and, similarly, that he has
      transferred mine to his discarded tenement. Practically, that is, he has
      changed bodies. But how such a change may be possible is without the range
      of my philosophy. I have been a materialist for all my thinking life, but
      here, suddenly, is a clear case of man''s detachability from matter.

One desperate experiment I am about to try. I sit writing here before
      putting the matter to issue. This morning, with the help of a table-knife
      that I had secreted at breakfast, I succeeded in breaking open a fairly
      obvious secret drawer in this wrecked writing-desk. I discovered nothing
      save a little green glass phial containing a white powder. Round the neck
      of the phial was a label, and thereon was written this one word, "Release."
      This may be—is most probably—poison. I can understand Elvesham
      placing poison in my way, and I should be sure that it was his intention
      so to get rid of the only living witness against him, were it not for this
      careful concealment. The man has practically solved the problem of
      immortality. Save for the spite of chance, he will live in my body until
      it has aged, and then, again, throwing that aside, he will assume some
      other victim''s youth and strength. When one remembers his heartlessness,
      it is terrible to think of the ever-growing experience that... How long
      has he been leaping from body to body?... But I tire of writing. The
      powder appears to be soluble in water. The taste is not unpleasant.

There the narrative found upon Mr. Elvesham''s desk ends. His dead body lay
      between the desk and the chair. The latter had been pushed back, probably
      by his last convulsions. The story was written in pencil and in a crazy
      hand, quite unlike his usual minute characters. There remain only two
      curious facts to record. Indisputably there was some connection between
      Eden and Elvesham, since the whole of Elvesham''s property was bequeathed
      to the young man. But he never inherited. When Elvesham committed suicide,
      Eden was, strangely enough, already dead. Twenty-four hours before, he had
      been knocked down by a cab and killed instantly, at the crowded crossing
      at the intersection of Gower Street and Euston Road. So that the only
      human being who could have thrown light upon this fantastic narrative is
      beyond the reach of questions. Without further comment I leave this
      extraordinary matter to the reader''s individual judgment.

"What if I die under it?" The thought recurred again and again, as I
      walked home from Haddon''s. It was a purely personal question. I was spared
      the deep anxieties of a married man, and I knew there were few of my
      intimate friends but would find my death troublesome chiefly on account of
      their duty of regret. I was surprised indeed, and perhaps a little
      humiliated, as I turned the matter over, to think how few could possibly
      exceed the conventional requirement. Things came before me stripped of
      glamour, in a clear dry light, during that walk from Haddon''s house over
      Primrose Hill. There were the friends of my youth: I perceived now that
      our affection was a tradition, which we foregathered rather laboriously to
      maintain. There were the rivals and helpers of my later career: I suppose
      I had been cold-blooded or undemonstrative—one perhaps implies the
      other. It may be that even the capacity for friendship is a question of
      physique. There had been a time in my own life when I had grieved bitterly
      enough at the loss of a friend; but as I walked home that afternoon the
      emotional side of my imagination was dormant. I could not pity myself, nor
      feel sorry for my friends, nor conceive of them as grieving for me.

I was interested in this deadness of my emotional nature—no doubt a
      concomitant of my stagnating physiology; and my thoughts wandered off
      along the line it suggested. Once before, in my hot youth, I had suffered
      a sudden loss of blood, and had been within an ace of death. I remembered
      now that my affections as well as my passions had drained out of me,
      leaving scarce anything but a tranquil resignation, a dreg of self-pity.
      It had been weeks before the old ambitions and tendernesses and all the
      complex moral interplay of a man had reasserted themselves. It occurred to
      me that the real meaning of this numbness might be a gradual slipping away
      from the pleasure-pain guidance of the animal man. It has been proven, I
      take it, as thoroughly as anything can be proven in this world, that the
      higher emotions, the moral feelings, even the subtle unselfishness of
      love, are evolved from the elemental desires and fears of the simple
      animal: they are the harness in which man''s mental freedom goes. And it
      may be that as death overshadows us, as our possibility of acting
      diminishes, this complex growth of balanced impulse, propensity and
      aversion, whose interplay inspires our acts, goes with it. Leaving what?

I was suddenly brought back to reality by an imminent collision with the
      butcher-boy''s tray. I found that I was crossing the bridge over the Regent''s
      Park Canal, which runs parallel with that in the Zoological Gardens. The
      boy in blue had been looking over his shoulder at a black barge advancing
      slowly, towed by a gaunt white horse. In the Gardens a nurse was leading
      three happy little children over the bridge. The trees were bright green;
      the spring hopefulness was still unstained by the dusts of summer; the sky
      in the water was bright and clear, but broken by long waves, by quivering
      bands of black, as the barge drove through. The breeze was stirring; but
      it did not stir me as the spring breeze used to do.

Was this dulness of feeling in itself an anticipation? It was curious that
      I could reason and follow out a network of suggestion as clearly as ever:
      so, at least, it seemed to me. It was calmness rather than dulness that
      was coming upon me. Was there any ground for the relief in the
      presentiment of death? Did a man near to death begin instinctively to
      withdraw himself from the meshes of matter and sense, even before the cold
      hand was laid upon his? I felt strangely isolated—isolated without
      regret—from the life and existence about me. The children playing in
      the sun and gathering strength and experience for the business of life,
      the park-keeper gossiping with a nursemaid, the nursing mother, the young
      couple intent upon each other as they passed me, the trees by the wayside
      spreading new pleading leaves to the sunlight, the stir in their branches—I
      had been part of it all, but I had nearly done with it now.

Some way down the Broad Walk I perceived that I was tired, and that my
      feet were heavy. It was hot that afternoon, and I turned aside and sat
      down on one of the green chairs that line the way. In a minute I had dozed
      into a dream, and the tide of my thoughts washed up a vision of the
      resurrection. I was still sitting in the chair, but I thought myself
      actually dead, withered, tattered, dried, one eye (I saw) pecked out by
      birds. "Awake!" cried a voice; and incontinently the dust of the path and
      the mould under the grass became insurgent. I had never before thought of
      Regent''s Park as a cemetery, but now, through the trees, stretching as far
      as eye could see, I beheld a flat plain of writhing graves and heeling
      tombstones. There seemed to be some trouble: the rising dead appeared to
      stifle as they struggled upward, they bled in their struggles, the red
      flesh was torn away from the white bones. "Awake!" cried a voice; but I
      determined I would not rise to such horrors. "Awake!" They would not let
      me alone. "Wake up!" said an angry voice. A cockney angel! The man who
      sells the tickets was shaking me, demanding my penny.

I paid my penny, pocketed my ticket, yawned, stretched my legs, and,
      feeling now rather less torpid, got up and walked on towards Langham
      Place. I speedily lost myself again in a shifting maze of thoughts about
      death. Going across Marylebone Road into that crescent at the end of
      Langham Place, I had the narrowest escape from the shaft of a cab, and
      went on my way with a palpitating heart and a bruised shoulder. It struck
      me that it would have been curious if my meditations on my death on the
      morrow had led to my death that day.

But I will not weary you with more of my experiences that day and the
      next. I knew more and more certainly that I should die under the
      operation; at times I think I was inclined to pose to myself. The doctors
      were coming at eleven, and I did not get up. It seemed scarce worth while
      to trouble about washing and dressing, and though I read my newspapers and
      the letters that came by the first post, I did not find them very
      interesting. There was a friendly note from Addison, my old school-friend,
      calling my attention to two discrepancies and a printer''s error in my new
      book, with one from Langridge venting some vexation over Minton. The rest
      were business communications. I breakfasted in bed. The glow of pain at my
      side seemed more massive. I knew it was pain, and yet, if you can
      understand, I did not find it very painful. I had been awake and hot and
      thirsty in the night, but in the morning bed felt comfortable. In the
      night-time I had lain thinking of things that were past; in the morning I
      dozed over the question of immortality. Haddon came, punctual to the
      minute, with a neat black bag; and Mowbray soon followed. Their arrival
      stirred me up a little. I began to take a more personal interest in the
      proceedings. Haddon moved the little octagonal table close to the bedside,
      and, with his broad back to me, began taking things out of his bag. I
      heard the light click of steel upon steel. My imagination, I found, was
      not altogether stagnant. "Will you hurt me much?" I said in an off-hand
      tone.

"Not a bit," Haddon answered over his shoulder. "We shall chloroform you.
      Your heart''s as sound as a bell." And as he spoke, I had a whiff of the
      pungent sweetness of the anaesthetic.

They stretched me out, with a convenient exposure of my side, and, almost
      before I realised what was happening, the chloroform was being
      administered. It stings the nostrils, and there is a suffocating sensation
      at first. I knew I should die—that this was the end of consciousness
      for me. And suddenly I felt that I was not prepared for death: I had a
      vague sense of a duty overlooked—I knew not what. What was it I had
      not done? I could think of nothing more to do, nothing desirable left in
      life; and yet I had the strangest disinclination to death. And the
      physical sensation was painfully oppressive. Of course the doctors did not
      know they were going to kill me. Possibly I struggled. Then I fell
      motionless, and a great silence, a monstrous silence, and an impenetrable
      blackness came upon me.

There must have been an interval of absolute unconsciousness, seconds or
      minutes. Then with a chilly, unemotional clearness, I perceived that I was
      not yet dead. I was still in my body; but all the multitudinous sensations
      that come sweeping from it to make up the background of consciousness had
      gone, leaving me free of it all. No, not free of it all; for as yet
      something still held me to the poor stark flesh upon the bed—held
      me, yet not so closely that I did not feel myself external to it,
      independent of it, straining away from it. I do not think I saw, I do not
      think I heard; but I perceived all that was going on, and it was as if I
      both heard and saw. Haddon was bending over me, Mowbray behind me; the
      scalpel—it was a large scalpel—was cutting my flesh at the
      side under the flying ribs. It was interesting to see myself cut like
      cheese, without a pang, without even a qualm. The interest was much of a
      quality with that one might feel in a game of chess between strangers.
      Haddon''s face was firm and his hand steady; but I was surprised to
      perceive (how I know not) that he was feeling the gravest doubt as
      to his own wisdom in the conduct of the operation.

Mowbray''s thoughts, too, I could see. He was thinking that Haddon''s manner
      showed too much of the specialist. New suggestions came up like bubbles
      through a stream of frothing meditation, and burst one after another in
      the little bright spot of his consciousness. He could not help noticing
      and admiring Haddon''s swift dexterity, in spite of his envious quality and
      his disposition to detract. I saw my liver exposed. I was puzzled at my
      own condition. I did not feel that I was dead, but I was different in some
      way from my living self. The grey depression, that had weighed on me for a
      year or more and coloured all my thoughts, was gone. I perceived and
      thought without any emotional tint at all. I wondered if everyone
      perceived things in this way under chloroform, and forgot it again when he
      came out of it. It would be inconvenient to look into some heads, and not
      forget.

Although I did not think that I was dead, I still perceived quite clearly
      that I was soon to die. This brought me back to the consideration of
      Haddon''s proceedings. I looked into his mind, and saw that he was afraid
      of cutting a branch of the portal vein. My attention was distracted from
      details by the curious changes going on in his mind. His consciousness was
      like the quivering little spot of light which is thrown by the mirror of a
      galvanometer. His thoughts ran under it like a stream, some through the
      focus bright and distinct, some shadowy in the half-light of the edge.
      Just now the little glow was steady; but the least movement on Mowbray''s
      part, the slightest sound from outside, even a faint difference in the
      slow movement of the living flesh he was cutting, set the light-spot
      shivering and spinning. A new sense-impression came rushing up through the
      flow of thoughts; and lo! the light-spot jerked away towards it, swifter
      than a frightened fish. It was wonderful to think that upon that unstable,
      fitful thing depended all the complex motions of the man; that for the
      next five minutes, therefore, my life hung upon its movements. And he was
      growing more and more nervous in his work. It was as if a little picture
      of a cut vein grew brighter, and struggled to oust from his brain another
      picture of a cut falling short of the mark. He was afraid: his dread of
      cutting too little was battling with his dread of cutting too far.

Then, suddenly, like an escape of water from under a lock-gate, a great
      uprush of horrible realisation set all his thoughts swirling, and
      simultaneously I perceived that the vein was cut. He started back with a
      hoarse exclamation, and I saw the brown-purple blood gather in a swift
      bead, and run trickling. He was horrified. He pitched the red-stained
      scalpel on to the octagonal table; and instantly both doctors flung
      themselves upon me, making hasty and ill-conceived efforts to remedy the
      disaster. "Ice!" said Mowbray, gasping. But I knew that I was killed,
      though my body still clung to me.

I will not describe their belated endeavours to save me, though I
      perceived every detail. My perceptions were sharper and swifter than they
      had ever been in life; my thoughts rushed through my mind with incredible
      swiftness, but with perfect definition. I can only compare their crowded
      clarity to the effects of a reasonable dose of opium. In a moment it would
      all be over, and I should be free. I knew I was immortal, but what would
      happen I did not know. Should I drift off presently, like a puff of smoke
      from a gun, in some kind of half-material body, an attenuated version of
      my material self? Should I find myself suddenly among the innumerable
      hosts of the dead, and know the world about me for the phantasmagoria it
      had always seemed? Should I drift to some spiritualistic siance,
      and there make foolish, incomprehensible attempts to affect a purblind
      medium? It was a state of unemotional curiosity, of colourless
      expectation. And then I realised a growing stress upon me, a feeling as
      though some huge human magnet was drawing me upward out of my body. The
      stress grew and grew. I seemed an atom for which monstrous forces were
      fighting. For one brief, terrible moment sensation came back to me. That
      feeling of falling headlong which comes in nightmares, that feeling a
      thousand times intensified, that and a black horror swept across my
      thoughts in a torrent. Then the two doctors, the naked body with its cut
      side, the little room, swept away from under me and vanished, as a speck
      of foam vanishes down an eddy.

I was in mid-air. Far below was the West End of London, receding rapidly,—for
      I seemed to be flying swiftly upward,—and as it receded, passing
      westward like a panorama. I could see, through the faint haze of smoke,
      the innumerable roofs chimney-set, the narrow roadways, stippled with
      people and conveyances, the little specks of squares, and the church
      steeples like thorns sticking out of the fabric. But it spun away as the
      earth rotated on its axis, and in a few seconds (as it seemed) I was over
      the scattered clumps of town about Ealing, the little Thames a thread of
      blue to the south, and the Chiltern Hills and the North Downs coming up
      like the rim of a basin, far away and faint with haze. Up I rushed. And at
      first I had not the faintest conception what this headlong rush upward
      could mean.

Every moment the circle of scenery beneath me grew wider and wider, and
      the details of town and field, of hill and valley, got more and more hazy
      and pale and indistinct, a luminous grey was mingled more and more with
      the blue of the hills and the green of the open meadows; and a little
      patch of cloud, low and far to the west, shone ever more dazzlingly white.
      Above, as the veil of atmosphere between myself and outer space grew
      thinner, the sky, which had been a fair springtime blue at first, grew
      deeper and richer in colour, passing steadily through the intervening
      shades, until presently it was as dark as the blue sky of midnight, and
      presently as black as the blackness of a frosty starlight, and at last as
      black as no blackness I had ever beheld. And first one star, and then
      many, and at last an innumerable host broke out upon the sky: more stars
      than anyone has ever seen from the face of the earth. For the blueness of
      the sky in the light of the sun and stars sifted and spread abroad
      blindingly: there is diffused light even in the darkest skies of winter,
      and we do not see the stars by day only because of the dazzling
      irradiation of the sun. But now I saw things—I know not how;
      assuredly with no mortal eyes—and that defect of bedazzlement
      blinded me no longer. The sun was incredibly strange and wonderful. The
      body of it was a disc of blinding white light: not yellowish, as it seems
      to those who live upon the earth, but livid white, all streaked with
      scarlet streaks and rimmed about with a fringe of writhing tongues of red
      fire. And shooting half-way across the heavens from either side of it and
      brighter than the Milky Way, were two pinions of silver white, making it
      look more like those winged globes I have seen in Egyptian sculpture than
      anything else I can remember upon earth. These I knew for the solar
      corona, though I had never seen anything of it but a picture during the
      days of my earthly life.

When my attention came back to the earth again, I saw that it had fallen
      very far away from me. Field and town were long since indistinguishable,
      and all the varied hues of the country were merging into a uniform bright
      grey, broken only by the brilliant white of the clouds that lay scattered
      in flocculent masses over Ireland and the west of England. For now I could
      see the outlines of the north of France and Ireland, and all this Island
      of Britain, save where Scotland passed over the horizon to the north, or
      where the coast was blurred or obliterated by cloud. The sea was a dull
      grey, and darker than the land; and the whole panorama was rotating slowly
      towards the east.

All this had happened so swiftly that until I was some thousand miles or
      so from the earth I had no thought for myself. But now I perceived I had
      neither hands nor feet, neither parts nor organs, and that I felt neither
      alarm nor pain. All about me I perceived that the vacancy (for I had
      already left the air behind) was cold beyond the imagination of man; but
      it troubled me not. The sun''s rays shot through the void, powerless to
      light or heat until they should strike on matter in their course. I saw
      things with a serene self-forgetfulness, even as if I were God. And down
      below there, rushing away from me,—countless miles in a second,—where
      a little dark spot on the grey marked the position of London, two doctors
      were struggling to restore life to the poor hacked and outworn shell I had
      abandoned. I felt then such release, such serenity as I can compare to no
      mortal delight I have ever known.

It was only after I had perceived all these things that the meaning of
      that headlong rush of the earth grew into comprehension. Yet it was so
      simple, so obvious, that I was amazed at my never anticipating the thing
      that was happening to me. I had suddenly been cut adrift from matter: all
      that was material of me was there upon earth, whirling away through space,
      held to the earth by gravitation, partaking of the earth-inertia, moving
      in its wreath of epicycles round the sun, and with the sun and the planets
      on their vast march through space. But the immaterial has no inertia,
      feels nothing of the pull of matter for matter: where it parts from its
      garment of flesh, there it remains (so far as space concerns it any
      longer) immovable in space. I was not leaving the earth: the earth
      was leaving me, and not only the earth but the whole solar system
      was streaming past. And about me in space, invisible to me, scattered in
      the wake of the earth upon its journey, there must be an innumerable
      multitude of souls, stripped like myself of the material, stripped like
      myself of the passions of the individual and the generous emotions of the
      gregarious brute, naked intelligences, things of new-born wonder and
      thought, marvelling at the strange release that had suddenly come on them!

As I receded faster and faster from the strange white sun in the black
      heavens, and from the broad and shining earth upon which my being had
      begun, I seemed to grow in some incredible manner vast: vast as regards
      this world I had left, vast as regards the moments and periods of a human
      life. Very soon I saw the full circle of the earth, slightly gibbous, like
      the moon when she nears her full, but very large; and the silvery shape of
      America was now in the noonday blaze wherein (as it seemed) little England
      had been basking but a few minutes ago. At first the earth was large, and
      shone in the heavens, filling a great part of them; but every moment she
      grew smaller and more distant. As she shrank, the broad moon in its third
      quarter crept into view over the rim of her disc. I looked for the
      constellations. Only that part of Aries directly behind the sun and the
      Lion, which the earth covered, were hidden. I recognised the tortuous,
      tattered band of the Milky Way with Vega very bright between sun and
      earth; and Sirius and Orion shone splendid against the unfathomable
      blackness in the opposite quarter of the heavens. The Pole Star was
      overhead, and the Great Bear hung over the circle of the earth. And away
      beneath and beyond the shining corona of the sun were strange groupings of
      stars I had never seen in my life—notably a dagger-shaped group that
      I knew for the Southern Cross. All these were no larger than when they had
      shone on earth, but the little stars that one scarce sees shone now
      against the setting of black vacancy as brightly as the first-magnitudes
      had done, while the larger worlds were points of indescribable glory and
      colour. Aldebaran was a spot of blood-red fire, and Sirius condensed to
      one point the light of innumerable sapphires. And they shone steadily:
      they did not scintillate, they were calmly glorious. My impressions had an
      adamantine hardness and brightness: there was no blurring softness, no
      atmosphere, nothing but infinite darkness set with the myriads of these
      acute and brilliant points and specks of light. Presently, when I looked
      again, the little earth seemed no bigger than the sun, and it dwindled and
      turned as I looked, until in a second''s space (as it seemed to me), it was
      halved; and so it went on swiftly dwindling. Far away in the opposite
      direction, a little pinkish pin''s head of light, shining steadily, was the
      planet Mars. I swam motionless in vacancy, and, without a trace of terror
      or astonishment, watched the speck of cosmic dust we call the world fall
      away from me.

Presently it dawned upon me that my sense of duration had changed; that my
      mind was moving not faster but infinitely slower, that between each
      separate impression there was a period of many days. The moon spun once
      round the earth as I noted this; and I perceived clearly the motion of
      Mars in his orbit. Moreover, it appeared as if the time between thought
      and thought grew steadily greater, until at last a thousand years was but
      a moment in my perception.

At first the constellations had shone motionless against the black
      background of infinite space; but presently it seemed as though the group
      of stars about Hercules and the Scorpion was contracting, while Orion and
      Aldebaran and their neighbours were scattering apart. Flashing suddenly
      out of the darkness there came a flying multitude of particles of rock,
      glittering like dust-specks in a sunbeam, and encompassed in a faintly
      luminous cloud. They swirled all about me, and vanished again in a
      twinkling far behind. And then I saw that a bright spot of light, that
      shone a little to one side of my path, was growing very rapidly larger,
      and perceived that it was the planet Saturn rushing towards me. Larger and
      larger it grew, swallowing up the heavens behind it, and hiding every
      moment a fresh multitude, of stars. I perceived its flattened, whirling
      body, its disc-like belt, and seven of its little satellites. It grew and
      grew, till it towered enormous; and then I plunged amid a streaming
      multitude of clashing stones and dancing dust-particles and gas-eddies,
      and saw for a moment the mighty triple belt like three concentric arches
      of moonlight above me, its shadow black on the boiling tumult below. These
      things happened in one-tenth of the time it takes to tell them. The planet
      went by like a flash of lightning; for a few seconds it blotted out the
      sun, and there and then became a mere black, dwindling, winged patch
      against the light. The earth, the mother mote of my being, I could no
      longer see.

So with a stately swiftness, in the profoundest silence, the solar system
      fell from me as it had been a garment, until the sun was a mere star amid
      the multitude of stars, with its eddy of planet-specks lost in the
      confused glittering of the remoter light. I was no longer a denizen of the
      solar system: I had come to the outer Universe, I seemed to grasp and
      comprehend the whole world of matter. Ever more swiftly the stars closed
      in about the spot where Antares and Vega had vanished in a phosphorescent
      haze, until that part of the sky had the semblance of a whirling mass of
      nebulae, and ever before me yawned vaster gaps of vacant blackness, and
      the stars shone fewer and fewer. It seemed as if I moved towards a point
      between Orion''s belt and sword; and the void about that region opened
      vaster and vaster every second, an incredible gulf of nothingness into
      which I was falling. Faster and ever faster the universe rushed by, a
      hurry of whirling motes at last, speeding silently into the void. Stars
      glowing brighter and brighter, with their circling planets catching the
      light in a ghostly fashion as I neared them, shone out and vanished again
      into inexistence; faint comets, clusters of meteorites, winking specks of
      matter, eddying light-points, whizzed past, some perhaps a hundred
      millions of miles or so from me at most, few nearer, travelling with
      unimaginable rapidity, shooting constellations, momentary darts of fire,
      through that black, enormous night. More than anything else it was like a
      dusty draught, sunbeam-lit. Broader and wider and deeper grew the starless
      space, the vacant Beyond, into which I was being drawn. At last a quarter
      of the heavens was black and blank, and the whole headlong rush of stellar
      universe closed in behind me like a veil of light that is gathered
      together. It drove away from me like a monstrous jack-o''-lantern driven by
      the wind. I had come out into the wilderness of space. Ever the vacant
      blackness grew broader, until the hosts of the stars seemed only like a
      swarm of fiery specks hurrying away from me, inconceivably remote, and the
      darkness, the nothingness and emptiness, was about me on every side. Soon
      the little universe of matter, the cage of points in which I had begun to
      be, was dwindling, now to a whirling disc of luminous glittering, and now
      to one minute disc of hazy light. In a little while it would shrink to a
      point, and at last would vanish altogether.

Suddenly feeling came back to me—feeling in the shape of
      overwhelming terror; such a dread of those dark vastitudes as no words can
      describe, a passionate resurgence of sympathy and social desire. Were
      there other souls, invisible to me as I to them, about me in the
      blackness? or was I indeed, even as I felt, alone? Had I passed out of
      being into something that was neither being nor not-being? The covering of
      the body, the covering of matter, had been torn from me, and the
      hallucinations of companionship and security. Everything was black and
      silent. I had ceased to be. I was nothing. There was nothing, save only
      that infinitesimal dot of light that dwindled in the gulf. I strained
      myself to hear and see, and for a while there was naught but infinite
      silence, intolerable darkness, horror, and despair.

Then I saw that about the spot of light into which the whole world of
      matter had shrunk there was a faint glow. And in a band on either side of
      that the darkness was not absolute. I watched it for ages, as it seemed to
      me, and through the long waiting the haze grew imperceptibly more
      distinct. And then about the band appeared an irregular cloud of the
      faintest, palest brown. I felt a passionate impatience; but the things
      grew brighter so slowly that they scarce seemed to change. What was
      unfolding itself? What was this strange reddish dawn in the interminable
      night of space?

The cloud''s shape was grotesque. It seemed to be looped along its lower
      side into four projecting masses, and, above, it ended in a straight line.
      What phantom was it? I felt assured I had seen that figure before; but I
      could not think what, nor where, nor when it was. Then the realisation
      rushed upon me. It was a clenched Hand. I was alone in space, alone
      with this huge, shadowy Hand, upon which the whole Universe of Matter lay
      like an unconsidered speck of dust. It seemed as though I watched it
      through vast periods of time. On the forefinger glittered a ring; and the
      universe from which I had come was but a spot of light upon the ring''s
      curvature. And the thing that the hand gripped had the likeness of a black
      rod. Through a long eternity I watched this Hand, with the ring and the
      rod, marvelling and fearing and waiting helplessly on what might follow.
      It seemed as though nothing could follow: that I should watch for ever,
      seeing only the Hand and the thing it held, and understanding nothing of
      its import. Was the whole universe but a refracting speck upon some
      greater Being? Were our worlds but the atoms of another universe, and
      those again of another, and so on through an endless progression? And what
      was I? Was I indeed immaterial? A vague persuasion of a body gathering
      about me came into my suspense. The abysmal darkness about the Hand filled
      with impalpable suggestions, with uncertain, fluctuating shapes.

Then, suddenly, came a sound, like the sound of a tolling bell: faint, as
      if infinitely far; muffled, as though heard through thick swathings of
      darkness: a deep, vibrating resonance, with vast gulfs of silence between
      each stroke. And the Hand appeared to tighten on the rod. And I saw far
      above the Hand, towards the apex of the darkness, a circle of dim
      phosphorescence, a ghostly sphere whence these sounds came throbbing; and
      at the last stroke the Hand vanished, for the hour had come, and I heard a
      noise of many waters. But the black rod remained as a great band across
      the sky. And then a voice, which seemed to run to the uttermost parts of
      space, spoke, saying, "There will be no more pain."

At that an almost intolerable gladness and radiance rushed in upon me, and
      I saw the circle shining white and bright, and the rod black and shining,
      and many things else distinct and clear. And the circle was the face of
      the clock, and the rod the rail of my bed. Haddon was standing at the
      foot, against the rail, with a small pair of scissors on his fingers; and
      the hands of my clock on the mantel over his shoulder were clasped
      together over the hour of twelve. Mowbray was washing something in a basin
      at the octagonal table, and at my side I felt a subdued feeling that could
      scarce be spoken of as pain.

The operation had not killed me. And I perceived, suddenly, that the dull
      melancholy of half a year was lifted from my mind.

I. — Until the extraordinary affair at Sidmouth, the peculiar
      species Haploteuthis ferox was known to science only generically,
      on the strength of a half-digested tentacle obtained near the Azores, and
      a decaying body pecked by birds and nibbled by fish, found early in 1896
      by Mr. Jennings, near Land''s End.

In no department of zoological science, indeed, are we quite so much in
      the dark as with regard to the deep-sea cephalopods. A mere accident, for
      instance, it was that led to the Prince of Monaco''s discovery of nearly a
      dozen new forms in the summer of 1895, a discovery in which the
      before-mentioned tentacle was included. It chanced that a cachalot was
      killed off Terceira by some sperm whalers, and in its last struggles
      charged almost to the Prince''s yacht, missed it, rolled under, and died
      within twenty yards of his rudder. And in its agony it threw up a number
      of large objects, which the Prince, dimly perceiving they were strange and
      important, was, by a happy expedient, able to secure before they sank. He
      set his screws in motion, and kept them circling in the vortices thus
      created until a boat could be lowered. And these specimens were whole
      cephalopods and fragments of cephalopods, some of gigantic proportions,
      and almost all of them unknown to science!

It would seem, indeed, that these large and agile creatures, living in the
      middle depths of the sea, must, to a large extent, for ever remain unknown
      to us, since under water they are too nimble for nets, and it is only by
      such rare, unlooked-for accidents that specimens can be obtained. In the
      case of Haploteuthis ferox, for instance, we are still altogether
      ignorant of its habitat, as ignorant as we are of the breeding-ground of
      the herring or the sea-ways of the salmon. And zoologists are altogether
      at a loss to account for its sudden appearance on our coast. Possibly it
      was the stress of a hunger migration that drove it hither out of the deep.
      But it will be, perhaps, better to avoid necessarily inconclusive
      discussion, and to proceed at once with our narrative.

The first human being to set eyes upon a living Haploteuthis—the
      first human being to survive, that is, for there can be little doubt now
      that the wave of bathing fatalities and boating accidents that travelled
      along the coast of Cornwall and Devon in early May was due to this cause—was
      a retired tea-dealer of the name of Fison, who was stopping at a Sidmouth
      boarding-house. It was in the afternoon, and he was walking along the
      cliff path between Sidmouth and Ladram Bay. The cliffs in this direction
      are very high, but down the red face of them in one place a kind of ladder
      staircase has been made. He was near this when his attention was attracted
      by what at first he thought to be a cluster of birds struggling over a
      fragment of food that caught the sunlight, and glistened pinkish-white.
      The tide was right out, and this object was not only far below him, but
      remote across a broad waste of rock reefs covered with dark seaweed and
      interspersed with silvery shining tidal pools. And he was, moreover,
      dazzled by the brightness of the further water.

In a minute, regarding this again, he perceived that his judgment was in
      fault, for over this struggle circled a number of birds, jackdaws and
      gulls for the most part, the latter gleaming blindingly when the sunlight
      smote their wings, and they seemed minute in comparison with it. And his
      curiosity was, perhaps, aroused all the more strongly because of his first
      insufficient explanations.

As he had nothing better to do than amuse himself, he decided to make this
      object, whatever it was, the goal of his afternoon walk, instead of Ladram
      Bay, conceiving it might perhaps be a great fish of some sort, stranded by
      some chance, and flapping about in its distress. And so he hurried down
      the long steep ladder, stopping at intervals of thirty feet or so to take
      breath and scan the mysterious movement.

At the foot of the cliff he was, of course, nearer his object than he had
      been; but, on the other hand, it now came up against the incandescent sky,
      beneath the sun, so as to seem dark and indistinct. Whatever was pinkish
      of it was now hidden by a skerry of weedy boulders. But he perceived that
      it was made up of seven rounded bodies distinct or connected, and that the
      birds kept up a constant croaking and screaming, but seemed afraid to
      approach it too closely.

Mr. Fison, torn by curiosity, began picking his way across the wave-worn
      rocks, and finding the wet seaweed that covered them thickly rendered them
      extremely slippery, he stopped, removed his shoes and socks, and rolled
      his trousers above his knees. His object was, of course, merely to avoid
      stumbling into the rocky pools about him, and perhaps he was rather glad,
      as all men are, of an excuse to resume, even for a moment, the sensations
      of his boyhood. At any rate, it is to this, no doubt, that he owes his
      life.

He approached his mark with all the assurance which the absolute security
      of this country against all forms of animal life gives its inhabitants.
      The round bodies moved to and fro, but it was only when he surmounted the
      skerry of boulders I have mentioned that he realised the horrible nature
      of the discovery. It came upon him with some suddenness.

The rounded bodies fell apart as he came into sight over the ridge, and
      displayed the pinkish object to be the partially devoured body of a human
      being, but whether of a man or woman he was unable to say. And the rounded
      bodies were new and ghastly-looking creatures, in shape somewhat
      resembling an octopus, with huge and very long and flexible tentacles,
      coiled copiously on the ground. The skin had a glistening texture,
      unpleasant to see, like shiny leather. The downward bend of the
      tentacle-surrounded mouth, the curious excrescence at the bend, the
      tentacles, and the large intelligent eyes, gave the creatures a grotesque
      suggestion of a face. They were the size of a fair-sized swine about the
      body, and the tentacles seemed to him to be many feet in length. There
      were, he thinks, seven or eight at least of the creatures. Twenty yards
      beyond them, amid the surf of the now returning tide, two others were
      emerging from the sea.

Their bodies lay flatly on the rocks, and their eyes regarded him with
      evil interest; but it does not appear that Mr. Fison was afraid, or that
      he realised that he was in any danger. Possibly his confidence is to be
      ascribed to the limpness of their attitudes. But he was horrified, of
      course, and intensely excited and indignant, at such revolting creatures
      preying upon human flesh. He thought they had chanced upon a drowned body.
      He shouted to them, with the idea of driving them off, and finding they
      did not budge, cast about him, picked up a big rounded lump of rock, and
      flung it at one.

And then, slowly uncoiling their tentacles, they all began moving towards
      him—creeping at first deliberately, and making a soft purring sound
      to each other.

In a moment Mr. Fison realised that he was in danger. He shouted again,
      threw both his boots, and started off, with a leap, forthwith. Twenty
      yards off he stopped and faced about, judging them slow, and behold! the
      tentacles of their leader were already pouring over the rocky ridge on
      which he had just been standing!

At that he shouted again, but this time not threatening, but a cry of
      dismay, and began jumping, striding, slipping, wading across the uneven
      expanse between him and the beach. The tall red cliffs seemed suddenly at
      a vast distance, and he saw, as though they were creatures in another
      world, two minute workmen engaged in the repair of the ladder-way, and
      little suspecting the race for life that was beginning below them. At one
      time he could hear the creatures splashing in the pools not a dozen feet
      behind him, and once he slipped and almost fell.

They chased him to the very foot of the cliffs, and desisted only when he
      had been joined by the workmen at the foot of the ladder-way up the cliff.
      All three of the men pelted them with stones for a time, and then hurried
      to the cliff top and along the path towards Sidmouth, to secure assistance
      and a boat, and to rescue the desecrated body from the clutches of these
      abominable creatures.

II. — And, as if he had not already been in sufficient peril that
      day, Mr. Fison went with the boat to point out the exact spot of his
      adventure.

As the tide was down, it required a considerable detour to reach the spot,
      and when at last they came off the ladder-way, the mangled body had
      disappeared. The water was now running in, submerging first one slab of
      slimy rock and then another, and the four men in the boat—the
      workmen, that is, the boatman, and Mr. Fison—now turned their
      attention from the bearings off shore to the water beneath the keel.

At first they could see little below them, save a dark jungle of
      laminaria, with an occasional darting fish. Their minds were set on
      adventure, and they expressed their disappointment freely. But presently
      they saw one of the monsters swimming through the water seaward, with a
      curious rolling motion that suggested to Mr. Fison the spinning roll of a
      captive balloon. Almost immediately after, the waving streamers of
      laminaria were extraordinarily perturbed, parted for a moment, and three
      of these beasts became darkly visible, struggling for what was probably
      some fragment of the drowned man. In a moment the copious olive-green
      ribbons had poured again over this writhing group.

At that all four men, greatly excited, began beating the water with oars
      and shouting, and immediately they saw a tumultuous movement among the
      weeds. They desisted to see more clearly, and as soon as the water was
      smooth, they saw, as it seemed to them, the whole sea bottom among the
      weeds set with eyes.

And forthwith the things began to rise through the water about them. Mr.
      Fison has since described to the writer this startling eruption out of the
      waving laminaria meadows. To him it seemed to occupy a considerable time,
      but it is probable that really it was an affair of a few seconds only. For
      a time nothing but eyes, and then he speaks of tentacles streaming out and
      parting the weed fronds this way and that. Then these things, growing
      larger, until at last the bottom was hidden by their intercoiling forms,
      and the tips of tentacles rose darkly here and there into the air above
      the swell of the waters.

One came up boldly to the side of the boat, and clinging to this with
      three of its sucker-set tentacles, threw four others over the gunwale, as
      if with an intention either of oversetting the boat or of clambering into
      it. Mr. Fison at once caught up the boat-hook, and, jabbing furiously at
      the soft tentacles, forced it to desist. He was struck in the back and
      almost pitched overboard by the boatman, who was using his oar to resist a
      similar attack on the other side of the boat. But the tentacles on either
      side at once relaxed their hold, slid out of sight, and splashed into the
      water.

"We''d better get out of this," said Mr. Fison, who was trembling
      violently. He went to the tiller, while the boatman and one of the workmen
      seated themselves and began rowing. The other workman stood up in the fore
      part of the boat, with the boat-hook, ready to strike any more tentacles
      that might appear. Nothing else seems to have been said. Mr. Fison had
      expressed the common feeling beyond amendment. In a hushed, scared mood,
      with faces white and drawn, they set about escaping from the position into
      which they had so recklessly blundered.

But the oars had scarcely dropped into the water before dark, tapering,
      serpentine ropes had bound them, and were about the rudder; and creeping
      up the sides of the boat with a looping motion came the suckers again. The
      men gripped their oars and pulled, but it was like trying to move a boat
      in a floating raft of weeds. "Help here!" cried the boatman, and Mr. Fison
      and the second workman rushed to help lug at the oar.

Then the man with the boat-hook—his name was Ewan, or Ewen—sprang
      up with a curse and began striking downward over the side, as far as he
      could reach, at the bank of tentacles that now clustered along the boat''s
      bottom. And, at the same time, the two rowers stood up to get a better
      purchase for the recovery of their oars. The boatman handed his to Mr.
      Fison, who lugged desperately, and, meanwhile, the boatman opened a big
      clasp-knife, and leaning over the side of the boat, began hacking at the
      spiring arms upon the oar shaft.

Mr. Fison, staggering with the quivering rocking of the boat, his teeth
      set, his breath coming short, and the veins starting on his hands as he
      pulled at his oar, suddenly cast his eyes seaward. And there, not fifty
      yards off, across the long rollers of the incoming tide, was a large boat
      standing in towards them, with three women and a little child in it. A
      boatman was rowing, and a little man in a pink-ribboned straw hat and
      whites stood in the stern hailing them. For a moment, of course, Mr. Fison
      thought of help, and then he thought of the child. He abandoned his oar
      forthwith, threw up his arms in a frantic gesture, and screamed to the
      party in the boat to keep away "for God''s sake!" It says much for the
      modesty and courage of Mr. Fison that he does not seem to be aware that
      there was any quality of heroism in his action at this juncture. The oar
      he had abandoned was at once drawn under, and presently reappeared
      floating about twenty yards away.

At the same moment Mr. Fison felt the boat under him lurch violently, and
      a hoarse scream, a prolonged cry of terror from Hill, the boatman, caused
      him to forget the party of excursionists altogether. He turned, and saw
      Hill crouching by the forward row-lock, his face convulsed with terror,
      and his right arm over the side and drawn tightly down. He gave now a
      succession of short, sharp cries, "Oh! oh! oh!—oh!" Mr. Fison
      believes that he must have been hacking at the tentacles below the
      water-line, and have been grasped by them, but, of course, it is quite
      impossible to say now certainly what had happened. The boat was heeling
      over, so that the gunwale was within ten inches of the water, and both
      Ewan and the other labourer were striking down into the water, with oar
      and boat-hook, on either side of Hill''s arm. Mr. Fison instinctively
      placed himself to counterpoise them.

Then Hill, who was a burly, powerful man, made a strenuous effort, and
      rose almost to a standing position. He lifted his arm, indeed, clean out
      of the water. Hanging to it was a complicated tangle of brown ropes, and
      the eyes of one of the brutes that had hold of him, glaring straight and
      resolute, showed momentarily above the surface. The boat heeled more and
      more, and the green-brown water came pouring in a cascade over the side.
      Then Hill slipped and fell with his ribs across the side, and his arm and
      the mass of tentacles about it splashed back into the water. He rolled
      over; his boot kicked Mr. Fison''s knee as that gentleman rushed forward to
      seize him, and in another moment fresh tentacles had whipped about his
      waist and neck, and after a brief, convulsive struggle, in which the boat
      was nearly capsized, Hill was lugged overboard. The boat righted with a
      violent jerk that all but sent Mr. Fison over the other side, and hid the
      struggle in the water from his eyes.

He stood staggering to recover his balance for a moment, and as he did so
      he became aware that the struggle and the inflowing tide had carried them
      close upon the weedy rocks again. Not four yards off a table of rock still
      rose in rhythmic movements above the in-wash of the tide. In a moment Mr.
      Fison seized the oar from Ewan, gave one vigorous stroke, then dropping
      it, ran to the bows and leapt. He felt his feet slide over the rock, and,
      by a frantic effort, leapt again towards a further mass. He stumbled over
      this, came to his knees, and rose again.

"Look out!" cried someone, and a large drab body struck him. He was
      knocked flat into a tidal pool by one of the workmen, and as he went down
      he heard smothered, choking cries, that he believed at the time came from
      Hill. Then he found himself marvelling at the shrillness and variety of
      Hill''s voice. Someone jumped over him, and a curving rush of foamy water
      poured over him, and passed. He scrambled to his feet dripping, and
      without looking seaward, ran as fast as his terror would let him
      shoreward. Before him, over the flat space of scattered rocks, stumbled
      the two work-men—one a dozen yards in front of the other.

He looked over his shoulder at last, and seeing that he was not pursued,
      faced about. He was astonished. From the moment of the rising of the
      cephalopods out of the water he had been acting too swiftly to fully
      comprehend his actions. Now it seemed to him as if he had suddenly jumped
      out of an evil dream.

For there were the sky, cloudless and blazing with the afternoon sun, the
      sea weltering under its pitiless brightness, the soft creamy foam of the
      breaking water, and the low, long, dark ridges of rock. The righted boat
      floated, rising and falling gently on the swell about a dozen yards from
      shore. Hill and the monsters, all the stress and tumult of that fierce
      fight for life, had vanished as though they had never been.

Mr. Fison''s heart was beating violently; he was throbbing to the
      finger-tips, and his breath came deep.

There was something missing. For some seconds he could not think clearly
      enough what this might be. Sun, sky, sea, rocks—what was it? Then he
      remembered the boat-load of excursionists. It had vanished. He wondered
      whether he had imagined it. He turned, and saw the two workmen standing
      side by side under the projecting masses of the tall pink cliffs. He
      hesitated whether he should make one last attempt to save the man Hill.
      His physical excitement seemed to desert him suddenly, and leave him
      aimless and helpless. He turned shoreward, stumbling and wading towards
      his two companions.

He looked back again, and there were now two boats floating, and the one
      farthest out at sea pitched clumsily, bottom upward.

III. — So it was Haploteuthis ferox made its appearance upon
      the Devonshire coast. So far, this has been its most serious aggression.
      Mr. Fison''s account, taken together with the wave of boating and bathing
      casualties to which I have already alluded, and the absence of fish from
      the Cornish coasts that year, points clearly to a shoal of these voracious
      deep-sea monsters prowling slowly along the sub-tidal coast-line. Hunger
      migration has, I know, been suggested as the force that drove them hither;
      but, for my own part, I prefer to believe the alternative theory of
      Hemsley. Hemsley holds that a pack or shoal of these creatures may have
      become enamoured of human flesh by the accident of a foundered ship
      sinking among them, and have wandered in search of it out of their
      accustomed zone; first waylaying and following ships, and so coming to our
      shores in the wake of the Atlantic traffic. But to discuss Hemsley''s
      cogent and admirably-stated arguments would be out of place here.

It would seem that the appetites of the shoal were satisfied by the catch
      of eleven people—for, so far as can be ascertained, there were ten
      people in the second boat, and certainly these creatures gave no further
      signs of their presence off Sidmouth that day. The coast between Seaton
      and Budleigh Salterton was patrolled all that evening and night by four
      Preventive Service boats, the men in which were armed with harpoons and
      cutlasses, and as the evening advanced, a number of more or less similarly
      equipped expeditions, organised by private individuals, joined them. Mr.
      Fison took no part in any of these expeditions.

About midnight excited hails were heard from a boat about a couple of
      miles out at sea to the south-east of Sidmouth, and a lantern was seen
      waving in a strange manner to and fro and up and down. The nearer boats at
      once hurried towards the alarm. The venturesome occupants of the boat—a
      seaman, a curate, and two schoolboys—had actually seen the monsters
      passing under their boat. The creatures, it seems, like most deep-sea
      organisms, were phosphorescent, and they had been floating, five fathoms
      deep or so, like creatures of moonshine through the blackness of the
      water, their tentacles retracted and as if asleep, rolling over and over,
      and moving slowly in a wedge-like formation towards the south-east.

These people told their story in gesticulated fragments, as first one boat
      drew alongside and then another. At last there was a little fleet of eight
      or nine boats collected together, and from them a tumult, like the chatter
      of a market-place, rose into the stillness of the night. There was little
      or no disposition to pursue the shoal, the people had neither weapons nor
      experience for such a dubious chase, and presently—even with a
      certain relief, it may be—the boats turned shoreward.

And now to tell what is perhaps the most astonishing fact in this whole
      astonishing raid. We have not the slightest knowledge of the subsequent
      movements of the shoal, although the whole south-west coast was now alert
      for it. But it may, perhaps, be significant that a cachalot was stranded
      off Sark on June 3. Two weeks and three days after this Sidmouth affair, a
      living Haploteuthis came ashore on Calais sands. It was alive,
      because several witnesses saw its tentacles moving in a convulsive way.
      But it is probable that it was dying. A gentleman named Pouchet obtained a
      rifle and shot it.

That was the last appearance of a living Haploteuthis. No others
      were seen on the French coast. On the 15th of June a dead carcass, almost
      complete, was washed ashore near Torquay, and a few days later a boat from
      the Marine Biological station, engaged in dredging off Plymouth, picked up
      a rotting specimen, slashed deeply with a cutlass wound. How the former
      had come by its death it is impossible to say. And on the last day of
      June, Mr. Egbert Caine, an artist, bathing near Newlyn, threw up his arms,
      shrieked, and was drawn under. A friend bathing with him made no attempt
      to save him, but swam at once for the shore. This is the last fact to tell
      of this extraordinary raid from the deeper sea. Whether it is really the
      last of these horrible creatures it is, as yet, premature to say. But it
      is believed, and certainly it is to be hoped, that they have returned now,
      and returned for good, to the sunless depths of the middle seas, out of
      which they have so strangely and so mysteriously arisen.

I was—you shall hear immediately why I am not now—Egbert
      Craddock Cummins. The name remains. I am still (Heaven help me!) Dramatic
      Critic to the Fiery Cross. What I shall be in a little while I do
      not know. I write in great trouble and confusion of mind. I will do what I
      can to make myself clear in the face of terrible difficulties. You must
      bear with me a little. When a man is rapidly losing his own identity, he
      naturally finds a difficulty in expressing himself. I will make it
      perfectly plain in a minute, when once I get my grip upon the story. Let
      me see—where am I? I wish I knew. Ah, I have it! Dead self!
      Egbert Craddock Cummins!

In the past I should have disliked writing anything quite so full of "I"
      as this story must be. It is full of "I''s" before and behind, like the
      beast in Revelation—the one with a head like a calf, I am afraid.
      But my tastes have changed since I became a Dramatic Critic and studied
      the masters—G.A.S., G.B.S., G.R.S., and the others. Everything has
      changed since then. At least the story is about myself—so that there
      is some excuse for me. And it is really not egotism, because, as I say,
      since those days my identity has undergone an entire alteration.

That past!... I was—in those days—rather a nice fellow, rather
      shy— taste for grey in my clothes, weedy little moustache, face
      "interesting," slight stutter which I had caught in my early life from a
      schoolfellow. Engaged to a very nice girl, named Delia. Fairly new, she
      was— cigarettes—liked me because I was human and original.
      Considered I was like Lamb—on the strength of the stutter, I
      believe. Father, an eminent authority on postage stamps. She read a great
      deal in the British Museum. (A perfect pairing ground for literary people,
      that British Museum—you should read George Egerton and Justin Huntly
      M''Carthy and Gissing and the rest of them.) We loved in our intellectual
      way, and shared the brightest hopes. (All gone now.) And her father liked
      me because I seemed honestly eager to hear about stamps. She had no
      mother. Indeed, I had the happiest prospects a young man could have. I
      never went to theatres in those days. My Aunt Charlotte before she died
      had told me not to.

Then Barnaby, the editor of the Fiery Cross, made me—in spite
      of my spasmodic efforts to escape—Dramatic Critic. He is a fine,
      healthy man, Barnaby, with an enormous head of frizzy black hair and a
      convincing manner, and he caught me on the staircase going to see Wembly.
      He had been dining, and was more than usually buoyant. "Hullo, Cummins!"
      he said. "The very man I want!" He caught me by the shoulder or the collar
      or something, ran me up the little passage, and flung me over the
      waste-paper basket into the arm-chair in his office. "Pray be seated," he
      said, as he did so. Then he ran across the room and came back with some
      pink and yellow tickets and pushed them into my hand. "Opera Comique," he
      said, "Thursday; Friday, the Surrey; Saturday, the Frivolity. That''s all,
      I think."

"Eigh?" he said, at the top of his voice, as though he thought I
      had gone and was startled at my remark.

"That''s just it. New view. No habits. No clichis in stock. Ours is
      a live paper, not a bag of tricks. None of your clockwork professional
      journalism in this office. And I can rely on your integrity——"

He caught me up suddenly and put me outside his door. "Go and talk to
      Wembly about that," he said. "He''ll explain."

As I stood perplexed, he opened the door again, said, "I forgot this,"
      thrust a fourth ticket into my hand (it was for that night—in twenty
      minutes'' time) and slammed the door upon me. His expression was quite
      calm, but I caught his eye.

I hate arguments. I decided that I would take his hint and become (to my
      own destruction) a Dramatic Critic. I walked slowly down the passage to
      Wembly. That Barnaby has a remarkable persuasive way. He has made few
      suggestions during our very pleasant intercourse of four years that he has
      not ultimately won me round to adopting. It may be, of course, that I am
      of a yielding disposition; certainly I am too apt to take my colour from
      my circumstances. It is, indeed, to my unfortunate susceptibility to vivid
      impressions that all my misfortunes are due. I have already alluded to the
      slight stammer I had acquired from a schoolfellow in my youth. However,
      this is a digression... I went home in a cab to dress.

I will not trouble the reader with my thoughts about the first-night
      audience, strange assembly as it is,—those I reserve for my Memoirs,—nor
      the humiliating story of how I got lost during the entr''acte in a
      lot of red plush passages, and saw the third act from the gallery. The
      only point upon which I wish to lay stress was the remarkable effect of
      the acting upon me. You must remember I had lived a quiet and retired
      life, and had never been to the theatre before, and that I am extremely
      sensitive to vivid impressions. At the risk of repetition I must insist
      upon these points.

The first effect was a profound amazement, not untinctured by alarm. The
      phenomenal unnaturalness of acting is a thing discounted in the minds of
      most people by early visits to the theatre. They get used to the fantastic
      gestures, the flamboyant emotions, the weird mouthings, melodious
      snortings, agonising yelps, lip-gnawings, glaring horrors, and other
      emotional symbolism of the stage. It becomes at last a mere deaf-and-dumb
      language to them, which they read intelligently pari passu with the
      hearing of the dialogue. But all this was new to me. The thing was called
      a modern comedy, the people were supposed to be English and were dressed
      like fashionable Americans of the current epoch, and I fell into the
      natural error of supposing that the actors were trying to represent human
      beings. I looked round on my first-night audience with a kind of wonder,
      discovered—as all new Dramatic Critics do—that it rested with
      me to reform the Drama, and, after a supper choked with emotion, went off
      to the office to write a column, piebald with "new paragraphs" (as all my
      stuff is—it fills out so) and purple with indignation. Barnaby was
      delighted.

But I could not sleep that night. I dreamt of actors—actors glaring,
      actors smiting their chests, actors flinging out a handful of extended
      fingers, actors smiling bitterly, laughing despairingly, falling
      hopelessly, dying idiotically. I got up at eleven with a slight headache,
      read my notice in the Fiery Cross, breakfasted, and went back to my
      room to shave, (It''s my habit to do so.) Then an odd thing happened. I
      could not find my razor. Suddenly it occurred to me that I had not
      unpacked it the day before.

Quite involuntarily, when I had thought of my portmanteau, I had flung up
      the left arm (fingers fully extended) and clutched at my diaphragm with my
      right hand. I am an acutely self-conscious man at all times. The gesture
      struck me as absolutely novel for me. I repeated it, for my own
      satisfaction. "Odd!" Then (rather puzzled) I turned to my portmanteau.

After shaving, my mind reverted to the acting I had seen, and I
      entertained myself before the cheval glass with some imitations of
      Jafferay''s more exaggerated gestures. "Really, one might think it a
      disease," I said—"Stage-Walkitis!" (There''s many a truth spoken in
      jest.) Then, if I remember rightly, I went off to see Wembly, and
      afterwards lunched at the British Museum with Delia. We actually spoke
      about our prospects, in the light of my new appointment.

But that appointment was the beginning of my downfall. From that day I
      necessarily became a persistent theatre-goer, and almost insensibly I
      began to change. The next thing I noticed after the gesture about the
      razor was to catch myself bowing ineffably when I met Delia, and stooping
      in an old-fashioned, courtly way over her hand. Directly I caught myself,
      I straightened myself up and became very uncomfortable. I remember she
      looked at me curiously. Then, in the office, I found myself doing "nervous
      business," fingers on teeth, when Barnaby asked me a question I could not
      very well answer. Then, in some trifling difference with Delia, I clasped
      my hand to my brow. And I pranced through my social transactions at times
      singularly like an actor! I tried not to—no one could be more keenly
      alive to the arrant absurdity of the histrionic bearing. And I did!

It began to dawn on me what it all meant. The acting, I saw, was too much
      for my delicately-strung nervous system. I have always, I know, been too
      amenable to the suggestions of my circumstances. Night after night of
      concentrated attention to the conventional attitudes and intonation of the
      English stage was gradually affecting my speech and carriage. I was giving
      way to the infection of sympathetic imitation. Night after night my
      plastic nervous system took the print of some new amazing gesture, some
      new emotional exaggeration—and retained it. A kind of theatrical
      veneer threatened to plate over and obliterate my private individuality
      altogether. I saw myself in a kind of vision. Sitting by myself one night,
      my new self seemed to me to glide, posing and gesticulating, across the
      room. He clutched his throat, he opened his fingers, he opened his legs in
      walking like a high-class marionette. He went from attitude to attitude.
      He might have been clockwork. Directly after this I made an ineffectual
      attempt to resign my theatrical work. But Barnaby persisted in talking
      about the Polywhiddle Divorce all the time I was with him, and I could get
      no opportunity of saying what I wished.

And then Delia''s manner began to change towards me. The ease of our
      intercourse vanished. I felt she was learning to dislike me. I grinned,
      and capered, and scowled, and posed at her in a thousand ways, and knew—with
      what a voiceless agony!—that I did it all the time. I tried to
      resign again, and Barnaby talked about "X" and "Z" and "Y" in the New
      Review, and gave me a strong cigar to smoke, and so routed me. And
      then I walked up the Assyrian Gallery in the manner of Irving to meet
      Delia, and so precipitated the crisis.

"Ah!—Dear!" I said, with more sprightliness and emotion in my
      voice than had ever been in all my life before I became (to my own
      undoing) a Dramatic Critic.

She held out her hand rather coldly, scrutinising my face as she did so. I
      prepared, with a new-won grace, to walk by her side. "Egbert," she said,
      standing still, and thought. Then she looked at me.

I said nothing. I felt what was coming. I tried to be the old Egbert
      Craddock Cummins of shambling gait and stammering sincerity, whom she
      loved, but I felt even as I did so that I was a new thing, a thing of
      surging emotions and mysterious fixity—like no human being that ever
      lived, except upon the stage. "Egbert," she said, "you are not yourself."

"What do you mean?" I said, whispering in vocal italics—you
      know how they do it—turning on her, perplexity on face, right hand
      down, left on brow. I knew quite well what she meant. I knew quite well
      the dramatic unreality of my behaviour. But I struggled against it in
      vain. "What do you mean?" I said, and, in a kind of hoarse whisper, "I
      don''t understand!"

She really looked as though she disliked me. "What do you keep on posing
      for?" she said. "I don''t like it. You didn''t use to."

"Didn''t use to!" I said slowly, repeating this twice. I glared up and down
      the gallery with short, sharp glances. "We are alone," I said swiftly. "Listen!"
      I poked my forefinger towards her, and glared at her. "I am under a
      curse."

I saw her hand tighten upon her sunshade. "You are under some bad
      influence or other," said Delia. "You should give it up. I never knew
      anyone change as you have done."

She eyed me critically. "Why you keep playing the fool like this I
      don''t know," she said. "Anyhow, I really cannot go about with a man who
      behaves as you do. You made us both ridiculous on Wednesday. Frankly, I
      dislike you, as you are now. I met you here to tell you so—as it''s
      about the only place where we can be sure of being alone together——"

By a violent effort I controlled myself and touched her hand. I tried to
      say some word of explanation to her. She looked into my working face and
      winced. "I must do it," she said hopelessly. Then she turned from
      me and began walking rapidly down the gallery.

Heavens! How the human agony cried within me! I loved Delia. But nothing
      found expression—I was already too deeply crusted with my acquired
      self.

"Good-baye!" I said at last, watching her retreating figure. How I hated
      myself for doing it! After she had vanished, I repeated in a dreamy way,
      "Good-baye!" looking hopelessly round me. Then, with a kind of
      heart-broken cry, I shook my clenched fists in the air, staggered to the
      pedestal of a winged figure, buried my face in my arms, and made my
      shoulders heave. Something within me said "Ass!" as I did so. (I had the
      greatest difficulty in persuading the Museum policeman, who was attracted
      by my cry of agony, that I was not intoxicated, but merely suffering from
      a transient indisposition.)

But even this great sorrow has not availed to save me from my fate. I see
      it; everyone sees it: I grow more "theatrical" every day. And no one could
      be more painfully aware of the pungent silliness of theatrical ways. The
      quiet, nervous, but pleasing E.C. Cummins vanishes. I cannot save him. I
      am driven like a dead leaf before the winds of March. My tailor even
      enters into the spirit of my disorder. He has a peculiar sense of what is
      fitting. I tried to get a dull grey suit from him this spring, and he
      foisted a brilliant blue upon me, and I see he has put braid down the
      sides of my new dress trousers. My hairdresser insists upon giving me a
      "wave."

I am beginning to associate with actors. I detest them, but it is only in
      their company that I can feel I am not glaringly conspicuous. Their talk
      infects me. I notice a growing tendency to dramatic brevity, to dashes and
      pauses in my style, to a punctuation of bows and attitudes. Barnaby has
      remarked it too. I offended Wembly by calling him "Dear Boy" yesterday. I
      dread the end, but I cannot escape from it.

The fact is, I am being obliterated. Living a grey, retired life all my
      youth, I came to the theatre a delicate sketch of a man, a thing of tints
      and faint lines. Their gorgeous colouring has effaced me altogether.
      People forget how much mode of expression, method of movement, are a
      matter of contagion. I have heard of stage-struck people before, and
      thought it a figure of speech. I spoke of it jestingly, as a disease. It
      is no jest. It is a disease. And I have got it badly! Deep down within me
      I protest against the wrong done to my personality—unavailingly. For
      three hours or more a week I have to go and concentrate my attention on
      some fresh play, and the suggestions of the drama strengthen their awful
      hold upon me. My manners grow so flamboyant, my passions so professional,
      that I doubt, as I said at the outset, whether it is really myself that
      behaves in such a manner. I feel merely the core to this dramatic casing,
      that grows thicker and presses upon me—me and mine. I feel like King
      John''s abbot in his cope of lead.

I doubt, indeed, whether I should not abandon the struggle altogether—
      leave this sad world of ordinary life for which I am so ill fitted,
      abandon the name of Cummins for some professional pseudonym, complete my
      self-effacement, and—a thing of tricks and tatters, of posing and
      pretence—go upon the stage. It seems my only resort—"to hold
      the mirror up to Nature." For in the ordinary life, I will confess, no one
      now seems to regard me as both sane and sober. Only upon the stage, I feel
      convinced, will people take me seriously. That will be the end of it. I know
      that will be the end of it. And yet ... I will frankly confess ... all
      that marks off your actor from your common man ... I detest. I am
      still largely of my Aunt Charlotte''s opinion, that play-acting is unworthy
      of a pure-minded man''s attention, much more participation. Even now I
      would resign my dramatic criticism and try a rest. Only I can''t get hold
      of Barnaby. Letters of resignation he never notices. He says it is against
      the etiquette of journalism to write to your Editor. And when I go to see
      him, he gives me another big cigar and some strong whisky and soda, and
      then something always turns up to prevent my explanation.

Whether the story of Gottfried Plattner is to be credited or not is a
      pretty question in the value of evidence. On the one hand, we have seven
      witnesses—to be perfectly exact, we have six and a half pairs of
      eyes, and one undeniable fact; and on the other we have—what is it?—prejudice,
      common-sense, the inertia of opinion. Never were there seven more
      honest-seeming witnesses; never was there a more undeniable fact than the
      inversion of Gottfried Plattner''s anatomical structure, and—never
      was there a more preposterous story than the one they have to tell! The
      most preposterous part of the story is the worthy Gottfried''s contribution
      (for I count him as one of the seven). Heaven forbid that I should be led
      into giving countenance to superstition by a passion for impartiality, and
      so come to share the fate of Eusapia''s patrons! Frankly, I believe there
      is something crooked about this business of Gottfried Plattner; but what
      that crooked factor is, I will admit as frankly, I do not know. I have
      been surprised at the credit accorded to the story in the most unexpected
      and authoritative quarters. The fairest way to the reader, however, will
      be for me to tell it without further comment.

Gottfried Plattner is, in spite of his name, a freeborn Englishman. His
      father was an Alsatian who came to England in the ''sixties, married a
      respectable English girl of unexceptionable antecedents, and died, after a
      wholesome and uneventful life (devoted, I understand, chiefly to the
      laying of parquet flooring), in 1887. Gottfried''s age is seven-and-twenty.
      He is, by virtue of his heritage of three languages, Modern Languages
      Master in a small private school in the south of England. To the casual
      observer he is singularly like any other Modern Languages Master in any
      other small private school. His costume is neither very costly nor very
      fashionable, but, on the other hand, it is not markedly cheap or shabby;
      his complexion, like his height and his bearing, is inconspicuous. You
      would notice, perhaps, that, like the majority of people, his face was not
      absolutely symmetrical, his right eye a little larger than the left, and
      his jaw a trifle heavier on the right side. If you, as an ordinary
      careless person, were to bare his chest and feel his heart beating, you
      would probably find it quite like the heart of anyone else. But here you
      and the trained observer would part company. If you found his heart quite
      ordinary, the trained observer would find it quite otherwise. And once the
      thing was pointed out to you, you too would perceive the peculiarity
      easily enough. It is that Gottfried''s heart beats on the right side of his
      body.

Now, that is not the only singularity of Gottfried''s structure, although
      it is the only one that would appeal to the untrained mind. Careful
      sounding of Gottfried''s internal arrangements by a well-known surgeon
      seems to point to the fact that all the other unsymmetrical parts of his
      body are similarly misplaced. The right lobe of his liver is on the left
      side, the left on his right; while his lungs, too, are similarly
      contraposed. What is still more singular, unless Gottfried is a consummate
      actor, we must believe that his right hand has recently become his left.
      Since the occurrences we are about to consider (as impartially as
      possible), he has found the utmost difficulty in writing, except from
      right to left across the paper with his left hand. He cannot throw with
      his right hand, he is perplexed at meal-times between knife and fork, and
      his ideas of the rule of the road—he is a cyclist—are still a
      dangerous confusion. And there is not a scrap of evidence to show that
      before these occurrences Gottfried was at all left-handed.

There is yet another wonderful fact in this preposterous business.
      Gottfried produces three photographs of himself. You have him at the age
      of five or six, thrusting fat legs at you from under a plaid frock, and
      scowling. In that photograph his left eye is a little larger than his
      right, and his jaw is a trifle heavier on the left side. This is the
      reverse of his present living condition. The photograph of Gottfried at
      fourteen seems to contradict these facts, but that is because it is one of
      those cheap "Gem" photographs that were then in vogue, taken direct upon
      metal, and therefore reversing things just as a looking-glass would. The
      third photograph represents him at one-and-twenty, and confirms the record
      of the others. There seems here evidence of the strongest confirmatory
      character that Gottfried has exchanged his left side for his right. Yet
      how a human being can be so changed, short of a fantastic and pointless
      miracle, it is exceedingly hard to suggest.

In one way, of course, these facts might be explicable on the supposition
      that Plattner has undertaken an elaborate mystification, on the strength
      of his heart''s displacement. Photographs may be faked, and left-handedness
      imitated. But the character of the man does not lend itself to any such
      theory. He is quiet, practical, unobtrusive, and thoroughly sane, from the
      Nordau standpoint. He likes beer, and smokes moderately, takes walking
      exercise daily, and has a healthily high estimate of the value of his
      teaching. He has a good but untrained tenor voice, and takes a pleasure in
      singing airs of a popular and cheerful character. He is fond, but not
      morbidly fond, of reading,—chiefly fiction pervaded with a vaguely
      pious optimism,—sleeps well, and rarely dreams. He is, in fact, the
      very last person to evolve a fantastic fable. Indeed, so far from forcing
      this story upon the world, he has been singularly reticent on the matter.
      He meets enquirers with a certain engaging—bashfulness is almost the
      word, that disarms the most suspicious. He seems genuinely ashamed that
      anything so unusual has occurred to him.

It is to be regretted that Plattner''s aversion to the idea of post-mortem
      dissection may postpone, perhaps for ever, the positive proof that his
      entire body has had its left and right sides transposed. Upon that fact
      mainly the credibility of his story hangs. There is no way of taking a man
      and moving him about in space as ordinary people understand space, that
      will result in our changing his sides. Whatever you do, his right is still
      his right, his left his left. You can do that with a perfectly thin and
      flat thing, of course. If you were to cut a figure out of paper, any
      figure with a right and left side, you could change its sides simply by
      lifting it up and turning it over. But with a solid it is different.
      Mathematical theorists tell us that the only way in which the right and
      left sides of a solid body can be changed is by taking that body clean out
      of space as we know it,—taking it out of ordinary existence, that
      is, and turning it somewhere outside space. This is a little abstruse, no
      doubt, but anyone with any knowledge of mathematical theory will assure
      the reader of its truth. To put the thing in technical language, the
      curious inversion of Plattner''s right and left sides is proof that he has
      moved out of our space into what is called the Fourth Dimension, and that
      he has returned again to our world. Unless we choose to consider ourselves
      the victims of an elaborate and motiveless fabrication, we are almost
      bound to believe that this has occurred.

So much for the tangible facts. We come now to the account of the
      phenomena that attended his temporary disappearance from the world. It
      appears that in the Sussexville Proprietary School, Plattner not only
      discharged the duties of Modern Languages Master, but also taught
      chemistry, commercial geography, bookkeeping, shorthand, drawing, and any
      other additional subject to which the changing fancies of the boys''
      parents might direct attention. He knew little or nothing of these various
      subjects, but in secondary as distinguished from Board or elementary
      schools, knowledge in the teacher is, very properly, by no means so
      necessary as high moral character and gentlemanly tone. In chemistry he
      was particularly deficient, knowing, he says, nothing beyond the Three
      Gases (whatever the three gases may be). As, however, his pupils began by
      knowing nothing, and derived all their information from him, this caused
      him (or anyone) but little inconvenience for several terms. Then a little
      boy named Whibble joined the school, who had been educated (it seems) by
      some mischievous relative into an inquiring habit of mind. This little boy
      followed Plattner''s lessons with marked and sustained interest, and in
      order to exhibit his zeal on the subject, brought, at various times,
      substances for Plattner to analyse. Plattner, flattered by this evidence
      of his power of awakening interest, and trusting to the boy''s ignorance,
      analysed these, and even, made general statements as to their composition.
      Indeed, he was so far stimulated by his pupil as to obtain a work upon
      analytical chemistry, and study it during his supervision of the evening''s
      preparation. He was surprised to find chemistry quite an interesting
      subject.

So far the story is absolutely commonplace. But now the greenish powder
      comes upon the scene. The source of that greenish powder seems,
      unfortunately, lost. Master Whibble tells a tortuous story of finding it
      done up in a packet in a disused limekiln near the Downs. It would have
      been an excellent thing for Plattner, and possibly for Master Whibble''s
      family, if a match could have been applied to that powder there and then.
      The young gentleman certainly did not bring it to school in a packet, but
      in a common eight-ounce graduated medicine bottle, plugged with masticated
      newspaper. He gave it to Plattner at the end of the afternoon school. Four
      boys had been detained after school prayers in order to complete some
      neglected tasks, and Plattner was supervising these in the small
      class-room in which the chemical teaching was conducted. The appliances
      for the practical teaching of chemistry in the Sussexville Proprietary
      School, as in most small schools in this country, are characterised by a
      severe simplicity. They are kept in a small cupboard standing in a recess,
      and having about the same capacity as a common travelling trunk. Plattner,
      being bored with his passive superintendence, seems to have welcomed the
      intervention of Whibble with his green powder as an agreeable diversion,
      and, unlocking this cupboard, proceeded at once with his analytical
      experiments. Whibble sat, luckily for himself, at a safe distance,
      regarding him. The four malefactors, feigning a profound absorption in
      their work, watched him furtively with the keenest interest. For even
      within the limits of the Three Gases, Plattner''s practical chemistry was,
      I understand, temerarious.

They are practically unanimous in their account of Plattner''s proceedings.
      He poured a little of the green powder into a test-tube, and tried the
      substance with water, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and sulphuric acid
      in succession. Getting no result, he emptied out a little heap—nearly
      half the bottleful, in fact—upon a slate and tried a match. He held
      the medicine bottle in his left hand. The stuff began to smoke and melt,
      and then exploded with deafening violence and a blinding flash.

The five boys, seeing the flash and being prepared for catastrophes,
      ducked below their desks, and were none of them seriously hurt. The window
      was blown out into the playground, and the blackboard on its easel was
      upset. The slate was smashed to atoms. Some plaster fell from the ceiling.
      No other damage was done to the school edifice or appliances, and the boys
      at first, seeing nothing of Plattner, fancied he was knocked down and
      lying out of their sight below the desks. They jumped out of their places
      to go to his assistance, and were amazed to find the space empty. Being
      still confused by the sudden violence of the report, they hurried to the
      open door, under the impression that he must have been hurt, and have
      rushed out of the room. But Carson, the foremost, nearly collided in the
      doorway with the principal, Mr. Lidgett.

Mr. Lidgett is a corpulent, excitable man with one eye. The boys describe
      him as stumbling into the room mouthing some of those tempered expletives
      irritable schoolmasters accustom themselves to use—lest worse
      befall. "Wretched mumchancer!" he said. "Where''s Mr. Plattner?" The boys
      are agreed on the very words. ("Wobbler," "snivelling puppy," and
      "mumchancer" are, it seems, among the ordinary small change of Mr.
      Lidgett''s scholastic commerce.)

Where''s Mr. Plattner? That was a question that was to be repeated many
      times in the next few days. It really seemed as though that frantic
      hyperbole, "blown to atoms," had for once realised itself. There was not a
      visible particle of Plattner to be seen; not a drop of blood nor a stitch
      of clothing to be found. Apparently he had been blown clean out of
      existence and left not a wrack behind. Not so much as would cover a
      sixpenny piece, to quote a proverbial expression! The evidence of his
      absolute disappearance as a consequence of that explosion is indubitable.

It is not necessary to enlarge here upon the commotion excited in the
      Sussexville Proprietary School, and in Sussexville and elsewhere, by this
      event. It is quite possible, indeed, that some of the readers of these
      pages may recall the hearing of some remote and dying version of that
      excitement during the last summer holidays. Lidgett, it would seem, did
      everything in his power to suppress and minimise the story. He instituted
      a penalty of twenty-five lines for any mention of Plattner''s name among
      the boys, and stated in the schoolroom that he was clearly aware of his
      assistant''s whereabouts. He was afraid, he explains, that the possibility
      of an explosion happening, in spite of the elaborate precautions taken to
      minimise the practical teaching of chemistry, might injure the reputation
      of the school; and so might any mysterious quality in Plattner''s
      departure. Indeed, he did everything in his power to make the occurrence
      seem as ordinary as possible. In particular, he cross-examined the five
      eye-witnesses of the occurrence so searchingly that they began to doubt
      the plain evidence of their senses. But, in spite of these efforts, the
      tale, in a magnified and distorted state, made a nine days'' wonder in the
      district, and several parents withdrew their sons on colourable pretexts.
      Not the least remarkable point in the matter is the fact that a large
      number of people in the neighbourhood dreamed singularly vivid dreams of
      Plattner during the period of excitement before his return, and that these
      dreams had a curious uniformity. In almost all of them Plattner was seen,
      sometimes singly, sometimes in company, wandering about through a
      coruscating iridescence. In all cases his face was pale and distressed,
      and in some he gesticulated towards the dreamer. One or two of the boys,
      evidently under the influence of nightmare, fancied that Plattner
      approached them with remarkable swiftness, and seemed to look closely into
      their very eyes. Others fled with Plattner from the pursuit of vague and
      extraordinary creatures of a globular shape. But all these fancies were
      forgotten in inquiries and speculations when on the Wednesday next but one
      after the Monday of the explosion, Plattner returned.

The circumstances of his return were as singular as those of his
      departure. So far as Mr. Lidgett''s somewhat choleric outline can be filled
      in from Plattner''s hesitating statements, it would appear that on
      Wednesday evening, towards the hour of sunset, the former gentleman,
      having dismissed evening preparation, was engaged in his garden, picking
      and eating strawberries, a fruit of which he is inordinately fond. It is a
      large old-fashioned garden, secured from observation, fortunately, by a
      high and ivy-covered red-brick wall. Just as he was stooping over a
      particularly prolific plant, there was a flash in the air and a heavy
      thud, and before he could look round, some heavy body struck him violently
      from behind. He was pitched forward, crushing the strawberries he held in
      his hand, and that so roughly, that his silk hat—Mr. Lidgett adheres
      to the older ideas of scholastic costume—was driven violently down
      upon his forehead, and almost over one eye. This heavy missile, which slid
      over him sideways and collapsed into a sitting posture among the
      strawberry plants, proved to be our long-lost Mr. Gottfried Plattner, in
      an extremely dishevelled condition. He was collarless and hatless, his
      linen was dirty, and there was blood upon his hands. Mr. Lidgett was so
      indignant and surprised that he remained on all-fours, and with his hat
      jammed down on his eye, while he expostulated vehemently with Plattner for
      his disrespectful and unaccountable conduct.

This scarcely idyllic scene completes what I may call the exterior version
      of the Plattner story—its exoteric aspect. It is quite unnecessary
      to enter here into all the details of his dismissal by Mr. Lidgett. Such
      details, with the full names and dates and references, will be found in
      the larger report of these occurrences that was laid before the Society
      for the Investigation of Abnormal Phenomena. The singular transposition of
      Plattner''s right and left sides was scarcely observed for the first day or
      so, and then first in connection with his disposition to write from right
      to left across the blackboard. He concealed rather than ostended this
      curious confirmatory circumstance, as he considered it would unfavourably
      affect his prospects in a new situation. The displacement of his heart was
      discovered some months after, when he was having a tooth extracted under
      anaesthetics. He then, very unwillingly, allowed a cursory surgical
      examination to be made of himself, with a view to a brief account in the
      Journal of Anatomy. That exhausts the statement of the material
      facts; and we may now go on to consider Plattner''s account of the matter.

But first let us clearly differentiate between the preceding portion of
      this story and what is to follow. All I have told thus far is established
      by such evidence as even a criminal lawyer would approve. Every one of the
      witnesses is still alive; the reader, if he have the leisure, may hunt the
      lads out to-morrow, or even brave the terrors of the redoubtable Lidgett,
      and cross-examine and trap and test to his heart''s content; Gottfried
      Plattner himself, and his twisted heart and his three photographs, are
      producible. It may be taken as proved that he did disappear for nine days
      as the consequence of an explosion; that he returned almost as violently,
      under circumstances in their nature annoying to Mr. Lidgett, whatever the
      details of those circumstances may be; and that he returned inverted, just
      as a reflection returns from a mirror. From the last fact, as I have
      already stated, it follows almost inevitably that Plattner, during those
      nine days, must have been in some state of existence altogether out of
      space. The evidence to these statements is, indeed, far stronger than that
      upon which most murderers are hanged. But for his own particular account
      of where he had been, with its confused explanations and wellnigh
      self-contradictory details, we have only Mr. Gottfried Plattner''s word. I
      do not wish to discredit that, but I must point out—what so many
      writers upon obscure psychic phenomena fail to do—that we are
      passing here from the practically undeniable to that kind of matter which
      any reasonable man is entitled to believe or reject as he thinks proper.
      The previous statements render it plausible; its discordance with common
      experience tilts it towards the incredible. I would prefer not to sway the
      beam of the reader''s judgment either way, but simply to tell the story as
      Plattner told it me.

He gave me his narrative, I may state, at my house at Chislehurst, and so
      soon as he had left me that evening, I went into my study and wrote down
      everything as I remembered it. Subsequently he was good enough to read
      over a type-written copy, so that its substantial correctness is
      undeniable.

He states that at the moment of the explosion he distinctly thought he was
      killed. He felt lifted off his feet and driven forcibly backward. It is a
      curious fact for psychologists that he thought clearly during his backward
      flight, and wondered whether he should hit the chemistry cupboard or the
      blackboard easel. His heels struck ground, and he staggered and fell
      heavily into a sitting position on something soft and firm. For a moment
      the concussion stunned him. He became aware at once of a vivid scent of
      singed hair, and he seemed to hear the voice of Lidgett asking for him.
      You will understand that for a time his mind was greatly confused.

At first he was under the impression that he was still standing in the
      class-room. He perceived quite distinctly the surprise of the boys and the
      entry of Mr. Lidgett. He is quite positive upon that score. He did not
      hear their remarks; but that he ascribed to the deafening effect of the
      experiment. Things about him seemed curiously dark and faint, but his mind
      explained that on the obvious but mistaken idea that the explosion had
      engendered a huge volume of dark smoke. Through the dimness the figures of
      Lidgett and the boys moved, as faint and silent as ghosts. Plattner''s face
      still tingled with the stinging heat of the flash. He, was, he says, "all
      muddled." His first definite thoughts seem to have been of his personal
      safety. He thought he was perhaps blinded and deafened. He felt his limbs
      and face in a gingerly manner. Then his perceptions grew clearer, and he
      was astonished to miss the old familiar desks and other schoolroom
      furniture about him. Only dim, uncertain, grey shapes stood in the place
      of these. Then came a thing that made him shout aloud, and awoke his
      stunned faculties to instant activity. Two of the boys, gesticulating,
      walked one after the other clean through him! Neither manifested the
      slightest consciousness of his presence. It is difficult to imagine the
      sensation he felt. They came against him, he says, with no more force than
      a wisp of mist.

Plattner''s first thought after that was that he was dead. Having been
      brought up with thoroughly sound views in these matters, however, he was a
      little surprised to find his body still about him. His second conclusion
      was that he was not dead, but that the others were: that the explosion had
      destroyed the Sussexville Proprietary School and every soul in it except
      himself. But that, too, was scarcely satisfactory. He was thrown back upon
      astonished observation.

Everything about him was profoundly dark: at first it seemed to have an
      altogether ebony blackness. Overhead was a black firmament. The only touch
      of light in the scene was a faint greenish glow at the edge of the sky in
      one direction, which threw into prominence a horizon of undulating black
      hills. This, I say, was his impression at first. As his eye grew
      accustomed to the darkness, he began to distinguish a faint quality of
      differentiating greenish colour in the circumambient night. Against this
      background the furniture and occupants of the class-room, it seems, stood
      out like phosphorescent spectres, faint and impalpable. He extended his
      hand, and thrust it without an effort through the wall of the room by the
      fireplace.

He describes himself as making a strenuous effort to attract attention. He
      shouted to Lidgett, and tried to seize the boys as they went to and fro.
      He only desisted from these attempts when Mrs. Lidgett, whom he (as an
      Assistant Master) naturally disliked, entered the room. He says the
      sensation of being in the world, and yet not a part of it, was an
      extraordinarily disagreeable one. He compared his feelings, not inaptly,
      to those of a cat watching a mouse through a window. Whenever he made a
      motion to communicate with the dim, familiar world about him, he found an
      invisible, incomprehensible barrier preventing intercourse.

He then turned his attention to his solid environment. He found the
      medicine bottle still unbroken in his hand, with the remainder of the
      green powder therein. He put this in his pocket, and began to feel about
      him. Apparently he was sitting on a boulder of rock covered with a velvety
      moss. The dark country about him he was unable to see, the faint, misty
      picture of the schoolroom blotting it out, but he had a feeling (due
      perhaps to a cold wind) that he was near the crest of a hill, and that a
      steep valley fell away beneath his feet. The green glow along the edge of
      the sky seemed to be growing in extent and intensity. He stood up, rubbing
      his eyes.

It would seem that he made a few steps, going steeply downhill, and then
      stumbled, nearly fell, and sat down again upon a jagged mass of rock to
      watch the dawn. He became aware that the world about him was absolutely
      silent. It was as still as it was dark, and though there was a cold wind
      blowing up the hill-face, the rustle of grass, the soughing of the boughs
      that should have accompanied it, were absent. He could hear, therefore, if
      he could not see, that the hillside upon which he stood was rocky and
      desolate. The green grew brighter every moment, and as it did so a faint,
      transparent blood-red mingled with, but did not mitigate, the blackness of
      the sky overhead and the rocky desolations about him. Having regard to
      what follows, I am inclined to think that that redness may have been an
      optical effect due to contrast. Something black fluttered momentarily
      against the livid yellow-green of the lower sky, and then the thin and
      penetrating voice of a bell rose out of the black gulf below him. An
      oppressive expectation grew with the growing light.

It is probable that an hour or more elapsed while he sat there, the
      strange green light growing brighter every moment, and spreading slowly,
      in flamboyant fingers, upward towards the zenith. As it grew, the spectral
      vision of our world became relatively or absolutely fainter.
      Probably both, for the time must have been about that of our earthly
      sunset. So far as his vision of our world went, Plattner, by his few steps
      downhill, had passed through the floor of the class-room, and was now, it
      seemed, sitting in mid-air in the larger schoolroom downstairs. He saw the
      boarders distinctly, but much more faintly than he had seen Lidgett. They
      were preparing their evening tasks, and he noticed with interest that
      several were cheating with their Euclid riders by means of a crib, a
      compilation whose existence he had hitherto never suspected. As the time
      passed, they faded steadily, as steadily as the light of the green dawn
      increased.

Looking down into the valley, he saw that the light had crept far down its
      rocky sides, and that the profound blackness of the abyss was now broken
      by a minute green glow, like the light of a glow-worm. And almost
      immediately the limb of a huge heavenly body of blazing green rose over
      the basaltic undulations of the distant hills, and the monstrous
      hill-masses about him came out gaunt and desolate, in green light and
      deep, ruddy black shadows. He became aware of a vast number of ball-shaped
      objects drifting as thistledown drifts over the high ground. There were
      none of these nearer to him than the opposite side of the gorge. The bell
      below twanged quicker and quicker, with something like impatient
      insistence, and several lights moved hither and thither. The boys at work
      at their desks were now almost imperceptibly faint.

This extinction of our world, when the green sun of this other universe
      rose, is a curious point upon which Plattner insists. During the
      Other-World night it is difficult to move about, on account of the
      vividness with which the things of this world are visible. It becomes a
      riddle to explain why, if this is the case, we in this world catch no
      glimpse of the Other-World. It is due, perhaps, to the comparatively vivid
      illumination of this world of ours. Plattner describes the midday of the
      Other-World, at its brightest, as not being nearly so bright as this world
      at full moon, while its night is profoundly black. Consequently, the
      amount of light, even in an ordinary dark room, is sufficient to render
      the things of the Other-World invisible, on the same principle that faint
      phosphorescence is only visible in the profoundest darkness. I have tried,
      since he told me his story, to see something of the Other-World by sitting
      for a long space in a photographer''s dark room at night. I have certainly
      seen indistinctly the form of greenish slopes and rocks, but only, I must
      admit, very indistinctly indeed. The reader may possibly be more
      successful. Plattner tells me that since his return he has dreamt and seen
      and recognised places in the Other-World, but this is probably due to his
      memory of these scenes. It seems quite possible that people with unusually
      keen eyesight may occasionally catch a glimpse of this strange Other-World
      about us.

However, this is a digression. As the green sun rose, a long street of
      black buildings became perceptible, though only darkly and indistinctly,
      in the gorge, and after some hesitation, Plattner began to clamber down
      the precipitous descent towards them. The descent was long and exceedingly
      tedious, being so not only by the extraordinary steepness, but also by
      reason of the looseness of the boulders with which the whole face of the
      hill was strewn. The noise of his descent—now and then his heels
      struck fire from the rocks—seemed now the only sound in the
      universe, for the beating of the bell had ceased. As he drew nearer, he
      perceived that the various edifices had a singular resemblance to tombs
      and mausoleums and monuments, saving only that they were all uniformly
      black instead of being white, as most sepulchres are. And then he saw,
      crowding out of the largest building, very much as people disperse from
      church, a number of pallid, rounded, pale-green figures. These dispersed
      in several directions about the broad street of the place, some going
      through side alleys and reappearing upon the steepness of the hill, others
      entering some of the small black buildings which lined the way.

At the sight of these things drifting up towards him, Plattner stopped,
      staring. They were not walking, they were indeed limbless, and they had
      the appearance of human heads, beneath which a tadpole-like body swung. He
      was too astonished at their strangeness, too full, indeed, of strangeness,
      to be seriously alarmed by them. They drove towards him, in front of the
      chill wind that was blowing uphill, much as soap-bubbles drive before a
      draught. And as he looked at the nearest of those approaching, he saw it
      was indeed a human head, albeit with singularly large eyes, and wearing
      such an expression of distress and anguish as he had never seen before
      upon mortal countenance. He was surprised to find that it did not turn to
      regard him, but seemed to be watching and following some unseen moving
      thing. For a moment he was puzzled, and then it occurred to him that this
      creature was watching with its enormous eyes something that was happening
      in the world he had just left. Nearer it came, and nearer, and he was too
      astonished to cry out. It made a very faint fretting sound as it came
      close to him. Then it struck his face with a gentle pat—its touch
      was very cold—and drove past him, and upward towards the crest of
      the hill.

An extraordinary conviction flashed across Plattner''s mind that this head
      had a strong likeness to Lidgett. Then he turned his attention to the
      other heads that were now swarming thickly up the hill-side. None made the
      slightest sign of recognition. One or two, indeed, came close to his head
      and almost followed the example of the first, but he dodged convulsively
      out of the way. Upon most of them he saw the same expression of unavailing
      regret he had seen upon the first, and heard the same faint sounds of
      wretchedness from them. One or two wept, and one rolling swiftly uphill
      wore an expression of diabolical rage. But others were cold, and several
      had a look of gratified interest in their eyes. One, at least, was almost
      in an ecstasy of happiness. Plattner does not remember that he recognised
      any more likenesses in those he saw at this time.

For several hours, perhaps, Plattner watched these strange things
      dispersing themselves over the hills, and not till long after they had
      ceased to issue from the clustering black buildings in the gorge, did he
      resume his downward climb. The darkness about him increased so much that
      he had a difficulty in stepping true. Overhead the sky was now a bright,
      pale green. He felt neither hunger nor thirst. Later, when he did, he
      found a chilly stream running down the centre of the gorge, and the rare
      moss upon the boulders, when he tried it at last in desperation, was good
      to eat.

He groped about among the tombs that ran down the gorge, seeking vaguely
      for some clue to these inexplicable things. After a long time he came to
      the entrance of the big mausoleum-like building from which the heads had
      issued. In this he found a group of green lights burning upon a kind of
      basaltic altar, and a bell-rope from a belfry overhead hanging down into
      the centre of the place. Round the wall ran a lettering of fire in a
      character unknown to him. While he was still wondering at the purport of
      these things, he heard the receding tramp of heavy feet echoing far down
      the street. He ran out into the darkness again, but he could see nothing.
      He had a mind to pull the bell-rope, and finally decided to follow the
      footsteps. But, although he ran far, he never overtook them; and his
      shouting was of no avail. The gorge seemed to extend an interminable
      distance. It was as dark as earthly starlight throughout its length, while
      the ghastly green day lay along the upper edge of its precipices. There
      were none of the heads, now, below. They were all, it seemed, busily
      occupied along the upper slopes. Looking up, he saw them drifting hither
      and thither, some hovering stationary, some flying swiftly through the
      air. It reminded him, he said, of "big snowflakes"; only these were black
      and pale green.

In pursuing the firm, undeviating footsteps that he never overtook, in
      groping into new regions of this endless devil''s dyke, in clambering up
      and down the pitiless heights, in wandering about the summits, and in
      watching the drifting faces, Plattner states that he spent the better part
      of seven or eight days. He did not keep count, he says. Though once or
      twice he found eyes watching him, he had word with no living soul. He
      slept among the rocks on the hillside. In the gorge things earthly were
      invisible, because, from the earthly standpoint, it was far underground.
      On the altitudes, so soon as the earthly day began, the world became
      visible to him. He found himself sometimes stumbling over the dark green
      rocks, or arresting himself on a precipitous brink, while all about him
      the green branches of the Sussexville lanes were swaying; or, again, he
      seemed to be walking through the Sussexville streets, or watching unseen
      the private business of some household. And then it was he discovered,
      that to almost every human being in our world there pertained some of
      these drifting heads; that everyone in the world is watched intermittently
      by these helpless disembodiments.

What are they—these Watchers of the Living? Plattner never learned.
      But two, that presently found and followed him, were like his childhood''s
      memory of his father and mother. Now and then other faces turned their
      eyes upon him: eyes like those of dead people who had swayed him, or
      injured him, or helped him in his youth and manhood. Whenever they looked
      at him, Plattner was overcome with a strange sense of responsibility. To
      his mother he ventured to speak; but she made no answer. She looked sadly,
      steadfastly, and tenderly—a little reproachfully, too, it seemed—into
      his eyes.

He simply tells this story: he does not endeavour to explain. We are left
      to surmise who these Watchers of the Living may be, or, if they are indeed
      the Dead, why they should so closely and passionately watch a world they
      have left for ever. It may be—indeed to my mind it seems just—that,
      when our life has closed, when evil or good is no longer a choice for us,
      we may still have to witness the working out of the train of consequences
      we have laid. If human souls continue after death, then surely human
      interests continue after death. But that is merely my own guess at the
      meaning of the things seen. Plattner offers no interpretation, for none
      was given him. It is well the reader should understand this clearly. Day
      after day, with his head reeling, he wandered about this strange lit world
      outside the world, weary and, towards the end, weak and hungry. By day—by
      our earthly day, that is—the ghostly vision of the old familiar
      scenery of Sussexville, all about him, irked and worried him. He could not
      see where to put his feet, and ever and again with a chilly touch one of
      these Watching Souls would come against his face. And after dark the
      multitude of these Watchers about him, and their intent distress, confused
      his mind beyond describing. A great longing to return to the earthly life
      that was so near and yet so remote consumed him. The unearthliness of
      things about him produced a positively painful mental distress. He was
      worried beyond describing by his own particular followers. He would shout
      at them to desist from staring at him, scold at them, hurry away from
      them. They were always mute and intent. Run as he might over the uneven
      ground, they followed his destinies.

On the ninth day, towards evening, Plattner heard the invisible footsteps
      approaching, far away down the gorge. He was then wandering over the broad
      crest of the same hill upon which he had fallen in his entry into this
      strange Other-World of his. He turned to hurry down into the gorge,
      feeling his way hastily, and was arrested by the sight of the thing that
      was happening in a room in a back street near the school. Both of the
      people in the room he knew by sight. The windows were open, the blinds up,
      and the setting sun shone clearly into it, so that it came out quite
      brightly at first, a vivid oblong of room, lying like a magic-lantern
      picture upon the black landscape and the livid green dawn. In addition to
      the sunlight, a candle had just been lit in the room.

On the bed lay a lank man, his ghastly white face terrible upon the
      tumbled pillow. His clenched hands were raised above his head. A little
      table beside the bed carried a few medicine bottles, some toast and water,
      and an empty glass. Every now and then the lank man''s lips fell apart, to
      indicate a word he could not articulate. But the woman did not notice that
      he wanted anything, because she was busy turning out papers from an
      old-fashioned bureau in the opposite corner of the room. At first the
      picture was very vivid indeed, but as the green dawn behind it grew
      brighter and brighter, so it became fainter and more and more transparent.

As the echoing footsteps paced nearer and nearer, those footsteps that
      sound so loud in that Other-World and come so silently in this, Plattner
      perceived about him a great multitude of dim faces gathering together out
      of the darkness and watching the two people in the room. Never before had
      he seen so many of the Watchers of the Living. A multitude had eyes only
      for the sufferer in the room, another multitude, in infinite anguish,
      watched the woman as she hunted with greedy eyes for something she could
      not find. They crowded about Plattner, they came across his sight and
      buffeted his face, the noise of their unavailing regrets was all about
      him. He saw clearly only now and then. At other times the picture quivered
      dimly, through the veil of green reflections upon their movements. In the
      room it must have been very still, and Plattner says the candle flame
      streamed up into a perfectly vertical line of smoke, but in his ears each
      footfall and its echoes beat like a clap of thunder. And the faces! Two,
      more particularly near the woman''s: one a woman''s also, white and
      clear-featured, a face which might have once been cold and hard, but which
      was now softened by the touch of a wisdom strange to earth. The other
      might have been the woman''s father. Both were evidently absorbed in the
      contemplation of some act of hateful meanness, so it seemed, which they
      could no longer guard against and prevent. Behind were others, teachers,
      it may be, who had taught ill, friends whose influence had failed. And
      over the man, too—a multitude, but none that seemed to be parents or
      teachers! Faces that might once have been coarse, now purged to strength
      by sorrow! And in the forefront one face, a girlish one, neither angry nor
      remorseful, but merely patient and weary, and, as it seemed to Plattner,
      waiting for relief. His powers of description fail him at the memory of
      this multitude of ghastly countenances. They gathered on the stroke of the
      bell. He saw them all in the space of a second. It would seem that he was
      so worked on by his excitement that, quite involuntarily, his restless
      fingers took the bottle of green powder out of his pocket and held it
      before him. But he does not remember that.

Abruptly the footsteps ceased. He waited for the next, and there was
      silence, and then suddenly, cutting through the unexpected stillness like
      a keen, thin blade, came the first stroke of the bell. At that the
      multitudinous faces swayed to and fro, and a louder crying began all about
      him. The woman did not hear; she was burning something now in the candle
      flame. At the second stroke everything grew dim, and a breath of wind, icy
      cold, blew through the host of watchers. They swirled about him like an
      eddy of dead leaves in the spring, and at the third stroke something was
      extended through them to the bed. You have heard of a beam of light. This
      was like a beam of darkness, and looking again at it, Plattner saw that it
      was a shadowy arm and hand.

The green sun was now topping the black desolations of the horizon, and
      the vision of the room was very faint. Plattner could see that the white
      of the bed struggled, and was convulsed; and that the woman looked round
      over her shoulder at it, startled.

The cloud of watchers lifted high like a puff of green dust before the
      wind, and swept swiftly downward towards the temple in the gorge. Then
      suddenly Plattner understood the meaning of the shadowy black arm that
      stretched across his shoulder and clutched its prey. He did not dare turn
      his head to see the Shadow behind the arm. With a violent effort, and
      covering his eyes, he set himself to run, made, perhaps, twenty strides,
      then slipped on a boulder, and fell. He fell forward on his hands; and the
      bottle smashed and exploded as he touched the ground.

In another moment he found himself, stunned and bleeding, sitting face to
      face with Lidgett in the old walled garden behind the school.

There the story of Plattner''s experiences ends. I have resisted, I believe
      successfully, the natural disposition of a writer of fiction to dress up
      incidents of this sort. I have told the thing as far as possible in the
      order in which Plattner told it to me. I have carefully avoided any
      attempt at style, effect, or construction. It would have been easy, for
      instance, to have worked the scene of the death-bed into a kind of plot in
      which Plattner might have been involved. But, quite apart from the
      objectionableness of falsifying a most extraordinary true story, any such
      trite devices would spoil, to my mind, the peculiar effect of this dark
      world, with its livid green illumination and its drifting Watchers of the
      Living, which, unseen and unapproachable to us, is yet lying all about us.

It remains to add that a death did actually occur in Vincent Terrace, just
      beyond the school garden, and, so far as can be proved, at the moment of
      Plattner''s return. Deceased was a rate-collector and insurance agent. His
      widow, who was much younger than himself, married last month a Mr.
      Whymper, a veterinary surgeon of Allbeeding. As the portion of this story
      given here has in various forms circulated orally in Sussexville, she has
      consented to my use of her name, on condition that I make it distinctly
      known that she emphatically contradicts every detail of Plattner''s account
      of her husband''s last moments. She burnt no will, she says, although
      Plattner never accused her of doing so; her husband made but one will, and
      that just after their marriage. Certainly, from a man who had never seen
      it, Plattner''s account of the furniture of the room was curiously
      accurate.

One other thing, even at the risk of an irksome repetition, I must insist
      upon, lest I seem to favour the credulous, superstitious view. Plattner''s
      absence from the world for nine days is, I think, proved. But that does
      not prove his story. It is quite conceivable that even outside space
      hallucinations may be possible. That, at least, the reader must bear
      distinctly in mind.

"I can assure you," said I, "that it will take a very tangible ghost to
      frighten me." And I stood up before the fire with my glass in my hand.

The old woman sat staring hard into the fire, her pale eyes wide open.
      "Ay," she broke in; "and eight-and-twenty years you have lived and never
      seen the likes of this house, I reckon. There''s a many things to see, when
      one''s still but eight-and-twenty." She swayed her head slowly from side to
      side. "A many things to see and sorrow for."

I half suspected the old people were trying to enhance the spiritual
      terrors of their house by their droning insistence. I put down my empty
      glass on the table and looked about the room, and caught a glimpse of
      myself, abbreviated and broadened to an impossible sturdiness, in the
      queer old mirror at the end of the room. "Well," I said, "if I see
      anything to-night, I shall be so much the wiser. For I come to the
      business with an open mind."

I heard the sound of a stick and a shambling step on the flags in the
      passage outside, and the door creaked on its hinges as a second old man
      entered, more bent, more wrinkled, more aged even than the first. He
      supported himself by a single crutch, his eyes were covered by a shade,
      and his lower lip, half averted, hung pale and pink from his decaying
      yellow teeth. He made straight for an arm-chair on the opposite side of
      the table, sat down clumsily, and began to cough. The man with the
      withered arm gave this new-comer a short glance of positive dislike; the
      old woman took no notice of his arrival, but remained with her eyes fixed
      steadily on the fire.

"I said—it''s your own choosing," said the man with the withered arm,
      when the coughing had ceased for a while.

The man with the shade became aware of my presence for the first time, and
      threw his head back for a moment and sideways, to see me. I caught a
      momentary glimpse of his eyes, small and bright and inflamed. Then he
      began to cough and splutter again.

"Why don''t you drink?" said the man with the withered arm, pushing the
      beer towards him. The man with the shade poured out a glassful with a
      shaky hand that splashed half as much again on the deal table. A monstrous
      shadow of him crouched upon the wall and mocked his action as he poured
      and drank. I must confess I had scarce expected these grotesque
      custodians. There is to my mind something inhuman in senility, something
      crouching and atavistic; the human qualities seem to drop from old people
      insensibly day by day. The three of them made me feel uncomfortable, with
      their gaunt silences, their bent carriage, their evident unfriendliness to
      me and to one another.

"If," said I, "you will show me to this haunted room of yours, I will make
      myself comfortable there."

The old man with the cough jerked his head back so suddenly that it
      startled me, and shot another glance of his red eyes at me from under the
      shade; but no one answered me. I waited a minute, glancing from one to the
      other.

"If," I said a little louder, "if you will show me to this haunted room of
      yours, I will relieve you from the task of entertaining me."

"There''s a candle on the slab outside the door," said the man with the
      withered arm, looking at my feet as he addressed me. "But if you go to the
      red room to-night——"

"You go along the passage for a bit," said he, "until you come to a door,
      and through that is a spiral staircase, and half-way up that is a landing
      and another door covered with baize. Go through that and down the long
      corridor to the end, and the red room is on your left up the steps."

"Have I got that right?" I said, and repeated his directions. He corrected
      me in one particular.

"And are you really going?" said the man with the shade, looking at me
      again for the third time, with that queer, unnatural tilting of the face.

"It is what I came for," I said, and moved towards the door. As I did so,
      the old man with the shade rose and staggered round the table, so as to be
      closer to the others and to the fire. At the door I turned and looked at
      them, and saw they were all close together, dark against the firelight,
      staring at me over their shoulders, with an intent expression on their
      ancient faces.

I left the door wide open until the candle was well alight, and then I
      shut them in and walked down the chilly, echoing passage.

I must confess that the oddness of these three old pensioners in whose
      charge her ladyship had left the castle, and the deep-toned, old-fashioned
      furniture of the housekeeper''s room in which they foregathered, affected
      me in spite of my efforts to keep myself at a matter-of-fact phase. They
      seemed to belong to another age, an older age, an age when things
      spiritual were different from this of ours, less certain; an age when
      omens and witches were credible, and ghosts beyond denying. Their very
      existence was spectral; the cut of their clothing, fashions born in dead
      brains. The ornaments and conveniences of the room about them were ghostly—the
      thoughts of vanished men, which still haunted rather than participated in
      the world of to-day. But with an effort I sent such thoughts to the
      right-about. The long, draughty subterranean passage was chilly and dusty,
      and my candle flared and made the shadows cower and quiver. The echoes
      rang up and down the spiral staircase, and a shadow came sweeping up after
      me, and one fled before me into the darkness overhead. I came to the
      landing and stopped there for a moment, listening to a rustling that I
      fancied I heard; then, satisfied of the absolute silence, I pushed open
      the baize-covered door and stood in the corridor.

The effect was scarcely what I expected, for the moonlight, coming in by
      the great window on the grand staircase, picked out everything in vivid
      black shadow or silvery illumination. Everything was in its place: the
      house might have been deserted on the yesterday instead of eighteen months
      ago. There were candles in the sockets of the sconces, and whatever dust
      had gathered on the carpets or upon the polished flooring was distributed
      so evenly as to be invisible in the moonlight. I was about to advance, and
      stopped abruptly. A bronze group stood upon the landing, hidden from me by
      the corner of the wall, but its shadow fell with marvellous distinctness
      upon the white panelling, and gave me the impression of someone crouching
      to waylay me. I stood rigid for half a minute perhaps. Then, with my hand
      in the pocket that held my revolver, I advanced, only to discover a
      Ganymede and Eagle glistening in the moonlight. That incident for a time
      restored my nerve, and a porcelain Chinaman on a buhl table, whose head
      rocked silently as I passed him, scarcely startled me.

The door to the red room and the steps up to it were in a shadowy corner.
      I moved my candle from side to side, in order to see clearly the nature of
      the recess in which I stood before opening the door. Here it was, thought
      I, that my predecessor was found, and the memory of that story gave me a
      sudden twinge of apprehension. I glanced over my shoulder at the Ganymede
      in the moonlight, and opened the door of the red room rather hastily, with
      my face half turned to the pallid silence of the landing.

I entered, closed the door behind me at once, turned the key I found in
      the lock within, and stood with the candle held aloft, surveying the scene
      of my vigil, the great red room of Lorraine Castle, in which the young
      duke had died. Or, rather, in which he had begun his dying, for he had
      opened the door and fallen headlong down the steps I had just ascended.
      That had been the end of his vigil, of his gallant attempt to conquer the
      ghostly tradition of the place, and never, I thought, had apoplexy better
      served the ends of superstition. And there were other and older stories
      that clung to the room, back to the half-credible beginning of it all, the
      tale of a timid wife and the tragic end that came to her husband''s jest of
      frightening her. And looking around that large sombre room, with its
      shadowy window bays, its recesses and alcoves, one could well understand
      the legends that had sprouted in its black corners, its germinating
      darkness. My candle was a little tongue of light in its vastness, that
      failed to pierce the opposite end of the room, and left an ocean of
      mystery and suggestion beyond its island of light.

I resolved to make a systematic examination of the place at once, and
      dispel the fanciful suggestions of its obscurity before they obtained a
      hold upon me. After satisfying myself of the fastening of the door, I
      began to walk about the room, peering round each article of furniture,
      tucking up the valances of the bed, and opening its curtains wide. I
      pulled up the blinds and examined the fastenings of the several windows
      before closing the shutters, leant forward and looked up the blackness of
      the wide chimney, and tapped the dark oak panelling for any secret
      opening. There were two big mirrors in the room, each with a pair of
      sconces bearing candles, and on the mantelshelf, too, were more candles in
      china candlesticks. All these I lit one after the other. The fire was
      laid, an unexpected consideration from the old housekeeper,—and I
      lit it, to keep down any disposition to shiver, and when it was burning
      well, I stood round with my back to it and regarded the room again. I had
      pulled up a chintz-covered arm-chair and a table, to form a kind of
      barricade before me, and on this lay my revolver ready to hand. My precise
      examination had done me good, but I still found the remoter darkness of
      the place, and its perfect stillness, too stimulating for the imagination.
      The echoing of the stir and crackling of the fire was no sort of comfort
      to me. The shadow in the alcove at the end in particular, had that
      undefinable quality of a presence, that odd suggestion of a lurking,
      living thing, that comes so easily in silence and solitude. At last, to
      reassure myself, I walked with a candle into it, and satisfied myself that
      there was nothing tangible there. I stood that candle upon the floor of
      the alcove, and left it in that position.

By this time I was in a state of considerable nervous tension, although to
      my reason there was no adequate cause for the condition. My mind, however,
      was perfectly clear. I postulated quite unreservedly that nothing
      supernatural could happen, and to pass the time I began to string some
      rhymes together, Ingoldsby fashion, of the original legend of the place. A
      few I spoke aloud, but the echoes were not pleasant. For the same reason I
      also abandoned, after a time, a conversation with myself upon the
      impossibility of ghosts and haunting. My mind reverted to the three old
      and distorted people downstairs, and I tried to keep it upon that topic.
      The sombre reds and blacks of the room troubled, me; even with seven
      candles the place was merely dim. The one in the alcove flared in a
      draught, and the fire-flickering kept the shadows and penumbra perpetually
      shifting and stirring. Casting about for a remedy, I recalled the candles
      I had seen in the passage, and, with a slight effort, walked out into the
      moonlight, carrying a candle and leaving the door open, and presently
      returned with as many as ten. These I put in various knick-knacks of china
      with which the room was sparsely adorned, lit and placed where the shadows
      had lain deepest, some on the floor, some in the window recesses, until at
      last my seventeen candles were so arranged that not an inch of the room
      but had the direct light of at least one of them. It occurred to me that
      when the ghost came, I could warn him not to trip over them. The room was
      now quite brightly illuminated. There was something very cheery and
      reassuring in these little streaming flames, and snuffing them gave me an
      occupation, and afforded a helpful sense of the passage of time. Even with
      that, however, the brooding expectation of the vigil weighed heavily upon
      me. It was after midnight that the candle in the alcove suddenly went out,
      and the black shadow sprang back to its place there. I did not see the
      candle go out; I simply turned and saw that the darkness was there, as one
      might start and see the unexpected presence of a stranger. "By Jove!" said
      I aloud; "that draught''s a strong one!" and, taking the matches from the
      table, I walked across the room in a leisurely manner, to relight the
      corner again. My first match would not strike, and as I succeeded with the
      second, something seemed to blink on the wall before me. I turned my head
      involuntarily, and saw that the two candles on the little table by the
      fireplace were extinguished. I rose at once to my feet.

I walked back, relit one, and as I did so, I saw the candle in the right
      sconce of one of the mirrors wink and go right out, and almost immediately
      its companion followed it. There was no mistake about it. The flame
      vanished, as if the wicks had been suddenly nipped between a finger and a
      thumb, leaving the wick neither glowing nor smoking, but black. While I
      stood gaping, the candle at the foot of the bed went out, and the shadows
      seemed to take another step towards me.

"What''s up?" I cried, with a queer high note getting into my voice
      somehow. At that the candle on the wardrobe went out, and the one I had
      relit in the alcove followed.

"Steady on!" I said. "These candles are wanted," speaking with a
      half-hysterical facetiousness, and scratching away at a match the while
      for the mantel candlesticks. My hands trembled so much that twice I missed
      the rough paper of the matchbox. As the mantel emerged from darkness
      again, two candles in the remoter end of the window were eclipsed. But
      with the same match I also relit the larger mirror candles, and those on
      the floor near the doorway, so that for the moment I seemed to gain on the
      extinctions. But then in a volley there vanished four lights at once in
      different corners of the room, and I struck another match in quivering
      haste, and stood hesitating whither to take it.

As I stood undecided, an invisible hand seemed to sweep out the two
      candles on the table. With a cry of terror, I dashed at the alcove, then
      into the corner, and then into the window, relighting three, as two more
      vanished by the fireplace; then, perceiving a better way, I dropped the
      matches on the iron-bound deed-box in the corner, and caught up the
      bedroom candlestick. With this I avoided the delay of striking matches;
      but for all that the steady process of extinction went on, and the shadows
      I feared and fought against returned, and crept in upon me, first a step
      gained on this side of me and then on that. It was like a ragged
      storm-cloud sweeping out the stars. Now and then one returned for a
      minute, and was lost again. I was now almost frantic with the horror of
      the coming darkness, and my self-possession deserted me. I leaped panting
      and dishevelled from candle to candle, in a vain struggle against that
      remorseless advance.

I bruised myself on the thigh against the table, I sent a chair headlong,
      I stumbled and fell and whisked the cloth from the table in my fall. My
      candle rolled away from me, and I snatched another as I rose. Abruptly
      this was blown out, as I swung it off the table by the wind of my sudden
      movement, and immediately the two remaining candles followed. But there
      was light still in the room, a red light that staved off the shadows from
      me. The fire! Of course I could still thrust my candle between the bars
      and relight it!

I turned to where the flames were still dancing between the glowing coals,
      and splashing red reflections upon the furniture, made two steps towards
      the grate, and incontinently the flames dwindled and vanished, the glow
      vanished, the reflections rushed together and vanished, and as I thrust
      the candle between the bars darkness closed upon me like the shutting of
      an eye, wrapped about me in a stifling embrace, sealed my vision, and
      crushed the last vestiges of reason from my brain. The candle fell from my
      hand. I flung out my arms in a vain effort to thrust that ponderous
      blackness away from me, and, lifting up my voice, screamed with all my
      might—once, twice, thrice. Then I think I must have staggered to my
      feet. I know I thought suddenly of the moonlit corridor, and, with my head
      bowed and my arms over my face, made a run for the door.

But I had forgotten the exact position of the door, and struck myself
      heavily against the corner of the bed. I staggered back, turned, and was
      either struck or struck myself against some other bulky furniture. I have
      a vague memory of battering myself thus, to and fro in the darkness, of a
      cramped struggle, and of my own wild crying as I darted to and fro, of a
      heavy blow at last upon my forehead, a horrible sensation of falling that
      lasted an age, of my last frantic effort to keep my footing, and then I
      remember no more.

I opened my eyes in daylight. My head was roughly bandaged, and the man
      with the withered arm was watching my face. I looked about me, trying to
      remember what had happened, and for a space I could not recollect. I
      rolled my eyes into the corner, and saw the old woman, no longer
      abstracted, pouring out some drops of medicine from a little blue phial
      into a glass. "Where am I?" I asked; "I seem to remember you, and yet I
      cannot remember who you are."

They told me then, and I heard of the haunted Red Room as one who hears a
      tale. "We found you at dawn," said he, "and there was blood on your
      forehead and lips."

It was very slowly I recovered my memory of my experience. "You believe
      now," said the old man, "that the room is haunted?" He spoke no longer as
      one who greets an intruder, but as one who grieves for a broken friend.

"And you have seen it. And we, who have lived here all our lives, have
      never set eyes upon it. Because we have never dared... Tell us, is it
      truly the old earl who——"

"I told you so," said the old lady, with the glass in her hand. "It is his
      poor young countess who was frightened——"

"It is not," I said. "There is neither ghost of earl nor ghost of countess
      in that room, there is no ghost there at all; but worse, far worse——"

"The worst of all the things that haunt poor mortal man," said I; "and
      that is, in all its nakedness—Fear that will not have light nor
      sound, that will not bear with reason, that deafens and darkens and
      overwhelms. It followed me through the corridor, it fought against me in
      the room——"

Then the man with the shade sighed and spoke. "That is it," said he. "I
      knew that was it. A power of darkness. To put such a curse upon a woman!
      It lurks there always. You can feel it even in the daytime, even of a
      bright summer''s day, in the hangings, in the curtains, keeping behind you
      however you face about. In the dusk it creeps along the corridor and
      follows you, so that you dare not turn. There is Fear in that room of hers—black
      Fear, and there will be—so long as this house of sin endures."

Mr. Coombes was sick of life. He walked away from his unhappy home, and,
      sick not only of his own existence but of everybody else''s, turned aside
      down Gaswork Lane to avoid the town, and, crossing the wooden bridge that
      goes over the canal to Starling''s Cottages, was presently alone in the
      damp pine woods and out of sight and sound of human habitation. He would
      stand it no longer. He repeated aloud with blasphemies unusual to him that
      he would stand it no longer.

He was a pale-faced little man, with dark eyes and a fine and very black
      moustache. He had a very stiff, upright collar slightly frayed, that gave
      him an illusory double chin, and his overcoat (albeit shabby) was trimmed
      with astrachan. His gloves were a bright brown with black stripes over the
      knuckles, and split at the finger ends. His appearance, his wife had said
      once in the dear, dead days beyond recall—before he married her,
      that is—was military. But now she called him—it seems a
      dreadful thing to tell of between husband and wife, but she called him "a
      little grub." It wasn''t the only thing she had called him, either.

The row had arisen about that beastly Jennie again. Jennie was his wife''s
      friend, and, by no invitation of Mr. Coombes, she came in every blessed
      Sunday to dinner, and made a shindy all the afternoon. She was a big,
      noisy girl, with a taste for loud colours and a strident laugh; and this
      Sunday she had outdone all her previous intrusions by bringing in a fellow
      with her, a chap as showy as herself. And Mr. Coombes, in a starchy, clean
      collar and his Sunday frock-coat, had sat dumb and wrathful at his own
      table, while his wife and her guests talked foolishly and undesirably, and
      laughed aloud. Well, he stood that, and after dinner (which, "as usual,"
      was late), what must Miss Jennie do but go to the piano and play banjo
      tunes, for all the world as if it were a week-day! Flesh and blood could
      not endure such goings on. They would hear next door, they would hear in
      the road, it was a public announcement of their disrepute. He had to
      speak.

He had felt himself go pale, and a kind of rigour had affected his
      respiration as he delivered himself. He had been sitting on one of the
      chairs by the window—the new guest had taken possession of the
      arm-chair. He turned his head. "Sun Day!" he said over the collar, in the
      voice of one who warns. "Sun Day!" What people call a "nasty" tone, it
      was.

Jennie had kept on playing, but his wife, who was looking through some
      music that was piled on the top of the piano, had stared at him. "What''s
      wrong now?" she said; "can''t people enjoy themselves?"

"I don''t mind rational ''njoyment, at all," said little Coombes, "but I
      ain''t a-going to have week-day tunes playing on a Sunday in this house."

"What''s wrong with my playing now?" said Jennie, stopping and twirling
      round on the music-stool with a monstrous rustle of flounces.

Coombes saw it was going to be a row, and opened too vigorously, as is
      common with your timid, nervous men all the world over. "Steady on with
      that music-stool!" said he; "it ain''t made for ''eavy-weights."

"Never you mind about weights," said Jennie, incensed. "What was you
      saying behind my back about my playing?"

"Surely you don''t ''old with not having a bit of music on a Sunday, Mr.
      Coombes?" said the new guest, leaning back in the arm-chair, blowing a
      cloud of cigarette smoke and smiling in a kind of pitying way. And
      simultaneously his wife said something to Jennie about "Never mind ''im.
      You go on, Jinny."

"May I arst why?" said the new guest, evidently enjoying both his
      cigarette and the prospect of an argument. He was, by-the-by, a lank young
      man, very stylishly dressed in bright drab, with a white cravat and a
      pearl and silver pin. It had been better taste to come in a black coat,
      Mr. Coombes thought.

"Because," began Mr. Coombes, "it don''t suit me. I''m a business man. I
      ''ave to study my connection. Rational ''njoyment—"

"His connection!" said Mrs. Coombes scornfully. "That''s what he''s always
      a-saying. We got to do this, and we got to do that—"

"Look here!" said Mr. Coombes, driven at last to revolt, standing up and
      raising his voice. "I tell you I won''t have that." The frock-coat heaved
      with his indignation.

Whereupon they all began talking at once. The new guest said he was
      Jennie''s "intended," and meant to protect her, and Mr. Coombes said he was
      welcome to do so anywhere but in his (Mr. Coombes'') house; and Mrs.
      Coombes said he ought to be ashamed of insulting his guests, and (as I
      have already mentioned) that he was getting a regular little grub; and the
      end was, that Mr. Coombes ordered his visitors out of the house, and they
      wouldn''t go, and so he said he would go himself. With his face burning and
      tears of excitement in his eyes, he went into the passage, and as he
      struggled with his overcoat—his frock-coat sleeves got concertinaed
      up his arm—and gave a brush at his silk hat, Jennie began again at
      the piano, and strummed him insultingly out of the house. Turn, turn,
      turn. He slammed the shop door so that the house quivered. That, briefly,
      was the immediate making of his mood. You will perhaps begin to understand
      his disgust with existence.

As he walked along the muddy path under the firs,—it was late
      October, and the ditches and heaps of fir needles were gorgeous with
      clumps of fungi,—he recapitulated the melancholy history of his
      marriage. It was brief and commonplace enough. He now perceived with
      sufficient clearness that his wife had married him out of a natural
      curiosity and in order to escape from her worrying, laborious, and
      uncertain life in the workroom; and, like the majority of her class, she
      was far too stupid to realise that it was her duty to co-operate with him
      in his business. She was greedy of enjoyment, loquacious, and
      socially-minded, and evidently disappointed to find the restraints of
      poverty still hanging about her. His worries exasperated her, and the
      slightest attempt to control her proceedings resulted in a charge of
      "grumbling." Why couldn''t he be nice— as he used to be? And Coombes
      was such a harmless little man, too, nourished mentally on Self-Help,
      and with a meagre ambition of self-denial and competition, that was to end
      in a "sufficiency." Then Jennie came in as a female Mephistopheles, a
      gabbling chronicle of "fellers," and was always wanting his wife to go to
      theatres, and "all that." And in addition were aunts of his wife, and
      cousins (male and female) to eat up capital, insult him personally, upset
      business arrangements, annoy good customers, and generally blight his
      life. It was not the first occasion by many that Mr. Coombes had fled his
      home in wrath and indignation, and something like fear, vowing furiously
      and even aloud that he wouldn''t stand it, and so frothing away his energy
      along the line of least resistance. But never before had he been quite so
      sick of life as on this particular Sunday afternoon. The Sunday dinner may
      have had its share in his despair—and the greyness of the sky.
      Perhaps, too, he was beginning to realise his unendurable frustration as a
      business man as the consequence of his marriage. Presently bankruptcy, and
      after that—— Perhaps she might have reason to repent when it
      was too late. And destiny, as I have already intimated, had planted the
      path through the wood with evil-smelling fungi, thickly and variously
      planted it, not only on the right side, but on the left.

A small shopman is in such a melancholy position, if his wife turns out a
      disloyal partner. His capital is all tied up in his business, and to leave
      her means to join the unemployed in some strange part of the earth. The
      luxuries of divorce are beyond him altogether. So that the good old
      tradition of marriage for better or worse holds inexorably for him, and
      things work up to tragic culminations. Bricklayers kick their wives to
      death, and dukes betray theirs; but it is among the small clerks and
      shopkeepers nowadays that it comes most often to a cutting of throats.
      Under the circumstances it is not so very remarkable—and you must
      take it as charitably as you can—that the mind of Mr. Coombes ran
      for a while on some such glorious close to his disappointed hopes, and
      that he thought of razors, pistols, bread-knives, and touching letters to
      the coroner denouncing his enemies by name, and praying piously for
      forgiveness. After a time his fierceness gave way to melancholia. He had
      been married in this very overcoat, in his first and only frock-coat that
      was buttoned up beneath it. He began to recall their courting along this
      very walk, his years of penurious saving to get capital, and the bright
      hopefulness of his marrying days. For it all to work out like this! Was
      there no sympathetic ruler anywhere in the world? He reverted to death as
      a topic.

He thought of the canal he had just crossed, and doubted whether he
      shouldn''t stand with his head out, even in the middle, and it was while
      drowning was in his mind that the purple pileus caught his eye. He looked
      at it mechanically for a moment, and stopped and stooped towards it to
      pick it up, under the impression that it was some such small leather
      object as a purse. Then he saw that it was the purple top of a fungus, a
      peculiarly poisonous-looking purple: slimy, shiny, and emitting a sour
      odour. He hesitated with his hand an inch or so from it, and the thought
      of poison crossed his mind. With that he picked the thing, and stood up
      again with it in his hand.

The odour was certainly strong—acrid, but by no means disgusting. He
      broke off a piece, and the fresh surface was a creamy white, that changed
      like magic in the space of ten seconds to a yellowish-green colour. It was
      even an inviting-looking change. He broke off two other pieces to see it
      repeated. They were wonderful things these fungi, thought Mr. Coombes, and
      all of them the deadliest poisons, as his father had often told him.
      Deadly poisons!

There is no time like the present for a rash resolve. Why not here and
      now? thought Mr. Coombes. He tasted a little piece, a very little piece
      indeed—a mere crumb. It was so pungent that he almost spat it out
      again, then merely hot and full-flavoured: a kind of German mustard with a
      touch of horse-radish and—well, mushroom. He swallowed it in the
      excitement of the moment. Did he like it or did he not? His mind was
      curiously careless. He would try another bit. It really wasn''t bad—it
      was good. He forgot his troubles in the interest of the immediate moment.
      Playing with death it was. He took another bite, and then deliberately
      finished a mouthful. A curious, tingling sensation began in his
      finger-tips and toes. His pulse began to move faster. The blood in his
      ears sounded like a mill-race. "Try bi'' more," said Mr. Coombes. He turned
      and looked about him, and found his feet unsteady. He saw, and struggled
      towards, a little patch of purple a dozen yards away. "Jol'' goo'' stuff,"
      said Mr. Coombes. "E—lomore ye''." He pitched forward and fell on his
      face, his hands outstretched towards the cluster of pilei. But he did not
      eat any more of them. He forgot forthwith.

He rolled over and sat up with a look of astonishment on his face. His
      carefully brushed silk hat had rolled away towards the ditch. He pressed
      his hand to his brow. Something had happened, but he could not rightly
      determine what it was. Anyhow, he was no longer dull—he felt bright,
      cheerful. And his throat was afire. He laughed in the sudden gaiety of his
      heart. Had he been dull? He did not know; but at any rate he would be dull
      no longer. He got up and stood unsteadily, regarding the universe with an
      agreeable smile. He began to remember. He could not remember very well,
      because of a steam roundabout that was beginning in his head. And he knew
      he had been disagreeable at home, just because they wanted to be happy.
      They were quite right; life should be as gay as possible. He would go home
      and make it up, and reassure them. And why not take some of this
      delightful toadstool with him, for them to eat? A hatful, no less. Some of
      those red ones with white spots as well, and a few yellow. He had been a
      dull dog, an enemy to merriment; he would make up for it. It would be gay
      to turn his coat-sleeves inside out, and stick some yellow gorse into his
      waistcoat pockets. Then home—singing—-for a jolly evening.

After the departure of Mr. Coombes, Jennie discontinued playing, and
      turned round on the music-stool again. "What a fuss about nothing!" said
      Jennie.

"He ain''t got the slightest sense of our position," said Mrs. Coombes;
      "that''s what I complain of. He cares for nothing but his old shop; and if
      I have a bit of company, or buy anything to keep myself decent, or get any
      little thing I want out of the housekeeping money, there''s disagreeables.
      ''Economy'' he says; ''struggle for life,'' and all that. He lies awake of
      nights about it, worrying how he can screw me out of a shilling. He wanted
      us to eat Dorset butter once. If once I was to give in to him—there!"

"If a man values a woman," said Mr. Clarence, lounging back in the
      arm-chair, "he must be prepared to make sacrifices for her. For my own
      part," said Mr. Clarence, with his eye on Jennie, "I shouldn''t think of
      marrying till I was in a position to do the thing in style. It''s downright
      selfishness. A man ought to go through the rough-and-tumble by himself,
      and not drag her—"

"I don''t agree altogether with that," said Jennie. "I don''t see why a man
      shouldn''t have a woman''s help, provided he doesn''t treat her meanly, you
      know. It''s meanness—"

"You wouldn''t believe," said Mrs. Coombes. "But I was a fool to ''ave ''im.
      I might ''ave known. If it ''adn''t been for my father, we shouldn''t ''ave ''ad
      not a carriage to our wedding."

"Said he wanted the money for his stock, or some such rubbish. Why, he
      wouldn''t have a woman in to help me once a week if it wasn''t for my
      standing out plucky. And the fusses he makes about money—comes to
      me, well, pretty near crying, with sheets of paper and figgers. ''If only
      we can tide over this year,'' he says, ''the business is bound to go.'' ''If
      only we can tide over this year,'' I says; ''then it''ll be, if only we can
      tide over next year. I know you,'' I says. ''And you don''t catch me screwing
      myself lean and ugly. Why didn''t you marry a slavey?'' I says, ''if you
      wanted one—instead of a respectable girl,'' I says."

So Mrs. Coombes. But we will not follow this unedifying conversation
      further. Suffice it that Mr. Coombes was very satisfactorily disposed of,
      and they had a snug little time round the fire. Then Mrs. Coombes went to
      get the tea, and Jennie sat coquettishly on the arm of Mr. Clarence''s
      chair until the tea-things clattered outside. "What was that I heard?"
      asked Mrs. Coombes playfully, as she entered, and there was badinage about
      kissing. They were just sitting down to the little circular table when the
      first intimation of Mr. Coombes'' return was heard.

"''Ere''s my lord," said Mrs. Coombes. "Went out like a lion and comes back
      like a lamb, I''ll lay."

Something fell over in the shop: a chair, it sounded like. Then there was
      a sound as of some complicated step exercise in the passage. Then the door
      opened and Coombes appeared. But it was Coombes transfigured. The
      immaculate collar had been torn carelessly from his throat. His
      carefully-brushed silk hat, half-full of a crush of fungi, was under one
      arm; his coat was inside out, and his waistcoat adorned with bunches of
      yellow-blossomed furze. These little eccentricities of Sunday costume,
      however, were quite overshadowed by the change in his face; it was livid
      white, his eyes were unnaturally large and bright, and his pale blue lips
      were drawn back in a cheerless grin. "Merry!" he said. He had stopped
      dancing to open the door. "Rational ''njoyment. Dance." He made three
      fantastic steps into the room, and stood bowing.

"He''s drunk," said Jennie in a weak voice. Never before had she seen this
      intense pallor in a drunken man, or such shining, dilated eyes.

Mr. Coombes held out a handful of scarlet agaric to Mr. Clarence. "Jo''
      stuff," said he; "ta'' some."

At that moment he was genial. Then at the sight of their startled faces he
      changed, with the swift transition of insanity, into overbearing fury. And
      it seemed as if he had suddenly recalled the quarrel of his departure. In
      such a huge voice as Mrs. Coombes had never heard before, he shouted, "My
      house. I''m master ''ere. Eat what I give yer!" He bawled this, as it
      seemed, without an effort, without a violent gesture, standing there as
      motionless as one who whispers, holding out a handful of fungus.

Clarence approved himself a coward. He could not meet the mad fury in
      Coombes'' eyes; he rose to his feet, pushing back his chair, and turned,
      stooping. At that Coombes rushed at him. Jennie saw her opportunity, and,
      with the ghost of a shriek, made for the door.

Mrs. Coombes followed her. Clarence tried to dodge. Over went the
      tea-table with a smash as Coombes clutched him by the collar and tried to
      thrust the fungus into his mouth. Clarence was content to leave his collar
      behind him, and shot out into the passage with red patches of fly agaric
      still adherent to his face. "Shut ''im in!" cried Mrs. Coombes, and would
      have closed the door, but her supports deserted her; Jennie saw the shop
      door open, and vanished thereby, locking it behind her, while Clarence
      went on hastily into the kitchen. Mr. Coombes came heavily against the
      door, and Mrs. Coombes, finding the key was inside, fled upstairs and
      locked herself in the spare bedroom.

So the new convert to joie de vivre emerged upon the passage, his
      decorations a little scattered, but that respectable hatful of fungi still
      under his arm. He hesitated at the three ways, and decided on the kitchen.
      Whereupon Clarence, who was fumbling with the key, gave up the attempt to
      imprison his host, and fled into the scullery, only to be captured before
      he could open the door into the yard. Mr. Clarence is singularly reticent
      of the details of what occurred. It seems that Mr. Coombes'' transitory
      irritation had vanished again, and he was once more a genial playfellow.
      And as there were knives and meat choppers about, Clarence very generously
      resolved to humour him and so avoid anything tragic. It is beyond dispute
      that Mr. Coombes played with Mr. Clarence to his heart''s content; they
      could not have been more playful and familiar if they had known each other
      for years. He insisted gaily on Clarence trying the fungi, and, after a
      friendly tussle, was smitten with remorse at the mess he was making of his
      guest''s face. It also appears that Clarence was dragged under the sink and
      his face scrubbed with the blacking brush—he being still resolved to
      humour the lunatic at any cost—and that finally, in a somewhat
      dishevelled, chipped, and discoloured condition, he was assisted to his
      coat and shown out by the back door, the shopway being barred by Jennie.
      Mr. Coombes'' wandering thoughts then turned to Jennie. Jennie had been
      unable to unfasten the shop door, but she shot the bolts against Mr.
      Coombes'' latch-key, and remained in possession of the shop for the rest of
      the evening.

It would appear that Mr. Coombes then returned to the kitchen, still in
      pursuit of gaiety, and, albeit a strict Good Templar, drank (or spilt down
      the front of the first and only frock-coat) no less than five bottles of
      the stout Mrs. Coombes insisted upon having for her health''s sake. He made
      cheerful noises by breaking off the necks of the bottles with several of
      his wife''s wedding-present dinner-plates, and during the earlier part of
      this great drunk he sang divers merry ballads. He cut his finger rather
      badly with one of the bottles—the only bloodshed in this story—and
      what with that, and the systematic convulsion of his inexperienced
      physiology by the liquorish brand of Mrs. Coombes'' stout, it may be the
      evil of the fungus poison was somehow allayed. But we prefer to draw a
      veil over the concluding incidents of this Sunday afternoon. They ended in
      the coal cellar, in a deep and healing sleep.

An interval of five years elapsed. Again it was a Sunday afternoon in
      October, and again Mr. Coombes walked through the pine wood beyond the
      canal. He was still the same dark-eyed, black-moustached little man that
      he was at the outset of the story, but his double chin was now scarcely so
      illusory as it had been. His overcoat was new, with a velvet lapel, and a
      stylish collar with turn-down corners, free of any coarse starchiness, had
      replaced the original all-round article. His hat was glossy, his gloves
      newish—though one finger had split and been carefully mended. And a
      casual observer would have noticed about him a certain rectitude of
      bearing, a certain erectness of head that marks the man who thinks well of
      himself. He was a master now, with three assistants. Beside him walked a
      larger sunburnt parody of himself, his brother Tom, just back from
      Australia. They were recapitulating their early struggles, and Mr. Coombes
      had just been making a financial statement.

"It''s a very nice little business, Jim," said brother Tom. "In these days
      of competition you''re jolly lucky to have worked it up so. And you''re
      jolly lucky, too, to have a wife who''s willing to help like yours does."

"Between ourselves," said Mr. Coombes, "it wasn''t always so. It wasn''t
      always like this. To begin with, the missus was a bit giddy. Girls are
      funny creatures."

"Yes. You''d hardly think it, but she was downright extravagant, and always
      having slaps at me. I was a bit too easy and loving, and all that, and she
      thought the whole blessed show was run for her. Turned the ''ouse into a
      regular caravansery, always having her relations and girls from business
      in, and their chaps. Comic songs a'' Sunday, it was getting to, and driving
      trade away. And she was making eyes at the chaps, too! I tell you, Tom,
      the place wasn''t my own."

"It was so. Well—I reasoned with her. I said, ''I ain''t a duke, to
      keep a wife like a pet animal. I married you for ''elp and company.'' I
      said, ''You got to ''elp and pull the business through.'' She wouldn''t ''ear
      of it. ''Very well,'' I says?? ''I''m a mild man till I''m roused,'' I says,
      ''and it''s getting to that.'' But she wouldn''t ''ear of no warnings."

"It''s the way with women. She didn''t think I ''ad it in me to be roused.
      Women of her sort (between ourselves, Tom) don''t respect a man until
      they''re a bit afraid of him. So I just broke out to show her. In comes a
      girl named Jennie, that used to work with her, and her chap. We ''ad a bit
      of a row, and I came out ''ere—it was just such another day as this—and
      I thought it all out. Then I went back and pitched into them."

"I did. I was mad, I can tell you. I wasn''t going to ''it ''er if I could
      ''elp it, so I went back and licked into this chap, just to show ''er what I
      could do. ''E was a big chap, too. Well, I chucked him, and smashed things
      about, and gave ''er a scaring, and she ran up and locked ''erself into the
      spare room."

"That''s all. I says to ''er the next morning, ''Now you know,'' I says, ''what
      I''m like when I''m roused.'' And I didn''t have to say anything more."

"So to speak. There''s nothing like putting your foot down with them. If it
      ''adn''t been for that afternoon I should ''a'' been tramping the roads now,
      and she''d ''a'' been grumbling at me, and all her family grumbling for
      bringing her to poverty—I know their little ways. But we''re all
      right now. And it''s a very decent little business, as you say."

"What a lot of these funguses there are about here!" remarked Brother Tom
      presently. "I can''t see what use they are in the world."

And that was as much thanks as the purple pileus ever got for maddening
      this absurd little man to the pitch of decisive action, and so altering
      the whole course of his life.

Outside the laboratory windows was a watery-grey fog, and within a close
      warmth and the yellow light of the green-shaded gas lamps that stood two
      to each table down its narrow length. On each table stood a couple of
      glass jars containing the mangled vestiges of the crayfish, mussels,
      frogs, and guinea-pigs upon which the students had been working, and down
      the side of the room, facing the windows, were shelves bearing bleached
      dissections in spirits, surmounted by a row of beautifully executed
      anatomical drawings in white-wood frames and overhanging a row of cubical
      lockers. All the doors of the laboratory were panelled with blackboard,
      and on these were the half-erased diagrams of the previous day''s work. The
      laboratory was empty, save for the demonstrator, who sat near the
      preparation-room door, and silent, save for a low, continuous murmur and
      the clicking of the rocker microtome at which he was working. But
      scattered about the room were traces of numerous students: hand-bags,
      polished boxes of instruments, in one place a large drawing covered by
      newspaper, and in another a prettily bound copy of News from Nowhere,
      a book oddly at variance with its surroundings. These things had been put
      down hastily as the students had arrived and hurried at once to secure
      their seats in the adjacent lecture theatre. Deadened by the closed door,
      the measured accents of the professor sounded as a featureless muttering.

Presently, faint through the closed windows came the sound of the Oratory
      clock striking the hour of eleven. The clicking of the microtome ceased,
      and the demonstrator looked at his watch, rose, thrust his hands into his
      pockets, and walked slowly down the laboratory towards the lecture theatre
      door. He stood listening for a moment, and then his eye fell on the little
      volume by William Morris. He picked it up, glanced at the title, smiled,
      opened it, looked at the name on the fly-leaf, ran the leaves through with
      his hand, and put it down. Almost immediately the even murmur of the
      lecturer ceased, there was a sudden burst of pencils rattling on the desks
      in the lecture theatre, a stirring, a scraping of feet, and a number of
      voices speaking together. Then a firm footfall approached the door, which
      began to open, and stood ajar, as some indistinctly heard question
      arrested the new-comer.

The demonstrator turned, walked slowly back past the microtome, and left
      the laboratory by the preparation-room door. As he did so, first one, and
      then several students carrying notebooks entered the laboratory from the
      lecture theatre, and distributed themselves among the little tables, or
      stood in a group about the doorway. They were an exceptionally
      heterogeneous assembly, for while Oxford and Cambridge still recoil from
      the blushing prospect of mixed classes, the College of Science anticipated
      America in the matter years ago—mixed socially, too, for the
      prestige of the College is high, and its scholarships, free of any age
      limit, dredge deeper even than do those of the Scotch universities. The
      class numbered one-and-twenty, but some remained in the theatre
      questioning the professor, copying the black-board diagrams before they
      were washed off, or examining the special specimens he had produced to
      illustrate the day''s teaching. Of the nine who had come into the
      laboratory three were girls, one of whom, a little fair woman, wearing
      spectacles and dressed in greyish-green, was peering out of the window at
      the fog, while the other two, both wholesome-looking, plain-faced
      schoolgirls, unrolled and put on the brown holland aprons they wore while
      dissecting. Of the men, two went down the laboratory to their places, one
      a pallid, dark-bearded man, who had once been a tailor; the other a
      pleasant-featured, ruddy young man of twenty, dressed in a well-fitting
      brown suit; young Wedderburn, the son of Wedderburn, the eye specialist.
      The others formed a little knot near the theatre door. One of these, a
      dwarfed, spectacled figure, with a hunchback, sat on a bent wood stool;
      two others, one a short, dark youngster, and the other a flaxen-haired,
      reddish-complexioned young man, stood leaning side by side against the
      slate sink, while the fourth stood facing them, and maintained the larger
      share of the conversation.

This last person was named Hill. He was a sturdily built young fellow, of
      the same age as Wedderburn; he had a white face, dark grey eyes, hair of
      an indeterminate colour, and prominent, irregular features. He talked
      rather louder than was needful, and thrust his hands deeply into his
      pockets. His collar was frayed and blue with the starch of a careless
      laundress, his clothes were evidently ready-made, and there was a patch on
      the side of his boot near the toe. And as he talked or listened to the
      others, he glanced now and again towards the lecture theatre door. They
      were discussing the depressing peroration of the lecture they had just
      heard, the last lecture it was in the introductory course in zoology.
      "From ovum to ovum is the goal of the higher vertebrata," the lecturer had
      said in his melancholy tones, and so had neatly rounded off the sketch of
      comparative anatomy he had been developing. The spectacled hunchback had
      repeated it, with noisy appreciation, had tossed it towards the
      fair-haired student with an evident provocation, and had started one of
      these vague, rambling discussions on generalities, so unaccountably dear
      to the student mind all the world over.

"That is our goal, perhaps—I admit it, as far as science goes," said
      the fair-haired student, rising to the challenge. "But there are things
      above science."

"Science," said Hill confidently, "is systematic knowledge. Ideas that
      don''t come into the system—must anyhow—be loose ideas." He was
      not quite sure whether that was a clever saying or a fatuity until his
      hearers took it seriously.

"The thing I cannot understand," said the hunchback, at large, "is whether
      Hill is a materialist or not."

"There is one thing above matter," said Hill promptly, feeling he had a
      better thing this time; aware, too, of someone in the doorway behind him,
      and raising his voice a trifle for her benefit, "and that is, the delusion
      that there is something above matter."

"So we have your gospel at last," said the fair student. "It''s all a
      delusion, is it? All our aspirations to lead something more than dogs''
      lives, all our work for anything beyond ourselves. But see how
      inconsistent you are. Your socialism, for instance. Why do you trouble
      about the interests of the race? Why do you concern yourself about the
      beggar in the gutter? Why are you bothering yourself to lend that book "—
      he indicated William Morris by a movement of the head—"to everyone
      in the lab.?"

The girl in brown, with the brown eyes, had come into the laboratory, and
      stood on the other side of the table behind him, with her rolled-up apron
      in one hand, looking over her shoulder, listening to the discussion. She
      did not notice the hunchback, because she was glancing from Hill to his
      interlocutor. Hill''s consciousness of her presence betrayed itself to her
      only in his studious ignorance of the fact; but she understood that, and
      it pleased her. "I see no reason," said he, "why a man should live like a
      brute because he knows of nothing beyond matter, and does not expect to
      exist a hundred years hence."

"That''s the way with all you religious people. It''s all a business of
      inducements. Cannot a man seek after righteousness for righteousness''
      sake?"

There was a pause. The fair man answered, with a kind of vocal padding,
      "But—you see—inducement—when I said inducement," to gain
      time. And then the hunchback came to his rescue and inserted a question.
      He was a terrible person in the debating society with his questions, and
      they invariably took one form—a demand for a definition, "What''s
      your definition of righteousness?" said the hunchback at this stage.

Hill experienced a sudden loss of complacency at this question, but even
      as it was asked, relief came in the person of Brooks, the laboratory
      attendant, who entered by the preparation-room door, carrying a number of
      freshly killed guinea-pigs by their hind legs. "This is the last batch of
      material this session," said the youngster who had not previously spoken.
      Brooks advanced up the laboratory, smacking down a couple of guinea-pigs
      at each table. The rest of the class, scenting the prey from afar, came
      crowding in by the lecture theatre door, and the discussion perished
      abruptly as the students who were not already in their places hurried to
      them to secure the choice of a specimen. There was a noise of keys
      rattling on split rings as lockers were opened and dissecting instruments
      taken out. Hill was already standing by his table, and his box of scalpels
      was sticking out of his pocket. The girl in brown came a step towards him,
      and, leaning over his table, said softly, "Did you see that I returned
      your book, Mr. Hill?"

During the whole scene she and the book had been vividly present in his
      consciousness; but he made a clumsy pretence of looking at the book and
      seeing it for the first time. "Oh, yes," he said, taking it up. "I see.
      Did you like it?"

Then suddenly the laboratory was hushed by a curious, braying noise. It
      was the demonstrator. He was at the blackboard ready to begin the day''s
      instruction, and it was his custom to demand silence by a sound midway
      between the "Er" of common intercourse and the blast of a trumpet. The
      girl in brown slipped back to her place: it was immediately in front of
      Hill''s, and Hill, forgetting her forthwith, took a notebook out of the
      drawer of his table, turned over its leaves hastily, drew a stumpy pencil
      from his pocket, and prepared to make a copious note of the coming
      demonstration. For demonstrations and lectures are the sacred text of the
      College students. Books, saving only the Professor''s own, you may—it
      is even expedient to—ignore.

Hill was the son of a Landport cobbler, and had been hooked by a chance
      blue paper the authorities had thrown out to the Landport Technical
      College. He kept himself in London on his allowance of a guinea a week,
      and found that, with proper care, this also covered his clothing
      allowance, an occasional waterproof collar, that is; and ink and needles
      and cotton, and such-like necessaries for a man about town. This was his
      first year and his first session, but the brown old man in Landport had
      already got himself detested in many public-houses by boasting of his son,
      "the Professor." Hill was a vigorous youngster, with a serene contempt for
      the clergy of all denominations, and a fine ambition to reconstruct the
      world. He regarded his scholarship as a brilliant opportunity. He had
      begun to read at seven, and had read steadily whatever came in his way,
      good or bad, since then. His worldly experience had been limited to the
      island of Portsea, and acquired chiefly in the wholesale boot factory in
      which he had worked by day, after passing the seventh standard of the
      Board school. He had a considerable gift of speech, as the College
      Debating Society, which met amidst the crushing machines and mine models
      in the metallurgical theatre downstairs, already recognised—recognised
      by a violent battering of desks whenever he rose. And he was just at that
      fine emotional age when life opens at the end of a narrow pass like a
      broad valley at one''s feet, full of the promise of wonderful discoveries
      and tremendous achievements. And his own limitations, save that he knew
      that he knew neither Latin nor French, were all unknown to him.

At first his interest had been divided pretty equally between his
      biological work at the College and social and theological theorising, an
      employment which he took in deadly earnest. Of a night, when the big
      museum library was not open, he would sit on the bed of his room in
      Chelsea with his coat and a muffler on, and write out the lecture notes
      and revise his dissection memoranda, until Thorpe called him out by a
      whistle—the landlady objected to open the door to attic visitors—and
      then the two would go prowling about the shadowy, shiny, gas-lit streets,
      talking, very much in the fashion of the sample just given, of the God
      idea, and Righteousness, and Carlyle, and the Reorganisation of Society.
      And in the midst of it all, Hill, arguing not only for Thorpe, but for the
      casual passer-by, would lose the thread of his argument glancing at some
      pretty painted face that looked meaningly at him as he passed. Science and
      Righteousness! But once or twice lately there had been signs that a third
      interest was creeping into his life, and he had found his attention
      wandering from the fate of the mesoblastic somites or the probable meaning
      of the blastopore, to the thought of the girl with the brown eyes who sat
      at the table before him.

She was a paying student; she descended inconceivable social altitudes to
      speak to him. At the thought of the education she must have had, and the
      accomplishments she must possess, the soul of Hill became abject within
      him. She had spoken to him first over a difficulty about the alisphenoid
      of a rabbit''s skull, and he had found that, in biology at least, he had no
      reason for self-abasement. And from that, after the manner of young people
      starting from any starting-point, they got to generalities, and while Hill
      attacked her upon the question of socialism—some instinct told him
      to spare her a direct assault upon her religion—she was gathering
      resolution to undertake what she told herself was his aesthetic education.
      She was a year or two older than he, though the thought never occurred to
      him. The loan of News from Nowhere was the beginning of a series of
      cross loans. Upon some absurd first principle of his, Hill had never
      "wasted time" upon poetry, and it seemed an appalling deficiency to her.
      One day in the lunch hour, when she chanced upon him alone in the little
      museum where the skeletons were arranged, shamefully eating the bun that
      constituted his midday meal, she retreated, and returned to lend him, with
      a slightly furtive air, a volume of Browning. He stood sideways towards
      her and took the book rather clumsily, because he was holding the bun in
      the other hand. And in the retrospect his voice lacked the cheerful
      clearness he could have wished.

That occurred after the examination in comparative anatomy, on the day
      before the College turned out its students, and was carefully locked up by
      the officials, for the Christmas holidays. The excitement of cramming for
      the first trial of strength had for a little while dominated Hill, to the
      exclusion of his other interests. In the forecasts of the result in which
      everyone indulged he was surprised to find that no one regarded him as a
      possible competitor for the Harvey Commemoration Medal, of which this and
      the two subsequent examinations disposed. It was about this time that
      Wedderburn, who so far had lived inconspicuously on the uttermost margin
      of Hill''s perceptions, began to take on the appearance of an obstacle. By
      a mutual agreement, the nocturnal prowlings with Thorpe ceased for the
      three weeks before the examination, and his landlady pointed out that she
      really could not supply so much lamp oil at the price. He walked to and
      fro from the College with little slips of mnemonics in his hand, lists of
      crayfish appendages, rabbits'' skull-bones, and vertebrate nerves, for
      example, and became a positive nuisance to foot passengers in the opposite
      direction.

But, by a natural reaction, Poetry and the girl with the brown eyes ruled
      the Christmas holiday. The pending results of the examination became such
      a secondary consideration that Hill marvelled at his father''s excitement.
      Even had he wished it, there was no comparative anatomy to read in
      Landport, and he was too poor to buy books, but the stock of poets in the
      library was extensive, and Hill''s attack was magnificently sustained. He
      saturated himself with the fluent numbers of Longfellow and Tennyson, and
      fortified himself with Shakespeare; found a kindred soul in Pope, and a
      master in Shelley, and heard and fled the siren voices of Eliza Cook and
      Mrs. Hemans. But he read no more Browning, because he hoped for the loan
      of other volumes from Miss Haysman when he returned to London.

He walked from his lodgings to the College with that volume of Browning in
      his shiny black bag, and his mind teeming with the finest general
      propositions about poetry. Indeed, he framed first this little speech and
      then that with which to grace the return. The morning was an exceptionally
      pleasant one for London; there was a clear, hard frost and undeniable blue
      in the sky, a thin haze softened every outline, and warm shafts of
      sunlight struck between the house blocks and turned the sunny side of the
      street to amber and gold. In the hall of the College he pulled off his
      glove and signed his name with fingers so stiff with cold that the
      characteristic dash under the signature he cultivated became a quivering
      line. He imagined Miss Haysman about him everywhere. He turned at the
      staircase, and there, below, he saw a crowd struggling at the foot of the
      notice-board. This, possibly, was the biology list. He forgot Browning and
      Miss Haysman for the moment, and joined the scrimmage. And at last, with
      his cheek flattened against the sleeve of the man on the step above him,
      he read the list—

and thereafter followed a second class that is outside our present
      sympathies. It was characteristic that he did not trouble to look for
      Thorpe on the physics list, but backed out of the struggle at once, and in
      a curious emotional state between pride over common second-class humanity
      and acute disappointment at Wedderburn''s success, went on his way
      upstairs. At the top, as he was hanging up his coat in the passage, the
      zoological demonstrator, a young man from Oxford, who secretly regarded
      him as a blatant "mugger" of the very worst type, offered his heartiest
      congratulations.

At the laboratory door Hill stopped for a second to get his breath, and
      then entered. He looked straight up the laboratory and saw all five girl
      students grouped in their places, and Wedderburn, the once retiring
      Wedderburn, leaning rather gracefully against the window, playing with the
      blind tassel and talking, apparently, to the five of them. Now, Hill could
      talk bravely enough and even overbearingly to one girl, and he could have
      made a speech to a roomful of girls, but this business of standing at ease
      and appreciating, fencing, and returning quick remarks round a group was,
      he knew, altogether beyond him. Coming up the staircase his feelings for
      Wedderburn had been generous, a certain admiration perhaps, a willingness
      to shake his hand conspicuously and heartily as one who had fought but the
      first round. But before Christmas Wedderburn had never gone up to that end
      of the room to talk. In a flash Hill''s mist of vague excitement condensed
      abruptly to a vivid dislike of Wedderburn. Possibly his expression
      changed. As he came up to his place, Wedderburn nodded carelessly to him,
      and the others glanced round. Miss Haysman looked at him and away again,
      the faintest touch of her eyes. "I can''t agree with you, Mr. Wedderburn,"
      she said.

"I must congratulate you on your first-class, Mr. Hill," said the
      spectacled girl in green, turning round and beaming at him.

"It''s nothing," said Hill, staring at Wedderburn and Miss Haysman talking
      together, and eager to hear what they talked about.

What was it Wedderburn was saying? Something about William Morris! Hill
      did not answer the girl in spectacles, and the smile died out of his face.
      He could not hear, and failed to see how he could "cut in." Confound
      Wedderburn! He sat down, opened his bag, hesitated whether to return the
      volume of Browning forthwith, in the sight of all, and instead drew out
      his new notebooks for the short course in elementary botany that was now
      beginning, and which would terminate in February. As he did so, a fat,
      heavy man, with a white face and pale grey eyes—Bindon, the
      professor of botany, who came up from Kew for January and February—came
      in by the lecture theatre door, and passed, rubbing his hands together and
      smiling, in silent affability down the laboratory.

In the subsequent six weeks Hill experienced some very rapid and curiously
      complex emotional developments. For the most part he had Wedderburn in
      focus—a fact that Miss Haysman never suspected. She told Hill (for
      in the comparative privacy of the museum she talked a good deal to him of
      socialism and Browning and general propositions) that she had met
      Wedderburn at the house of some people she knew, and "he''s inherited his
      cleverness; for his father, you know, is the great eye-specialist."

"My father is a cobbler," said Hill, quite irrelevantly, and
      perceived the want of dignity even as he said it. But the gleam of
      jealousy did not offend her. She conceived herself the fundamental source
      of it. He suffered bitterly from a sense of Wedderburn''s unfairness, and a
      realisation of his own handicap. Here was this Wedderburn had picked up a
      prominent man for a father, and instead of his losing so many marks on the
      score of that advantage, it was counted to him for righteousness! And
      while Hill had to introduce himself and talk to Miss Haysman clumsily over
      mangled guinea-pigs in the laboratory, this Wedderburn, in some backstairs
      way, had access to her social altitudes, and could converse in a polished
      argot that Hill understood perhaps, but felt incapable of speaking. Not,
      of course, that he wanted to. Then it seemed to Hill that for Wedderburn
      to come there day after day with cuffs unfrayed, neatly tailored,
      precisely barbered, quietly perfect, was in itself an ill-bred, sneering
      sort of proceeding. Moreover, it was a stealthy thing for Wedderburn to
      behave insignificantly for a space, to mock modesty, to lead Hill to fancy
      that he himself was beyond dispute the man of the year, and then suddenly
      to dart in front of him, and incontinently to swell up in this fashion. In
      addition to these things, Wedderburn displayed an increasing disposition
      to join in any conversational grouping that included Miss Haysman, and
      would venture, and indeed seek occasion, to pass opinions derogatory to
      socialism and atheism. He goaded Hill to incivilities by neat, shallow,
      and exceedingly effective personalities about the socialist leaders, until
      Hill hated Bernard Shaw''s graceful egotisms, William Morris''s limited
      editions and luxurious wall-papers, and Walter Crane''s charmingly absurd
      ideal working men, about as much as he hated Wedderburn. The dissertations
      in the laboratory, that had been his glory in the previous term, became a
      danger, degenerated into inglorious tussels with Wedderburn, and Hill kept
      to them only out of an obscure perception that his honour was involved. In
      the debating society Hill knew quite clearly that, to a thunderous
      accompaniment of banged desks, he could have pulverised Wedderburn. Only
      Wedderburn never attended the debating society to be pulverised, because—nauseous
      affectation!—he "dined late."

You must not imagine that these things presented themselves in quite such
      a crude form to Hill''s perception. Hill was a born generaliser. Wedderburn
      to him was not so much an individual obstacle as a type, the salient angle
      of a class. The economic theories that, after infinite ferment, had shaped
      themselves in Hill''s mind, became abruptly concrete at the contact. The
      world became full of easy-mannered, graceful, gracefully-dressed,
      conversationally dexterous, finally shallow Wedderburns, Bishops
      Wedderburn, Wedderburn M.P.''s, Professors Wedderburn, Wedderburn
      landlords, all with finger-bowl shibboleths and epigrammatic cities of
      refuge from a sturdy debater. And everyone ill-clothed or ill-dressed,
      from the cobbler to the cab-runner, was a man and a brother, a
      fellow-sufferer, to Hill''s imagination. So that he became, as it were, a
      champion of the fallen and oppressed, albeit to outward seeming only a
      self-assertive, ill-mannered young man, and an unsuccessful champion at
      that. Again and again a skirmish over the afternoon tea that the girl
      students had inaugurated left Hill with flushed cheeks and a tattered
      temper, and the debating society noticed a new quality of sarcastic
      bitterness in his speeches.

You will understand now how it was necessary, if only in the interests of
      humanity, that Hill should demolish Wedderburn in the forthcoming
      examination and outshine him in the eyes of Miss Haysman; and you will
      perceive, too, how Miss Haysman fell into some common feminine
      misconceptions. The Hill-Wedderburn quarrel, for in his unostentatious way
      Wedderburn reciprocated Hill''s ill-veiled rivalry, became a tribute to her
      indefinable charm; she was the Queen of Beauty in a tournament of scalpels
      and stumpy pencils. To her confidential friend''s secret annoyance, it even
      troubled her conscience, for she was a good girl, and painfully aware,
      from Ruskin and contemporary fiction, how entirely men''s activities are
      determined by women''s attitudes. And if Hill never by any chance mentioned
      the topic of love to her, she only credited him with the finer modesty for
      that omission. So the time came on for the second examination, and Hill''s
      increasing pallor confirmed the general rumour that he was working hard.
      In the aerated bread shop near South Kensington Station you would see him,
      breaking his bun and sipping his milk, with his eyes intent upon a paper
      of closely written notes. In his bedroom there were propositions about
      buds and stems round his looking-glass, a diagram to catch his eye, if
      soap should chance to spare it, above his washing basin. He missed several
      meetings of the debating society, but he found the chance encounters with
      Miss Haysman in the spacious ways of the adjacent art museum, or in the
      little museum at the top of the College, or in the College corridors, more
      frequent and very restful. In particular, they used to meet in a little
      gallery full of wrought-iron chests and gates, near the art library, and
      there Hill used to talk, under the gentle stimulus of her flattering
      attention, of Browning and his personal ambitions. A characteristic she
      found remarkable in him was his freedom from avarice. He contemplated
      quite calmly the prospect of living all his life on an income below a
      hundred pounds a year. But he was determined to be famous, to make,
      recognisably in his own proper person, the world a better place to live
      in. He took Bradlaugh and John Burns for his leaders and models, poor,
      even impecunious, great men. But Miss Haysman thought that such lives were
      deficient on the aesthetic side, by which, though she did not know it, she
      meant good wall-paper and upholstery, pretty books, tasteful clothes,
      concerts, and meals nicely cooked and respectfully served.

At last came the day of the second examination, and the professor of
      botany, a fussy, conscientious man, rearranged all the tables in a long
      narrow laboratory to prevent copying, and put his demonstrator on a chair
      on a table (where he felt, he said, like a Hindoo god), to see all the
      cheating, and stuck a notice outside the door, "Door closed," for no
      earthly reason that any human being could discover. And all the morning
      from ten till one the quill of Wedderburn shrieked defiance at Hill''s, and
      the quills of the others chased their leaders in a tireless pack, and so
      also it was in the afternoon. Wedderburn was a little quieter than usual,
      and Hill''s face was hot all day, and his overcoat bulged with textbooks
      and notebooks against the last moment''s revision. And the next day, in the
      morning and in the afternoon, was the practical examination, when sections
      had to be cut and slides identified. In the morning Hill was depressed
      because he knew he had cut a thick section, and in the afternoon came the
      mysterious slip.

It was just the kind of thing that the botanical professor was always
      doing. Like the income tax, it offered a premium to the cheat. It was a
      preparation under the microscope, a little glass slip, held in its place
      on the stage of the instrument by light steel clips, and the inscription
      set forth that the slip was not to be moved. Each student was to go in
      turn to it, sketch it, write in his book of answers what he considered it
      to be, and return to his place. Now, to move such a slip is a thing one
      can do by a chance movement of the finger, and in a fraction of a second.
      The professor''s reason for decreeing that the slip should not be moved
      depended on the fact that the object he wanted identified was
      characteristic of a certain tree stem. In the position in which it was
      placed it was a difficult thing to recognise, but once the slip was moved
      so as to bring other parts of the preparation into view, its nature was
      obvious enough.

Hill came to this, flushed from a contest with staining re-agents, sat
      down on the little stool before the microscope, turned the mirror to get
      the best light, and then, out of sheer habit, shifted the slips. At once
      he remembered the prohibition, and, with an almost continuous motion of
      his hands, moved it back, and sat paralysed with astonishment at his
      action.

Then, slowly, he turned his head. The professor was out of the room; the
      demonstrator sat aloft on his impromptu rostrum, reading the Q. Jour.
      Mi. Sci.; the rest of the examinees were busy, and with their backs to
      him. Should he own up to the accident now? He knew quite clearly what the
      thing was. It was a lenticel, a characteristic preparation from the
      elder-tree. His eyes roved over his intent fellow-students, and Wedderburn
      suddenly glanced over his shoulder at him with a queer expression in his
      eyes. The mental excitement that had kept Hill at an abnormal pitch of
      vigour these two days gave way to a curious nervous tension. His book of
      answers was beside him. He did not write down what the thing was, but with
      one eye at the microscope he began making a hasty sketch of it. His mind
      was full of this grotesque puzzle in ethics that had suddenly been sprung
      upon him. Should he identify it? or should he leave this question
      unanswered? In that case Wedderburn would probably come out first in the
      second result. How could he tell now whether he might not have identified
      the thing without shifting it? It was possible that Wedderburn had failed
      to recognise it, of course. Suppose Wedderburn too had shifted the slide?
      He looked up at the clock. There were fifteen minutes in which to make up
      his mind. He gathered up his book of answers and the coloured pencils he
      used in illustrating his replies and walked back to his seat.

He read through his manuscript, and then sat thinking and gnawing his
      knuckle. It would look queer now if he owned up. He must beat
      Wedderburn. He forgot the examples of those starry gentlemen, John Burns
      and Bradlaugh. Besides, he reflected, the glimpse of the rest of the slip
      he had had was, after all, quite accidental, forced upon him by chance, a
      kind of providential revelation rather than an unfair advantage. It was
      not nearly so dishonest to avail himself of that as it was of Broome, who
      believed in the efficacy of prayer, to pray daily for a first-class. "Five
      minutes more," said the demonstrator, folding up his paper and becoming
      observant. Hill watched the clock hands until two minutes remained; then
      he opened the book of answers, and, with hot ears and an affectation of
      ease, gave his drawing of the lenticel its name.

When the second pass list appeared, the previous positions of Wedderburn
      and Hill were reversed, and the spectacled girl in green, who knew the
      demonstrator in private life (where he was practically human), said that
      in the result of the two examinations taken together Hill had the
      advantage of a mark—167 to 166 out of a possible 200. Everyone
      admired Hill in a way, though the suspicion of "mugging" clung to him. But
      Hill was to find congratulations and Miss Haysman''s enhanced opinion of
      him, and even the decided decline in the crest of Wedderburn, tainted by
      an unhappy memory. He felt a remarkable access of energy at first, and the
      note of a democracy marching to triumph returned to his debating-society
      speeches; he worked at his comparative anatomy with tremendous zeal and
      effect, and he went on with his aesthetic education. But through it all, a
      vivid little picture was continually coming before his mind''s eye—of
      a sneakish person manipulating a slide.

No human being had witnessed the act, and he was cocksure that no higher
      power existed to see, it; but for all that it worried him. Memories are
      not dead things but alive; they dwindle in disuse, but they harden and
      develop in all sorts of queer ways if they are being continually fretted.
      Curiously enough, though at the time he perceived clearly that the
      shifting was accidental, as the days wore on, his memory became confused
      about it, until at last he was not sure—although he assured himself
      that he was sure—whether the movement had been absolutely
      involuntary. Then it is possible that Hill''s dietary was conducive to
      morbid conscientiousness; a breakfast frequently eaten in a hurry, a
      midday bun, and, at such hours after five as chanced to be convenient,
      such meat as his means determined, usually in a chop-house in a back
      street off the Brompton Road. Occasionally he treated himself to
      threepenny or ninepenny classics, and they usually represented a
      suppression of potatoes or chops. It is indisputable that outbreaks of
      self-abasement and emotional revival have a distinct relation to periods
      of scarcity. But apart from this influence on the feelings, there was in
      Hill a distinct aversion to falsity that the blasphemous Landport cobbler
      had inculcated by strap and tongue from his earliest years. Of one fact
      about professed atheists I am convinced; they may be—they usually
      are—fools, void of subtlety, revilers of holy institutions, brutal
      speakers, and mischievous knaves, but they lie with difficulty. If it were
      not so, if they had the faintest grasp of the idea of compromise, they
      would simply be liberal churchmen. And, moreover, this memory poisoned his
      regard for Miss Haysman. For she now so evidently preferred him to
      Wedderburn that he felt sure he cared for her, and began reciprocating her
      attentions by timid marks of personal regard; at one time he even bought a
      bunch of violets, carried it about in his pocket, and produced it, with a
      stumbling explanation, withered and dead, in the gallery of old iron. It
      poisoned, too, the denunciation of capitalist dishonesty that had been one
      of his life''s pleasures. And, lastly, it poisoned his triumph in
      Wedderburn. Previously he had been Wedderburn''s superior in his own eyes,
      and had raged simply at a want of recognition. Now he began to fret at the
      darker suspicion of positive inferiority. He fancied he found
      justifications for his position in Browning, but they vanished on
      analysis. At last—moved, curiously enough, by exactly the same
      motive forces that had resulted in his dishonesty—he went to
      Professor Bindon, and made a clean breast of the whole affair. As Hill was
      a paid student, Professor Bindon did not ask him to sit down, and he stood
      before the professor''s desk as he made his confession.

"It''s a curious story," said Professor Bindon, slowly realising how the
      thing reflected on himself, and then letting his anger rise,—"a most
      remarkable story. I can''t understand your doing it, and I can''t understand
      this avowal. You''re a type of student—Cambridge men would never
      dream—I suppose I ought to have thought—why did you
      cheat?"

"I am not a metaphysician, I am a servant of science—of fact. You
      were told not to move the slip. You did move the slip. If that is not
      cheating—"

"If I was a cheat," said Hill, with the note of hysterics in his voice,
      "should I come here and tell you?"

"Your repentance, of course, does you credit," said Professor Bindon, "but
      it does not alter the original facts."

"Even now you cause an enormous amount of trouble. The examination list
      will have to be revised."

"Suppose so? Of course it must be revised. And I don''t see how I can
      conscientiously pass you."

"It''s the rule in all examinations. Or where should we be? What else did
      you expect? You don''t want to shirk the consequences of your own acts?"

"I thought, perhaps——" said Hill. And then, "Fail me? I
      thought, as I told you, you would simply deduct the marks given for that
      slip."

"Impossible!" said Bindon. "Besides, it would still leave you above
      Wedderburn. Deduct only the marks! Preposterous! The Departmental
      Regulations distinctly say——"

"The Regulations say nothing whatever of the manner in which the matter
      comes to light. They simply provide——"

"I cannot consider anything. Professors in this College are machines. The
      Regulations will not even let us recommend our students for appointments.
      I am a machine, and you have worked me. I have to do——"

"That is as you think proper." Bindon''s voice softened a little; he
      perceived he had been unjust, and, provided he did not contradict himself,
      he was disposed to amelioration. "As a private person," he said, "I think
      this confession of yours goes far to mitigate your offence. But you have
      set the machinery in motion, and now it must take its course. I—I am
      really sorry you gave way."

A wave of emotion prevented Hill from answering. Suddenly, very vividly,
      he saw the heavily-lined face of the old Landport cobbler, his father.
      "Good God! What a fool I have been!" he said hotly and abruptly.

"I would like a day to think, sir, and then I will let you know—about
      going home, I mean," said Hill, moving towards the door.

The next day Hill''s place was vacant. The spectacled girl in green was, as
      usual, first with the news. Wedderburn and Miss Haysman were talking of a
      performance of The Meistersingers when she came up to them.

"I didn''t," said the girl in spectacles. "But I know it now for a
      fact. Mr. Hill went and confessed to Professor Bindon himself."

"By Jove!" said Wedderburn. "Hill of all people. But I am always inclined
      to distrust these philanthropists-on-principle—"

"Quite. It''s dreadful, isn''t it? But, you know, what can you expect? His
      father is a cobbler."

"I don''t care. I will not believe it," she said, flushing darkly under her
      warm-tinted skin. "I will not believe it until he has told me so himself—
      face to face. I would scarcely believe it then," and abruptly she turned
      her back on the girl in spectacles, and walked to her own place.

But Wedderburn did not answer her. She was indeed one of those people who
      seemed destined to make unanswered remarks.

There was, until a year ago, a little and very grimy-looking shop near
      Seven Dials, over which, in weather-worn yellow lettering, the name of "C.
      Cave, Naturalist and Dealer in Antiquities," was inscribed. The contents
      of its window were curiously variegated. They comprised some elephant
      tusks and an imperfect set of chessmen, beads and weapons, a box of eyes,
      two skulls of tigers and one human, several moth-eaten stuffed monkeys
      (one holding a lamp), an old-fashioned cabinet, a fly-blown ostrich egg or
      so, some fishing-tackle, and an extraordinarily dirty, empty glass
      fish-tank. There was also, at the moment the story begins, a mass of
      crystal, worked into the shape of an egg and brilliantly polished. And at
      that two people who stood outside the window were looking, one of them a
      tall, thin clergyman, the other a black-bearded young man of dusky
      complexion and unobtrusive costume. The dusky young man spoke with eager
      gesticulation, and seemed anxious for his companion to purchase the
      article.

While they were there, Mr. Cave came into his shop, his beard still
      wagging with the bread and butter of his tea. When he saw these men and
      the object of their regard, his countenance fell. He glanced guiltily over
      his shoulder, and softly shut the door. He was a little old man, with pale
      face and peculiar watery blue eyes; his hair was a dirty grey, and he wore
      a shabby blue frock-coat, an ancient silk hat, and carpet slippers very
      much down at heel. He remained watching the two men as they talked. The
      clergyman went deep into his trouser pocket, examined a handful of money,
      and showed his teeth in an agreeable smile. Mr. Cave seemed still more
      depressed when they came into the shop.

The clergyman, without any ceremony, asked the price of the crystal egg.
      Mr. Cave glanced nervously towards the door leading into the parlour, and
      said five pounds. The clergyman protested that the price was high, to his
      companion as well as to Mr. Cave—it was, indeed, very much more than
      Mr. Cave had intended to ask when he had stocked the article—and an
      attempt at bargaining ensued. Mr. Cave stepped to the shop door, and held
      it open. "Five pounds is my price," he said, as though he wished to save
      himself the trouble of unprofitable discussion. As he did so, the upper
      portion of a woman''s face appeared above the blind in the glass upper
      panel of the door leading into the parlour, and stared curiously at the
      two customers. "Five pounds is my price," said Mr. Cave, with a quiver in
      his voice.

The swarthy young man had so far remained a spectator, watching Cave
      keenly. Now he spoke. "Give him five pounds," he said. The clergyman
      glanced at him to see if he were in earnest, and when he looked at Mr.
      Cave again, he saw that the latter''s face was white. "It''s a lot of
      money," said the clergyman, and, diving into his pocket, began counting
      his resources. He had little more than thirty shillings, and he appealed
      to his companion, with whom he seemed to be on terms of considerable
      intimacy. This gave Mr. Cave an opportunity of collecting his thoughts,
      and he began to explain in an agitated manner that the crystal was not, as
      a matter of fact, entirely free for sale. His two customers were naturally
      surprised at this, and inquired why he had not thought of that before he
      began to bargain. Mr. Cave became confused, but he stuck to his story,
      that the crystal was not in the market that afternoon, that a probable
      purchaser of it had already appeared. The two, treating this as an attempt
      to raise the price still further, made as if they would leave the shop.
      But at this point the parlour door opened, and the owner of the dark
      fringe and the little eyes appeared.

She was a coarse-featured, corpulent woman, younger and very much larger
      than Mr. Cave; she walked heavily, and her face was flushed. "That crystal
      is for sale," she said. "And five pounds is a good enough price for
      it. I can''t think what you''re about, Cave, not to take the gentleman''s
      offer!"

Mr. Cave, greatly perturbed by the irruption, looked angrily at her over
      the rims of his spectacles, and, without excessive assurance, asserted his
      right to manage his business in his own way. An altercation began. The two
      customers watched the scene with interest and some amusement, occasionally
      assisting Mrs. Cave with suggestions. Mr. Cave, hard driven, persisted in
      a confused and impossible story of an inquiry for the crystal that
      morning, and his agitation became painful. But he stuck to his point with
      extraordinary persistence. It was the young Oriental who ended this
      curious controversy. He proposed that they should call again in the course
      of two days—so as to give the alleged inquirer a fair chance. "And
      then we must insist," said the clergyman. "Five pounds." Mrs. Cave took it
      on herself to apologise for her husband, explaining that he was sometimes
      "a little odd," and as the two customers left, the couple prepared for a
      free discussion of the incident in all its bearings.

Mrs. Cave talked to her husband with singular directness. The poor little
      man, quivering with emotion, muddled himself between his stories,
      maintaining on the one hand that he had another customer in view, and on
      the other asserting that the crystal was honestly worth ten guineas. "Why
      did you ask five pounds?" said his wife. "Do let me manage my
      business my own way!" said Mr. Cave.

Mr. Cave had living with him a step-daughter and a step-son, and at supper
      that night the transaction was re-discussed. None of them had a high
      opinion of Mr. Cave''s business methods, and this action seemed a
      culminating folly.

"It''s my opinion he''s refused that crystal before," said the step-son, a
      loose-limbed lout of eighteen.

Mr. Cave''s answers were wretched; he could only mumble weak assertions
      that he knew his own business best. They drove him from his half-eaten
      supper into the shop, to close it for the night, his ears aflame and tears
      of vexation behind his spectacles. Why had he left the crystal in the
      window so long? The folly of it! That was the trouble closest in his mind.
      For a time he could see no way of evading sale.

After supper his step-daughter and step-son smartened themselves up and
      went out and his wife retired upstairs to reflect upon the business
      aspects of the crystal, over a little sugar and lemon and so forth in hot
      water. Mr. Cave went into the shop, and stayed there until late,
      ostensibly to make ornamental rockeries for gold-fish cases, but really
      for a private purpose that will be better explained later. The next day
      Mrs. Cave found that the crystal had been removed from the window, and was
      lying behind some second-hand books on angling. She replaced it in a
      conspicuous position. But she did not argue further about it, as a nervous
      headache disinclined her from debate. Mr. Cave was always disinclined. The
      day passed disagreeably. Mr. Cave was, if anything, more absent-minded
      than usual, and uncommonly irritable withal. In the afternoon, when his
      wife was taking her customary sleep, he removed the crystal from the
      window again.

The next day Mr. Cave had to deliver a consignment of dog-fish at one of
      the hospital schools, where they were needed for dissection. In his
      absence Mrs. Cave''s mind reverted to the topic of the crystal, and the
      methods of expenditure suitable to a windfall of five pounds. She had
      already devised some very agreeable expedients, among others a dress of
      green silk for herself and a trip to Richmond, when a jangling of the
      front door bell summoned her into the shop. The customer was an
      examination coach who came to complain of the non-delivery of certain
      frogs asked for the previous day. Mrs. Cave did not approve of this
      particular branch of Mr. Cave''s business, and the gentleman, who had
      called in a somewhat aggressive mood, retired after a brief exchange of
      words—entirely civil, so far as he was concerned. Mrs. Cave''s eye
      then naturally turned to the window; for the sight of the crystal was an
      assurance of the five pounds and of her dreams. What was her surprise to
      find it gone!

She went to the place behind the locker on the counter, where she had
      discovered it the day before. It was not there; and she immediately began
      an eager search about the shop.

When Mr. Cave returned from his business with the dogfish, about a quarter
      to two in the afternoon, he found the shop in some confusion, and his
      wife, extremely exasperated and on her knees behind the counter, routing
      among his taxidermic material. Her face came up hot and angry over the
      counter, as the jangling bell announced his return, and she forthwith
      accused him of "hiding it."

At that Mr. Cave, apparently much surprised, rushed to the window. "Isn''t
      it here?" he said. "Great Heavens! what has become of it?"

Just then Mr. Cave''s step-son re-entered the shop from, the inner room—he
      had come home a minute or so before Mr. Cave—and he was blaspheming
      freely. He was apprenticed to a second-hand furniture dealer down the
      road, but he had his meals at home, and he was naturally annoyed to find
      no dinner ready.

But when he heard of the loss of the crystal, he forgot his meal, and his
      anger was diverted from his mother to his step-father. Their first idea,
      of course, was that he had hidden it. But Mr. Cave stoutly denied all
      knowledge of its fate, freely offering his bedabbled affidavit in the
      matter—and at last was worked up to the point of accusing, first,
      his wife and then his stepson of having taken it with a view to a private
      sale. So began an exceedingly acrimonious and emotional discussion, which
      ended for Mrs. Cave in a peculiar nervous condition midway between
      hysterics and amuck, and caused the step-son to be half-an-hour late at
      the furniture establishment in the afternoon. Mr. Cave took refuge from
      his wife''s emotions in the shop.

In the evening the matter was resumed, with less passion and in a judicial
      spirit, under the presidency of the step-daughter. The supper passed
      unhappily and culminated in a painful scene. Mr. Cave gave way at last to
      extreme exasperation, and went out banging the front door violently. The
      rest of the family, having discussed him with the freedom his absence
      warranted, hunted the house from garret to cellar, hoping to light upon
      the crystal.

The next day the two customers called again. They were received by Mrs.
      Cave almost in tears. It transpired that no one could imagine all
      that she had stood from Cave at various times in her married pilgrimage.
      ... She also gave a garbled account of the disappearance. The clergyman
      and the Oriental laughed silently at one another, and said it was very
      extraordinary. As Mrs. Cave seemed disposed to give them the complete
      history of her life they made to leave the shop. Thereupon Mrs. Cave,
      still clinging to hope, asked for the clergyman''s address, so that, if she
      could get anything out of Cave, she might communicate it. The address was
      duly given, but apparently was afterwards mislaid. Mrs. Cave can remember
      nothing about it.

In the evening of that day the Caves seem to have exhausted their
      emotions, and Mr. Cave, who had been out in the afternoon, supped in a
      gloomy isolation that contrasted pleasantly with the impassioned
      controversy of the previous days. For some time matters were very badly
      strained in the Cave household, but neither crystal nor customer
      reappeared.

Now, without mincing the matter, we must admit that Mr. Cave was a liar.
      He knew perfectly well where the crystal was. It was in the rooms of Mr.
      Jacoby Wace, Assistant Demonstrator at St. Catherine''s Hospital,
      Westbourne Street. It stood on the sideboard partially covered by a black
      velvet cloth, and beside a decanter of American whisky. It is from Mr.
      Wace, indeed, that the particulars upon which this narrative is based were
      derived. Cave had taken off the thing to the hospital hidden in the
      dog-fish sack, and there had pressed the young investigator to keep it for
      him. Mr. Wace was a little dubious at first. His relationship to Cave was
      peculiar. He had a taste for singular characters, and he had more than
      once invited the old man to smoke and drink in his rooms, and to unfold
      his rather amusing views of life in general and of his wife in particular.
      Mr. Wace had encountered Mrs. Cave, too, on occasions when Mr. Cave was
      not at home to attend to him. He knew the constant interference to which
      Cave was subjected, and having weighed the story judicially, he decided to
      give the crystal a refuge. Mr. Cave promised to explain the reasons for
      his remarkable affection for the crystal more fully on a later occasion,
      but he spoke distinctly of seeing visions therein. He called on Mr. Wace
      the same evening.

He told a complicated story. The crystal he said had come into his
      possession with other oddments at the forced sale of another curiosity
      dealer''s effects, and not knowing what its value might be, he had ticketed
      it at ten shillings. It had hung upon his hands at that price for some
      months, and he was thinking of "reducing the figure," when he made a
      singular discovery.

At that time his health was very bad—and it must be borne in mind
      that, throughout all this experience, his physical condition was one of
      ebb—and he was in considerable distress by reason of the negligence,
      the positive ill-treatment even, he received from his wife and
      step-children. His wife was vain, extravagant, unfeeling, and had a
      growing taste for private drinking; his step-daughter was mean and
      over-reaching; and his step-son had conceived a violent dislike for him,
      and lost no chance of showing it. The requirements of his business pressed
      heavily upon him, and Mr. Wace does not think that he was altogether free
      from occasional intemperance. He had begun life in a comfortable position,
      he was a man of fair education, and he suffered, for weeks at a stretch,
      from melancholia and insomnia. Afraid to disturb his family, he would slip
      quietly from his wife''s side, when his thoughts became intolerable, and
      wander about the house. And about three o''clock one morning, late in
      August, chance directed him into the shop.

The dirty little place was impenetrably black except in one spot, where he
      perceived an unusual glow of light. Approaching this, he discovered it to
      be the crystal egg, which was standing on the corner of the counter
      towards the window. A thin ray smote through a crack in the shutters,
      impinged upon the object, and seemed as it were to fill its entire
      interior.

It occurred to Mr. Cave that this was not in accordance with the laws of
      optics as he had known them in his younger days. He could understand the
      rays being refracted by the crystal and coming to a focus in its interior,
      but this diffusion jarred with his physical conceptions. He approached the
      crystal nearly, peering into it and round it, with a transient revival of
      the scientific curiosity that in his youth had determined his choice of a
      calling. He was surprised to find the light not steady, but writhing
      within the substance of the egg, as though that object was a hollow sphere
      of some luminous vapour. In moving about to get different points of view,
      he suddenly found that he had come between it and the ray, and that the
      crystal none the less remained luminous. Greatly astonished, he lifted it
      out of the light ray and carried it to the darkest part of the shop. It
      remained bright for some four or five minutes, when it slowly faded and
      went out. He placed it in the thin streak of daylight, and its
      luminousness was almost immediately restored.

So far, at least, Mr. Wace was able to verify the remarkable story of Mr.
      Cave. He has himself repeatedly held this crystal in a ray of light (which
      had to be of a less diameter than one millimetre). And in a perfect
      darkness, such as could be produced by velvet wrapping, the crystal did
      undoubtedly appear very faintly phosphorescent. It would seem, however,
      that the luminousness was of some exceptional sort, and not equally
      visible to all eyes; for Mr. Harbinger—whose name will be familiar
      to the scientific reader in connection with the Pasteur Institute—was
      quite unable to see any light whatever. And Mr. Wace''s own capacity for
      its appreciation was out of comparison inferior to that of Mr. Cave''s.
      Even with Mr. Cave the power varied very considerably: his vision was most
      vivid during states of extreme weakness and fatigue.

Now, from the outset, this light in the crystal exercised a curious
      fascination upon Mr. Cave. And it says more for his loneliness of soul
      than a volume of pathetic writing could do, that he told no human being of
      his curious observations. He seems to have been living in such an
      atmosphere of petty spite that to admit the existence of a pleasure would
      have been to risk the loss of it. He found that as the dawn advanced, and
      the amount of diffused light increased, the crystal became to all
      appearance non-luminous. And for some time he was unable to see anything
      in it, except at night-time, in dark corners of the shop.

But the use of an old velvet cloth, which he used as a background for a
      collection of minerals, occurred to him, and by doubling this, and putting
      it over his head and hands, he was able to get a sight of the luminous
      movement within the crystal even in the day-time. He was very cautious
      lest he should be thus discovered by his wife, and he practised this
      occupation only in the afternoons, while she was asleep upstairs, and then
      circumspectly in a hollow under the counter. And one day, turning the
      crystal about in his hands, he saw something. It came and went like a
      flash, but it gave him the impression that the object had for a moment
      opened to him the view of a wide and spacious and strange country; and
      turning it about, he did, just as the light faded, see the same vision
      again.

Now it would be tedious and unnecessary to state all the phases of Mr.
      Cave''s discovery from this point. Suffice that the effect was this: the
      crystal, being peered into at an angle of about 137 degrees from the
      direction of the illuminating ray, gave a clear and consistent picture of
      a wide and peculiar country-side. It was not dream-like at all: it
      produced a definite impression of reality, and the better the light the
      more real and solid it seemed. It was a moving picture: that is to say,
      certain objects moved in it, but slowly in an orderly manner like real
      things, and, according as the direction of the lighting and vision
      changed, the picture changed also. It must, indeed, have been like looking
      through an oval glass at a view, and turning the glass about to get at
      different aspects.

Mr. Cave''s statements, Mr. Wace assures me, were extremely circumstantial,
      and entirely free from any of that emotional quality that taints
      hallucinatory impressions. But it must be remembered that all the efforts
      of Mr. Wace to see any similar clarity in the faint opalescence of the
      crystal were wholly unsuccessful, try as he would. The difference in
      intensity of the impressions received by the two men was very great, and
      it is quite conceivable that what was a view to Mr. Cave was a mere
      blurred nebulosity to Mr. Wace.

The view, as Mr. Cave described it, was invariably of an extensive plain,
      and he seemed always to be looking at it from a considerable height, as if
      from a tower or a mast. To the east and to the west the plain was bounded
      at a remote distance by vast reddish cliffs, which reminded him of those
      he had seen in some picture; but what the picture was Mr. Wace was unable
      to ascertain. These cliffs passed north and south—he could tell the
      points of the compass by the stars that were visible of a night—receding
      in an almost illimitable perspective and fading into the mists of the
      distance before they met. He was nearer the eastern set of cliffs; on the
      occasion of his first vision the sun was rising over them, and black
      against the sunlight and pale against their shadow appeared a multitude of
      soaring forms that Mr. Cave regarded as birds. A vast range of buildings
      spread below him; he seemed to be looking down upon them; and as they
      approached the blurred and refracted edge of the picture they became
      indistinct. There were also trees curious in shape, and in colouring a
      deep mossy green and an exquisite grey, beside a wide and shining canal.
      And something great and brilliantly coloured flew across the picture. But
      the first time Mr. Cave saw these pictures he saw only in flashes, his
      hands shook, his head moved, the vision came and went, and grew foggy and
      indistinct. And at first he had the greatest difficulty in finding the
      picture again once the direction of it was lost.

His next clear vision, which came about a week after the first, the
      interval having yielded nothing but tantalising glimpses and some useful
      experience, showed him the view down the length of the valley. The view
      was different, but he had a curious persuasion, which his subsequent
      observations abundantly confirmed, that he was regarding the strange world
      from exactly the same spot, although he was looking in a different
      direction. The long faÃ§ade of the great building, whose roof he had looked
      down upon before, was now receding in perspective. He recognised the roof.
      In the front of the faÃ§ade was a terrace of massive proportions and
      extraordinary length, and down the middle of the terrace, at certain
      intervals, stood huge but very graceful masts, bearing small shiny objects
      which reflected the setting sun. The import of these small objects did not
      occur to Mr. Cave until some time after, as he was describing the scene to
      Mr. Wace. The terrace overhung a thicket of the most luxuriant and
      graceful vegetation, and beyond this was a wide grassy lawn on which
      certain broad creatures, in form like beetles but enormously larger,
      reposed. Beyond this again was a richly decorated causeway of pinkish
      stone; and beyond that, and lined with dense red weeds, and passing up the
      valley exactly parallel with the distant cliffs, was a broad and
      mirror-like expanse of water. The air seemed full of squadrons of great
      birds, manoeuvring in stately curves; and across the river was a multitude
      of splendid buildings, richly coloured and glittering with metallic
      tracery and facets, among a forest of moss-like and lichenous trees. And
      suddenly something flapped repeatedly across the vision, like the
      fluttering of a jewelled fan or the beating of a wing, and a face, or
      rather the upper part of a face with very large eyes, came as it were
      close to his own and as if on the other side of the crystal. Mr. Cave was
      so startled and so impressed by the absolute reality of these eyes that he
      drew his head back from the crystal to look behind it. He had become so
      absorbed in watching that he was quite surprised to find himself in the
      cool darkness of his little shop, with its familiar odour of methyl,
      mustiness, and decay. And as he blinked about him, the glowing crystal
      faded and went out.

Such were the first general impressions of Mr. Cave. The story is
      curiously direct and circumstantial. From the outset, when the valley
      first flashed momentarily on his senses, his imagination was strangely
      affected, and as he began to appreciate the details of the scene he saw,
      his wonder rose to the point of a passion. He went about his business
      listless and distraught, thinking only of the time when he should be able
      to return to his watching. And then a few weeks after his first sight of
      the valley came the two customers, the stress and excitement of their
      offer, and the narrow escape of the crystal from sale, as I have already
      told.

Now, while the thing was Mr. Cave''s secret, it remained a mere wonder, a
      thing to creep to covertly and peep at, as a child might peep upon a
      forbidden garden. But Mr. Wace has, for a young scientific investigator, a
      particularly lucid and consecutive habit of mind. Directly the crystal and
      its story came to him, and he had satisfied himself, by seeing the
      phosphorescence with his own eyes, that there really was a certain
      evidence for Mr. Cave''s statements, he proceeded to develop the matter
      systematically. Mr. Cave was only too eager to come and feast his eyes on
      this wonderland he saw, and he came every night from half-past eight until
      half-past ten, and sometimes, in Mr. Wace''s absence, during the day. On
      Sunday afternoons, also, he came. From the outset Mr. Wace made copious
      notes, and it was due to his scientific method that the relation between
      the direction from which the initiating ray entered the crystal and the
      orientation of the picture were proved. And, by covering the crystal in a
      box perforated only with a small aperture to admit the exciting ray, and
      by substituting black holland for his buff blinds, he greatly improved the
      conditions of the observations; so that in a little while they were able
      to survey the valley in any direction they desired.

So having cleared the way, we may give a brief account of this visionary
      world within the crystal. The things were in all cases seen by Mr. Cave,
      and the method of working was invariably for him to watch the crystal and
      report what he saw, while Mr. Wace (who as a science student had learnt
      the trick of writing in the dark) wrote a brief note of his report. When
      the crystal faded, it was put into its box in the proper position and the
      electric light turned on. Mr. Wace asked questions, and suggested
      observations to clear up difficult points. Nothing, indeed, could have
      been less visionary and more matter-of-fact.

The attention of Mr. Cave had been speedily directed to the bird-like
      creatures he had seen so abundantly present in each of his earlier
      visions. His first impression was soon corrected, and he considered for a
      time that they might represent a diurnal species of bat. Then he thought,
      grotesquely enough, that they might be cherubs. Their heads were round and
      curiously human, and it was the eyes of one of them that had so startled
      him on his second observation. They had broad, silvery wings, not
      feathered, but glistening almost as brilliantly as new-killed fish and
      with the same subtle play of colour, and these wings were not built on the
      plan of bird-wing or bat, Mr. Wace learned, but supported by curved ribs
      radiating from the body. (A sort of butterfly wing with curved ribs seems
      best to express their appearance.) The body was small, but fitted with two
      bunches of prehensile organs, like long tentacles, immediately under the
      mouth. Incredible as it appeared to Mr. Wace, the persuasion at last
      became irresistible that it was these creatures which owned the great
      quasi-human buildings and the magnificent garden that made the broad
      valley so splendid. And Mr. Cave perceived that the buildings, with other
      peculiarities, had no doors, but that the great circular windows, which
      opened freely, gave the creatures egress and entrance. They would alight
      upon their tentacles, fold their wings to a smallness almost rod-like, and
      hop into the interior. But among them was a multitude of smaller-winged
      creatures, like great dragon-flies and moths and flying beetles, and
      across the greensward brilliantly-coloured gigantic ground-beetles crawled
      lazily to and fro. Moreover, on the causeways and terraces, large-headed
      creatures similar to the greater winged flies, but wingless, were visible,
      hopping busily upon their hand-like tangle of tentacles.

Allusion has already been made to the glittering objects upon masts that
      stood upon the terrace of the nearer building. It dawned upon Mr. Cave,
      after regarding one of these masts very fixedly on one particularly vivid
      day that the glittering object there was a crystal exactly like that into
      which he peered. And a still more careful scrutiny convinced him that each
      one in a vista of nearly twenty carried a similar object.

Occasionally one of the large flying creatures would flutter up to one,
      and folding its wings and coiling a number of its tentacles about the
      mast, would regard the crystal fixedly for a space,—sometimes for as
      long as fifteen minutes. And a series of observations, made at the
      suggestion of Mr. Wace, convinced both watchers that, so far as this
      visionary world was concerned, the crystal into which they peered actually
      stood at the summit of the end-most mast on the terrace, and that on one
      occasion at least one of these inhabitants of this other world had looked
      into Mr. Cave''s face while he was making these observations.

So much for the essential facts of this very singular story. Unless we
      dismiss it all as the ingenious fabrication of Mr. Wace, we have to
      believe one of two things: either that Mr. Cave''s crystal was in two
      worlds at once, and that while it was carried about in one, it remained
      stationary in the other, which seems altogether absurd; or else that it
      had some peculiar relation of sympathy with another and exactly similar
      crystal in this other world, so that what was seen in the interior of the
      one in this world was, under suitable conditions, visible to an observer
      in the corresponding crystal in the other world; and vice versa. At
      present, indeed, we do not know of any way in which two crystals could so
      come en rapport, but nowadays we know enough to understand that the
      thing is not altogether impossible. This view of the crystals as en
      rapport was the supposition that occurred to Mr. Wace, and to me at
      least it seems extremely plausible...

And where was this other world? On this, also, the alert intelligence of
      Mr. Wace speedily threw light. After sunset, the sky darkened rapidly—
      there was a very brief twilight interval indeed—and the stars shone
      out. They were recognisably the same as those we see, arranged in the same
      constellations. Mr. Cave recognised the Bear, the Pleiades, Aldebaran, and
      Sirius; so that the other world must be somewhere in the solar system,
      and, at the utmost, only a few hundreds of millions of miles from our own.
      Following up this clue, Mr. Wace learned that the midnight sky was a
      darker blue even than our midwinter sky, and that the sun seemed a little
      smaller. And there were two small moons! "like our moon but
      smaller, and quite differently marked," one of which moved so rapidly that
      its motion was clearly visible as one regarded it. These moons were never
      high in the sky, but vanished as they rose: that is, every time they
      revolved they were eclipsed because they were so near their primary
      planet. And all this answers quite completely, although Mr. Cave did not
      know it, to what must be the condition of things on Mars.

Indeed, it seems an exceedingly plausible conclusion that peering into
      this crystal Mr. Cave did actually see the planet Mars and its
      inhabitants. And if that be the case, then the evening star that shone so
      brilliantly in the sky of that distant vision was neither more nor less
      than our own familiar earth.

For a time the Martians—if they were Martians—do not seem to
      have known of Mr. Cave''s inspection. Once or twice one would come to peer,
      and go away very shortly to some other mast, as though the vision was
      unsatisfactory. During this time Mr. Cave was able to watch the
      proceedings of these winged people without being disturbed by their
      attentions, and although his report is necessarily vague and fragmentary,
      it is nevertheless very suggestive. Imagine the impression of humanity a
      Martian observer would get who, after a difficult process of preparation
      and with considerable fatigue to the eyes, was able to peer at London from
      the steeple of St. Martin''s Church for stretches, at longest, of four
      minutes at a time. Mr. Cave was unable to ascertain if the winged Martians
      were the same as the Martians who hopped about the causeways and terraces,
      and if the latter could put on wings at will. He several times saw certain
      clumsy bipeds, dimly suggestive of apes, white and partially translucent,
      feeding among certain of the lichenous trees, and once some of these fled
      before one of the hopping, round-headed Martians. The latter caught one in
      its tentacles, and then the picture faded suddenly and left Mr. Cave most
      tantalisingly in the dark. On another occasion a vast thing, that Mr. Cave
      thought at first was some gigantic insect, appeared advancing along the
      causeway beside the canal with extraordinary rapidity. As this drew nearer
      Mr. Cave perceived that it was a mechanism of shining metals and of
      extraordinary complexity. And then, when he looked again, it had passed
      out of sight.

After a time Mr. Wace aspired to attract the attention of the Martians,
      and the next time that the strange eyes of one of them appeared close to
      the crystal Mr. Cave cried out and sprang away, and they immediately
      turned on the light and began to gesticulate in a manner suggestive of
      signalling. But when at last Mr. Cave examined the crystal again the
      Martian had departed.

Thus far these observations had progressed in early November, and then Mr.
      Cave, feeling that the suspicions of his family about the crystal were
      allayed, began to take it to and fro with him in order that, as occasion
      arose in the daytime or night, he might comfort himself with what was fast
      becoming the most real thing in his existence.

In December Mr. Wace''s work in connection with a forthcoming examination
      became heavy, the sittings were reluctantly suspended for a week, and for
      ten or eleven days—he is not quite sure which—he saw nothing
      of Cave. He then grew anxious to resume these investigations, and, the
      stress of his seasonal labours being abated, he went down to Seven Dials.
      At the corner he noticed a shutter before a bird fancier''s window, and
      then another at a cobbler''s. Mr. Cave''s shop was closed.

He rapped and the door was opened by the step-son in black. He at once
      called Mrs. Cave, who was, Mr. Wace could not but observe, in cheap but
      ample widow''s weeds of the most imposing pattern. Without any very great
      surprise Mr. Wace learnt that Cave was dead and already buried. She was in
      tears, and her voice was a little thick. She had just returned from
      Highgate. Her mind seemed occupied with her own prospects and the
      honourable details of the obsequies, but Mr. Wace was at last able to
      learn the particulars of Cave''s death. He had been found dead in his shop
      in the early morning, the day after his last visit to Mr. Wace, and the
      crystal had been clasped in his stone-cold hands. His face was smiling,
      said Mrs. Cave, and the velvet cloth from the minerals lay on the floor at
      his feet. He must have been dead five or six hours when he was found.

This came as a great shock to Wace, and he began to reproach himself
      bitterly for having neglected the plain symptoms of the old man''s
      ill-health. But his chief thought was of the crystal. He approached that
      topic in a gingerly manner, because he knew Mrs. Cave''s peculiarities. He
      was dumfounded to learn that it was sold.

Mrs. Cave''s first impulse, directly Cave''s body had been taken upstairs,
      had been to write to the mad clergyman who had offered five pounds for the
      crystal, informing him of its recovery; but after a violent hunt, in which
      her daughter joined her, they were convinced of the loss of his address.
      As they were without the means required to mourn and bury Cave in the
      elaborate style the dignity of an old Seven Dials inhabitant demands, they
      had appealed to a friendly fellow-tradesman in Great Portland Street. He
      had very kindly taken over a portion of the stock at a valuation. The
      valuation was his own, and the crystal egg was included in one of the
      lots. Mr. Wace, after a few suitable condolences, a little off-handedly
      proffered perhaps, hurried at once to Great Portland Street. But there he
      learned that the crystal egg had already been sold to a tall, dark man in
      grey. And there the material facts in this curious, and to me at least
      very suggestive, story come abruptly to an end. The Great Portland Street
      dealer did not know who the tall dark man in grey was, nor had he observed
      him with sufficient attention to describe him minutely. He did not even
      know which way this person had gone after leaving the shop. For a time Mr.
      Wace remained in the shop, trying the dealer''s patience with hopeless
      questions, venting his own exasperation. And at last, realising abruptly
      that the whole thing had passed out of his hands, had vanished like a
      vision of the night, he returned to his own rooms, a little astonished to
      find the notes he had made still tangible and visible upon, his untidy
      table.

His annoyance and disappointment were naturally very great. He made a
      second call (equally ineffectual) upon the Great Portland Street dealer,
      and he resorted to advertisements in such periodicals as were lively to
      come into the hands of a bric-a-brac collector. He also wrote
      letters to The Daily Chronicle and Nature, but both those
      periodicals, suspecting a hoax, asked him to reconsider his action before
      they printed, and he was advised that such a strange story, unfortunately
      so bare of supporting evidence, might imperil his reputation as an
      investigator. Moreover, the calls of his proper work were urgent. So that
      after a month or so, save for an occasional reminder to certain dealers,
      he had reluctantly to abandon the quest for the crystal egg, and from that
      day to this it remains undiscovered. Occasionally, however, he tells me,
      and I can quite believe him, he has bursts of zeal, in which he abandons
      his more urgent occupation and resumes the search.

Whether or not it will remain lost for ever, with the material and origin
      of it, are things equally speculative at the present time. If the present
      purchaser is a collector, one would have expected the enquiries of Mr.
      Wace to have reached him through the dealers. He has been able to discover
      Mr. Cave''s clergyman and "Oriental"—no other than the Rev. James
      Parker and the young Prince of Bosso-Kuni in Java. I am obliged to them
      for certain particulars. The object of the Prince was simply curiosity—and
      extravagance. He was so eager to buy because Cave was so oddly reluctant
      to sell. It is just as possible that the buyer in the second instance was
      simply a casual purchaser and not a collector at all, and the crystal egg,
      for all I know, may at the present moment be within a mile of me,
      decorating a drawing-room or serving as a paper-weight—its
      remarkable functions all unknown. Indeed, it is partly with the idea of
      such a possibility that I have thrown this narrative into a form that will
      give it a chance of being read by the ordinary consumer of fiction.

My own ideas in the matter are practically identical with those of Mr.
      Wace. I believe the crystal on the mast in Mars and the crystal egg of Mr.
      Cave''s to be in some physical, but at present quite inexplicable, way en
      rapport, and we both believe further that the terrestrial crystal must
      have been—possibly at some remote date—sent hither from that
      planet, in order to give the Martians a near view of our affairs. Possibly
      the fellows to the crystals on the other masts are also on our globe. No
      theory of hallucination suffices for the facts.

It was on the first day of the new year that the announcement was made,
      almost simultaneously from three observatories, that the motion of the
      planet Neptune, the outermost of all the planets that wheel about the sun,
      had become very erratic. Ogilvy had already called attention to a
      suspected retardation in its velocity in December. Such a piece of news
      was scarcely calculated to interest a world the greater portion of whose
      inhabitants were unaware of the existence of the planet Neptune, nor
      outside the astronomical profession did the subsequent discovery of a
      faint remote speck of light in the region of the perturbed planet cause
      any very great excitement. Scientific people, however, found the
      intelligence remarkable enough, even before it became known that the new
      body was rapidly growing larger and brighter, that its motion was quite
      different from the orderly progress of the planets, and that the
      deflection of Neptune and its satellite was becoming now of an
      unprecedented kind.

Few people without a training in science can realise the huge isolation of
      the solar system. The sun with its specks of planets, its dust of
      planetoids, and its impalpable comets, swims in a vacant immensity that
      almost defeats the imagination. Beyond the orbit of Neptune there is
      space, vacant so far as human observation has penetrated, without warmth
      or light or sound, blank emptiness, for twenty million times a million
      miles. That is the smallest estimate of the distance to be traversed
      before the very nearest of the stars is attained. And, saving a few comets
      more unsubstantial than the thinnest flame, no matter had ever to human
      knowledge crossed this gulf of space until early in the twentieth century
      this strange wanderer appeared. A vast mass of matter it was, bulky,
      heavy, rushing without warning out of the black mystery of the sky into
      the radiance of the sun. By the second day it was clearly visible to any
      decent instrument, as a speck with a barely sensible diameter, in the
      constellation Leo near Regulus. In a little while an opera glass could
      attain it.

On the third day of the new year the newspaper readers of two hemispheres
      were made aware for the first time of the real importance of this unusual
      apparition in the heavens. "A Planetary Collision," one London paper
      headed the news, and proclaimed Duchaine''s opinion that this strange new
      planet would probably collide with Neptune. The leader-writers enlarged
      upon the topic. So that in most of the capitals of the world, on January
      3rd, there was an expectation, however vague, of some imminent phenomenon
      in the sky; and as the night followed the sunset round the globe,
      thousands of men turned their eyes skyward to see—the old familiar
      stars just as they had always been.

Until it was dawn in London and Pollux setting and the stars overhead
      grown pale. The Winter''s dawn it was, a sickly filtering accumulation of
      daylight, and the light of gas and candles shone yellow in the windows to
      show where people were astir. But the yawning policeman saw the thing, the
      busy crowds in the markets stopped agape, workmen going to their work
      betimes, milkmen, the drivers of news-carts, dissipation going home jaded
      and pale, homeless wanderers, sentinels on their beats, and, in the
      country, labourers trudging afield, poachers slinking home, all over the
      dusky quickening country it could be seen—and out at sea by seamen
      watching for the day—a great white star, come suddenly into the
      westward sky!

Brighter it was than any star in our skies; brighter than the evening star
      at its brightest. It still glowed out white and large, no mere twinkling
      spot of light, but a small, round, clear shining disc, an hour after the
      day had come. And where science has not reached, men stared and feared,
      telling one another of the wars and pestilences that are foreshadowed by
      these fiery signs in the Heavens. Sturdy Boers, dusky Hottentots, Gold

Leonard Bilsiter was one of those people who have failed to
find this world attractive or interesting, and who have sought
compensation in an “unseen world” of their own
experience or imagination—or invention.  Children do
that sort of thing successfully, but children are content to
convince themselves, and do not vulgarise their beliefs by trying
to convince other people.  Leonard Bilsiter’s beliefs
were for “the few,” that is to say, anyone who would
listen to him.

His dabblings in the unseen might not have carried him beyond
the customary platitudes of the drawing-room visionary if
accident had not reinforced his stock-in-trade of mystical
lore.  In company with a friend, who was interested in a
Ural mining concern, he had made a trip across Eastern Europe at
a moment when the great Russian railway strike was developing
from a threat to a reality; its outbreak caught him on the return
journey, somewhere on the further side of Perm, and it was while
waiting for a couple of days at a wayside station in a state of
suspended locomotion that he made the acquaintance of a dealer in
harness and metalware, who profitably whiled away the tedium of
the long halt by initiating his English travelling companion in a
fragmentary system of folk-lore that he had picked up from
Trans-Baikal traders and natives.  Leonard returned to his
home circle garrulous about his Russian strike experiences, but
oppressively reticent about certain dark mysteries, which he
alluded to under the resounding title of Siberian Magic. 
The reticence wore off in a week or two under the influence of an
entire lack of general curiosity, and Leonard began to make more
detailed allusions to the enormous powers which this new esoteric
force, to use his own description of it, conferred on the
initiated few who knew how to wield it.  His aunt, Cecilia
Hoops, who loved sensation perhaps rather better than she loved
the truth, gave him as clamorous an advertisement as anyone could
wish for by retailing an account of how he had turned a vegetable
marrow into a wood pigeon before her very eyes.  As a
manifestation of the possession of supernatural powers, the story
was discounted in some quarters by the respect accorded to Mrs.
Hoops’ powers of imagination.

However divided opinion might be on the question of
Leonard’s status as a wonderworker or a charlatan, he
certainly arrived at Mary Hampton’s house-party with a
reputation for pre-eminence in one or other of those professions,
and he was not disposed to shun such publicity as might fall to
his share.  Esoteric forces and unusual powers figured
largely in whatever conversation he or his aunt had a share in,
and his own performances, past and potential, were the subject of
mysterious hints and dark avowals.

“I wish you would turn me into a wolf, Mr.
Bilsiter,” said his hostess at luncheon the day after his
arrival.

“A she-wolf, of course,” continued Mrs. Hampton;
“it would be too confusing to change one’s sex as
well as one’s species at a moment’s
notice.”

“I’m not jesting, I’m quite serious, I
assure you.  Only don’t do it to-day; we have only
eight available bridge players, and it would break up one of our
tables.  To-morrow we shall be a larger party. 
To-morrow night, after dinner—”

“In our present imperfect understanding of these hidden
forces I think one should approach them with humbleness rather
than mockery,” observed Leonard, with such severity that
the subject was forthwith dropped.

Clovis Sangrail had sat unusually silent during the discussion
on the possibilities of Siberian Magic; after lunch he
side-tracked Lord Pabham into the comparative seclusion of the
billiard-room and delivered himself of a searching question.

“Have you such a thing as a she-wolf in your collection
of wild animals?  A she-wolf of moderately good
temper?”

Lord Pabham considered.  “There is Louisa,”
he said, “a rather fine specimen of the timber-wolf. 
I got her two years ago in exchange for some Arctic foxes. 
Most of my animals get to be fairly tame before they’ve
been with me very long; I think I can say Louisa has an angelic
temper, as she-wolves go.  Why do you ask?”

“I was wondering whether you would lend her to me for
to-morrow night,” said Clovis, with the careless solicitude
of one who borrows a collar stud or a tennis racquet.

“Yes, wolves are nocturnal animals, so the late hours
won’t hurt her,” said Clovis, with the air of one who
has taken everything into consideration; “one of your men
could bring her over from Pabham Park after dusk, and with a
little help he ought to be able to smuggle her into the
conservatory at the same moment that Mary Hampton makes an
unobtrusive exit.”

Lord Pabham stared at Clovis for a moment in pardonable
bewilderment; then his face broke into a wrinkled network of
laughter.

“Oh, that’s your game, is it?  You are going
to do a little Siberian Magic on your own account.  And is
Mrs. Hampton willing to be a fellow-conspirator?”

By the following day the house-party had swollen to larger
proportions, and Bilsiter’s instinct for self-advertisement
expanded duly under the stimulant of an increased audience. 
At dinner that evening he held forth at length on the subject of
unseen forces and untested powers, and his flow of impressive
eloquence continued unabated while coffee was being served in the
drawing-room preparatory to a general migration to the
card-room.

His aunt ensured a respectful hearing for his utterances, but
her sensation-loving soul hankered after something more dramatic
than mere vocal demonstration.

“Won’t you do something to convince them of
your powers, Leonard?” she pleaded; “change something
into another shape.  He can, you know, if he only chooses
to,” she informed the company.

“Oh, do,” said Mavis Pellington earnestly, and her
request was echoed by nearly everyone present.  Even those
who were not open to conviction were perfectly willing to be
entertained by an exhibition of amateur conjuring.

“Has anyone present,” he asked, “got a
three-penny bit or some small object of no particular
value—?”

“You’re surely not going to make coins disappear,
or something primitive of that sort?” said Clovis
contemptuously.

“I think it very unkind of you not to carry out my
suggestion of turning me into a wolf,” said Mary Hampton,
as she crossed over to the conservatory to give her macaws their
usual tribute from the dessert dishes.

“I have already warned you of the danger of treating
these powers in a mocking spirit,” said Leonard
solemnly.

“I don’t believe you can do it,” laughed
Mary provocatively from the conservatory; “I dare you to do
it if you can.  I defy you to turn me into a
wolf.”

“Mrs. Hampton—” began Leonard with increased
solemnity, but he got no further.  A breath of chill air
seemed to rush across the room, and at the same time the macaws
broke forth into ear-splitting screams.

“What on earth is the matter with those confounded
birds, Mary?” exclaimed Colonel Hampton; at the same moment
an even more piercing scream from Mavis Pellington stampeded the
entire company from their seats.  In various attitudes of
helpless horror or instinctive defence they confronted the
evil-looking grey beast that was peering at them from amid a
setting of fern and azalea.

“Leonard!” she screamed shrilly to her nephew,
“turn it back into Mrs. Hampton at once!  It may fly
at us at any moment.  Turn it back!”

“What!” shouted Colonel Hampton,
“you’ve taken the abominable liberty of turning my
wife into a wolf, and now you stand there calmly and say you
can’t turn her back again!”

To do strict justice to Leonard, calmness was not a
distinguishing feature of his attitude at the moment.

“I assure you I didn’t turn Mrs. Hampton into a
wolf; nothing was farther from my intentions,” he
protested.

“Of course we must accept your assurance that you
didn’t turn Mrs. Hampton into a wolf,” said Clovis
politely, “but you will agree that appearances are against
you.”

“Are we to have all these recriminations with that beast
standing there ready to tear us to pieces?” wailed Mavis
indignantly.

“The wild beasts that I have been accustomed to,”
said Lord Pabham, “have come with proper credentials from
well-known dealers, or have been bred in my own menagerie. 
I’ve never before been confronted with an animal that walks
unconcernedly out of an azalea bush, leaving a charming and
popular hostess unaccounted for.  As far as one can judge
from outward characteristics,” he continued,
“it has the appearance of a well-grown female of the North
American timber-wolf, a variety of the common species canis
lupus.”

“Oh, never mind its Latin name,” screamed Mavis,
as the beast came a step or two further into the room;
“can’t you entice it away with food, and shut it up
where it can’t do any harm?”

“If it is really Mrs. Hampton, who has just had a very
good dinner, I don’t suppose food will appeal to it very
strongly,” said Clovis.

“Leonard,” beseeched Mrs. Hoops tearfully,
“even if this is none of your doing can’t you use
your great powers to turn this dreadful beast into something
harmless before it bites us all—a rabbit or
something?”

“I don’t suppose Colonel Hampton would care to
have his wife turned into a succession of fancy animals as though
we were playing a round game with her,” interposed
Clovis.

“Most wolves that I’ve had anything to do with
have been inordinately fond of sugar,” said Lord Pabham;
“if you like I’ll try the effect on this
one.”

He took a piece of sugar from the saucer of his coffee cup and
flung it to the expectant Louisa, who snapped it in
mid-air.  There was a sigh of relief from the company; a
wolf that ate sugar when it might at the least have been employed
in tearing macaws to pieces had already shed some of its
terrors.  The sigh deepened to a gasp of thanks-giving when
Lord Pabham decoyed the animal out of the room by a pretended
largesse of further sugar.  There was an instant rush to the
vacated conservatory.  There was no trace of Mrs. Hampton
except the plate containing the macaws’ supper.

“The door is locked on the inside!” exclaimed
Clovis, who had deftly turned the key as he affected to test
it.

“If you haven’t turned my wife into a wolf,”
said Colonel Hampton, “will you kindly explain where she
has disappeared to, since she obviously could not have gone
through a locked door?  I will not press you for an
explanation of how a North American timber-wolf suddenly appeared
in the conservatory, but I think I have some right to inquire
what has become of Mrs. Hampton.”

“If our hostess has really vanished out of human
form,” said Mrs. Hoops, “none of the ladies of the
party can very well remain.  I absolutely decline to be
chaperoned by a wolf!”

The correct etiquette to be observed under the unusual
circumstances received no further elucidation.  The sudden
entry of Mary Hampton deprived the discussion of its immediate
interest.

“Some one has mesmerised me,” she exclaimed
crossly; “I found myself in the game larder, of all places,
being fed with sugar by Lord Pabham.  I hate being
mesmerised, and the doctor has forbidden me to touch
sugar.”

The situation was explained to her, as far as it permitted of
anything that could be called explanation.

But Leonard had burned the boat in which he might now have
embarked on a sea of glory.  He could only shake his head
feebly.

“It was I who took that liberty,” said Clovis;
“you see, I happen to have lived for a couple of years in
North-Eastern Russia, and I have more than a tourist’s
acquaintance with the magic craft of that region.  One does
not care to speak about these strange powers, but once in a way,
when one hears a lot of nonsense being talked about them, one is
tempted to show what Siberian magic can accomplish in the hands
of someone who really understands it.  I yielded to that
temptation.  May I have some brandy? the effort has left me
rather faint.”

If Leonard Bilsiter could at that moment have transformed
Clovis into a cockroach and then have stepped on him he would
gladly have performed both operations.

“I never said I was going to die.  I am presumably
going to leave off being Laura, but I shall go on being
something.  An animal of some kind, I suppose.  You
see, when one hasn’t been very good in the life one has
just lived, one reincarnates in some lower organism.  And I
haven’t been very good, when one comes to think of
it.  I’ve been petty and mean and vindictive and all
that sort of thing when circumstances have seemed to warrant
it.”

“If you don’t mind my saying so,” observed
Laura, “Egbert is a circumstance that would warrant any
amount of that sort of thing.  You’re married to
him—that’s different; you’ve sworn to love,
honour, and endure him: I haven’t.”

“Oh, I daresay the wrongness has been on my part,”
admitted Laura dispassionately; “he has merely been the
extenuating circumstance.  He made a thin, peevish kind of
fuss, for instance, when I took the collie puppies from the farm
out for a run the other day.”

“They chased his young broods of speckled Sussex and
drove two sitting hens off their nests, besides running all over
the flower beds.  You know how devoted he is to his poultry
and garden.”

“Anyhow, he needn’t have gone on about it for the
entire evening and then have said, ‘Let’s say no more
about it’ just when I was beginning to enjoy the
discussion.  That’s where one of my petty vindictive
revenges came in,” added Laura with an unrepentant chuckle;
“I turned the entire family of speckled Sussex into his
seedling shed the day after the puppy episode.”

“It came quite easy,” said Laura; “two of
the hens pretended to be laying at the time, but I was
firm.”

“You see,” resumed Laura, “I really
have some grounds for supposing that my next incarnation
will be in a lower organism.  I shall be an animal of some
kind.  On the other hand, I haven’t been a bad sort in
my way, so I think I may count on being a nice animal, something
elegant and lively, with a love of fun.  An otter,
perhaps.”

“Personally I think an otter life would be rather
enjoyable,” continued Laura; “salmon to eat all the
year round, and the satisfaction of being able to fetch the trout
in their own homes without having to wait for hours till they
condescend to rise to the fly you’ve been dangling before
them; and an elegant svelte figure—”

“Think of the otter hounds,” interposed Amanda;
“how dreadful to be hunted and harried and finally worried
to death!”

“Rather fun with half the neighbourhood looking on, and
anyhow not worse than this Saturday-to-Tuesday business of dying
by inches; and then I should go on into something else.  If
I had been a moderately good otter I suppose I should get back
into human shape of some sort; probably something rather
primitive—a little brown, unclothed Nubian boy, I should
think.”

“I wish you would be serious,” sighed Amanda;
“you really ought to be if you’re only going to live
till Tuesday.”

“So dreadfully upsetting,” Amanda complained to
her uncle-in-law, Sir Lulworth Quayne.  “I’ve
asked quite a lot of people down for golf and fishing, and the
rhododendrons are just looking their best.”

“Laura always was inconsiderate,” said Sir
Lulworth; “she was born during Goodwood week, with an
Ambassador staying in the house who hated babies.”

“She had the maddest kind of ideas,” said Amanda;
“do you know if there was any insanity in her
family?”

“Insanity?  No, I never heard of any.  Her
father lives in West Kensington, but I believe he’s sane on
all other subjects.”

“One meets with those ideas of reincarnation so
frequently, even in the West,” said Sir Lulworth,
“that one can hardly set them down as being mad.  And
Laura was such an unaccountable person in this life that I should
not like to lay down definite rules as to what she might be doing
in an after state.”

“You think she really might have passed into some animal
form?” asked Amanda.  She was one of those who shape
their opinions rather readily from the standpoint of those around
them.

Just then Egbert entered the breakfast-room, wearing an air of
bereavement that Laura’s demise would have been
insufficient, in itself, to account for.

“Four of my speckled Sussex have been killed,” he
exclaimed; “the very four that were to go to the show on
Friday.  One of them was dragged away and eaten right in the
middle of that new carnation bed that I’ve been to such
trouble and expense over.  My best flower bed and my best
fowls singled out for destruction; it almost seems as if the
brute that did the deed had special knowledge how to be as
devastating as possible in a short space of time.”

“No,” said Egbert, “there were marks of
webbed feet all over the place, and we followed the tracks down
to the stream at the bottom of the garden; evidently an
otter.”

Egbert was too agitated to eat any breakfast, and went out to
superintend the strengthening of the poultry yard defences.

“I think she might at least have waited till the funeral
was over,” said Amanda in a scandalised voice.

“It’s her own funeral, you know,” said Sir
Lulworth; “it’s a nice point in etiquette how far one
ought to show respect to one’s own mortal
remains.”

Disregard for mortuary convention was carried to further
lengths next day; during the absence of the family at the funeral
ceremony the remaining survivors of the speckled Sussex were
massacred.  The marauder’s line of retreat seemed to
have embraced most of the flower beds on the lawn, but the
strawberry beds in the lower garden had also suffered.

“On no account!  You can’t dream of such a
thing!” exclaimed Amanda.  “I mean, it
wouldn’t do, so soon after a funeral in the
house.”

“There’s been so little water in the stream
lately,” objected Amanda; “it seems hardly sporting
to hunt an animal when it has so little chance of taking refuge
anywhere.”

“Good gracious!” fumed Egbert, “I’m
not thinking about sport.  I want to have the animal killed
as soon as possible.”

Even Amanda’s opposition weakened when, during church
time on the following Sunday, the otter made its way into the
house, raided half a salmon from the larder and worried it into
scaly fragments on the Persian rug in Egbert’s studio.

“We shall have it hiding under our beds and biting
pieces out of our feet before long,” said Egbert, and from
what Amanda knew of this particular otter she felt that the
possibility was not a remote one.

On the evening preceding the day fixed for the hunt Amanda
spent a solitary hour walking by the banks of the stream, making
what she imagined to be hound noises.  It was charitably
supposed by those who overheard her performance, that she was
practising for farmyard imitations at the forth-coming village
entertainment.

“Pity you weren’t out; we had quite a good
day.  We found at once, in the pool just below your
garden.”

“Rather.  A fine she-otter.  Your husband got
rather badly bitten in trying to ‘tail it.’ 
Poor beast, I felt quite sorry for it, it had such a human look
in its eyes when it was killed.  You’ll call me silly,
but do you know who the look reminded me of?  My dear woman,
what is the matter?”

When Amanda had recovered to a certain extent from her attack
of nervous prostration Egbert took her to the Nile Valley to
recuperate.  Change of scene speedily brought about the
desired recovery of health and mental balance.  The
escapades of an adventurous otter in search of a variation of
diet were viewed in their proper light.  Amanda’s
normally placid temperament reasserted itself.  Even a
hurricane of shouted curses, coming from her husband’s
dressing-room, in her husband’s voice, but hardly in his
usual vocabulary, failed to disturb her serenity as she made a
leisurely toilet one evening in a Cairo hotel.

“What little beast?” asked Amanda, suppressing a
desire to laugh; Egbert’s language was so hopelessly
inadequate to express his outraged feelings.

“There is a back way on to the lawn,” said Mrs.
Philidore Stossen to her daughter, “through a small grass
paddock and then through a walled fruit garden full of gooseberry
bushes.  I went all over the place last year when the family
were away.  There is a door that opens from the fruit garden
into a shrubbery, and once we emerge from there we can mingle
with the guests as if we had come in by the ordinary way. 
It’s much safer than going in by the front entrance and
running the risk of coming bang up against the hostess; that
would be so awkward when she doesn’t happen to have invited
us.”

“To a garden party, yes; to the garden party of
the season, certainly not.  Every one of any consequence in
the county, with the exception of ourselves, has been asked to
meet the Princess, and it would be far more troublesome to invent
explanations as to why we weren’t there than to get in by a
roundabout way.  I stopped Mrs. Cuvering in the road
yesterday and talked very pointedly about the Princess.  If
she didn’t choose to take the hint and send me an
invitation it’s not my fault, is it?  Here we are: we
just cut across the grass and through that little gate into the
garden.”

Mrs. Stossen and her daughter, suitably arrayed for a county
garden party function with an infusion of Almanack de Gotha,
sailed through the narrow grass paddock and the ensuing
gooseberry garden with the air of state barges making an
unofficial progress along a rural trout stream.  There was a
certain amount of furtive haste mingled with the stateliness of
their advance, as though hostile search-lights might be turned on
them at any moment; and, as a matter of fact, they were not
unobserved.  Matilda Cuvering, with the alert eyes of
thirteen years old and the added advantage of an exalted position
in the branches of a medlar tree, had enjoyed a good view of the
Stossen flanking movement and had foreseen exactly where it would
break down in execution.

“They’ll find the door locked, and they’ll
jolly well have to go back the way they came,” she remarked
to herself.  “Serves them right for not coming in by
the proper entrance.  What a pity Tarquin Superbus
isn’t loose in the paddock.  After all, as every one
else is enjoying themselves, I don’t see why Tarquin
shouldn’t have an afternoon out.”

Matilda was of an age when thought is action; she slid down
from the branches of the medlar tree, and when she clambered back
again Tarquin, the huge white Yorkshire boar-pig, had exchanged
the narrow limits of his stye for the wider range of the grass
paddock.  The discomfited Stossen expedition, returning in
recriminatory but otherwise orderly retreat from the unyielding
obstacle of the locked door, came to a sudden halt at the gate
dividing the paddock from the gooseberry garden.

“It’s there now, anyhow,” said her
daughter.  “What on earth are we to do?  I wish
we had never come.”

The boar-pig had drawn nearer to the gate for a closer
inspection of the human intruders, and stood champing his jaws
and blinking his small red eyes in a manner that was doubtless
intended to be disconcerting, and, as far as the Stossens were
concerned, thoroughly achieved that result.

“If they think they’re going to drive him away by
reciting lists of the kings of Israel and Judah they’re
laying themselves out for disappointment,” observed Matilda
from her seat in the medlar tree.  As she made the
observation aloud Mrs. Stossen became for the first time aware of
her presence.  A moment or two earlier she would have been
anything but pleased at the discovery that the garden was not as
deserted as it looked, but now she hailed the fact of the
child’s presence on the scene with absolute relief.

“Permettez-moi expliquer.  You see,
I’m rather under a cloud,” said Matilda. 
“I’m staying with my aunt, and I was told I must
behave particularly well to-day, as lots of people were coming
for a garden party, and I was told to imitate Claude,
that’s my young cousin, who never does anything wrong
except by accident, and then is always apologetic about it. 
It seems they thought I ate too much raspberry trifle at lunch,
and they said Claude never eats too much raspberry trifle. 
Well, Claude always goes to sleep for half an hour after lunch,
because he’s told to, and I waited till he was asleep, and
tied his hands and started forcible feeding with a whole
bucketful of raspberry trifle that they were keeping for the
garden-party.  Lots of it went on to his sailor-suit and
some of it on to the bed, but a good deal went down
Claude’s throat, and they can’t say again that he has
never been known to eat too much raspberry trifle.  That is
why I am not allowed to go to the party, and as an additional
punishment I must speak French all the afternoon. 
I’ve had to tell you all this in English, as there were
words like ‘forcible feeding’ that I didn’t
know the French for; of course I could have invented them, but if
I had said nourriture obligatoire you wouldn’t have
had the least idea what I was talking about.  Mais
maintenant, nous parlons français.”

“Oh, very well, trés bien,” said
Mrs. Stossen reluctantly; in moments of flurry such French as she
knew was not under very good control. 
“Là, à l’autre
côté de la porte, est un
cochon—”

“Une bête,” corrected Matilda;
“a pig is masculine as long as you call it a pig, but if
you lose your temper with it and call it a ferocious beast it
becomes one of us at once.  French is a dreadfully unsexing
language.”

“For goodness’ sake let us talk English
then,” said Mrs. Stossen.  “Is there any way out
of this garden except through the paddock where the pig
is?”

“Dressed as we are we could hardly do that,” said
Mrs. Stossen; it was difficult to imagine her doing it in any
costume.

“Shall I recite to you to make the time pass
quicker?” asked Matilda obligingly. 
“‘Belinda, the little Breadwinner,’ is
considered my best piece, or, perhaps, it ought to be something
in French.  Henri Quatre’s address to his soldiers is
the only thing I really know in that language.”

“If you will go and fetch some one to drive that animal
away I will give you something to buy yourself a nice
present,” said Mrs. Stossen.

“That is the most practical suggestion you have made yet
for getting out of the garden,” she remarked cheerfully;
“Claude and I are collecting money for the Children’s
Fresh Air Fund, and we are seeing which of us can collect the
biggest sum.”

“I shall be very glad to contribute half a crown, very
glad indeed,” said Mrs. Stossen, digging that coin out of
the depths of a receptacle which formed a detached outwork of her
toilet.

“Claude is a long way ahead of me at present,”
continued Matilda, taking no notice of the suggested offering;
“you see, he’s only eleven, and has golden hair, and
those are enormous advantages when you’re on the collecting
job.  Only the other day a Russian lady gave him ten
shillings.  Russians understand the art of giving far better
than we do.  I expect Claude will net quite twenty-five
shillings this afternoon; he’ll have the field to himself,
and he’ll be able to do the pale, fragile,
not-long-for-this-world business to perfection after his
raspberry trifle experience.  Yes, he’ll be
quite two pounds ahead of me by now.”

With much probing and plucking and many regretful murmurs the
beleaguered ladies managed to produce seven-and-sixpence between
them.

“I could not do violence to my conscience for anything
less than ten shillings,” she announced stiffly.

Mother and daughter muttered certain remarks under their
breath, in which the word “beast” was prominent, and
probably had no reference to Tarquin.

“I find I have got another half-crown,”
said Mrs. Stossen in a shaking voice; “here you are. 
Now please fetch some one quickly.”

Matilda slipped down from the tree, took possession of the
donation, and proceeded to pick up a handful of over-ripe medlars
from the grass at her feet.  Then she climbed over the gate
and addressed herself affectionately to the boar-pig.

Tarquin couldn’t.  By dint of throwing the fruit in
front of him at judicious intervals Matilda decoyed him back to
his stye, while the delivered captives hurried across the
paddock.

“Well, I never!  The little minx!” exclaimed
Mrs. Stossen when she was safely on the high road. 
“The animal wasn’t savage at all, and as for the ten
shillings, I don’t believe the Fresh Air Fund will see a
penny of it!”

There she was unwarrantably harsh in her judgment.  If
you examine the books of the fund you will find the
acknowledgment: “Collected by Miss Matilda Cuvering, 2s.
6d.”

The hunting season had come to an end, and the Mullets had not
succeeded in selling the Brogue.  There had been a kind of
tradition in the family for the past three or four years, a sort
of fatalistic hope, that the Brogue would find a purchaser before
the hunting was over; but seasons came and went without anything
happening to justify such ill-founded optimism.  The animal
had been named Berserker in the earlier stages of its career; it
had been rechristened the Brogue later on, in recognition of the
fact that, once acquired, it was extremely difficult to get rid
of.  The unkinder wits of the neighbourhood had been known
to suggest that the first letter of its name was
superfluous.  The Brogue had been variously described in
sale catalogues as a light-weight hunter, a lady’s hack,
and, more simply, but still with a touch of imagination, as a
useful brown gelding, standing 15.1.  Toby Mullet had ridden
him for four seasons with the West Wessex; you can ride almost
any sort of horse with the West Wessex as long as it is an animal
that knows the country.  The Brogue knew the country
intimately, having personally created most of the gaps that were
to be met with in banks and hedges for many miles round. 
His manners and characteristics were not ideal in the hunting
field, but he was probably rather safer to ride to hounds than he
was as a hack on country roads.  According to the Mullet
family, he was not really road-shy, but there were one or two
objects of dislike that brought on sudden attacks of what Toby
called the swerving sickness.  Motors and cycles he treated
with tolerant disregard, but pigs, wheelbarrows, piles of stones
by the roadside, perambulators in a village street, gates painted
too aggressively white, and sometimes, but not always, the newer
kind of beehives, turned him aside from his tracks in vivid
imitation of the zigzag course of forked lightning.  If a
pheasant rose noisily from the other side of a hedgerow the
Brogue would spring into the air at the same moment, but this may
have been due to a desire to be companionable.  The Mullet
family contradicted the widely prevalent report that the horse
was a confirmed crib-biter.

It was about the third week in May that Mrs. Mullet, relict of
the late Sylvester Mullet, and mother of Toby and a bunch of
daughters, assailed Clovis Sangrail on the outskirts of the
village with a breathless catalogue of local happenings.

“You know our new neighbour, Mr. Penricarde?” she
vociferated; “awfully rich, owns tin mines in Cornwall,
middle-aged and rather quiet.  He’s taken the Red
House on a long lease and spent a lot of money on alterations and
improvements.  Well, Toby’s sold him the
Brogue!”

Clovis spent a moment or two in assimilating the astonishing
news; then he broke out into unstinted congratulation.  If
he had belonged to a more emotional race he would probably have
kissed Mrs. Mullet.

“How wonderfully lucky to have pulled it off at
last!  Now you can buy a decent animal.  I’ve
always said that Toby was clever.  Ever so many
congratulations.”

“Don’t congratulate me.  It’s the most
unfortunate thing that could have happened!” said Mrs.
Mullet dramatically.

“Mr. Penricarde,” said Mrs. Mullet, sinking her
voice to what she imagined to be an impressive whisper, though it
rather resembled a hoarse, excited squeak, “Mr. Penricarde
has just begun to pay attentions to Jessie.  Slight at
first, but now unmistakable.  I was a fool not to have seen
it sooner.  Yesterday, at the Rectory garden party, he asked
her what her favourite flowers were, and she told him carnations,
and to-day a whole stack of carnations has arrived, clove and
malmaison and lovely dark red ones, regular exhibition blooms,
and a box of chocolates that he must have got on purpose from
London.  And he’s asked her to go round the links with
him to-morrow.  And now, just at this critical moment, Toby
has sold him that animal.  It’s a calamity!”

“I’ve got a houseful of daughters,” said
Mrs. Mullet, “and I’ve been trying—well, not to
get them off my hands, of course, but a husband or two
wouldn’t be amiss among the lot of them; there are six of
them, you know.”

“I don’t know,” said Clovis,
“I’ve never counted, but I expect you’re right
as to the number; mothers generally know these things.”

“And now,” continued Mrs. Mullet, in her tragic
whisper, “when there’s a rich husband-in-prospect
imminent on the horizon Toby goes and sells him that miserable
animal.  It will probably kill him if he tries to ride it;
anyway it will kill any affection he might have felt towards any
member of our family.  What is to be done?  We
can’t very well ask to have the horse back; you see, we
praised it up like anything when we thought there was a chance of
his buying it, and said it was just the animal to suit
him.”

“Couldn’t you steal it out of his stable and send
it to grass at some farm miles away?” suggested Clovis;
“write ‘Votes for Women’ on the stable door,
and the thing would pass for a Suffragette outrage.  No one
who knew the horse could possibly suspect you of wanting to get
it back again.”

“Every newspaper in the country would ring with the
affair,” said Mrs. Mullet; “can’t you imagine
the headline, ‘Valuable Hunter Stolen by
Suffragettes’?  The police would scour the countryside
till they found the animal.”

“Well, Jessie must try and get it back from Penricarde
on the plea that it’s an old favourite.  She can say
it was only sold because the stable had to be pulled down under
the terms of an old repairing lease, and that now it has been
arranged that the stable is to stand for a couple of years
longer.”

“It sounds a queer proceeding to ask for a horse back
when you’ve just sold him,” said Mrs. Mullet,
“but something must be done, and done at once.  The
man is not used to horses, and I believe I told him it was as
quiet as a lamb.  After all, lambs go kicking and twisting
about as if they were demented, don’t they?”

“It’s all right about the proposal,” she
announced; “he came out with it at the sixth hole.  I
said I must have time to think it over.  I accepted him at
the seventh.”

“My dear,” said her mother, “I think a
little more maidenly reserve and hesitation would have been
advisable, as you’ve known him so short a time.  You
might have waited till the ninth hole.”

“The seventh is a very long hole,” said Jessie;
“besides, the tension was putting us both off our
game.  By the time we’d got to the ninth hole
we’d settled lots of things.  The honeymoon is to be
spent in Corsica, with perhaps a flying visit to Naples if we
feel like it, and a week in London to wind up with.  Two of
his nieces are to be asked to be bridesmaids, so with our lot
there will be seven, which is rather a lucky number.  You
are to wear your pearl grey, with any amount of Honiton lace
jabbed into it.  By the way, he’s coming over this
evening to ask your consent to the whole affair.  So far
all’s well, but about the Brogue it’s a different
matter.  I told him the legend about the stable, and how
keen we were about buying the horse back, but he seems equally
keen on keeping it.  He said he must have horse exercise now
that he’s living in the country, and he’s going to
start riding to-morrow.  He’s ridden a few times in
the Row, on an animal that was accustomed to carry octogenarians
and people undergoing rest cures, and that’s about all his
experience in the saddle—oh, and he rode a pony once in
Norfolk, when he was fifteen and the pony twenty-four; and
to-morrow he’s going to ride the Brogue!  I shall be a
widow before I’m married, and I do so want to see what
Corsica’s like; it looks so silly on the map.”

“Nobody can ride that animal with any safety,”
said Mrs. Mullet, “except Toby, and he knows by long
experience what it is going to shy at, and manages to swerve at
the same time.”

“I did hint to Mr. Penricarde—to Vincent, I should
say—that the Brogue didn’t like white gates,”
said Jessie.

“White gates!” exclaimed Mrs. Mullet; “did
you mention what effect a pig has on him?  He’ll have
to go past Lockyer’s farm to get to the high road, and
there’s sure to be a pig or two grunting about in the
lane.”

“It’s obvious that Penricarde mustn’t be
allowed to go out on that animal,” said Clovis, “at
least not till Jessie has married him, and tired of him.  I
tell you what: ask him to a picnic to-morrow, starting at an
early hour; he’s not the sort to go out for a ride before
breakfast.  The day after I’ll get the rector to drive
him over to Crowleigh before lunch, to see the new cottage
hospital they’re building there.  The Brogue will be
standing idle in the stable and Toby can offer to exercise it;
then it can pick up a stone or something of the sort and go
conveniently lame.  If you hurry on the wedding a bit the
lameness fiction can be kept up till the ceremony is safely
over.”

It was nobody’s fault that the rain came down in
torrents the next morning, making a picnic a fantastic
impossibility.  It was also nobody’s fault, but sheer
ill-luck, that the weather cleared up sufficiently in the
afternoon to tempt Mr. Penricarde to make his first essay with
the Brogue.  They did not get as far as the pigs at
Lockyer’s farm; the rectory gate was painted a dull
unobtrusive green, but it had been white a year or two ago, and
the Brogue never forgot that he had been in the habit of making a
violent curtsey, a back-pedal and a swerve at this particular
point of the road.  Subsequently, there being apparently no
further call on his services, he broke his way into the rectory
orchard, where he found a hen turkey in a coop; later visitors to
the orchard found the coop almost intact, but very little left of
the turkey.

Mr. Penricarde, a little stunned and shaken, and suffering
from a bruised knee and some minor damages, good-naturedly
ascribed the accident to his own inexperience with horses and
country roads, and allowed Jessie to nurse him back into complete
recovery and golf-fitness within something less than a week.

In the list of wedding presents which the local newspaper
published a fortnight or so later appeared the following
item:

“You’ve rather done it, haven’t you?”
he chuckled; “Jane Martlet has only been here five days,
and she never stays less than a fortnight, even when she’s
asked definitely for a week.  You’ll never get her out
of the house by Thursday.”

“Why should I?” asked Mrs. Sangrail; “she
and Dora are good friends, aren’t they?  They used to
be, as far as I remember.”

“They used to be; that’s what makes them all the
more bitter now.  Each feels that she has nursed a viper in
her bosom.  Nothing fans the flame of human resentment so
much as the discovery that one’s bosom has been utilised as
a snake sanatorium.”

“It was a bronze Leghorn or some such exotic breed, and
Dora sold it to Jane at a rather exotic price.  They both go
in for prize poultry, you know, and Jane thought she was going to
get her money back in a large family of pedigree chickens. 
The bird turned out to be an abstainer from the egg habit, and
I’m told that the letters which passed between the two
women were a revelation as to how much invective could be got on
to a sheet of notepaper.”

“People tried,” said Clovis, “but it must
have been rather like composing the storm music of the
‘Fliegende Holländer.’  Jane was willing to
take back some of her most libellous remarks if Dora would take
back the hen, but Dora said that would be owning herself in the
wrong, and you know she’d as soon think of owning slum
property in Whitechapel as do that.”

“It’s a most awkward situation,” said Mrs.
Sangrail.  “Do you suppose they won’t speak to
one another?”

“On the contrary, the difficulty will be to get them to
leave off.  Their remarks on each other’s conduct and
character have hitherto been governed by the fact that only four
ounces of plain speaking can be sent through the post for a
penny.”

“I can’t put Dora off,” said Mrs.
Sangrail.  “I’ve already postponed her visit
once, and nothing short of a miracle would make Jane leave before
her self-allotted fortnight is over.”

“Miracles are rather in my line,” said
Clovis.  “I don’t pretend to be very hopeful in
this case but I’ll do my best.”

“Servants are a bit of a nuisance,” muttered
Clovis, as he sat in the smoking-room after lunch, talking
fitfully to Jane Martlet in the intervals of putting together the
materials of a cocktail, which he had irreverently patented under
the name of an Ella Wheeler Wilcox.  It was partly
compounded of old brandy and partly of curaçoa; there were
other ingredients, but they were never indiscriminately
revealed.

“Servants a nuisance!” exclaimed Jane, bounding
into the topic with the exuberant plunge of a hunter when it
leaves the high road and feels turf under its hoofs; “I
should think they were!  The trouble I’ve had in
getting suited this year you would hardly believe.  But I
don’t see what you have to complain of—your mother is
so wonderfully lucky in her servants.  Sturridge, for
instance—he’s been with you for years, and I’m
sure he’s a paragon as butlers go.”

“That’s just the trouble,” said
Clovis.  “It’s when servants have been with you
for years that they become a really serious nuisance.  The
‘here to-day and gone to-morrow’ sort don’t
matter—you’ve simply got to replace them; it’s
the stayers and the paragons that are the real worry.”

“That doesn’t prevent them from giving
trouble.  Now, you’ve mentioned Sturridge—it was
Sturridge I was particularly thinking of when I made the
observation about servants being a nuisance.”

“I know he’s excellent, and we just couldn’t
get along without him; he’s the one reliable element in
this rather haphazard household.  But his very orderliness
has had an effect on him.  Have you ever considered what it
must be like to go on unceasingly doing the correct thing in the
correct manner in the same surroundings for the greater part of a
lifetime?  To know and ordain and superintend exactly what
silver and glass and table linen shall be used and set out on
what occasions, to have cellar and pantry and plate-cupboard
under a minutely devised and undeviating administration, to be
noiseless, impalpable, omnipresent, and, as far as your own
department is concerned, omniscient?”

“On most points he’s thoroughly sane and
reliable,” said Clovis, “but at times he is subject
to the most obstinate delusions, and on those occasions he
becomes not merely a nuisance but a decided
embarrassment.”

“Unfortunately they usually centre round one of the
guests of the house party, and that is where the awkwardness
comes in.  For instance, he took it into his head that
Matilda Sheringham was the Prophet Elijah, and as all that he
remembered about Elijah’s history was the episode of the
ravens in the wilderness he absolutely declined to interfere with
what he imagined to be Matilda’s private catering
arrangements, wouldn’t allow any tea to be sent up to her
in the morning, and if he was waiting at table he passed her over
altogether in handing round the dishes.”

“Oh, Matilda got fed, after a fashion, but it was judged
to be best for her to cut her visit short.  It was really
the only thing to be done,” said Clovis with some
emphasis.

“I shouldn’t have done that,” said Jane,
“I should have humoured him in some way.  I certainly
shouldn’t have gone away.”

“It is not always wise to humour people when they get
these ideas into their heads.  There’s no knowing to
what lengths they may go if you encourage them.”

“One can never be certain,” said Clovis;
“now and then he gets some idea about a guest which might
take an unfortunate turn.  That is precisely what is
worrying me at the present moment.”

“What, has he taken a fancy about some one here
now?” asked Jane excitedly; “how thrilling!  Do
tell me who it is.”

“Queen Anne!  What an idea.  But, anyhow,
there’s nothing dangerous about her; she’s such a
colourless personality.”

“Ghost?  Dear no.  No one ever heard of a
ghost that came down to breakfast and ate kidneys and toast and
honey with a healthy appetite.  No, it’s the fact of
you being so very much alive and flourishing that perplexes and
annoys him.  All his life he has been accustomed to look on
Queen Anne as the personification of everything that is dead and
done with, ‘as dead as Queen Anne,’ you know; and now
he has to fill your glass at lunch and dinner and listen to your
accounts of the gay time you had at the Dublin Horse Show, and
naturally he feels that something’s very wrong with
you.”

“I didn’t get really alarmed about it till lunch
to-day,” said Clovis; “I caught him glowering at you
with a very sinister look and muttering: ‘Ought to be dead
long ago, she ought, and some one should see to it.’ 
That’s why I mentioned the matter to you.”

“My mother mustn’t hear a word about it,”
said Clovis earnestly; “it would upset her
dreadfully.  She relies on Sturridge for
everything.”

“You’ll have to keep a sharp look-out all the time
and be on your guard to frustrate any murderous attack,”
said Jane, adding in a tone of weak obstinacy: “It’s
a dreadful situation to be in, with a mad butler dangling over
you like the sword of What’s-his-name, but I’m
certainly not going to cut my visit short.”

It was in the hall the next morning after a late breakfast
that Clovis had his final inspiration as he stood engaged in
coaxing rust spots from an old putter.

“Writing letters in the morning-room, sir,” said
Sturridge, announcing a fact of which his questioner was already
aware.

“She wants to copy the inscription on that old
basket-hilted sabre,” said Clovis, pointing to a venerable
weapon hanging on the wall.  “I wish you’d take
it to her; my hands are all over oil.  Take it without the
sheath, it will be less trouble.”

The butler drew the blade, still keen and bright in its
well-cared for old age, and carried it into the
morning-room.  There was a door near the writing-table
leading to a back stairway; Jane vanished through it with such
lightning rapidity that the butler doubted whether she had seen
him come in.  Half an hour later Clovis was driving her and
her hastily-packed luggage to the station.

“Mother will be awfully vexed when she comes back from
her ride and finds you have gone,” he observed to the
departing guest, “but I’ll make up some story about
an urgent wire having called you away.  It wouldn’t do
to alarm her unnecessarily about Sturridge.”

Jane sniffed slightly at Clovis’ ideas of unnecessary
alarm, and was almost rude to the young man who came round with
thoughtful inquiries as to luncheon-baskets.

The miracle lost some of its usefulness from the fact that
Dora wrote the same day postponing the date of her visit, but, at
any rate, Clovis holds the record as the only human being who
ever hustled Jane Martlet out of the time-table of her
migrations.

“My aunt will be down presently, Mr. Nuttel,” said
a very self-possessed young lady of fifteen; “in the
meantime you must try and put up with me.”

Framton Nuttel endeavoured to say the correct something which
should duly flatter the niece of the moment without unduly
discounting the aunt that was to come.  Privately he doubted
more than ever whether these formal visits on a succession of
total strangers would do much towards helping the nerve cure
which he was supposed to be undergoing.

“I know how it will be,” his sister had said when
he was preparing to migrate to this rural retreat; “you
will bury yourself down there and not speak to a living soul, and
your nerves will be worse than ever from moping.  I shall
just give you letters of introduction to all the people I know
there.  Some of them, as far as I can remember, were quite
nice.”

Framton wondered whether Mrs. Sappleton, the lady to whom he
was presenting one of the letters of introduction, came into the
nice division.

“Do you know many of the people round here?” asked
the niece, when she judged that they had had sufficient silent
communion.

“Hardly a soul,” said Framton.  “My
sister was staying here, at the rectory, you know, some four
years ago, and she gave me letters of introduction to some of the
people here.”

“Only her name and address,” admitted the
caller.  He was wondering whether Mrs. Sappleton was in the
married or widowed state.  An undefinable something about
the room seemed to suggest masculine habitation.

“Her great tragedy happened just three years ago,”
said the child; “that would be since your sister’s
time.”

“You may wonder why we keep that window wide open on an
October afternoon,” said the niece, indicating a large
French window that opened on to a lawn.

“It is quite warm for the time of the year,” said
Framton; “but has that window got anything to do with the
tragedy?”

“Out through that window, three years ago to a day, her
husband and her two young brothers went off for their day’s
shooting.  They never came back.  In crossing the moor
to their favourite snipe-shooting ground they were all three
engulfed in a treacherous piece of bog.  It had been that
dreadful wet summer, you know, and places that were safe in other
years gave way suddenly without warning.  Their bodies were
never recovered.  That was the dreadful part of
it.”  Here the child’s voice lost its
self-possessed note and became falteringly human. 
“Poor aunt always thinks that they will come back some day,
they and the little brown spaniel that was lost with them, and
walk in at that window just as they used to do.  That is why
the window is kept open every evening till it is quite
dusk.  Poor dear aunt, she has often told me how they went
out, her husband with his white waterproof coat over his arm, and
Ronnie, her youngest brother, singing ‘Bertie, why do you
bound?’ as he always did to tease her, because she said it
got on her nerves.  Do you know, sometimes on still, quiet
evenings like this, I almost get a creepy feeling that they will
all walk in through that window—”

She broke off with a little shudder.  It was a relief to
Framton when the aunt bustled into the room with a whirl of
apologies for being late in making her appearance.

“I hope you don’t mind the open window,”
said Mrs. Sappleton briskly; “my husband and brothers will
be home directly from shooting, and they always come in this
way.  They’ve been out for snipe in the marshes
to-day, so they’ll make a fine mess over my poor
carpets.  So like you men-folk, isn’t it?”

She rattled on cheerfully about the shooting and the scarcity
of birds, and the prospects for duck in the winter.  To
Framton it was all purely horrible.  He made a desperate but
only partially successful effort to turn the talk on to a less
ghastly topic; he was conscious that his hostess was giving him
only a fragment of her attention, and her eyes were constantly
straying past him to the open window and the lawn beyond. 
It was certainly an unfortunate coincidence that he should have
paid his visit on this tragic anniversary.

“The doctors agree in ordering me complete rest, an
absence of mental excitement, and avoidance of anything in the
nature of violent physical exercise,” announced Framton,
who laboured under the tolerably widespread delusion that total
strangers and chance acquaintances are hungry for the least
detail of one’s ailments and infirmities, their cause and
cure.  “On the matter of diet they are not so much in
agreement,” he continued.

“No?” said Mrs. Sappleton, in a voice which only
replaced a yawn at the last moment.  Then she suddenly
brightened into alert attention—but not to what Framton was
saying.

“Here they are at last!” she cried. 
“Just in time for tea, and don’t they look as if they
were muddy up to the eyes!”

Framton shivered slightly and turned towards the niece with a
look intended to convey sympathetic comprehension.  The
child was staring out through the open window with dazed horror
in her eyes.  In a chill shock of nameless fear Framton
swung round in his seat and looked in the same direction.

In the deepening twilight three figures were walking across
the lawn towards the window; they all carried guns under their
arms, and one of them was additionally burdened with a white coat
hung over his shoulders.  A tired brown spaniel kept close
at their heels.  Noiselessly they neared the house, and then
a hoarse young voice chanted out of the dusk: “I said,
Bertie, why do you bound?”

Framton grabbed wildly at his stick and hat; the hall-door,
the gravel-drive, and the front gate were dimly-noted stages in
his headlong retreat.  A cyclist coming along the road had
to run into the hedge to avoid an imminent collision.

“Here we are, my dear,” said the bearer of the
white mackintosh, coming in through the window; “fairly
muddy, but most of it’s dry.  Who was that who bolted
out as we came up?”

“A most extraordinary man, a Mr. Nuttel,” said
Mrs. Sappleton; “could only talk about his illnesses, and
dashed off without a word of good-bye or apology when you
arrived.  One would think he had seen a ghost.”

“I expect it was the spaniel,” said the niece
calmly; “he told me he had a horror of dogs.  He was
once hunted into a cemetery somewhere on the banks of the Ganges
by a pack of pariah dogs, and had to spend the night in a newly
dug grave with the creatures snarling and grinning and foaming
just above him.  Enough to make anyone lose their
nerve.”

The great galleon lay in semi-retirement under the sand and
weed and water of the northern bay where the fortune of war and
weather had long ago ensconced it.  Three and a quarter
centuries had passed since the day when it had taken the high
seas as an important unit of a fighting squadron—precisely
which squadron the learned were not agreed.  The galleon had
brought nothing into the world, but it had, according to
tradition and report, taken much out of it.  But how
much?  There again the learned were in disagreement. 
Some were as generous in their estimate as an income-tax
assessor, others applied a species of higher criticism to the
submerged treasure chests, and debased their contents to the
currency of goblin gold.  Of the former school was Lulu,
Duchess of Dulverton.

The Duchess was not only a believer in the existence of a
sunken treasure of alluring proportions; she also believed that
she knew of a method by which the said treasure might be
precisely located and cheaply disembedded.  An aunt on her
mother’s side of the family had been Maid of Honour at the
Court of Monaco, and had taken a respectful interest in the
deep-sea researches in which the Throne of that country,
impatient perhaps of its terrestrial restrictions, was wont to
immerse itself.  It was through the instrumentality of this
relative that the Duchess learned of an invention, perfected and
very nearly patented by a Monegaskan savant, by means of which
the home-life of the Mediterranean sardine might be studied at a
depth of many fathoms in a cold white light of more than
ball-room brilliancy.  Implicated in this invention (and, in
the Duchess’s eyes, the most attractive part of it) was an
electric suction dredge, specially designed for dragging to the
surface such objects of interest and value as might be found in
the more accessible levels of the ocean-bed.  The rights of
the invention were to be acquired for a matter of eighteen
hundred francs, and the apparatus for a few thousand more. 
The Duchess of Dulverton was rich, as the world counted wealth;
she nursed the hope, of being one day rich at her own
computation.  Companies had been formed and efforts had been
made again and again during the course of three centuries to
probe for the alleged treasures of the interesting galleon; with
the aid of this invention she considered that she might go to
work on the wreck privately and independently.  After all,
one of her ancestors on her mother’s side was descended
from Medina Sidonia, so she was of opinion that she had as much
right to the treasure as anyone.  She acquired the invention
and bought the apparatus.

Among other family ties and encumbrances, Lulu possessed a
nephew, Vasco Honiton, a young gentleman who was blessed with a
small income and a large circle of relatives, and lived
impartially and precariously on both.  The name Vasco had
been given him possibly in the hope that he might live up to its
adventurous tradition, but he limited himself strictly to the
home industry of adventurer, preferring to exploit the assured
rather than to explore the unknown.  Lulu’s
intercourse with him had been restricted of recent years to the
negative processes of being out of town when he called on her,
and short of money when he wrote to her.  Now, however, she
bethought herself of his eminent suitability for the direction of
a treasure-seeking experiment; if anyone could extract gold from
an unpromising situation it would certainly be Vasco—of
course, under the necessary safeguards in the way of
supervision.  Where money was in question Vasco’s
conscience was liable to fits of obstinate silence.

Somewhere on the west coast of Ireland the Dulverton property
included a few acres of shingle, rock, and heather, too barren to
support even an agrarian outrage, but embracing a small and
fairly deep bay where the lobster yield was good in most
seasons.  There was a bleak little house on the property,
and for those who liked lobsters and solitude, and were able to
accept an Irish cook’s ideas as to what might be
perpetrated in the name of mayonnaise, Innisgluther was a
tolerable exile during the summer months.  Lulu seldom went
there herself, but she lent the house lavishly to friends and
relations.  She put it now at Vasco’s disposal.

“It will be the very place to practise and experiment
with the salvage apparatus,” she said; “the bay is
quite deep in places, and you will be able to test everything
thoroughly before starting on the treasure hunt.”

“The apparatus works beautifully,” he informed his
aunt; “the deeper one got the clearer everything
grew.  We found something in the way of a sunken wreck to
operate on, too!”

“No! really?” said Lulu; “poor Billy
Yuttley’s boat.  I remember it went down somewhere off
that coast some three years ago.  His body was washed ashore
at the Point.  People said at the time that the boat was
capsized intentionally—a case of suicide, you know. 
People always say that sort of thing when anything tragic
happens.”

“In a locker of the Sub-Rosa I found a
water-tight strong-box.  It contained papers.” 
Vasco paused with dramatic effect and searched for a moment in
the inner breast-pocket of his coat.  He drew out a folded
slip of paper.  The Duchess snatched at it in almost
indecent haste and moved appreciably nearer the fireplace.

“Oh no,” said Vasco carelessly, “that is a
list of the well-known people who would be involved in a very
disagreeable scandal if the Sub-Rosa’s papers were
made public.  I’ve put you at the head of it,
otherwise it follows alphabetical order.”

The Duchess gazed helplessly at the string of names, which
seemed for the moment to include nearly every one she knew. 
As a matter of fact, her own name at the head of the list
exercised an almost paralysing effect on her thinking
faculties.

“Of course you have destroyed the papers?” she
asked, when she had somewhat recovered herself.  She was
conscious that she made the remark with an entire lack of
conviction.

“Then you should put them out of harm’s way at
once.  Supposing anything should leak out, think of all
these poor, unfortunate people who would be involved in the
disclosures,” and Lulu tapped the list with an agitated
gesture.

“Unfortunate, perhaps, but not poor,” corrected
Vasco; “if you read the list carefully you’ll notice
that I haven’t troubled to include anyone whose financial
standing isn’t above question.”

Lulu glared at her nephew for some moments in silence. 
Then she asked hoarsely: “What are you going to
do?”

“Nothing—for the remainder of my life,” he
answered meaningly.  “A little hunting,
perhaps,” he continued, “and I shall have a villa at
Florence.  The Villa Sub-Rosa would sound rather quaint and
picturesque, don’t you think, and quite a lot of people
would be able to attach a meaning to the name.  And I
suppose I must have a hobby; I shall probably collect
Raeburns.”

Lulu’s relative, who lived at the Court of Monaco, got
quite a snappish answer when she wrote recommending some further
invention in the realm of marine research.

The farmhouse kitchen probably stood where it did as a matter
of accident or haphazard choice; yet its situation might have
been planned by a master-strategist in farmhouse
architecture.  Dairy and poultry-yard, and herb garden, and
all the busy places of the farm seemed to lead by easy access
into its wide flagged haven, where there was room for everything
and where muddy boots left traces that were easily swept
away.  And yet, for all that it stood so well in the centre
of human bustle, its long, latticed window, with the wide
window-seat, built into an embrasure beyond the huge fireplace,
looked out on a wild spreading view of hill and heather and
wooded combe.  The window nook made almost a little room in
itself, quite the pleasantest room in the farm as far as
situation and capabilities went.  Young Mrs. Ladbruk, whose
husband had just come into the farm by way of inheritance, cast
covetous eyes on this snug corner, and her fingers itched to make
it bright and cosy with chintz curtains and bowls of flowers, and
a shelf or two of old china.  The musty farm parlour,
looking out on to a prim, cheerless garden imprisoned within
high, blank walls, was not a room that lent itself readily either
to comfort or decoration.

“When we are more settled I shall work wonders in the
way of making the kitchen habitable,” said the young woman
to her occasional visitors.  There was an unspoken wish in
those words, a wish which was unconfessed as well as
unspoken.  Emma Ladbruk was the mistress of the farm;
jointly with her husband she might have her say, and to a certain
extent her way, in ordering its affairs.  But she was not
mistress of the kitchen.

On one of the shelves of an old dresser, in company with
chipped sauce-boats, pewter jugs, cheese-graters, and paid bills,
rested a worn and ragged Bible, on whose front page was the
record, in faded ink, of a baptism dated ninety-four years
ago.  “Martha Crale” was the name written on
that yellow page.  The yellow, wrinkled old dame who hobbled
and muttered about the kitchen, looking like a dead autumn leaf
which the winter winds still pushed hither and thither, had once
been Martha Crale; for seventy odd years she had been Martha
Mountjoy.  For longer than anyone could remember she had
pattered to and fro between oven and wash-house and dairy, and
out to chicken-run and garden, grumbling and muttering and
scolding, but working unceasingly.  Emma Ladbruk, of whose
coming she took as little notice as she would of a bee wandering
in at a window on a summer’s day, used at first to watch
her with a kind of frightened curiosity.  She was so old and
so much a part of the place, it was difficult to think of her
exactly as a living thing.  Old Shep, the white-nozzled,
stiff-limbed collie, waiting for his time to die, seemed almost
more human than the withered, dried-up old woman.  He had
been a riotous, roystering puppy, mad with the joy of life, when
she was already a tottering, hobbling dame; now he was just a
blind, breathing carcase, nothing more, and she still worked with
frail energy, still swept and baked and washed, fetched and
carried.  If there were something in these wise old dogs
that did not perish utterly with death, Emma used to think to
herself, what generations of ghost-dogs there must be out on
those hills, that Martha had reared and fed and tended and spoken
a last good-bye word to in that old kitchen.  And what
memories she must have of human generations that had passed away
in her time.  It was difficult for anyone, let alone a
stranger like Emma, to get her to talk of the days that had been;
her shrill, quavering speech was of doors that had been left
unfastened, pails that had got mislaid, calves whose feeding-time
was overdue, and the various little faults and lapses that
chequer a farmhouse routine.  Now and again, when election
time came round, she would unstore her recollections of the old
names round which the fight had waged in the days gone by. 
There had been a Palmerston, that had been a name down Tiverton
way; Tiverton was not a far journey as the crow flies, but to
Martha it was almost a foreign country.  Later there had
been Northcotes and Aclands, and many other newer names that she
had forgotten; the names changed, but it was always Libruls and
Toories, Yellows and Blues.  And they always quarrelled and
shouted as to who was right and who was wrong.  The one they
quarrelled about most was a fine old gentleman with an angry
face—she had seen his picture on the walls.  She had
seen it on the floor too, with a rotten apple squashed over it,
for the farm had changed its politics from time to time. 
Martha had never been on one side or the other; none of
“they” had ever done the farm a stroke of good. 
Such was her sweeping verdict, given with all a peasant’s
distrust of the outside world.

When the half-frightened curiosity had somewhat faded away,
Emma Ladbruk was uncomfortably conscious of another feeling
towards the old woman.  She was a quaint old tradition,
lingering about the place, she was part and parcel of the farm
itself, she was something at once pathetic and
picturesque—but she was dreadfully in the way.  Emma
had come to the farm full of plans for little reforms and
improvements, in part the result of training in the newest ways
and methods, in part the outcome of her own ideas and
fancies.  Reforms in the kitchen region, if those deaf old
ears could have been induced to give them even a hearing, would
have met with short shrift and scornful rejection, and the
kitchen region spread over the zone of dairy and market business
and half the work of the household.  Emma, with the latest
science of dead-poultry dressing at her finger-tips, sat by, an
unheeded watcher, while old Martha trussed the chickens for the
market-stall as she had trussed them for nearly fourscore
years—all leg and no breast.  And the hundred hints
anent effective cleaning and labour-lightening and the things
that make for wholesomeness which the young woman was ready to
impart or to put into action dropped away into nothingness before
that wan, muttering, unheeding presence.  Above all, the
coveted window corner, that was to be a dainty, cheerful oasis in
the gaunt old kitchen, stood now choked and lumbered with a
litter of odds and ends that Emma, for all her nominal authority,
would not have dared or cared to displace; over them seemed to be
spun the protection of something that was like a human
cobweb.  Decidedly Martha was in the way.  It would
have been an unworthy meanness to have wished to see the span of
that brave old life shortened by a few paltry months, but as the
days sped by Emma was conscious that the wish was there, disowned
though it might be, lurking at the back of her mind.

She felt the meanness of the wish come over her with a qualm
of self-reproach one day when she came into the kitchen and found
an unaccustomed state of things in that usually busy
quarter.  Old Martha was not working.  A basket of corn
was on the floor by her side, and out in the yard the poultry
were beginning to clamour a protest of overdue
feeding-time.  But Martha sat huddled in a shrunken bunch on
the window seat, looking out with her dim old eyes as though she
saw something stranger than the autumn landscape.

“’Tis death, ’tis death a-coming,”
answered the quavering voice; “I knew ’twere
coming.  I knew it.  ’Tweren’t for nothing
that old Shep’s been howling all morning.  An’
last night I heard the screech-owl give the death-cry, and there
were something white as run across the yard yesterday;
’tweren’t a cat nor a stoat, ’twere
something.  The fowls knew ’twere something; they all
drew off to one side.  Ay, there’s been
warnings.  I knew it were a-coming.”

The young woman’s eyes clouded with pity.  The old
thing sitting there so white and shrunken had once been a merry,
noisy child, playing about in lanes and hay-lofts and farmhouse
garrets; that had been eighty odd years ago, and now she was just
a frail old body cowering under the approaching chill of the
death that was coming at last to take her.  It was not
probable that much could be done for her, but Emma hastened away
to get assistance and counsel.  Her husband, she knew, was
down at a tree-felling some little distance off, but she might
find some other intelligent soul who knew the old woman better
than she did.  The farm, she soon found out, had that
faculty common to farmyards of swallowing up and losing its human
population.  The poultry followed her in interested fashion,
and swine grunted interrogations at her from behind the bars of
their styes, but barnyard and rickyard, orchard and stables and
dairy, gave no reward to her search.  Then, as she retraced
her steps towards the kitchen, she came suddenly on her cousin,
young Mr. Jim, as every one called him, who divided his time
between amateur horse-dealing, rabbit-shooting, and flirting with
the farm maids.

“I’m afraid old Martha is dying,” said
Emma.  Jim was not the sort of person to whom one had to
break news gently.

“She may be actually dying at this moment, or it may
just be the beginning of the break-up,” persisted Emma,
with a feeling of contempt for the slowness and dulness of the
young man.

“It don’t look like it,” he said, nodding
towards the yard.  Emma turned to catch the meaning of his
remark.  Old Martha stood in the middle of a mob of poultry
scattering handfuls of grain around her.  The turkey-cock,
with the bronzed sheen of his feathers and the purple-red of his
wattles, the gamecock, with the glowing metallic lustre of his
Eastern plumage, the hens, with their ochres and buffs and umbers
and their scarlet combs, and the drakes, with their bottle-green
heads, made a medley of rich colour, in the centre of which the
old woman looked like a withered stalk standing amid a riotous
growth of gaily-hued flowers.  But she threw the grain
deftly amid the wilderness of beaks, and her quavering voice
carried as far as the two people who were watching her.  She
was still harping on the theme of death coming to the farm.

“’Tis young Mister Ladbruk,” she shrilled
back; “they’ve just a-carried his body in.  Run
out of the way of a tree that was coming down an’ ran
hisself on to an iron post.  Dead when they picked un
up.  Aye, I knew ’twere coming.”

And she turned to fling a handful of barley at a belated group
of guinea-fowl that came racing toward her.

The farm was a family property, and passed to the
rabbit-shooting cousin as the next-of-kin.  Emma Ladbruk
drifted out of its history as a bee that had wandered in at an
open window might flit its way out again.  On a cold grey
morning she stood waiting, with her boxes already stowed in the
farm cart, till the last of the market produce should be ready,
for the train she was to catch was of less importance than the
chickens and butter and eggs that were to be offered for
sale.  From where she stood she could see an angle of the
long latticed window that was to have been cosy with curtains and
gay with bowls of flowers.  Into her mind came the thought
that for months, perhaps for years, long after she had been
utterly forgotten, a white, unheeding face would be seen peering
out through those latticed panes, and a weak muttering voice
would be heard quavering up and down those flagged
passages.  She made her way to a narrow barred casement that
opened into the farm larder.  Old Martha was standing at a
table trussing a pair of chickens for the market stall as she had
trussed them for nearly fourscore years.

“I’ve asked Latimer Springfield to spend Sunday
with us and stop the night,” announced Mrs. Durmot at the
breakfast-table.

“Exactly; the poll is on Wednesday, and the poor man
will have worked himself to a shadow by that time.  Imagine
what electioneering must be like in this awful soaking rain,
going along slushy country roads and speaking to damp audiences
in draughty schoolrooms, day after day for a fortnight. 
He’ll have to put in an appearance at some place of worship
on Sunday morning, and he can come to us immediately afterwards
and have a thorough respite from everything connected with
politics.  I won’t let him even think of them. 
I’ve had the picture of Cromwell dissolving the Long
Parliament taken down from the staircase, and even the portrait
of Lord Rosebery’s ‘Ladas’ removed from the
smoking-room.  And Vera,” added Mrs. Durmot, turning
to her sixteen-year-old niece, “be careful what colour
ribbon you wear in your hair; not blue or yellow on any account;
those are the rival party colours, and emerald green or orange
would be almost as bad, with this Home Rule business to the
fore.”

Latimer Springfield was a rather cheerless, oldish young man,
who went into politics somewhat in the spirit in which other
people might go into half-mourning.  Without being an
enthusiast, however, he was a fairly strenuous plodder, and Mrs.
Durmot had been reasonably near the mark in asserting that he was
working at high pressure over this election.  The restful
lull which his hostess enforced on him was decidedly welcome, and
yet the nervous excitement of the contest had too great a hold on
him to be totally banished.

“I know he’s going to sit up half the night
working up points for his final speeches,” said Mrs. Durmot
regretfully; “however, we’ve kept politics at
arm’s length all the afternoon and evening.  More than
that we cannot do.”

Latimer had scarcely shut his bedroom door before he was
immersed in a sheaf of notes and pamphlets, while a fountain-pen
and pocket-book were brought into play for the due marshalling of
useful facts and discreet fictions.  He had been at work for
perhaps thirty-five minutes, and the house was seemingly
consecrated to the healthy slumber of country life, when a
stifled squealing and scuffling in the passage was followed by a
loud tap at his door.  Before he had time to answer, a
much-encumbered Vera burst into the room with the question;
“I say, can I leave these here?”

Latimer was moderately fond of animals, and particularly
interested in small livestock rearing from the economic point of
view; in fact, one of the pamphlets on which he was at that
moment engaged warmly advocated the further development of the
pig and poultry industry in our rural districts; but he was
pardonably unwilling to share even a commodious bedroom with
samples of henroost and stye products.

“Wouldn’t they be happier somewhere
outside?” he asked, tactfully expressing his own preference
in the matter in an apparent solicitude for theirs.

“There is no outside,” said Vera impressively,
“nothing but a waste of dark, swirling waters.  The
reservoir at Brinkley has burst.”

“Well, there isn’t now, it’s jolly well all
over the place, and as we stand particularly low we’re the
centre of an inland sea just at present.  You see the river
has overflowed its banks as well.”

“Heaps, I should say.  The second housemaid has
already identified three bodies that have floated past the
billiard-room window as being the young man she’s engaged
to.  Either she’s engaged to a large assortment of the
population round here or else she’s very careless at
identification.  Of course it may be the same body coming
round again and again in a swirl; I hadn’t thought of
that.”

“But we ought to go out and do rescue work,
oughtn’t we?” said Latimer, with the instinct of a
Parliamentary candidate for getting into the local limelight.

“We can’t,” said Vera decidedly, “we
haven’t any boats and we’re cut off by a raging
torrent from any human habitation.  My aunt particularly
hoped you would keep to your room and not add to the confusion,
but she thought it would be so kind of you if you would take in
Hartlepool’s Wonder, the gamecock, you know, for the
night.  You see, there are eight other gamecocks, and they
fight like furies if they get together, so we’re putting
one in each bedroom.  The fowl-houses are all flooded out,
you know.  And then I thought perhaps you wouldn’t
mind taking in this wee piggie; he’s rather a little love,
but he has a vile temper.  He gets that from his
mother—not that I like to say things against her when
she’s lying dead and drowned in her stye, poor thing. 
What he really wants is a man’s firm hand to keep him in
order.  I’d try and grapple with him myself, only
I’ve got my chow in my room, you know, and he goes for pigs
wherever he finds them.”

“Couldn’t the pig go in the bathroom?” asked
Latimer faintly, wishing that he had taken up as determined a
stand on the subject of bedroom swine as the chow had.

“The bathroom?” Vera laughed shrilly. 
“It’ll be full of Boy Scouts till morning if the hot
water holds out.”

“Yes, thirty of them came to rescue us while the water
was only waist-high; then it rose another three feet or so and we
had to rescue them.  We’re giving them hot baths in
batches and drying their clothes in the hot-air cupboard, but, of
course, drenched clothes don’t dry in a minute, and the
corridor and staircase are beginning to look like a bit of coast
scenery by Tuke.  Two of the boys are wearing your Melton
overcoat; I hope you don’t mind.”

“You’ll take every care of Hartlepool’s
Wonder, won’t you?” said Vera.  “His
mother took three firsts at Birmingham, and he was second in the
cockerel class last year at Gloucester.  He’ll
probably roost on the rail at the bottom of your bed.  I
wonder if he’d feel more at home if some of his wives were
up here with him?  The hens are all in the pantry, and I
think I could pick out Hartlepool Helen; she’s his
favourite.”

Latimer showed a belated firmness on the subject of Hartlepool
Helen, and Vera withdrew without pressing the point, having first
settled the gamecock on his extemporised perch and taken an
affectionate farewell of the pigling.  Latimer undressed and
got into bed with all due speed, judging that the pig would abate
its inquisitorial restlessness once the light was turned
out.  As a substitute for a cosy, straw-bedded sty the room
offered, at first inspection, few attractions, but the
disconsolate animal suddenly discovered an appliance in which the
most luxuriously contrived piggeries were notably
deficient.  The sharp edge of the underneath part of the bed
was pitched at exactly the right elevation to permit the pigling
to scrape himself ecstatically backwards and forwards, with an
artistic humping of the back at the crucial moment and an
accompanying gurgle of long-drawn delight.  The gamecock,
who may have fancied that he was being rocked in the branches of
a pine-tree, bore the motion with greater fortitude than Latimer
was able to command.  A series of slaps directed at the
pig’s body were accepted more as an additional and pleasing
irritant than as a criticism of conduct or a hint to desist;
evidently something more than a man’s firm hand was needed
to deal with the case.  Latimer slipped out of bed in search
of a weapon of dissuasion.  There was sufficient light in
the room to enable the pig to detect this manœuvre, and the
vile temper, inherited from the drowned mother, found full
play.  Latimer bounded back into bed, and his conqueror,
after a few threatening snorts and champings of its jaws, resumed
its massage operations with renewed zeal.  During the long
wakeful hours which ensued Latimer tried to distract his mind
from his own immediate troubles by dwelling with decent sympathy
on the second housemaid’s bereavement, but he found himself
more often wondering how many Boy Scouts were sharing his Melton
overcoat.  The rôle of Saint Martin malgré lui
was not one which appealed to him.

Towards dawn the pigling fell into a happy slumber, and
Latimer might have followed its example, but at about the same
time Stupor Hartlepooli gave a rousing crow, clattered down to
the floor and forthwith commenced a spirited combat with his
reflection in the wardrobe mirror.  Remembering that the
bird was more or less under his care Latimer performed Hague
Tribunal offices by draping a bath-towel over the provocative
mirror, but the ensuing peace was local and short-lived. 
The deflected energies of the gamecock found new outlet in a
sudden and sustained attack on the sleeping and temporarily
inoffensive pigling, and the duel which followed was desperate
and embittered beyond any possibility of effective
intervention.  The feathered combatant had the advantage of
being able, when hard pressed, to take refuge on the bed, and
freely availed himself of this circumstance; the pigling never
quite succeeded in hurling himself on to the same eminence, but
it was not from want of trying.

Neither side could claim any decisive success, and the
struggle had been practically fought to a standstill by the time
that the maid appeared with the early morning tea.

The pigling, as though aware that it might have outstayed its
welcome, dashed out at the door, and the gamecock followed it at
a more dignified pace.

“If Miss Vera’s dog sees that pig—!”
exclaimed the maid, and hurried off to avert such a
catastrophe.

A cold suspicion was stealing over Latimer’s mind; he
went to the window and drew up the blind.  A light,
drizzling rain was falling, but there was not the faintest trace
of any inundation.

“I should not like to think of you as a deliberate
liar,” he observed coldly, “but one occasionally has
to do things one does not like.”

The season of strikes seemed to have run itself to a
standstill.  Almost every trade and industry and calling in
which a dislocation could possibly be engineered had indulged in
that luxury.  The last and least successful convulsion had
been the strike of the World’s Union of Zoological Garden
attendants, who, pending the settlement of certain demands,
refused to minister further to the wants of the animals committed
to their charge or to allow any other keepers to take their
place.  In this case the threat of the Zoological Gardens
authorities that if the men “came out” the animals
should come out also had intensified and precipitated the
crisis.  The imminent prospect of the larger carnivores, to
say nothing of rhinoceroses and bull bison, roaming at large and
unfed in the heart of London, was not one which permitted of
prolonged conferences.  The Government of the day, which
from its tendency to be a few hours behind the course of events
had been nicknamed the Government of the afternoon, was obliged
to intervene with promptitude and decision.  A strong force
of Bluejackets was despatched to Regent’s Park to take over
the temporarily abandoned duties of the strikers. 
Bluejackets were chosen in preference to land forces, partly on
account of the traditional readiness of the British Navy to go
anywhere and do anything, partly by reason of the familiarity of
the average sailor with monkeys, parrots, and other tropical
fauna, but chiefly at the urgent request of the First Lord of the
Admiralty, who was keenly desirous of an opportunity for
performing some personal act of unobtrusive public service within
the province of his department.

“If he insists on feeding the infant jaguar himself, in
defiance of its mother’s wishes, there may be another
by-election in the north,” said one of his colleagues, with
a hopeful inflection in his voice.  “By-elections are
not very desirable at present, but we must not be
selfish.”

As a matter of fact the strike collapsed peacefully without
any outside intervention.  The majority of the keepers had
become so attached to their charges that they returned to work of
their own accord.

And then the nation and the newspapers turned with a sense of
relief to happier things.  It seemed as if a new era of
contentment was about to dawn.  Everybody had struck who
could possibly want to strike or who could possibly be cajoled or
bullied into striking, whether they wanted to or not.  The
lighter and brighter side of life might now claim some
attention.  And conspicuous among the other topics that
sprang into sudden prominence was the pending Falvertoon divorce
suit.

The Duke of Falvertoon was one of those human hors
d’œuvres that stimulate the public appetite for
sensation without giving it much to feed on.  As a mere
child he had been precociously brilliant; he had declined the
editorship of the Anglian Review at an age when most boys
are content to have declined mensa, a table, and though he
could not claim to have originated the Futurist movement in
literature, his “Letters to a possible Grandson,”
written at the age of fourteen, had attracted considerable
notice.  In later days his brilliancy had been less
conspicuously displayed.  During a debate in the House of
Lords on affairs in Morocco, at a moment when that country, for
the fifth time in seven years, had brought half Europe to the
verge of war, he had interpolated the remark “a little Moor
and how much it is,” but in spite of the encouraging
reception accorded to this one political utterance he was never
tempted to a further display in that direction.  It began to
be generally understood that he did not intend to supplement his
numerous town and country residences by living overmuch in the
public eye.

And then had come the unlooked-for tidings of the imminent
proceedings for divorce.  And such a divorce!  There
were cross-suits and allegations and counter-allegations, charges
of cruelty and desertion, everything in fact that was necessary
to make the case one of the most complicated and sensational of
its kind.  And the number of distinguished people involved
or cited as witnesses not only embraced both political parties in
the realm and several Colonial governors, but included an exotic
contingent from France, Hungary, the United States of North
America, and the Grand Duchy of Baden.  Hotel accommodation
of the more expensive sort began to experience a strain on its
resources.  “It will be quite like the Durbar without
the elephants,” exclaimed an enthusiastic lady who, to do
her justice, had never seen a Durbar.  The general feeling
was one of thankfulness that the last of the strikes had been got
over before the date fixed for the hearing of the great suit.

As a reaction from the season of gloom and industrial strife
that had just passed away the agencies that purvey and
stage-manage sensations laid themselves out to do their level
best on this momentous occasion.  Men who had made their
reputations as special descriptive writers were mobilised from
distant corners of Europe and the further side of the Atlantic in
order to enrich with their pens the daily printed records of the
case; one word-painter, who specialised in descriptions of how
witnesses turn pale under cross-examination, was summoned
hurriedly back from a famous and prolonged murder trial in
Sicily, where indeed his talents were being decidedly
wasted.  Thumb-nail artists and expert kodak manipulators
were retained at extravagant salaries, and special dress
reporters were in high demand.  An enterprising Paris firm
of costume builders presented the defendant Duchess with three
special creations, to be worn, marked, learned, and extensively
reported at various critical stages of the trial; and as for the
cinematograph agents, their industry and persistence was
untiring.  Films representing the Duke saying good-bye to
his favourite canary on the eve of the trial were in readiness
weeks before the event was due to take place; other films
depicted the Duchess holding imaginary consultations with
fictitious lawyers or making a light repast off specially
advertised vegetarian sandwiches during a supposed luncheon
interval.  As far as human foresight and human enterprise
could go nothing was lacking to make the trial a success.

Two days before the case was down for hearing the advance
reporter of an important syndicate obtained an interview with the
Duke for the purpose of gleaning some final grains of information
concerning his Grace’s personal arrangements during the
trial.

“I suppose I may say this will be one of the biggest
affairs of its kind during the lifetime of a generation,”
began the reporter as an excuse for the unsparing minuteness of
detail that he was about to make quest for.

The baleful word flashed out in all its old hideous
familiarity.  Was there to be no end to its recurrence?

“Do you mean,” faltered the reporter, “that
you are contemplating a mutual withdrawal of the
charges?”

“But think of the arrangements that have been made, the
special reporting, the cinematographs, the catering for the
distinguished foreign witnesses, the prepared music-hall
allusions; think of all the money that has been
sunk—”

“Exactly,” said the Duke coldly, “the
Duchess and I have realised that it is we who provide the
material out of which this great far-reaching industry has been
built up.  Widespread employment will be given and enormous
profits made during the duration of the case, and we, on whom all
the stress and racket falls, will get—what?  An
unenviable notoriety and the privilege of paying heavy legal
expenses whichever way the verdict goes.  Hence our decision
to strike.  We don’t wish to be reconciled; we fully
realise that it is a grave step to take, but unless we get some
reasonable consideration out of this vast stream of wealth and
industry that we have called into being we intend coming out of
court and staying out.  Good afternoon.”

The news of this latest strike spread universal dismay. 
Its inaccessibility to the ordinary methods of persuasion made it
peculiarly formidable.  If the Duke and Duchess persisted in
being reconciled the Government could hardly be called on to
interfere.  Public opinion in the shape of social ostracism
might be brought to bear on them, but that was as far as coercive
measures could go.  There was nothing for it but a
conference, with powers to propose liberal terms.  As it
was, several of the foreign witnesses had already departed and
others had telegraphed cancelling their hotel arrangements.

The conference, protracted, uncomfortable, and occasionally
acrimonious, succeeded at last in arranging for a resumption of
litigation, but it was a fruitless victory.  The Duke, with
a touch of his earlier precocity, died of premature decay a
fortnight before the date fixed for the new trial.

It was autumn in London, that blessed season between the
harshness of winter and the insincerities of summer; a trustful
season when one buys bulbs and sees to the registration of
one’s vote, believing perpetually in spring and a change of
Government.

Morton Crosby sat on a bench in a secluded corner of Hyde
Park, lazily enjoying a cigarette and watching the slow grazing
promenade of a pair of snow-geese, the male looking rather like
an albino edition of the russet-hued female.  Out of the
corner of his eye Crosby also noted with some interest the
hesitating hoverings of a human figure, which had passed and
repassed his seat two or three times at shortening intervals,
like a wary crow about to alight near some possibly edible
morsel.  Inevitably the figure came to an anchorage on the
bench, within easy talking distance of its original
occupant.  The uncared-for clothes, the aggressive, grizzled
beard, and the furtive, evasive eye of the new-comer bespoke the
professional cadger, the man who would undergo hours of
humiliating tale-spinning and rebuff rather than adventure on
half a day’s decent work.

For a while the new-comer fixed his eyes straight in front of
him in a strenuous, unseeing gaze; then his voice broke out with
the insinuating inflection of one who has a story to retail well
worth any loiterer’s while to listen to.

“As far as I am concerned,” said Crosby,
“the strangeness has worn off in the course of thirty-six
years.”

“Ah,” said the greybeard, “I could tell you
things that you’d hardly believe.  Marvellous things
that have really happened to me.”

“Nowadays there is no demand for marvellous things that
have really happened,” said Crosby discouragingly;
“the professional writers of fiction turn these things out
so much better.  For instance, my neighbours tell me
wonderful, incredible things that their Aberdeens and chows and
borzois have done; I never listen to them.  On the other
hand, I have read ‘The Hound of the Baskervilles’
three times.”

“I am a prominent and I think I may say an influential
member of the Mussulman community of Eastern Persia,” said
Crosby, making an excursion himself into the realms of
fiction.

The greybeard was obviously disconcerted at this new check to
introductory conversation, but the defeat was only momentary.

“An Afghan!” said the other, smitten into
bewildered silence for a moment.  Then he recovered himself
and renewed his attack.

“Afghanistan.  Ah!  We’ve had some wars
with that country; now, I daresay, instead of fighting it we
might have learned something from it.  A very wealthy
country, I believe.  No real poverty there.”

He raised his voice on the word “poverty” with a
suggestion of intense feeling.  Crosby saw the opening and
avoided it.

“It possesses, nevertheless, a number of highly talented
and ingenious beggars,” he said; “if I had not spoken
so disparagingly of marvellous things that have really happened I
would tell you the story of Ibrahim and the eleven camel-loads of
blotting-paper.  Also I have forgotten exactly how it
ended.”

“My own life-story is a curious one,” said the
stranger, apparently stifling all desire to hear the history of
Ibrahim; “I was not always as you see me now.”

“We are supposed to undergo complete change in the
course of every seven years,” said Crosby, as an
explanation of the foregoing announcement.

“I mean I was not always in such distressing
circumstances as I am at present,” pursued the stranger
doggedly.

“That sounds rather rude,” said Crosby stiffly,
“considering that you are at present talking to a man
reputed to be one of the most gifted conversationalists of the
Afghan border.”

“I don’t mean in that way,” said the
greybeard hastily; “I’ve been very much interested in
your conversation.  I was alluding to my unfortunate
financial situation.  You mayn’t hardly believe it,
but at the present moment I am absolutely without a
farthing.  Don’t see any prospect of getting any
money, either, for the next few days.  I don’t suppose
you’ve ever found yourself in such a position,” he
added.

“In the town of Yom,” said Crosby, “which is
in Southern Afghanistan, and which also happens to be my
birthplace, there was a Chinese philosopher who used to say that
one of the three chiefest human blessings was to be absolutely
without money.  I forget what the other two were.”

“Ah, I daresay,” said the stranger, in a tone that
betrayed no enthusiasm for the philosopher’s memory;
“and did he practise what he preached?  That’s
the test.”

“Then I expect he had friends who would help him
liberally whenever he was in difficulties, such as I am in at
present.”

“In Yom,” said Crosby, “it is not necessary
to have friends in order to obtain help.  Any citizen of Yom
would help a stranger as a matter of course.”

“If someone, like me, for instance, who was in
undeserved difficulties, asked a citizen of that town you speak
of for a small loan to tide over a few days’
impecuniosity—five shillings, or perhaps a rather larger
sum—would it be given to him as a matter of
course?”

“There would be a certain preliminary,” said
Crosby; “one would take him to a wine-shop and treat him to
a measure of wine, and then, after a little high-flown
conversation, one would put the desired sum in his hand and wish
him good-day.  It is a roundabout way of performing a simple
transaction, but in the East all ways are roundabout.”

“Ah,” he exclaimed, with a thin sneer ringing
meaningly through his words, “I suppose you’ve given
up all those generous customs since you left your town. 
Don’t practise them now, I expect.”

“No one who has lived in Yom,” said Crosby
fervently, “and remembers its green hills covered with
apricot and almond trees, and the cold water that rushes down
like a caress from the upland snows and dashes under the little
wooden bridges, no one who remembers these things and treasures
the memory of them would ever give up a single one of its
unwritten laws and customs.  To me they are as binding as
though I still lived in that hallowed home of my
youth.”

“Then if I was to ask you for a small loan—”
began the greybeard fawningly, edging nearer on the seat and
hurriedly wondering how large he might safely make his request,
“if I was to ask you for, say—”

“At any other time, certainly,” said Crosby;
“in the months of November and December, however, it is
absolutely forbidden for anyone of our race to give or receive
loans or gifts; in fact, one does not willingly speak of
them.  It is considered unlucky.  We will therefore
close this discussion.”

“But it is still October!” exclaimed the
adventurer with an eager, angry whine, as Crosby rose from his
seat; “wants eight days to the end of the month!”

“The Afghan November began yesterday,” said Crosby
severely, and in another moment he was striding across the Park,
leaving his recent companion scowling and muttering furiously on
the seat.

“I don’t believe a word of his story,” he
chattered to himself; “pack of nasty lies from beginning to
end.  Wish I’d told him so to his face.  Calling
himself an Afghan!”

The snorts and snarls that escaped from him for the next
quarter of an hour went far to support the truth of the old
saying that two of a trade never agree.

Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of the small
wayside station and took a turn or two up and down its
uninteresting length, to kill time till the train should be
pleased to proceed on its way.  Then, in the roadway beyond,
she saw a horse struggling with a more than ample load, and a
carter of the sort that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the
animal that helps him to earn a living.  Lady Carlotta
promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a different
complexion on the struggle.  Certain of her acquaintances
were wont to give her plentiful admonition as to the
undesirability of interfering on behalf of a distressed animal,
such interference being “none of her business.” 
Only once had she put the doctrine of non-interference into
practice, when one of its most eloquent exponents had been
besieged for nearly three hours in a small and extremely
uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while Lady Carlotta,
on the other side of the fence, had proceeded with the
water-colour sketch she was engaged on, and refused to interfere
between the boar and his prisoner.  It is to be feared that
she lost the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady.  On
this occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to the
first sign of impatience it had shown throughout the journey, and
steamed off without her.  She bore the desertion with
philosophical indifference; her friends and relations were
thoroughly well used to the fact of her luggage arriving without
her.  She wired a vague non-committal message to her
destination to say that she was coming on “by another
train.”  Before she had time to think what her next
move might be she was confronted by an imposingly attired lady,
who seemed to be taking a prolonged mental inventory of her
clothes and looks.

“You must be Miss Hope, the governess I’ve come to
meet,” said the apparition, in a tone that admitted of very
little argument.

“It’s gone astray,” said the alleged
governess, falling in with the excellent rule of life that the
absent are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact,
behaved with perfect correctitude.  “I’ve just
telegraphed about it,” she added, with a nearer approach to
truth.

“How provoking,” said Mrs. Quabarl; “these
railway companies are so careless.  However, my maid can
lend you things for the night,” and she led the way to her
car.

During the drive to the Quabarl mansion Lady Carlotta was
impressively introduced to the nature of the charge that had been
thrust upon her; she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were
delicate, sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic
temperament highly developed, and that Viola was something or
other else of a mould equally commonplace among children of that
class and type in the twentieth century.

“I wish them not only to be taught,” said
Mrs. Quabarl, “but interested in what they
learn.  In their history lessons, for instance, you must try
to make them feel that they are being introduced to the
life-stories of men and women who really lived, not merely
committing a mass of names and dates to memory.  French, of
course, I shall expect you to talk at meal-times several days in
the week.”

Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was knocked off
her perch.  She was one of those imperfectly self-assured
individuals who are magnificent and autocratic as long as they
are not seriously opposed.  The least show of unexpected
resistance goes a long way towards rendering them cowed and
apologetic.  When the new governess failed to express
wondering admiration of the large newly-purchased and expensive
car, and lightly alluded to the superior advantages of one or two
makes which had just been put on the market, the discomfiture of
her patroness became almost abject.  Her feelings were those
which might have animated a general of ancient warfaring days, on
beholding his heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off
the field by slingers and javelin throwers.

At dinner that evening, although reinforced by her husband,
who usually duplicated her opinions and lent her moral support
generally, Mrs. Quabarl regained none of her lost ground. 
The governess not only helped herself well and truly to wine, but
held forth with considerable show of critical knowledge on
various vintage matters, concerning which the Quabarls were in no
wise able to pose as authorities.  Previous governesses had
limited their conversation on the wine topic to a respectful and
doubtless sincere expression of a preference for water. 
When this one went as far as to recommend a wine firm in whose
hands you could not go very far wrong Mrs. Quabarl thought it
time to turn the conversation into more usual channels.

“We got very satisfactory references about you from
Canon Teep,” she observed; “a very estimable man, I
should think.”

“Drinks like a fish and beats his wife, otherwise a very
lovable character,” said the governess imperturbably.

“One must in justice admit that there is some
provocation,” continued the romancer.  “Mrs.
Teep is quite the most irritating bridge-player that I have ever
sat down with; her leads and declarations would condone a certain
amount of brutality in her partner, but to souse her with the
contents of the only soda-water syphon in the house on a Sunday
afternoon, when one couldn’t get another, argues an
indifference to the comfort of others which I cannot altogether
overlook.  You may think me hasty in my judgments, but it
was practically on account of the syphon incident that I
left.”

Mr. Quabarl made a welcome diversion by asking what studies
the new instructress proposed to inaugurate on the morrow.

“Ah, history,” he observed sagely; “now in
teaching them history you must take care to interest them in what
they learn.  You must make them feel that they are being
introduced to the life-stories of men and women who really
lived—”

“Ah, yes,” said her listeners, thinking it
expedient to assume an acquaintance at least with the name.

“What are you children doing out here?” demanded
Mrs. Quabarl the next morning, on finding Irene sitting rather
glumly at the head of the stairs, while her sister was perched in
an attitude of depressed discomfort on the window-seat behind
her, with a wolf-skin rug almost covering her.

“We are having a history lesson,” came the
unexpected reply.  “I am supposed to be Rome, and
Viola up there is the she-wolf; not a real wolf, but the figure
of one that the Romans used to set store by—I forget
why.  Claude and Wilfrid have gone to fetch the shabby
women.”

“Yes, they’ve got to carry them off.  They
didn’t want to, but Miss Hope got one of father’s
fives-bats and said she’d give them a number nine spanking
if they didn’t, so they’ve gone to do it.”

A loud, angry screaming from the direction of the lawn drew
Mrs. Quabarl thither in hot haste, fearful lest the threatened
castigation might even now be in process of infliction.  The
outcry, however, came principally from the two small daughters of
the lodge-keeper, who were being hauled and pushed towards the
house by the panting and dishevelled Claude and Wilfrid, whose
task was rendered even more arduous by the incessant, if not very
effectual, attacks of the captured maidens’ small
brother.  The governess, fives-bat in hand, sat negligently
on the stone balustrade, presiding over the scene with the cold
impartiality of a Goddess of Battles.  A furious and
repeated chorus of “I’ll tell muvver” rose from
the lodge-children, but the lodge-mother, who was hard of
hearing, was for the moment immersed in the preoccupation of her
washtub.

After an apprehensive glance in the direction of the lodge
(the good woman was gifted with the highly militant temper which
is sometimes the privilege of deafness) Mrs. Quabarl flew
indignantly to the rescue of the struggling captives.

“Wilfrid!  Claude!  Let those children go at
once.  Miss Hope, what on earth is the meaning of this
scene?”

“Early Roman history; the Sabine Women, don’t you
know?  It’s the Schartz-Metterklume method to make
children understand history by acting it themselves; fixes it in
their memory, you know.  Of course, if, thanks to your
interference, your boys go through life thinking that the Sabine
women ultimately escaped, I really cannot be held
responsible.”

“You may be very clever and modern, Miss Hope,”
said Mrs. Quabarl firmly, “but I should like you to leave
here by the next train.  Your luggage will be sent after you
as soon as it arrives.”

“I’m not certain exactly where I shall be for the
next few days,” said the dismissed instructress of youth;
“you might keep my luggage till I wire my address. 
There are only a couple of trunks and some golf-clubs and a
leopard cub.”

“A leopard cub!” gasped Mrs. Quabarl.  Even
in her departure this extraordinary person seemed destined to
leave a trail of embarrassment behind her.

“Well, it’s rather left off being a cub;
it’s more than half-grown, you know.  A fowl every day
and a rabbit on Sundays is what it usually gets.  Raw beef
makes it too excitable.  Don’t trouble about getting
the car for me, I’m rather inclined for a walk.”

The advent of the genuine Miss Hope, who had made a mistake as
to the day on which she was due to arrive, caused a turmoil which
that good lady was quite unused to inspiring.  Obviously the
Quabarl family had been woefully befooled, but a certain amount
of relief came with the knowledge.

“How tiresome for you, dear Carlotta,” said her
hostess, when the overdue guest ultimately arrived; “how
very tiresome losing your train and having to stop overnight in a
strange place.”

“It’s not the daily grind that I complain
of,” said Blenkinthrope resentfully; “it’s the
dull grey sameness of my life outside of office hours. 
Nothing of interest comes my way, nothing remarkable or out of
the common.  Even the little things that I do try to find
some interest in don’t seem to interest other people. 
Things in my garden, for instance.”

“Did I tell you about that?” said Blenkinthrope;
“I was telling the others in the train this morning. 
I forgot if I’d told you.”

“To be exact you told me that it weighed just under two
pounds, but I took into account the fact that abnormal vegetables
and freshwater fish have an after-life, in which growth is not
arrested.”

“The fault is with the potato, not with us,” said
Gorworth; “we are not in the least interested in it because
it is not in the least interesting.  The men you go up in
the train with every day are just in the same case as yourself;
their lives are commonplace and not very interesting to
themselves, and they certainly are not going to wax enthusiastic
over the commonplace events in other men’s lives. 
Tell them something startling, dramatic, piquant that has
happened to yourself or to someone in your family, and you will
capture their interest at once.  They will talk about you
with a certain personal pride to all their acquaintances. 
‘Man I know intimately, fellow called Blenkinthrope, lives
down my way, had two of his fingers clawed clean off by a lobster
he was carrying home to supper.  Doctor says entire hand may
have to come off.’  Now that is conversation of a very
high order.  But imagine walking into a tennis club with the
remark: ‘I know a man who has grown a potato weighing two
and a quarter pounds.’”

“But hang it all, my dear fellow,” said
Blenkinthrope impatiently, “haven’t I just told you
that nothing of a remarkable nature ever happens to
me?”

“Invent something,” said Gorworth.  Since
winning a prize for excellence in Scriptural knowledge at a
preparatory school he had felt licensed to be a little more
unscrupulous than the circle he moved in.  Much might surely
be excused to one who in early life could give a list of
seventeen trees mentioned in the Old Testament.

“A snake got into your hen-run yesterday morning and
killed six out of seven pullets, first mesmerising them with its
eyes and then biting them as they stood helpless.  The
seventh pullet was one of that French sort, with feathers all
over its eyes, so it escaped the mesmeric snare, and just flew at
what it could see of the snake and pecked it to
pieces.”

“Thank you,” said Blenkinthrope stiffly;
“it’s a very clever invention.  If such a thing
had really happened in my poultry-run I admit I should have been
proud and interested to tell people about it.  But I’d
rather stick to fact, even if it is plain fact.”  All
the same his mind dwelt wistfully on the story of the Seventh
Pullet.  He could picture himself telling it in the train
amid the absorbed interest of his fellow-passengers. 
Unconsciously all sorts of little details and improvements began
to suggest themselves.

Wistfulness was still his dominant mood when he took his seat
in the railway carriage the next morning.  Opposite him sat
Stevenham, who had attained to a recognised brevet of importance
through the fact of an uncle having dropped dead in the act of
voting at a Parliamentary election.  That had happened three
years ago, but Stevenham was still deferred to on all questions
of home and foreign politics.

“Hullo, how’s the giant mushroom, or whatever it
was?” was all the notice Blenkinthrope got from his fellow
travellers.

Young Duckby, whom he mildly disliked, speedily monopolised
the general attention by an account of a domestic
bereavement.

“Had four young pigeons carried off last night by a
whacking big rat.  Oh, a monster he must have been; you
could tell by the size of the hole he made breaking into the
loft.”

No moderate-sized rat ever seemed to carry out any predatory
operations in these regions; they were all enormous in their
enormity.

“Pretty hard lines that,” continued Duckby, seeing
that he had secured the attention and respect of the company;
“four squeakers carried off at one swoop.  You’d
find it rather hard to match that in the way of unlooked-for bad
luck.”

“I had six pullets out of a pen of seven killed by a
snake yesterday afternoon,” said Blenkinthrope, in a voice
which he hardly recognised as his own.

“It fascinated them with its deadly, glittering eyes,
one after the other, and struck them down while they stood
helpless.  A bedridden neighbour, who wasn’t able to
call for assistance, witnessed it all from her bedroom
window.”

“The interesting part of it is about the seventh pullet,
the one that didn’t get killed,” resumed
Blenkinthrope, slowly lighting a cigarette.  His diffidence
had left him, and he was beginning to realise how safe and easy
depravity can seem once one has the courage to begin. 
“The six dead birds were Minorcas; the seventh was a Houdan
with a mop of feathers all over its eyes.  It could hardly
see the snake at all, so of course it wasn’t mesmerised
like the others.  It just could see something wriggling on
the ground, and went for it and pecked it to death.”

In the course of the next few days Blenkinthrope discovered
how little the loss of one’s self-respect affects one when
one has gained the esteem of the world.  His story found its
way into one of the poultry papers, and was copied thence into a
daily news-sheet as a matter of general interest.  A lady
wrote from the North of Scotland recounting a similar episode
which she had witnessed as occurring between a stoat and a blind
grouse.  Somehow a lie seems so much less reprehensible when
one can call it a lee.

For awhile the adapter of the Seventh Pullet story enjoyed to
the full his altered standing as a person of consequence, one who
had had some share in the strange events of his times.  Then
he was thrust once again into the cold grey background by the
sudden blossoming into importance of Smith-Paddon, a daily
fellow-traveller, whose little girl had been knocked down and
nearly hurt by a car belonging to a musical-comedy actress. 
The actress was not in the car at the time, but she was in
numerous photographs which appeared in the illustrated papers of
Zoto Dobreen inquiring after the well-being of Maisie, daughter
of Edmund Smith-Paddon, Esq.  With this new human interest
to absorb them the travelling companions were almost rude when
Blenkinthrope tried to explain his contrivance for keeping vipers
and peregrine falcons out of his chicken-run.

The ready affirmative coupled with the question betrayed a
significant shifting of the ethical standpoint.

It was a few days later that Blenkinthrope revealed a chapter
of family history to the customary gathering in the railway
carriage.

“Curious thing happened to my aunt, the one who lives in
Paris,” he began.  He had several aunts, but they were
all geographically distributed over Greater London.

“She was sitting on a seat in the Bois the other
afternoon, after lunching at the Roumanian Legation.”

Whatever the story gained in picturesqueness from the
dragging-in of diplomatic “atmosphere,” it ceased
from that moment to command any acceptance as a record of current
events.  Gorworth had warned his neophyte that this would be
the case, but the traditional enthusiasm of the neophyte had
triumphed over discretion.

“She was feeling rather drowsy, the effect probably of
the champagne, which she’s not in the habit of taking in
the middle of the day.”

A subdued murmur of admiration went round the company. 
Blenkinthrope’s aunts were not used to taking champagne in
the middle of the year, regarding it exclusively as a Christmas
and New Year accessory.

“Presently a rather portly gentleman passed by her seat
and paused an instant to light a cigar.  At that moment a
youngish man came up behind him, drew the blade from a
swordstick, and stabbed him half a dozen times through and
through.  ‘Scoundrel,’ he cried to his victim,
‘you do not know me.  My name is Henri
Leturc.’  The elder man wiped away some of the blood
that was spattering his clothes, turned to his assailant, and
said: ‘And since when has an attempted assassination been
considered an introduction?’  Then he finished
lighting his cigar and walked away.  My aunt had intended
screaming for the police, but seeing the indifference with which
the principal in the affair treated the matter she felt that it
would be an impertinence on her part to interfere.  Of
course I need hardly say she put the whole thing down to the
effects of a warm, drowsy afternoon and the Legation
champagne.  Now comes the astonishing part of my
story.  A fortnight later a bank manager was stabbed to
death with a swordstick in that very part of the Bois.  His
assassin was the son of a charwoman formerly working at the bank,
who had been dismissed from her job by the manager on account of
chronic intemperance.  His name was Henri Leturc.”

From that moment Blenkinthrope was tacitly accepted as the
Munchausen of the party.  No effort was spared to draw him
out from day to day in the exercise of testing their powers of
credulity, and Blenkinthrope, in the false security of an assured
and receptive audience, waxed industrious and ingenious in
supplying the demand for marvels.  Duckby’s satirical
story of a tame otter that had a tank in the garden to swim in,
and whined restlessly whenever the water-rate was overdue, was
scarcely an unfair parody of some of Blenkinthrope’s wilder
efforts.  And then one day came Nemesis.

Returning to his villa one evening Blenkinthrope found his
wife sitting in front of a pack of cards, which she was
scrutinising with unusual concentration.

“No, dear; this is the Death’s Head patience, the
most difficult of them all.  I’ve never got it to work
out, and somehow I should be rather frightened if I did. 
Mother only got it out once in her life; she was afraid of it,
too.  Her great-aunt had done it once and fallen dead from
excitement the next moment, and mother always had a feeling that
she would die if she ever got it out.  She died the same
night that she did it.  She was in bad health at the time,
certainly, but it was a strange coincidence.”

“Don’t do it if it frightens you,” was
Blenkinthrope’s practical comment as he left the
room.  A few minutes later his wife called to him.

“John, it gave me such a turn, I nearly got it
out.  Only the five of diamonds held me up at the end. 
I really thought I’d done it.”

“Why, you can do it,” said Blenkinthrope, who had
come back to the room; “if you shift the eight of clubs on
to that open nine the five can be moved on to the six.”

His wife made the suggested move with hasty, trembling
fingers, and piled the outstanding cards on to their respective
packs.  Then she followed the example of her mother and
great-grand-aunt.

Blenkinthrope had been genuinely fond of his wife, but in the
midst of his bereavement one dominant thought obtruded
itself.  Something sensational and real had at last come
into his life; no longer was it a grey, colourless record. 
The headlines which might appropriately describe his domestic
tragedy kept shaping themselves in his brain. 
“Inherited presentiment comes true.”  “The
Death’s Head patience: Card-game that justified its
sinister name in three generations.”  He wrote out a
full story of the fatal occurrence for the Essex Vedette,
the editor of which was a friend of his, and to another friend he
gave a condensed account, to be taken up to the office of one of
the halfpenny dailies.  But in both cases his reputation as
a romancer stood fatally in the way of the fulfilment of his
ambitions.  “Not the right thing to be Munchausening
in a time of sorrow” agreed his friends among themselves,
and a brief note of regret at the “sudden death of the wife
of our respected neighbour, Mr. John Blenkinthrope, from heart
failure,” appearing in the news column of the local paper
was the forlorn outcome of his visions of widespread
publicity.

Blenkinthrope shrank from the society of his erstwhile
travelling companions and took to travelling townwards by an
earlier train.  He sometimes tries to enlist the sympathy
and attention of a chance acquaintance in details of the
whistling prowess of his best canary or the dimensions of his
largest beetroot; he scarcely recognises himself as the man who
was once spoken about and pointed out as the owner of the Seventh
Pullet.

“You’ve just come back from Adelaide’s
funeral, haven’t you?” said Sir Lulworth to his
nephew; “I suppose it was very like most other
funerals?”

“You’ll do nothing of the sort.  It
wouldn’t be respectful either to your great-aunt’s
memory or to the lunch.  We begin with Spanish olives, then
a borshch, then more olives and a bird of some kind, and a rather
enticing Rhenish wine, not at all expensive as wines go in this
country, but still quite laudable in its way.  Now
there’s absolutely nothing in that menu that harmonises in
the least with the subject of your great-aunt Adelaide or her
funeral.  She was a charming woman, and quite as intelligent
as she had any need to be, but somehow she always reminded me of
an English cook’s idea of a Madras curry.”

“She used to say you were frivolous,” said
Egbert.  Something in his tone suggested that he rather
endorsed the verdict.

“I believe I once considerably scandalised her by
declaring that clear soup was a more important factor in life
than a clear conscience.  She had very little sense of
proportion.  By the way, she made you her principal heir,
didn’t she?”

“Yes,” said Egbert, “and executor as
well.  It’s in that connection that I particularly
want to speak to you.”

“Business is not my strong point at any time,”
said Sir Lulworth, “and certainly not when we’re on
the immediate threshold of lunch.”

“Then we can’t possibly speak about it now,”
said Sir Lulworth; “no one could talk seriously during a
borshch.  A beautifully constructed borshch, such as you are
going to experience presently, ought not only to banish
conversation but almost to annihilate thought.  Later on,
when we arrive at the second stage of olives, I shall be quite
ready to discuss that new book on Borrow, or, if you prefer it,
the present situation in the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg.  But
I absolutely decline to talk anything approaching business till
we have finished with the bird.”

For the greater part of the meal Egbert sat in an abstracted
silence, the silence of a man whose mind is focussed on one
topic.  When the coffee stage had been reached he launched
himself suddenly athwart his uncle’s reminiscences of the
Court of Luxemburg.

“I think I told you that great-aunt Adelaide had made me
her executor.  There wasn’t very much to be done in
the way of legal matters, but I had to go through her
papers.”

“Stacks of them, and most of them highly
uninteresting.  There was one packet, however, which I
thought might repay a careful perusal.  It was a bundle of
correspondence from her brother Peter.”

“Probably the simplest explanation was the correct
one,” said Sir Lulworth; “he slipped on the stone
staircase and fractured his skull in falling.”

Egbert shook his head.  “The medical evidence all
went to prove that the blow on the head was struck by some one
coming up behind him.  A wound caused by violent contact
with the steps could not possibly have been inflicted at that
angle of the skull.  They experimented with a dummy figure
falling in every conceivable position.”

“But the motive?” exclaimed Sir Lulworth;
“no one had any interest in doing away with him, and the
number of people who destroy Canons of the Established Church for
the mere fun of killing must be extremely limited.  Of
course there are individuals of weak mental balance who do that
sort of thing, but they seldom conceal their handiwork; they are
more generally inclined to parade it.”

“I know he was,” said Sir Lulworth, “simply
because he was about the only person on the premises at the time
of the tragedy.  But could anything be sillier than trying
to fasten a charge of murder on to Sebastien?  He had
nothing to gain, in fact, a good deal to lose, from the death of
his employer.  The Canon was paying him quite as good wages
as I was able to offer him when I took him over into my
service.  I have since raised them to something a little
more in accordance with his real worth, but at the time he was
glad to find a new place without troubling about an increase of
wages.  People were fighting rather shy of him, and he had
no friends in this country.  No; if anyone in the world was
interested in the prolonged life and unimpaired digestion of the
Canon it would certainly be Sebastien.”

“People don’t always weigh the consequences of
their rash acts,” said Egbert, “otherwise there would
be very few murders committed.  Sebastien is a man of hot
temper.”

“He is a southerner,” admitted Sir Lulworth;
“to be geographically exact I believe he hails from the
French slopes of the Pyrenees.  I took that into
consideration when he nearly killed the gardener’s boy the
other day for bringing him a spurious substitute for
sorrel.  One must always make allowances for origin and
locality and early environment; ‘Tell me your longitude and
I’ll know what latitude to allow you,’ is my
motto.”

“My dear Egbert, between nearly killing a
gardener’s boy and altogether killing a Canon there is a
wide difference.  No doubt you have often felt a temporary
desire to kill a gardener’s boy; you have never given way
to it, and I respect you for your self-control.  But I
don’t suppose you have ever wanted to kill an octogenarian
Canon.  Besides, as far as we know, there had never been any
quarrel or disagreement between the two men.  The evidence
at the inquest brought that out very clearly.”

“Ah!” said Egbert, with the air of a man coming at
last into a deferred inheritance of conversational importance,
“that is precisely what I want to speak to you
about.”

He pushed away his coffee cup and drew a pocket-book from his
inner breast-pocket.  From the depths of the pocket-book he
produced an envelope, and from the envelope he extracted a
letter, closely written in a small, neat handwriting.

“One of the Canon’s numerous letters to Aunt
Adelaide,” he explained, “written a few days before
his death.  Her memory was already failing when she received
it, and I daresay she forgot the contents as soon as she had read
it; otherwise, in the light of what subsequently happened, we
should have heard something of this letter before now.  If
it had been produced at the inquest I fancy it would have made
some difference in the course of affairs.  The evidence, as
you remarked just now, choked off suspicion against Sebastien by
disclosing an utter absence of anything that could be considered
a motive or provocation for the crime, if crime there
was.”

“It’s a long rambling affair, like most of his
letters in his later years,” said Egbert. 
“I’ll read the part that bears immediately on the
mystery.

“‘I very much fear I shall have to get rid of
Sebastien.  He cooks divinely, but he has the temper of a
fiend or an anthropoid ape, and I am really in bodily fear of
him.  We had a dispute the other day as to the correct sort
of lunch to be served on Ash Wednesday, and I got so irritated
and annoyed at his conceit and obstinacy that at last I threw a
cupful of coffee in his face and called him at the same time an
impudent jackanapes.  Very little of the coffee went
actually in his face, but I have never seen a human being show
such deplorable lack of self-control.  I laughed at the
threat of killing me that he spluttered out in his rage, and
thought the whole thing would blow over, but I have several times
since caught him scowling and muttering in a highly unpleasant
fashion, and lately I have fancied that he was dogging my
footsteps about the grounds, particularly when I walk of an
evening in the Italian Garden.’

“It was on the steps in the Italian Garden that the body
was found,” commented Egbert, and resumed reading.

Egbert paused for a moment at the conclusion of the extract;
then, as his uncle made no remark, he added: “If lack of
motive was the only factor that saved Sebastien from prosecution
I fancy this letter will put a different complexion on
matters.”

“Have you shown it to anyone else?” asked Sir
Lulworth, reaching out his hand for the incriminating piece of
paper.

“No,” said Egbert, handing it across the table,
“I thought I would tell you about it first.  Heavens,
what are you doing?”

Egbert’s voice rose almost to a scream.  Sir
Lulworth had flung the paper well and truly into the glowing
centre of the grate.  The small, neat handwriting shrivelled
into black flaky nothingness.

“What on earth did you do that for?” gasped
Egbert.  “That letter was our one piece of evidence to
connect Sebastien with the crime.”

Norman Gortsby sat on a bench in the Park, with his back to a
strip of bush-planted sward, fenced by the park railings, and the
Row fronting him across a wide stretch of carriage drive. 
Hyde Park Corner, with its rattle and hoot of traffic, lay
immediately to his right.  It was some thirty minutes past
six on an early March evening, and dusk had fallen heavily over
the scene, dusk mitigated by some faint moonlight and many street
lamps.  There was a wide emptiness over road and sidewalk,
and yet there were many unconsidered figures moving silently
through the half-light, or dotted unobtrusively on bench and
chair, scarcely to be distinguished from the shadowed gloom in
which they sat.

The scene pleased Gortsby and harmonised with his present
mood.  Dusk, to his mind, was the hour of the
defeated.  Men and women, who had fought and lost, who hid
their fallen fortunes and dead hopes as far as possible from the
scrutiny of the curious, came forth in this hour of gloaming,
when their shabby clothes and bowed shoulders and unhappy eyes
might pass unnoticed, or, at any rate, unrecognised.

The wanderers in the dusk did not choose to have strange looks
fasten on them, therefore they came out in this bat-fashion,
taking their pleasure sadly in a pleasure-ground that had emptied
of its rightful occupants.  Beyond the sheltering screen of
bushes and palings came a realm of brilliant lights and noisy,
rushing traffic.  A blazing, many-tiered stretch of windows
shone through the dusk and almost dispersed it, marking the
haunts of those other people, who held their own in life’s
struggle, or at any rate had not had to admit failure.  So
Gortsby’s imagination pictured things as he sat on his
bench in the almost deserted walk.  He was in the mood to
count himself among the defeated.  Money troubles did not
press on him; had he so wished he could have strolled into the
thoroughfares of light and noise, and taken his place among the
jostling ranks of those who enjoyed prosperity or struggled for
it.  He had failed in a more subtle ambition, and for the
moment he was heartsore and disillusionised, and not disinclined
to take a certain cynical pleasure in observing and labelling his
fellow wanderers as they went their ways in the dark stretches
between the lamp-lights.

On the bench by his side sat an elderly gentleman with a
drooping air of defiance that was probably the remaining vestige
of self-respect in an individual who had ceased to defy
successfully anybody or anything.  His clothes could
scarcely be called shabby, at least they passed muster in the
half-light, but one’s imagination could not have pictured
the wearer embarking on the purchase of a half-crown box of
chocolates or laying out ninepence on a carnation
buttonhole.  He belonged unmistakably to that forlorn
orchestra to whose piping no one dances; he was one of the
world’s lamenters who induce no responsive weeping. 
As he rose to go Gortsby imagined him returning to a home circle
where he was snubbed and of no account, or to some bleak lodging
where his ability to pay a weekly bill was the beginning and end
of the interest he inspired.  His retreating figure vanished
slowly into the shadows, and his place on the bench was taken
almost immediately by a young man, fairly well dressed but
scarcely more cheerful of mien than his predecessor.  As if
to emphasise the fact that the world went badly with him the
new-corner unburdened himself of an angry and very audible
expletive as he flung himself into the seat.

“You don’t seem in a very good temper,” said
Gortsby, judging that he was expected to take due notice of the
demonstration.

“You wouldn’t be in a good temper if you were in
the fix I’m in,” he said; “I’ve done the
silliest thing I’ve ever done in my life.”

“Came up this afternoon, meaning to stay at the
Patagonian Hotel in Berkshire Square,” continued the young
man; “when I got there I found it had been pulled down some
weeks ago and a cinema theatre run up on the site.  The taxi
driver recommended me to another hotel some way off and I went
there.  I just sent a letter to my people, giving them the
address, and then I went out to buy some soap—I’d
forgotten to pack any and I hate using hotel soap.  Then I
strolled about a bit, had a drink at a bar and looked at the
shops, and when I came to turn my steps back to the hotel I
suddenly realised that I didn’t remember its name or even
what street it was in.  There’s a nice predicament for
a fellow who hasn’t any friends or connections in
London!  Of course I can wire to my people for the address,
but they won’t have got my letter till to-morrow; meantime
I’m without any money, came out with about a shilling on
me, which went in buying the soap and getting the drink, and here
I am, wandering about with twopence in my pocket and nowhere to
go for the night.”

There was an eloquent pause after the story had been
told.  “I suppose you think I’ve spun you rather
an impossible yarn,” said the young man presently, with a
suggestion of resentment in his voice.

“Not at all impossible,” said Gortsby judicially;
“I remember doing exactly the same thing once in a foreign
capital, and on that occasion there were two of us, which made it
more remarkable.  Luckily we remembered that the hotel was
on a sort of canal, and when we struck the canal we were able to
find our way back to the hotel.”

The youth brightened at the reminiscence.  “In a
foreign city I wouldn’t mind so much,” he said;
“one could go to one’s Consul and get the requisite
help from him.  Here in one’s own land one is far more
derelict if one gets into a fix.  Unless I can find some
decent chap to swallow my story and lend me some money I seem
likely to spend the night on the Embankment.  I’m
glad, anyhow, that you don’t think the story outrageously
improbable.”

He threw a good deal of warmth into the last remark, as though
perhaps to indicate his hope that Gortsby did not fall far short
of the requisite decency.

The young man sat forward hurriedly, felt rapidly in the
pockets of his overcoat, and then jumped to his feet.

“To lose an hotel and a cake of soap on one afternoon
suggests wilful carelessness,” said Gortsby, but the young
man scarcely waited to hear the end of the remark.  He
flitted away down the path, his head held high, with an air of
somewhat jaded jauntiness.

“It was a pity,” mused Gortsby; “the going
out to get one’s own soap was the one convincing touch in
the whole story, and yet it was just that little detail that
brought him to grief.  If he had had the brilliant
forethought to provide himself with a cake of soap, wrapped and
sealed with all the solicitude of the chemist’s counter, he
would have been a genius in his particular line.  In his
particular line genius certainly consists of an infinite capacity
for taking precautions.”

With that reflection Gortsby rose to go; as he did so an
exclamation of concern escaped him.  Lying on the ground by
the side of the bench was a small oval packet, wrapped and sealed
with the solicitude of a chemist’s counter.  It could
be nothing else but a cake of soap, and it had evidently fallen
out of the youth’s overcoat pocket when he flung himself
down on the seat.  In another moment Gortsby was scudding
along the dusk-shrouded path in anxious quest for a youthful
figure in a light overcoat.  He had nearly given up the
search when he caught sight of the object of his pursuit standing
irresolutely on the border of the carriage drive, evidently
uncertain whether to strike across the Park or make for the
bustling pavements of Knightsbridge.  He turned round
sharply with an air of defensive hostility when he found Gortsby
hailing him.

“The important witness to the genuineness of your story
has turned up,” said Gortsby, holding out the cake of soap;
“it must have slid out of your overcoat pocket when you sat
down on the seat.  I saw it on the ground after you
left.  You must excuse my disbelief, but appearances were
really rather against you, and now, as I appealed to the
testimony of the soap I think I ought to abide by its
verdict.  If the loan of a sovereign is any good to
you—”

“Here is my card with my address,” continued
Gortsby; “any day this week will do for returning the
money, and here is the soap—don’t lose it again
it’s been a good friend to you.”

“Lucky thing your finding it,” said the youth, and
then, with a catch in his voice, he blurted out a word or two of
thanks and fled headlong in the direction of Knightsbridge.

“Poor boy, he as nearly as possible broke down,”
said Gortsby to himself.  “I don’t wonder
either; the relief from his quandary must have been acute. 
It’s a lesson to me not to be too clever in judging by
circumstances.”

As Gortsby retraced his steps past the seat where the little
drama had taken place he saw an elderly gentleman poking and
peering beneath it and on all sides of it, and recognised his
earlier fellow occupant.

“I hope you’ve come full of suggestions for
Christmas,” said Lady Blonze to her latest arrived guest;
“the old-fashioned Christmas and the up-to-date Christmas
are both so played out.  I want to have something really
original this year.”

“I was staying with the Mathesons last month,”
said Blanche Boveal eagerly, “and we had such a good
idea.  Every one in the house-party had to be a character
and behave consistently all the time, and at the end of the visit
one had to guess what every one’s character was.  The
one who was voted to have acted his or her character best got a
prize.”

“I was St. Francis of Assisi,” continued Blanche;
“we hadn’t got to keep to our right sexes.  I
kept getting up in the middle of a meal, and throwing out food to
the birds; you see, the chief thing that one remembers of St.
Francis is that he was fond of the birds.  Every one was so
stupid about it, and thought that I was the old man who feeds the
sparrows in the Tuileries Gardens.  Then Colonel Pentley was
the Jolly Miller on the banks of Dee.”

“If you could imagine all that you might as well imagine
cattle on the further bank and keep on calling them home,
Mary-fashion, across the sands of Dee.  Or you might change
the river to the Yarrow and imagine it was on the top of you, and
say you were Willie, or whoever it was, drowned in
Yarrow.”

“Of course it’s easy to make fun of it,”
said Blanche sharply, “but it was extremely interesting and
amusing.  The prize was rather a fiasco, though.  You
see, Millie Matheson said her character was Lady Bountiful, and
as she was our hostess of course we all had to vote that she had
carried out her character better than anyone.  Otherwise I
ought to have got the prize.”

Sir Nicholas was not so enthusiastic.  “Are you
quite sure, my dear, that you’re wise in doing this
thing?” he said to his wife when they were alone
together.  “It might do very well at the Mathesons,
where they had rather a staid, elderly house-party, but here it
will be a different matter.  There is the Durmot flapper,
for instance, who simply stops at nothing, and you know what Van
Tahn is like.  Then there is Cyril Skatterly; he has madness
on one side of his family and a Hungarian grandmother on the
other.”

“It’s the unknown that is to be dreaded,”
said Sir Nicholas.  “If Skatterly took it into his
head to represent a Bull of Bashan, well, I’d rather not be
here.”

“Of course we shan’t allow any Bible
characters.  Besides, I don’t know what the Bulls of
Bashan really did that was so very dreadful; they just came round
and gaped, as far as I remember.”

“My dear, you don’t know what Skatterly’s
Hungarian imagination mightn’t read into the part; it would
be small satisfaction to say to him afterwards:
‘You’ve behaved as no Bull of Bashan would have
behaved.’”

“Oh, you’re an alarmist,” said Lady Blonze;
“I particularly want to have this idea carried out. 
It will be sure to be talked about a lot.”

Dinner that evening was not a particularly lively affair; the
strain of trying to impersonate a self-imposed character or to
glean hints of identity from other people’s conduct acted
as a check on the natural festivity of such a gathering. 
There was a general feeling of gratitude and acquiescence when
good-natured Rachel Klammerstein suggested that there should be
an hour or two’s respite from “the game” while
they all listened to a little piano-playing after dinner. 
Rachel’s love of piano music was not indiscriminate, and
concentrated itself chiefly on selections rendered by her
idolised offspring, Moritz and Augusta, who, to do them justice,
played remarkably well.

The Klammersteins were deservedly popular as Christmas guests;
they gave expensive gifts lavishly on Christmas Day and New Year,
and Mrs. Klammerstein had already dropped hints of her intention
to present the prize for the best enacted character in the game
competition.  Every one had brightened at this prospect; if
it had fallen to Lady Blonze, as hostess, to provide the prize,
she would have considered that a little souvenir of some twenty
or twenty-five shillings’ value would meet the case,
whereas coming from a Klammerstein source it would certainly run
to several guineas.

The close time for impersonation efforts came to an end with
the final withdrawal of Moritz and Augusta from the piano. 
Blanche Boveal retired early, leaving the room in a series of
laboured leaps that she hoped might be recognised as a tolerable
imitation of Pavlova.  Vera Durmot, the sixteen-year-old
flapper, expressed her confident opinion that the performance was
intended to typify Mark Twain’s famous jumping frog, and
her diagnosis of the case found general acceptance.  Another
guest to set an example of early bed-going was Waldo Plubley, who
conducted his life on a minutely regulated system of time-tables
and hygienic routine.  Waldo was a plump, indolent young man
of seven-and-twenty, whose mother had early in his life decided
for him that he was unusually delicate, and by dint of much
coddling and home-keeping had succeeded in making him physically
soft and mentally peevish.  Nine hours’ unbroken
sleep, preceded by elaborate breathing exercises and other
hygienic ritual, was among the indispensable regulations which
Waldo imposed on himself, and there were innumerable small
observances which he exacted from those who were in any way
obliged to minister to his requirements; a special teapot for the
decoction of his early tea was always solemnly handed over to the
bedroom staff of any house in which he happened to be
staying.  No one had ever quite mastered the mechanism of
this precious vessel, but Bertie van Tahn was responsible for the
legend that its spout had to be kept facing north during the
process of infusion.

On this particular night the irreducible nine hours were
severely mutilated by the sudden and by no means noiseless
incursion of a pyjama-clad figure into Waldo’s room at an
hour midway between midnight and dawn.

“What is the matter?  What are you looking
for?” asked the awakened and astonished Waldo, slowly
recognising Van Tahn, who appeared to be searching hastily for
something he had lost.

“I can’t argue the matter at this hour of the
night,” said Bertie, and began hastily rummaging in the
chest of drawers.  Shirts and underwear went flying on to
the floor.

“I’ve only got your word for it,” said
Bertie, whisking most of the bedclothes on to the floor;
“if you weren’t concealing something you
wouldn’t be so agitated.”

Waldo was by this time convinced that Van Tahn was raving mad,
and made an anxious effort to humour him.

“Go back to bed like a dear fellow,” he pleaded,
“and your sheep will turn up all right in the
morning.”

“I daresay,” said Bertie gloomily, “without
their tails.  Nice fool I shall look with a lot of Manx
sheep.”

And by way of emphasising his annoyance at the prospect he
sent Waldo’s pillows flying to the top of the wardrobe.

“But why no tails?” asked Waldo, whose
teeth were chattering with fear and rage and lowered
temperature.

“My dear boy, have you never heard the ballad of Little
Bo-Peep?” said Bertie with a chuckle. 
“It’s my character in the Game, you know.  If I
didn’t go hunting about for my lost sheep no one would be
able to guess who I was; and now go to sleepy weeps like a good
child or I shall be cross with you.”

“I leave you to imagine,” wrote Waldo in the
course of a long letter to his mother, “how much sleep I
was able to recover that night, and you know how essential nine
uninterrupted hours of slumber are to my health.”

On the other hand he was able to devote some wakeful hours to
exercises in breathing wrath and fury against Bertie van
Tahn.

Breakfast at Blonzecourt was a scattered meal, on the
“come when you please” principle, but the house-party
was supposed to gather in full strength at lunch.  On the
day after the “Game” had been started there were,
however, some notable absentees.  Waldo Plubley, for
instance, was reported to be nursing a headache.  A large
breakfast and an “A.B.C.” had been taken up to his
room, but he had made no appearance in the flesh.

“I expect he’s playing up to some
character,” said Vera Durmot; “isn’t there a
thing of Molière’s, ‘Le Malade
Imaginaire’?  I expect he’s that.”

“But there are only three of them.  Besides,
they’ll want their lunch.  Hasn’t anyone seen
anything of them?”

“I saw you and Vera come back,” said Lady Blonze,
“but I didn’t see the Klammersteins.  Did you
put them down in the village?”

“We didn’t stop to consider that,” said
Skatterly; “we asked them to get out for a moment, on the
pretence that the car had stuck, and then we dashed off full
speed and left them there.”

“It’s something to do with Spanish history; we
don’t mind giving you that clue,” said Skatterly,
helping himself cheerfully to salad, and then Bertie van Tahn
broke forth into peals of joyous laughter.

“I’ve got it!  Ferdinand and Isabella
deporting the Jews!  Oh, lovely!  Those two have
certainly won the prize; we shan’t get anything to beat
that for thoroughness.”

Lady Blonze’s Christmas party was talked about and
written about to an extent that she had not anticipated in her
most ambitious moments.  The letters from Waldo’s
mother would alone have made it memorable.

Basset Harrowcluff returned to the home of his fathers, after
an absence of four years, distinctly well pleased with
himself.  He was only thirty-one, but he had put in some
useful service in an out-of-the-way, though not unimportant,
corner of the world.  He had quieted a province, kept open a
trade route, enforced the tradition of respect which is worth the
ransom of many kings in out-of-the-way regions, and done the
whole business on rather less expenditure than would be requisite
for organising a charity in the home country.  In Whitehall
and places where they think, they doubtless thought well of
him.  It was not inconceivable, his father allowed himself
to imagine, that Basset’s name might figure in the next
list of Honours.

Basset was inclined to be rather contemptuous of his
half-brother, Lucas, whom he found feverishly engrossed in the
same medley of elaborate futilities that had claimed his whole
time and energies, such as they were, four years ago, and almost
as far back before that as he could remember.  It was the
contempt of the man of action for the man of activities, and it
was probably reciprocated.  Lucas was an over-well nourished
individual, some nine years Basset’s senior, with a
colouring that would have been accepted as a sign of intensive
culture in an asparagus, but probably meant in this case mere
abstention from exercise.  His hair and forehead furnished a
recessional note in a personality that was in all other respects
obtrusive and assertive.  There was certainly no Semitic
blood in Lucas’s parentage, but his appearance contrived to
convey at least a suggestion of Jewish extraction.  Clovis
Sangrail, who knew most of his associates by sight, said it was
undoubtedly a case of protective mimicry.

Two days after Basset’s return, Lucas frisked in to
lunch in a state of twittering excitement that could not be
restrained even for the immediate consideration of soup, but had
to be verbally discharged in spluttering competition with
mouthfuls of vermicelli.

Basset gave a short laugh that would have done equally well as
a snort, if one had wanted to make the exchange.  His
half-brother was in the habit of discovering futilities that were
“simply It” at frequently recurring intervals. 
The discovery generally meant that he flew up to town, preceded
by glowingly-worded telegrams, to see some one connected with the
stage or the publishing world, got together one or two momentous
luncheon parties, flitted in and out of “Gambrinus”
for one or two evenings, and returned home with an air of subdued
importance and the asparagus tint slightly intensified.  The
great idea was generally forgotten a few weeks later in the
excitement of some new discovery.

“The inspiration came to me whilst I was
dressing,” announced Lucas; “it will be the
thing in the next music-hall revue.  All London will
go mad over it.  It’s just a couplet; of course there
will be other words, but they won’t matter. 
Listen:

A lifting, catchy sort of refrain, you see, and big-drum
business on the two syllables of bor-zoi.  It’s
immense.  And I’ve thought out all the business of it;
the singer will sing the first verse alone, then during the
second verse Cousin Teresa will walk through, followed by four
wooden dogs on wheels; Cæsar will be an Irish terrier, Fido
a black poodle, Jock a fox-terrier, and the borzoi, of course,
will be a borzoi.  During the third verse Cousin Teresa will
come on alone, and the dogs will be drawn across by themselves
from the opposite wing; then Cousin Teresa will catch on to the
singer and go off-stage in one direction, while the dogs’
procession goes off in the other, crossing en route, which is
always very effective.  There’ll be a lot of applause
there, and for the fourth verse Cousin Teresa will come on in
sables and the dogs will all have coats on.  Then I’ve
got a great idea for the fifth verse; each of the dogs will be
led on by a Nut, and Cousin Teresa will come on from the opposite
side, crossing en route, always effective, and then she turns
round and leads the whole lot of them off on a string, and all
the time every one singing like mad:

Tum-Tum!  Drum business on the two last syllables. 
I’m so excited, I shan’t sleep a wink to-night. 
I’m off to-morrow by the ten-fifteen.  I’ve
wired to Hermanova to lunch with me.”

If any of the rest of the family felt any excitement over the
creation of Cousin Teresa, they were signally successful in
concealing the fact.

“Poor Lucas does take his silly little ideas
seriously,” said Colonel Harrowcluff afterwards in the
smoking-room.

“Yes,” said his younger son, in a slightly less
tolerant tone, “in a day or two he’ll come back and
tell us that his sensational masterpiece is above the heads of
the public, and in about three weeks’ time he’ll be
wild with enthusiasm over a scheme to dramatise the poems of
Herrick or something equally promising.”

And then an extraordinary thing befell.  In defiance of
all precedent Lucas’s glowing anticipations were justified
and endorsed by the course of events.  If Cousin Teresa was
above the heads of the public, the public heroically adapted
itself to her altitude.  Introduced as an experiment at a
dull moment in a new revue, the success of the item was
unmistakable; the calls were so insistent and uproarious that
even Lucas’ ample devisings of additional
“business” scarcely sufficed to keep pace with the
demand.  Packed houses on successive evenings confirmed the
verdict of the first night audience, stalls and boxes filled
significantly just before the turn came on, and emptied
significantly after the last encore had been given. 
The manager tearfully acknowledged that Cousin Teresa was
It.  Stage hands and supers and programme sellers
acknowledged it to one another without the least
reservation.  The name of the revue dwindled to
secondary importance, and vast letters of electric blue blazoned
the words “Cousin Teresa” from the front of the great
palace of pleasure.  And, of course, the magic of the famous
refrain laid its spell all over the Metropolis.  Restaurant
proprietors were obliged to provide the members of their
orchestras with painted wooden dogs on wheels, in order that the
much-demanded and always conceded melody should be rendered with
the necessary spectacular effects, and the crash of bottles and
forks on the tables at the mention of the big borzoi usually
drowned the sincerest efforts of drum or cymbals.  Nowhere
and at no time could one get away from the double thump that
brought up the rear of the refrain; revellers reeling home at
night banged it on doors and hoardings, milkmen clashed their
cans to its cadence, messenger boys hit smaller messenger boys
resounding double smacks on the same principle.  And the
more thoughtful circles of the great city were not deaf to the
claims and significance of the popular melody.  An
enterprising and emancipated preacher discoursed from his pulpit
on the inner meaning of “Cousin Teresa,” and Lucas
Harrowcluff was invited to lecture on the subject of his great
achievement to members of the Young Mens’ Endeavour League,
the Nine Arts Club, and other learned and willing-to-learn
bodies.  In Society it seemed to be the one thing people
really cared to talk about; men and women of middle age and
average education might be seen together in corners earnestly
discussing, not the question whether Servia should have an outlet
on the Adriatic, or the possibilities of a British success in
international polo contests, but the more absorbing topic of the
problematic Aztec or Nilotic origin of the Teresa
motiv.

“Politics and patriotism are so boring and so out of
date,” said a revered lady who had some pretensions to
oracular utterance; “we are too cosmopolitan nowadays to be
really moved by them.  That is why one welcomes an
intelligible production like ‘Cousin Teresa,’ that
has a genuine message for one.  One can’t understand
the message all at once, of course, but one felt from the very
first that it was there.  I’ve been to see it eighteen
times and I’m going again to-morrow and on Thursday. 
One can’t see it often enough.”

“It would be rather a popular move if we gave this
Harrowcluff person a knighthood or something of the sort,”
said the Minister reflectively.

“Which?  There is only one, isn’t
there?” said the Minister; “the ‘Cousin
Teresa’ man, of course.  I think every one would be
pleased if we knighted him.  Yes, you can put him down on
the list of certainties—under the letter L.”

“The letter L,” said the secretary, who was new to
his job; “does that stand for Liberalism or
liberality?”

And thus, after a fashion, Colonel Harrowcluff’s
expectation of seeing his son’s name in the list of Honours
was gratified.

Sir Lulworth Quayne was making a leisurely progress through
the Zoological Society’s Gardens in company with his
nephew, recently returned from Mexico.  The latter was
interested in comparing and contrasting allied types of animals
occurring in the North American and Old World fauna.

“One of the most remarkable things in the wanderings of
species,” he observed, “is the sudden impulse to trek
and migrate that breaks out now and again, for no apparent
reason, in communities of hitherto stay-at-home
animals.”

“In human affairs the same phenomenon is occasionally
noticeable,” said Sir Lulworth; “perhaps the most
striking instance of it occurred in this country while you were
away in the wilds of Mexico.  I mean the wander fever which
suddenly displayed itself in the managing and editorial staffs of
certain London newspapers.  It began with the stampede of
the entire staff of one of our most brilliant and enterprising
weeklies to the banks of the Seine and the heights of
Montmartre.  The migration was a brief one, but it heralded
an era of restlessness in the Press world which lent quite a new
meaning to the phrase ‘newspaper circulation.’ 
Other editorial staffs were not slow to imitate the example that
had been set them.  Paris soon dropped out of fashion as
being too near home; Nürnberg, Seville, and Salonica became
more favoured as planting-out grounds for the personnel of not
only weekly but daily papers as well.  The localities were
perhaps not always well chosen; the fact of a leading organ of
Evangelical thought being edited for two successive fortnights
from Trouville and Monte Carlo was generally admitted to have
been a mistake.  And even when enterprising and adventurous
editors took themselves and their staffs further afield there
were some unavoidable clashings.  For instance, the
Scrutator, Sporting Bluff, and The
Damsels’ Own Paper all pitched on Khartoum for the same
week.  It was, perhaps, a desire to out-distance all
possible competition that influenced the management of the
Daily Intelligencer, one of the most solid and respected
organs of Liberal opinion, in its decision to transfer its
offices for three or four weeks from Fleet Street to Eastern
Turkestan, allowing, of course, a necessary margin of time for
the journey there and back.  This was, in many respects, the
most remarkable of all the Press stampedes that were experienced
at this time.  There was no make-believe about the
undertaking; proprietor, manager, editor, sub-editors,
leader-writers, principal reporters, and so forth, all took part
in what was popularly alluded to as the Drang nach Osten;
an intelligent and efficient office-boy was all that was left in
the deserted hive of editorial industry.”

“Well, you see,” said Sir Lulworth, “the
migration idea was falling somewhat into disrepute from the
half-hearted manner in which it was occasionally carried
out.  You were not impressed by the information that such
and such a paper was being edited and brought out at Lisbon or
Innsbruck if you chanced to see the principal leader-writer or
the art editor lunching as usual at their accustomed
restaurants.  The Daily Intelligencer was determined
to give no loophole for cavil at the genuineness of its
pilgrimage, and it must be admitted that to a certain extent the
arrangements made for transmitting copy and carrying on the usual
features of the paper during the long outward journey worked
smoothly and well.  The series of articles which commenced
at Baku on ‘What Cobdenism might do for the camel
industry’ ranks among the best of the recent contributions
to Free Trade literature, while the views on foreign policy
enunciated ‘from a roof in Yarkand’ showed at least
as much grasp of the international situation as those that had
germinated within half a mile of Downing Street.  Quite in
keeping, too, with the older and better traditions of British
journalism was the manner of the home-coming; no bombast, no
personal advertisement, no flamboyant interviews.  Even a
complimentary luncheon at the Voyagers’ Club was
courteously declined.  Indeed, it began to be felt that the
self-effacement of the returned pressmen was being carried to a
pedantic length.  Foreman compositors, advertisement clerks,
and other members of the non-editorial staff, who had, of course,
taken no part in the great trek, found it as impossible to get
into direct communication with the editor and his satellites now
that they had returned as when they had been excusably
inaccessible in Central Asia.  The sulky, overworked
office-boy, who was the one connecting link between the editorial
brain and the business departments of the paper, sardonically
explained the new aloofness as the ‘Yarkand
manner.’  Most of the reporters and sub-editors seemed
to have been dismissed in autocratic fashion since their return
and new ones engaged by letter; to these the editor and his
immediate associates remained an unseen presence, issuing its
instructions solely through the medium of curt typewritten
notes.  Something mystic and Tibetan and forbidden had
replaced the human bustle and democratic simplicity of
pre-migration days, and the same experience was encountered by
those who made social overtures to the returned wanderers. 
The most brilliant hostess of Twentieth Century London flung the
pearl of her hospitality into the unresponsive trough of the
editorial letter-box; it seemed as if nothing short of a Royal
command would drag the hermit-souled revenants from their
self-imposed seclusion.  People began to talk unkindly of
the effect of high altitudes and Eastern atmosphere on minds and
temperaments unused to such luxuries.  The Yarkand manner
was not popular.”

“Ah!” said Sir Lulworth, “that was the
exciting thing.  In home affairs, social questions, and the
ordinary events of the day not much change was noticeable. 
A certain Oriental carelessness seemed to have crept into the
editorial department, and perhaps a note of lassitude not
unnatural in the work of men who had returned from what had been
a fairly arduous journey.  The aforetime standard of
excellence was scarcely maintained, but at any rate the general
lines of policy and outlook were not departed from.  It was
in the realm of foreign affairs that a startling change took
place.  Blunt, forcible, outspoken articles appeared,
couched in language which nearly turned the autumn
manœuvres of six important Powers into mobilisations. 
Whatever else the Daily Intelligencer had learned in the
East, it had not acquired the art of diplomatic ambiguity. 
The man in the street enjoyed the articles and bought the paper
as he had never bought it before; the men in Downing Street took
a different view.  The Foreign Secretary, hitherto accounted
a rather reticent man, became positively garrulous in the course
of perpetually disavowing the sentiments expressed in the
Daily Intelligencer’s leaders; and then one day the
Government came to the conclusion that something definite and
drastic must be done.  A deputation, consisting of the Prime
Minister, the Foreign Secretary, four leading financiers, and a
well-known Nonconformist divine, made its way to the offices of
the paper.  At the door leading to the editorial department
the way was barred by a nervous but defiant office-boy.

“‘We insist on seeing the editor or some
responsible person,’ said the Prime Minister, and the
deputation forced its way in.  The boy had spoken truly;
there was no one to be seen.  In the whole suite of rooms
there was no sign of human life.

“In answer to the shower of questions the boy unlocked a
drawer and produced a strange-looking envelope, which bore a
Khokand postmark, and a date of some seven or eight months
back.  It contained a scrap of paper on which was written
the following message:

“‘Entire party captured by brigand
tribe on homeward journey.  Quarter of million demanded as
ransom, but would probably take less.  Inform Government,
relations, and friends.’

“There followed the signatures of the principal members
of the party and instructions as to how and where the money was
to be paid.

“The letter had been directed to the
office-boy-in-charge, who had quietly suppressed it.  No one
is a hero to one’s own office-boy, and he evidently
considered that a quarter of a million was an unwarrantable
outlay for such a doubtfully advantageous object as the
repatriation of an errant newspaper staff.  So he drew the
editorial and other salaries, forged what signatures were
necessary, engaged new reporters, did what sub-editing he could,
and made as much use as possible of the large accumulation of
special articles that was held in reserve for emergencies. 
The articles on foreign affairs were entirely his own
composition.

“Of course the whole thing had to be kept as quiet as
possible; an interim staff, pledged to secrecy, was appointed to
keep the paper going till the pining captives could be sought
out, ransomed, and brought home, in twos and threes to escape
notice, and gradually things were put back on their old
footing.  The articles on foreign affairs reverted to the
wonted traditions of the paper.”

“But,” interposed the nephew, “how on earth
did the boy account to the relatives all those months for the
non-appearance—”

“That,” said Sir Lulworth, “was the most
brilliant stroke of all.  To the wife or nearest relative of
each of the missing men he forwarded a letter, copying the
handwriting of the supposed writer as well as he could, and
making excuses about vile pens and ink; in each letter he told
the same story, varying only the locality, to the effect that the
writer, alone of the whole party, was unable to tear himself away
from the wild liberty and allurements of Eastern life, and was
going to spend several months roaming in some selected
region.  Many of the wives started off immediately in
pursuit of their errant husbands, and it took the Government a
considerable time and much trouble to reclaim them from their
fruitless quests along the banks of the Oxus, the Gobi Desert,
the Orenburg steppe, and other outlandish places.  One of
them, I believe, is still lost somewhere in the Tigris
Valley.”

Sophie Chattel-Monkheim was a Socialist by conviction and a
Chattel-Monkheim by marriage.  The particular member of that
wealthy family whom she had married was rich, even as his
relatives counted riches.  Sophie had very advanced and
decided views as to the distribution of money: it was a pleasing
and fortunate circumstance that she also had the money. 
When she inveighed eloquently against the evils of capitalism at
drawing-room meetings and Fabian conferences she was conscious of
a comfortable feeling that the system, with all its inequalities
and iniquities, would probably last her time.  It is one of
the consolations of middle-aged reformers that the good they
inculcate must live after them if it is to live at all.

On a certain spring evening, somewhere towards the
dinner-hour, Sophie sat tranquilly between her mirror and her
maid, undergoing the process of having her hair built into an
elaborate reflection of the prevailing fashion.  She was
hedged round with a great peace, the peace of one who has
attained a desired end with much effort and perseverance, and who
has found it still eminently desirable in its attainment. 
The Duke of Syria had consented to come beneath her roof as a
guest, was even now installed beneath her roof, and would shortly
be sitting at her dining-table.  As a good Socialist, Sophie
disapproved of social distinctions, and derided the idea of a
princely caste, but if there were to be these artificial
gradations of rank and dignity she was pleased and anxious to
have an exalted specimen of an exalted order included in her
house-party.  She was broad-minded enough to love the sinner
while hating the sin—not that she entertained any warm
feeling of personal affection for the Duke of Syria, who was a
comparative stranger, but still, as Duke of Syria, he was very,
very welcome beneath her roof.  She could not have explained
why, but no one was likely to ask her for an explanation, and
most hostesses envied her.

“You must surpass yourself to-night, Richardson,”
she said complacently to her maid; “I must be looking my
very best.  We must all surpass ourselves.”

The maid said nothing, but from the concentrated look in her
eyes and the deft play of her fingers it was evident that she was
beset with the ambition to surpass herself.

Richardson held a hurried conference with an invisible
messenger at the door; when she returned there was noticeable a
curious listlessness in place of her hitherto alert manner.

“Yes, madame.  Before he became an omelette
specialist he was a valet, and he was one of the strike-breakers
in the great strike at Lord Grimford’s two years ago. 
As soon as the household staff here learned that you had engaged
him they resolved to ‘down tools’ as a protest. 
They haven’t got any grievance against you personally, but
they demand that Gaspare should be immediately
dismissed.”

“But,” protested Sophie, “he is the only man
in England who understands how to make a Byzantine
omelette.  I engaged him specially for the Duke of
Syria’s visit, and it would be impossible to replace him at
short notice.  I should have to send to Paris, and the Duke
loves Byzantine omelettes.  It was the one thing we talked
about coming from the station.”

“This is too awful,” said Sophie; “a strike
of servants at a moment like this, with the Duke of Syria staying
in the house.  Something must be done immediately. 
Quick, finish my hair and I’ll go and see what I can do to
bring them round.”

“I can’t finish your hair, madame,” said
Richardson quietly, but with immense decision.  “I
belong to the union and I can’t do another
half-minute’s work till the strike is settled. 
I’m sorry to be disobliging.”

“But this is inhuman!” exclaimed Sophie
tragically; “I’ve always been a model mistress and
I’ve refused to employ any but union servants, and this is
the result.  I can’t finish my hair myself; I
don’t know how to.  What am I to do?  It’s
wicked!”

“Wicked is the word,” said Richardson;
“I’m a good Conservative and I’ve no patience
with this Socialist foolery, asking your pardon.  It’s
tyranny, that’s what it is, all along the line, but
I’ve my living to make, same as other people, and
I’ve got to belong to the union.  I couldn’t
touch another hair-pin without a strike permit, not if you was to
double my wages.”

“Here’s a nice affair,” she screamed,
“a strike of household servants without a moment’s
warning, and I’m left like this!  I can’t appear
in public in this condition.”

“Dinner!” snorted Catherine, “what on earth
is the good of dinner when none of us will be able to appear at
it?  Look at your hair—and look at me! or rather,
don’t.”

“I know it’s difficult to manage without a maid;
can’t your husband be any help to you?” asked Sophie
despairingly.

“Henry?  He’s in worse case than any of
us.  His man is the only person who really understands that
ridiculous new-fangled Turkish bath that he insists on taking
with him everywhere.”

“Surely he could do without a Turkish bath for one
evening,” said Sophie; “I can’t appear without
hair, but a Turkish bath is a luxury.”

“My good woman,” said Catherine, speaking with a
fearful intensity, “Henry was in the bath when the strike
started.  In it, do you understand?  He’s there
now.”

“He doesn’t know how to.  Every time he pulls
the lever marked ‘release’ he only releases hot
steam.  There are two kinds of steam in the bath,
‘bearable’ and ‘scarcely bearable’; he
has released them both.  By this time I’m probably a
widow.”

“I simply can’t send away Gaspare,” wailed
Sophie; “I should never be able to secure another omelette
specialist.”

“Any difficulty that I may experience in securing
another husband is of course a trifle beneath anyone’s
consideration,” said Catherine bitterly.

Sophie capitulated.  “Go,” she said to
Richardson, “and tell the Strike Committee, or whoever are
directing this affair, that Gaspare is herewith dismissed. 
And ask Gaspare to see me presently in the library, when I will
pay him what is due to him and make what excuses I can; and then
fly back and finish my hair.”

Some half an hour later Sophie marshalled her guests in the
Grand Salon preparatory to the formal march to the
dining-room.  Except that Henry Malsom was of the ripe
raspberry tint that one sometimes sees at private theatricals
representing the human complexion, there was little outward sign
among those assembled of the crisis that had just been
encountered and surmounted.  But the tension had been too
stupefying while it lasted not to leave some mental effects
behind it.  Sophie talked at random to her illustrious
guest, and found her eyes straying with increasing frequency
towards the great doors through which would presently come the
blessed announcement that dinner was served.  Now and again
she glanced mirror-ward at the reflection of her wonderfully
coiffed hair, as an insurance underwriter might gaze thankfully
at an overdue vessel that had ridden safely into harbour in the
wake of a devastating hurricane.  Then the doors opened and
the welcome figure of the butler entered the room.  But he
made no general announcement of a banquet in readiness, and the
doors closed behind him; his message was for Sophie alone.

“There is no dinner, madame,” he said gravely;
“the kitchen staff have ‘downed tools.’ 
Gaspare belongs to the Union of Cooks and Kitchen Employees, and
as soon as they heard of his summary dismissal at a
moment’s notice they struck work.  They demand his
instant reinstatement and an apology to the union.  I may
add, madame, that they are very firm; I’ve been obliged
even to hand back the dinner rolls that were already on the
table.”

After the lapse of eighteen months Sophie Chattel-Monkheim is
beginning to go about again among her old haunts and associates,
but she still has to be very careful.  The doctors will not
let her attend anything at all exciting, such as a drawing-room
meeting or a Fabian conference; it is doubtful, indeed, whether
she wants to.

“It’s a good thing that Saint Valentine’s
Day has dropped out of vogue,” said Mrs. Thackenbury;
“what with Christmas and New Year and Easter, not to speak
of birthdays, there are quite enough remembrance days as it
is.  I tried to save myself trouble at Christmas by just
sending flowers to all my friends, but it wouldn’t work;
Gertrude has eleven hot-houses and about thirty gardeners, so it
would have been ridiculous to send flowers to her, and Milly has
just started a florist’s shop, so it was equally out of the
question there.  The stress of having to decide in a hurry
what to give to Gertrude and Milly just when I thought I’d
got the whole question nicely off my mind completely ruined my
Christmas, and then the awful monotony of the letters of thanks:
‘Thank you so much for your lovely flowers.  It was so
good of you to think of me.’  Of course in the
majority of cases I hadn’t thought about the recipients at
all; their names were down in my list of ‘people who must
not be left out.’  If I trusted to remembering them
there would be some awful sins of omission.”

“The trouble is,” said Clovis to his aunt,
“all these days of intrusive remembrance harp so
persistently on one aspect of human nature and entirely ignore
the other; that is why they become so perfunctory and
artificial.  At Christmas and New Year you are emboldened
and encouraged by convention to send gushing messages of
optimistic goodwill and servile affection to people whom you
would scarcely ask to lunch unless some one else had failed you
at the last moment; if you are supping at a restaurant on New
Year’s Eve you are permitted and expected to join hands and
sing ‘For Auld Lang Syne’ with strangers whom you
have never seen before and never want to see again.  But no
licence is allowed in the opposite direction.”

“There is no outlet for demonstrating your feelings
towards people whom you simply loathe.  That is really the
crying need of our modern civilisation.  Just think how
jolly it would be if a recognised day were set apart for the
paying off of old scores and grudges, a day when one could lay
oneself out to be gracefully vindictive to a carefully treasured
list of ‘people who must not be let off.’  I
remember when I was at a private school we had one day, the last
Monday of the term I think it was, consecrated to the settlement
of feuds and grudges; of course we did not appreciate it as much
as it deserved, because, after all, any day of the term could be
used for that purpose.  Still, if one had chastised a
smaller boy for being cheeky weeks before, one was always
permitted on that day to recall the episode to his memory by
chastising him again.  That is what the French call
reconstructing the crime.”

“I should call it reconstructing the punishment,”
said Mrs. Thackenbury; “and, anyhow, I don’t see how
you could introduce a system of primitive schoolboy vengeance
into civilised adult life.  We haven’t outgrown our
passions, but we are supposed to have learned how to keep them
within strictly decorous limits.”

“Of course the thing would have to be done furtively and
politely,” said Clovis; “the charm of it would be
that it would never be perfunctory like the other thing. 
Now, for instance, you say to yourself: ‘I must show the
Webleys some attention at Christmas, they were kind to dear
Bertie at Bournemouth,’ and you send them a calendar, and
daily for six days after Christmas the male Webley asks the
female Webley if she has remembered to thank you for the calendar
you sent them.  Well, transplant that idea to the other and
more human side of your nature, and say to yourself: ‘Next
Thursday is Nemesis Day; what on earth can I do to those odious
people next door who made such an absurd fuss when Ping Yang bit
their youngest child?’  Then you’d get up
awfully early on the allotted day and climb over into their
garden and dig for truffles on their tennis court with a good
gardening fork, choosing, of course, that part of the court that
was screened from observation by the laurel bushes.  You
wouldn’t find any truffles but you would find a great
peace, such as no amount of present-giving could ever
bestow.”

“I shouldn’t,” said Mrs. Thackenbury, though
her air of protest sounded a bit forced; “I should feel
rather a worm for doing such a thing.”

“You exaggerate the power of upheaval which a worm would
be able to bring into play in the limited time available,”
said Clovis; “if you put in a strenuous ten minutes with a
really useful fork, the result ought to suggest the operations of
an unusually masterful mole or a badger in a hurry.”

“Of course they would,” said Clovis; “that
would be half the satisfaction of the thing, just as you like
people at Christmas to know what presents or cards you’ve
sent them.  The thing would be much easier to manage, of
course, when you were on outwardly friendly terms with the object
of your dislike.  That greedy little Agnes Blaik, for
instance, who thinks of nothing but her food, it would be quite
simple to ask her to a picnic in some wild woodland spot and lose
her just before lunch was served; when you found her again every
morsel of food could have been eaten up.”

“It would require no ordinary human strategy to lose
Agnes Blaik when luncheon was imminent: in fact, I don’t
believe it could be done.”

“Then have all the other guests, people whom you
dislike, and lose the luncheon.  It could have been sent by
accident in the wrong direction.”

“For them, but not for you,” said Clovis;
“you would have had an early and comforting lunch before
you started, and you could improve the occasion by mentioning in
detail the items of the missing banquet—the lobster Newburg
and the egg mayonnaise, and the curry that was to have been
heated in a chafing-dish.  Agnes Blaik would be delirious
long before you got to the list of wines, and in the long
interval of waiting, before they had quite abandoned hope of the
lunch turning up, you could induce them to play silly games, such
as that idiotic one of ‘the Lord Mayor’s
dinner-party,’ in which every one has to choose the name of
a dish and do something futile when it is called out.  In
this case they would probably burst into tears when their dish is
mentioned.  It would be a heavenly picnic.”

Mrs. Thackenbury was silent for a moment; she was probably
making a mental list of the people she would like to invite to
the Duke Humphrey picnic.  Presently she asked: “And
that odious young man, Waldo Plubley, who is always coddling
himself—have you thought of anything that one could do to
him?”  Evidently she was beginning to see the
possibilities of Nemesis Day.

“If there was anything like a general observance of the
festival,” said Clovis, “Waldo would be in such
demand that you would have to bespeak him weeks beforehand, and
even then, if there were an east wind blowing or a cloud or two
in the sky he might be too careful of his precious self to come
out.  It would be rather jolly if you could lure him into a
hammock in the orchard, just near the spot where there is a
wasps’ nest every summer.  A comfortable hammock on a
warm afternoon would appeal to his indolent tastes, and then,
when he was getting drowsy, a lighted fusee thrown into the nest
would bring the wasps out in an indignant mass, and they would
soon find a ‘home away from home’ on Waldo’s
fat body.  It takes some doing to get out of a hammock in a
hurry.”

“Waldo is one of those people who would be enormously
improved by death,” said Clovis; “but if you
didn’t want to go as far as that, you could have some wet
straw ready to hand, and set it alight under the hammock at the
same time that the fusee was thrown into the nest; the smoke
would keep all but the most militant of the wasps just outside
the stinging line, and as long as Waldo remained within its
protection he would escape serious damage, and could be
eventually restored to his mother, kippered all over and swollen
in places, but still perfectly recognisable.”

It was the season of sales.  The august establishment of
Walpurgis and Nettlepink had lowered its prices for an entire
week as a concession to trade observances, much as an
Arch-duchess might protestingly contract an attack of influenza
for the unsatisfactory reason that influenza was locally
prevalent.  Adela Chemping, who considered herself in some
measure superior to the allurements of an ordinary bargain sale,
made a point of attending the reduction week at Walpurgis and
Nettlepink’s.

Which showed that beneath her surface strength of character
there flowed a gracious undercurrent of human weakness.

With a view to providing herself with a male escort Mrs.
Chemping had invited her youngest nephew to accompany her on the
first day of the shopping expedition, throwing in the additional
allurement of a cinematograph theatre and the prospect of light
refreshment.  As Cyprian was not yet eighteen she hoped he
might not have reached that stage in masculine development when
parcel-carrying is looked on as a thing abhorrent.

“Meet me just outside the floral department,” she
wrote to him, “and don’t be a moment later than
eleven.”

Cyprian was a boy who carried with him through early life the
wondering look of a dreamer, the eyes of one who sees things that
are not visible to ordinary mortals, and invests the commonplace
things of this world with qualities unsuspected by plainer
folk—the eyes of a poet or a house agent.  He was
quietly dressed—that sartorial quietude which frequently
accompanies early adolescence, and is usually attributed by
novel-writers to the influence of a widowed mother.  His
hair was brushed back in a smoothness as of ribbon seaweed and
seamed with a narrow furrow that scarcely aimed at being a
parting.  His aunt particularly noted this item of his
toilet when they met at the appointed rendezvous, because he was
standing waiting for her bareheaded.

“You are not going to be what they call a Nut, are
you?” she inquired with some anxiety, partly with the idea
that a Nut would be an extravagance which her sister’s
small household would scarcely be justified in incurring, partly,
perhaps, with the instinctive apprehension that a Nut, even in
its embryo stage, would refuse to carry parcels.

“I didn’t bring a hat,” he said,
“because it is such a nuisance when one is shopping; I mean
it is so awkward if one meets anyone one knows and has to take
one’s hat off when one’s hands are full of
parcels.  If one hasn’t got a hat on one can’t
take it off.”

“It is more orthodox to wear a hat,” she observed,
and then turned her attention briskly to the business in
hand.

“We will go first to the table-linen counter,” she
said, leading the way in that direction; “I should like to
look at some napkins.”

The wondering look deepened in Cyprian’s eyes as he
followed his aunt; he belonged to a generation that is supposed
to be over-fond of the rôle of mere spectator, but looking
at napkins that one did not mean to buy was a pleasure beyond his
comprehension.  Mrs. Chemping held one or two napkins up to
the light and stared fixedly at them, as though she half expected
to find some revolutionary cypher written on them in scarcely
visible ink; then she suddenly broke away in the direction of the
glassware department.

“Millicent asked me to get her a couple of decanters if
there were any going really cheap,” she explained on the
way, “and I really do want a salad bowl.  I can come
back to the napkins later on.”

She handled and scrutinised a large number of decanters and a
long series of salad bowls, and finally bought seven
chrysanthemum vases.

“No one uses that kind of vase nowadays,” she
informed Cyprian, “but they will do for presents next
Christmas.”

Two sunshades that were marked down to a price that Mrs.
Chemping considered absurdly cheap were added to her
purchases.

“One of them will do for Ruth Colson; she is going out
to the Malay States, and a sunshade will always be useful
there.  And I must get her some thin writing paper.  It
takes up no room in one’s baggage.”

Mrs. Chemping bought stacks of writing paper; it was so cheap,
and it went so flat in a trunk or portmanteau.  She also
bought a few envelopes—envelopes somehow seemed rather an
extragavance compared with notepaper.

“We haven’t any mauve,” said the assistant,
“but we’ve two shades of green and a darker shade of
grey.”

Cyprian behaved in an exemplary fashion in the refreshment
department, and cheerfully accepted a fish cake and a mince pie
and a small cup of coffee as adequate restoratives after two
hours of concentrated shopping.  He was adamant, however, in
resisting his aunt’s suggestion that a hat should be bought
for him at the counter where men’s headwear was being
disposed of at temptingly reduced prices.

“I’ve got as many hats as I want at home,”
he said, “and besides, it rumples one’s hair so,
trying them on.”

Perhaps he was going to develop into a Nut after all.  It
was a disquieting symptom that he left all the parcels in charge
of the cloak-room attendant.

“We shall be getting more parcels presently,” he
said, “so we need not collect these till we have finished
our shopping.”

His aunt was doubtfully appeased; some of the pleasure and
excitement of a shopping expedition seemed to evaporate when one
was deprived of immediate personal contact with one’s
purchases.

“I’m going to look at those napkins again,”
she said, as they descended the stairs to the ground floor. 
“You need not come,” she added, as the dreaming look
in the boy’s eyes changed for a moment into one of mute
protest, “you can meet me afterwards in the cutlery
department; I’ve just remembered that I haven’t a
corkscrew in the house that can be depended on.”

Cyprian was not to be found in the cutlery department when his
aunt in due course arrived there, but in the crush and bustle of
anxious shoppers and busy attendants it was an easy matter to
miss anyone.  It was in the leather goods department some
quarter of an hour later that Adela Chemping caught sight of her
nephew, separated from her by a rampart of suit-cases and
portmanteaux and hemmed in by the jostling crush of human beings
that now invaded every corner of the great shopping
emporium.  She was just in time to witness a pardonable but
rather embarrassing mistake on the part of a lady who had
wriggled her way with unstayable determination towards the
bareheaded Cyprian, and was now breathlessly demanding the sale
price of a handbag which had taken her fancy.

“There now,” exclaimed Adela to herself,
“she takes him for one of the shop assistants because he
hasn’t got a hat on.  I wonder it hasn’t
happened before.”

Perhaps it had.  Cyprian, at any rate, seemed neither
startled nor embarrassed by the error into which the good lady
had fallen.  Examining the ticket on the bag, he announced
in a clear, dispassionate voice:

“Black seal, thirty-four shillings, marked down to
twenty-eight.  As a matter of fact, we are clearing them out
at a special reduction price of twenty-six shillings.  They
are going off rather fast.”

“Will you take it as it is?” asked Cyprian;
“it will be a matter of a few minutes to get it wrapped up,
there is such a crush.”

“Never mind, I’ll take it as it is,” said
the purchaser, clutching her treasure and counting the money into
Cyprian’s palm.

When she next came across Cyprian he was standing in the crowd
that pushed and jostled around the counters of the book
department.  The dream look was deeper than ever in his
eyes.  He had just sold two books of devotion to an elderly
Canon.

“I’ve just been to see old Betsy Mullen,”
announced Vera to her aunt, Mrs. Bebberly Cumble; “she
seems in rather a bad way about her rent.  She owes about
fifteen weeks of it, and says she doesn’t know where any of
it is to come from.”

“Betsy Mullen always is in difficulties with her rent,
and the more people help her with it the less she troubles about
it,” said the aunt.  “I certainly am not going
to assist her any more.  The fact is, she will have to go
into a smaller and cheaper cottage; there are several to be had
at the other end of the village for half the rent that she is
paying, or supposed to be paying, now.  I told her a year
ago that she ought to move.”

“But she wouldn’t get such a nice garden anywhere
else,” protested Vera, “and there’s such a
jolly quince tree in the corner.  I don’t suppose
there’s another quince tree in the whole parish.  And
she never makes any quince jam; I think to have a quince tree and
not to make quince jam shows such strength of character. 
Oh, she can’t possibly move away from that
garden.”

“When one is sixteen,” said Mrs. Bebberly Cumble
severely, “one talks of things being impossible which are
merely uncongenial.  It is not only possible but it is
desirable that Betsy Mullen should move into smaller quarters;
she has scarcely enough furniture to fill that big
cottage.”

“As far as value goes,” said Vera after a short
pause, “there is more in Betsy’s cottage than in any
other house for miles round.”

“I’m not talking about anything that belongs to
Betsy herself,” said Vera darkly; “but, of course,
you don’t know what I know, and I don’t suppose I
ought to tell you.”

“You must tell me at once,” exclaimed the aunt,
her senses leaping into alertness like those of a terrier
suddenly exchanging a bored drowsiness for the lively
anticipation of an immediate rat hunt.

“I’m perfectly certain that I oughtn’t to
tell you anything about it,” said Vera, “but, then, I
often do things that I oughtn’t to do.”

“I should be the last person to suggest that you should
do anything that you ought not to do to—” began Mrs.
Bebberly Cumble impressively.

“And I am always swayed by the last person who speaks to
me,” admitted Vera, “so I’ll do what I ought
not to do and tell you.”

Mrs. Bebberley Cumble thrust a very pardonable sense of
exasperation into the background of her mind and demanded
impatiently:

“It’s hardly fair to say that I’ve
made a fuss about it,” said Vera; “this is the first
time I’ve mentioned the matter, but there’s been no
end of trouble and mystery and newspaper speculation about
it.  It’s rather amusing to think of the columns of
conjecture in the Press and the police and detectives hunting
about everywhere at home and abroad, and all the while that
innocent-looking little cottage has held the secret.”

“You don’t mean to say it’s the Louvre
picture, La Something or other, the woman with the smile, that
disappeared about two years ago?” exclaimed the aunt with
rising excitement.

“Oh no, not that,” said Vera, “but something
quite as important and just as mysterious—if anything,
rather more scandalous.”

“Of course Betsy hasn’t an idea as to what they
are,” said Vera; “she just knows that they are
something valuable and that she must keep quiet about them. 
I found out quite by accident what they were and how they came to
be there.  You see, the people who had them were at their
wits’ end to know where to stow them away for safe keeping,
and some one who was motoring through the village was struck by
the snug loneliness of the cottage and thought it would be just
the thing.  Mrs. Lamper arranged the matter with Betsy and
smuggled the things in.”

“I am quite aware that she takes soup and flannel and
improving literature to the poorer cottagers,” said Mrs.
Bebberly Cumble, “but that is hardly the same sort of thing
as disposing of stolen goods, and she must have known something
about their history; anyone who reads the papers, even casually,
must have been aware of the theft, and I should think the things
were not hard to recognise.  Mrs. Lamper has always had the
reputation of being a very conscientious woman.”

“Of course she was screening some one else,” said
Vera.  “A remarkable feature of the affair is the
extraordinary number of quite respectable people who have
involved themselves in its meshes by trying to shield
others.  You would be really astonished if you knew some of
the names of the individuals mixed up in it, and I don’t
suppose a tithe of them know who the original culprits were; and
now I’ve got you entangled in the mess by letting you into
the secret of the cottage.”

“You most certainly have not entangled me,” said
Mrs. Bebberly Cumble indignantly.  “I have no
intention of shielding anybody.  The police must know about
it at once; a theft is a theft, whoever is involved.  If
respectable people choose to turn themselves into receivers and
disposers of stolen goods, well, they’ve ceased to be
respectable, that’s all.  I shall telephone
immediately—”

“Oh, aunt,” said Vera reproachfully, “it
would break the poor Canon’s heart if Cuthbert were to be
involved in a scandal of this sort.  You know it
would.”

“Of course I know you think a lot of him, and that
he’s engaged to marry Beatrice, and that it will be a
frightfully good match, and that he’s your ideal of what a
son-in-law ought to be.  All the same, it was
Cuthbert’s idea to stow the things away in the cottage, and
it was his motor that brought them.  He was only doing it to
help his friend Pegginson, you know—the Quaker man, who is
always agitating for a smaller Navy.  I forget how he got
involved in it.  I warned you that there were lots of quite
respectable people mixed up in it, didn’t I? 
That’s what I meant when I said it would be impossible for
old Betsy to leave the cottage; the things take up a good bit of
room, and she couldn’t go carrying them about with her
other goods and chattels without attracting notice.  Of
course if she were to fall ill and die it would be equally
unfortunate.  Her mother lived to be over ninety, she tells
me, so with due care and an absence of worry she ought to last
for another dozen years at least.  By that time perhaps some
other arrangements will have been made for disposing of the
wretched things.”

“The wedding isn’t till next year,” said
Vera, in recounting the story to her best girl friend, “and
meanwhile old Betsy is living rent free, with soup twice a week
and my aunt’s doctor to see her whenever she has a finger
ache.”

“Oh, about the jewels?  I invented that
part,” explained Vera; “I mean the mystery was where
old Betsy’s arrears of rent were to come from; and she
would have hated leaving that jolly quince tree.”

“I don’t specialise in it,” said Clovis;
“it’s all right while you’re doing it, but the
after-effects are sometimes so disconcerting—the mute
reproachful looks of the people you’ve aided and abetted in
matrimonial experiments.  It’s as bad as selling a man
a horse with half a dozen latent vices and watching him discover
them piecemeal in the course of the hunting season.  I
suppose you’re thinking of the Coulterneb girl. 
She’s certainly jolly, and quite all right as far as looks
go, and I believe a certain amount of money adheres to her. 
What I don’t see is how you will ever manage to propose to
her.  In all the time I’ve known her I don’t
remember her to have stopped talking for three consecutive
minutes.  You’ll have to race her six times round the
grass paddock for a bet, and then blurt your proposal out before
she’s got her wind back.  The paddock is laid up for
hay, but if you’re really in love with her you won’t
let a consideration of that sort stop you, especially as
it’s not your hay.”

“I think I could manage the proposing part right
enough,” said Hugo, “if I could count on being left
alone with her for four or five hours.  The trouble is that
I’m not likely to get anything like that amount of
grace.  That fellow Lanner is showing signs of interesting
himself in the same quarter.  He’s quite
heartbreakingly rich and is rather a swell in his way; in fact,
our hostess is obviously a bit flattered at having him
here.  If she gets wind of the fact that he’s inclined
to be attracted by Betty Coulterneb she’ll think it a
splendid match and throw them into each other’s arms all
day long, and then where will my opportunities come in?  My
one anxiety is to keep him out of the girl’s way as much as
possible, and if you could help me—”

“If you want me to trot Lanner round the countryside,
inspecting alleged Roman remains and studying local methods of
bee culture and crop raising, I’m afraid I can’t
oblige you,” said Clovis.  “You see, he’s
taken something like an aversion to me since the other night in
the smoking-room.”

“He trotted out some well-worn chestnut as the latest
thing in good stories, and I remarked, quite innocently, that I
never could remember whether it was George II. or James II. who
was so fond of that particular story, and now he regards me with
politely-draped dislike.  I’ll do my best for you, if
the opportunity arises, but it will have to be in a roundabout,
impersonal manner.”

“It’s so nice having Mr. Lanner here,”
confided Mrs. Olston to Clovis the next afternoon;
“he’s always been engaged when I’ve asked him
before.  Such a nice man; he really ought to be married to
some nice girl.  Between you and me, I have an idea that he
came down here for a certain reason.”

“For what he can get?” said the hostess
with a touch of indignation in her voice; “what do you
mean?  He’s a very rich man.  What should he want
to get here?”

“He has one ruling passion,” said Clovis,
“and there’s something he can get here that is not to
be had for love nor for money anywhere else in the country, as
far as I know.”

“Egg-collecting,” said Clovis.  “He has
agents all over the world getting rare eggs for him, and his
collection is one of the finest in Europe; but his great ambition
is to collect his treasures personally.  He stops at no
expense nor trouble to achieve that end.”

“Good heavens!  The buzzards, the rough-legged
buzzards!” exclaimed Mrs. Olston; “you don’t
think he’s going to raid their nest?”

“What do you think yourself?” asked Clovis;
“the only pair of rough-legged buzzards known to breed in
this country are nesting in your woods.  Very few people
know about them, but as a member of the league for protecting
rare birds that information would be at his disposal.  I
came down in the train with him, and I noticed that a bulky
volume of Dresser’s ‘Birds of Europe’ was one
of the requisites that he had packed in his travelling-kit. 
It was the volume dealing with short-winged hawks and
buzzards.”

“This is appalling,” said Mrs. Olston; “my
husband would never forgive me if anything happened to those
birds.  They’ve been seen about the woods for the last
year or two, but this is the first time they’ve
nested.  As you say, they are almost the only pair known to
be breeding in the whole of Great Britain; and now their nest is
going to be harried by a guest staying under my roof.  I
must do something to stop it.  Do you think if I appealed to
him—”

“There is a story going about, which I fancy is true in
most of its details, of something that happened not long ago
somewhere on the coast of the Sea of Marmora, in which our friend
had a hand.  A Syrian nightjar, or some such bird, was known
to be breeding in the olive gardens of a rich Armenian, who for
some reason or other wouldn’t allow Lanner to go in and
take the eggs, though he offered cash down for the
permission.  The Armenian was found beaten nearly to death a
day or two later, and his fences levelled.  It was assumed
to be a case of Mussulman aggression, and noted as such in all
the Consular reports, but the eggs are in the Lanner
collection.  No, I don’t think I should appeal to his
better feelings if I were you.”

“I must do something,” said Mrs. Olston tearfully;
“my husband’s parting words when he went off to
Norway were an injunction to see that those birds were not
disturbed, and he’s asked about them every time he’s
written.  Do suggest something.”

“No; round Lanner.  He can’t find his way
through those woods by night, and you could arrange that you or
Evelyn or Jack or the German governess should be by his side in
relays all day long.  A fellow guest he could get rid of,
but he couldn’t very well shake off members of the
household, and even the most determined collector would hardly go
climbing after forbidden buzzards’ eggs with a German
governess hanging round his neck, so to speak.”

Lanner, who had been lazily watching for an opportunity for
prosecuting his courtship of the Coulterneb girl, found presently
that his chances of getting her to himself for ten minutes even
were non-existent.  If the girl was ever alone he never
was.  His hostess had changed suddenly, as far as he was
concerned, from the desirable type that lets her guests do
nothing in the way that best pleases them, to the sort that drags
them over the ground like so many harrows.  She showed him
the herb garden and the greenhouses, the village church, some
water-colour sketches that her sister had done in Corsica, and
the place where it was hoped that celery would grow later in the
year.

He was shown all the Aylesbury ducklings and the row of wooden
hives where there would have been bees if there had not been bee
disease.  He was also taken to the end of a long lane and
shown a distant mound whereon local tradition reported that the
Danes had once pitched a camp.  And when his hostess had to
desert him temporarily for other duties he would find Evelyn
walking solemnly by his side.  Evelyn was fourteen and
talked chiefly about good and evil, and of how much one might
accomplish in the way of regenerating the world if one was
thoroughly determined to do one’s utmost.  It was
generally rather a relief when she was displaced by Jack, who was
nine years old, and talked exclusively about the Balkan War
without throwing any fresh light on its political or military
history.  The German governess told Lanner more about
Schiller than he had ever heard in his life about any one person;
it was perhaps his own fault for having told her that he was not
interested in Goethe.  When the governess went off picket
duty the hostess was again on hand with a not-to-be-gainsaid
invitation to visit the cottage of an old woman who remembered
Charles James Fox; the woman had been dead for two or three
years, but the cottage was still there.  Lanner was called
back to town earlier than he had originally intended.

Hugo did not bring off his affair with Betty Coulterneb. 
Whether she refused him or whether, as was more generally
supposed, he did not get a chance of saying three consecutive
words, has never been exactly ascertained.  Anyhow, she is
still the jolly Coulterneb girl.

“Ronnie is a great trial to me,” said Mrs. Attray
plaintively.  “Only eighteen years old last February
and already a confirmed gambler.  I am sure I don’t
know where he inherits it from; his father never touched cards,
and you know how little I play—a game of bridge on
Wednesday afternoons in the winter, for three-pence a hundred,
and even that I shouldn’t do if it wasn’t that Edith
always wants a fourth and would be certain to ask that detestable
Jenkinham woman if she couldn’t get me.  I would much
rather sit and talk any day than play bridge; cards are such a
waste of time, I think.  But as to Ronnie, bridge and
baccarat and poker-patience are positively all that he thinks
about.  Of course I’ve done my best to stop it;
I’ve asked the Norridrums not to let him play cards when
he’s over there, but you might as well ask the Atlantic
Ocean to keep quiet for a crossing as expect them to bother about
a mother’s natural anxieties.”

“My dear,” said Mrs. Attray, “I don’t
want to offend them.  After all, they are my landlords and I
have to look to them for anything I want done about the place;
they were very accommodating about the new roof for the orchid
house.  And they lend me one of their cars when mine is out
of order; you know how often it gets out of order.”

“I don’t know how often,” said Eleanor,
“but it must happen very frequently.  Whenever I want
you to take me anywhere in your car I am always told that there
is something wrong with it, or else that the chauffeur has got
neuralgia and you don’t like to ask him to go
out.”

“He suffers quite a lot from neuralgia,” said Mrs.
Attray hastily.  “Anyhow,” she continued,
“you can understand that I don’t want to offend the
Norridrums.  Their household is the most rackety one in the
county, and I believe no one ever knows to an hour or two when
any particular meal will appear on the table or what it will
consist of when it does appear.”

“Still,” pursued Mrs. Attray, “whatever
their own home life may be, as landlords and neighbours they are
considerate and obliging, so I don’t want to quarrel with
them.  Besides, if Ronnie didn’t play cards there
he’d be playing somewhere else.”

“Firm?  I am firm,” exclaimed Mrs. Attray;
“I am more than firm—I am farseeing.  I’ve
done everything I can think of to prevent Ronnie from playing for
money.  I’ve stopped his allowance for the rest of the
year, so he can’t even gamble on credit, and I’ve
subscribed a lump sum to the church offertory in his name instead
of giving him instalments of small silver to put in the bag on
Sundays.  I wouldn’t even let him have the money to
tip the hunt servants with, but sent it by postal order.  He
was furiously sulky about it, but I reminded him of what happened
to the ten shillings that I gave him for the Young Men’s
Endeavour League ‘Self-Denial Week.’”

“Well, Ronnie did some preliminary endeavouring with it,
on his own account, in connection with the Grand National. 
If it had come off, as he expressed it, he would have given the
League twenty-five shillings and netted a comfortable commission
for himself; as it was, that ten shillings was one of the things
the League had to deny itself.  Since then I’ve been
careful not to let him have a penny piece in his
hands.”

“My dear, he’s done all that is to be done in that
direction already.  He’s got rid of his wrist-watch
and his hunting flask and both his cigarette cases, and I
shouldn’t be surprised if he’s wearing imitation-gold
sleeve links instead of those his Aunt Rhoda gave him on his
seventeenth birthday.  He can’t sell his clothes, of
course, except his winter overcoat, and I’ve locked that up
in the camphor cupboard on the pretext of preserving it from
moth.  I really don’t see what else he can raise money
on.  I consider that I’ve been both firm and
farseeing.”

“He was there yesterday afternoon and stayed to
dinner,” said Mrs. Attray.  “I don’t quite
know when he came home, but I fancy it was late.”

“Then depend on it he was gambling,” said Eleanor,
with the assured air of one who has few ideas and makes the most
of them.  “Late hours in the country always mean
gambling.”

“He can’t gamble if he has no money and no chance
of getting any,” argued Mrs. Attray; “even if one
plays for small stakes one must have a decent prospect of paying
one’s losses.”

“He may have sold some of the Amherst pheasant
chicks,” suggested Eleanor; “they would fetch about
ten or twelve shillings each, I daresay.”

“Ronnie wouldn’t do such a thing,” said Mrs.
Attray; “and anyhow I went and counted them this morning
and they’re all there.  No,” she continued, with
the quiet satisfaction that comes from a sense of painstaking and
merited achievement, “I fancy that Ronnie had to content
himself with the rôle of onlooker last night, as far as the
card-table was concerned.”

“Is that clock right?” asked Eleanor, whose eyes
had been straying restlessly towards the mantel-piece for some
little time; “lunch is usually so punctual in your
establishment.”

“Three minutes past the half-hour,” exclaimed Mrs.
Attray; “cook must be preparing something unusually
sumptuous in your honour.  I am not in the secret;
I’ve been out all the morning, you know.”

Eleanor smiled forgivingly.  A special effort by Mrs.
Attray’s cook was worth waiting a few minutes for.

As a matter of fact, the luncheon fare, when it made its tardy
appearance, was distinctly unworthy of the reputation which the
justly-treasured cook had built up for herself.  The soup
alone would have sufficed to cast a gloom over any meal that it
had inaugurated, and it was not redeemed by anything that
followed.  Eleanor said little, but when she spoke there was
a hint of tears in her voice that was far more eloquent than
outspoken denunciation would have been, and even the insouciant
Ronald showed traces of depression when he tasted the rognons
Saltikoff.

“Not quite the best luncheon I’ve enjoyed in your
house,” said Eleanor at last, when her final hope had
flickered out with the savoury.

“My dear, it’s the worst meal I’ve sat down
to for years,” said her hostess; “that last dish
tasted principally of red pepper and wet toast.  I’m
awfully sorry.  Is anything the matter in the kitchen,
Pellin?” she asked of the attendant maid.

“Well, ma’am, the new cook hadn’t hardly
time to see to things properly, coming in so sudden—”
commenced Pellin by way of explanation.

“What on earth do you mean?  What is Colonel
Norridrum’s cook doing in my kitchen—and where is my
cook?”

“Perhaps I can explain better than Pellin can,”
said Ronald hurriedly; “the fact is, I was dining at the
Norridrums’ yesterday, and they were wishing they had a
swell cook like yours, just for to-day and to-morrow, while
they’ve got some gourmet staying with them: their own cook
is no earthly good—well, you’ve seen what she turns
out when she’s at all flurried.  So I thought it would
be rather sporting to play them at baccarat for the loan of our
cook against a money stake, and I lost, that’s all.  I
have had rotten luck at baccarat all this year.”

The remainder of his explanation, of how he had assured the
cooks that the temporary transfer had his mother’s
sanction, and had smuggled the one out and the other in during
the maternal absence, was drowned in the outcry of scandalised
upbraiding.

“If I had sold the woman into slavery there
couldn’t have been a bigger fuss about it,” he
confided afterwards to Bertie Norridrum, “and Eleanor
Saxelby raged and ramped the louder of the two.  I tell you
what, I’ll bet you two of the Amherst pheasants to five
shillings that she refuses to have me as a partner at the croquet
tournament.  We’re drawn together, you
know.”

Marion Eggelby sat talking to Clovis on the only subject that
she ever willingly talked about—her offspring and their
varied perfections and accomplishments.  Clovis was not in
what could be called a receptive mood; the younger generation of
Eggelby, depicted in the glowing improbable colours of parent
impressionism, aroused in him no enthusiasm.  Mrs. Eggelby,
on the other hand, was furnished with enthusiasm enough for
two.

“You would like Eric,” she said, argumentatively
rather than hopefully.  Clovis had intimated very
unmistakably that he was unlikely to care extravagantly for
either Amy or Willie.  “Yes, I feel sure you would
like Eric.  Every one takes to him at once.  You know,
he always reminds me of that famous picture of the youthful
David—I forget who it’s by, but it’s very well
known.”

“That would be sufficient to set me against him, if I
saw much of him,” said Clovis.  “Just imagine at
auction bridge, for instance, when one was trying to concentrate
one’s mind on what one’s partner’s original
declaration had been, and to remember what suits one’s
opponents had originally discarded, what it would be like to have
some one persistently reminding one of a picture of the youthful
David.  It would be simply maddening.  If Eric did that
I should detest him.”

“None of my children have been brought up to play card
games,” said Mrs. Eggelby; “draughts and halma and
those sorts of games I encourage.  Eric is considered quite
a wonderful draughts-player.”

“You are strewing dreadful risks in the path of your
family,” said Clovis; “a friend of mine who is a
prison chaplain told me that among the worst criminal cases that
have come under his notice, men condemned to death or to long
periods of penal servitude, there was not a single
bridge-player.  On the other hand, he knew at least two
expert draughts-players among them.”

“I really don’t see what my boys have got to do
with the criminal classes,” said Mrs. Eggelby
resentfully.  “They have been most carefully brought
up, I can assure you that.”

“That shows that you were nervous as to how they would
turn out,” said Clovis.  “Now, my mother never
bothered about bringing me up.  She just saw to it that I
got whacked at decent intervals and was taught the difference
between right and wrong; there is some difference, you know, but
I’ve forgotten what it is.”

“Well, you see, I took up natural history and a whole
lot of other subjects at the same time, and one can’t
remember everything, can one?  I used to know the difference
between the Sardinian dormouse and the ordinary kind, and whether
the wry-neck arrives at our shores earlier than the cuckoo, or
the other way round, and how long the walrus takes in growing to
maturity; I daresay you knew all those sorts of things once, but
I bet you’ve forgotten them.”

“The fact that we’ve both forgotten them proves
that they are important,” said Clovis; “you must have
noticed that it’s always the important things that one
forgets, while the trivial, unnecessary facts of life stick in
one’s memory.  There’s my cousin, Editha
Clubberley, for instance; I can never forget that her birthday is
on the 12th of October.  It’s a matter of utter
indifference to me on what date her birthday falls, or whether
she was born at all; either fact seems to me absolutely trivial,
or unnecessary—I’ve heaps of other cousins to go on
with.  On the other hand, when I’m staying with
Hildegarde Shrubley I can never remember the important
circumstance whether her first husband got his unenviable
reputation on the Turf or the Stock Exchange, and that
uncertainty rules Sport and Finance out of the conversation at
once.  One can never mention travel, either, because her
second husband had to live permanently abroad.”

“No one who knows Hildegarde could possibly accuse her
of moving in a circle,” said Clovis; “her view of
life seems to be a non-stop run with an inexhaustible supply of
petrol.  If she can get some one else to pay for the petrol
so much the better.  I don’t mind confessing to you
that she has taught me more than any other woman I can think
of.”

“What kind of knowledge?” demanded Mrs. Eggelby,
with the air a jury might collectively wear when finding a
verdict without leaving the box.

“Well, among other things, she’s introduced me to
at least four different ways of cooking lobster,” said
Clovis gratefully.  “That, of course, wouldn’t
appeal to you; people who abstain from the pleasures of the
card-table never really appreciate the finer possibilities of the
dining-table.  I suppose their powers of enlightened
enjoyment get atrophied from disuse.”

“I daresay, if we knew more of her history, we should
find out that she’d often been ill before eating the
lobster.  Aren’t you concealing the fact that
she’d had measles and influenza and nervous headache and
hysteria, and other things that aunts do have, long before she
ate the lobster?  Aunts that have never known a day’s
illness are very rare; in fact, I don’t personally know of
any.  Of course if she ate it as a child of two weeks old it
might have been her first illness—and her last.  But
if that was the case I think you should have said so.”

“I must be going,” said Mrs. Eggelby, in a tone
which had been thoroughly sterilised of even perfunctory
regret.

“I have so enjoyed our little talk about Eric,” he
said; “I quite look forward to meeting him some
day.”

“Good-bye,” said Mrs. Eggelby frostily; the
supplementary remark which she made at the back of her throat
was—

Kenelm Jerton entered the dining-hall of the Golden Galleon
Hotel in the full crush of the luncheon hour.  Nearly every
seat was occupied, and small additional tables had been brought
in, where floor space permitted, to accommodate latecomers, with
the result that many of the tables were almost touching each
other.  Jerton was beckoned by a waiter to the only vacant
table that was discernible, and took his seat with the
uncomfortable and wholly groundless idea that nearly every one in
the room was staring at him.  He was a youngish man of
ordinary appearance, quiet of dress and unobtrusive of manner,
and he could never wholly rid himself of the idea that a fierce
light of public scrutiny beat on him as though he had been a
notability or a super-nut.  After he had ordered his lunch
there came the unavoidable interval of waiting, with nothing to
do but to stare at the flower-vase on his table and to be stared
at (in imagination) by several flappers, some maturer beings of
the same sex, and a satirical-looking Jew.  In order to
carry off the situation with some appearance of unconcern he
became spuriously interested in the contents of the
flower-vase.

“What is the name of these roses, d’you
know?” he asked the waiter.  The waiter was ready at
all times to conceal his ignorance concerning items of the
wine-list or menu; he was frankly ignorant as to the specific
name of the roses.

The voice came from a pleasant-faced, well-dressed young woman
who was sitting at a table that almost touched
Jerton’s.  He thanked her hurriedly and nervously for
the information, and made some inconsequent remark about the
flowers.

“It is a curious thing,” said the young woman,
that, “I should be able to tell you the name of those roses
without an effort of memory, because if you were to ask me my
name I should be utterly unable to give it to you.”

Jerton had not harboured the least intention of extending his
thirst for name-labels to his neighbour.  After her rather
remarkable announcement, however, he was obliged to say something
in the way of polite inquiry.

“Yes,” answered the lady, “I suppose it is a
case of partial loss of memory.  I was in the train coming
down here; my ticket told me that I had come from Victoria and
was bound for this place.  I had a couple of five-pound
notes and a sovereign on me, no visiting cards or any other means
of identification, and no idea as to who I am.  I can only
hazily recollect that I have a title; I am Lady
Somebody—beyond that my mind is a blank.”

“That is what I didn’t know.  I knew the name
of this hotel and made up my mind to come here, and when the
hotel porter who meets the trains asked if I had any luggage I
had to invent a dressing-bag and dress-basket; I could always
pretend that they had gone astray.  I gave him the name of
Smith, and presently he emerged from a confused pile of luggage
and passengers with a dressing-bag and dress-basket labelled
Kestrel-Smith.  I had to take them; I don’t see what
else I could have done.”

“Of course it was dreadful arriving at a strange hotel
with the name of Kestrel-Smith, but it would have been worse to
have arrived without luggage.  Anyhow, I hate causing
trouble.”

Jerton had visions of harassed railway officials and
distraught Kestrel-Smiths, but he made no attempt to clothe his
mental picture in words.  The lady continued her story.

“Naturally, none of my keys would fit the things, but I
told an intelligent page boy that I had lost my key-ring, and he
had the locks forced in a twinkling.  Rather too
intelligent, that boy; he will probably end in Dartmoor. 
The Kestrel-Smith toilet tools aren’t up to much, but they
are better than nothing.”

“If you feel sure that you have a title,” said
Jerton, “why not get hold of a peerage and go right through
it?”

“I tried that.  I skimmed through the list of the
House of Lords in ‘Whitaker,’ but a mere printed
string of names conveys awfully little to one, you know.  If
you were an army officer and had lost your identity you might
pore over the Army List for months without finding out who your
were.  I’m going on another tack; I’m trying to
find out by various little tests who I am not—that
will narrow the range of uncertainty down a bit.  You may
have noticed, for instance, that I’m lunching principally
off lobster Newburg.”

“It’s an extravagance, because it’s one of
the most expensive dishes on the menu, but at any rate it proves
that I’m not Lady Starping; she never touches shell-fish,
and poor Lady Braddleshrub has no digestion at all; if I am
her I shall certainly die in agony in the course of the
afternoon, and the duty of finding out who I am will devolve on
the press and the police and those sort of people; I shall be
past caring.  Lady Knewford doesn’t know one rose from
another and she hates men, so she wouldn’t have spoken to
you in any case; and Lady Mousehilton flirts with every man she
meets—I haven’t flirted with you, have I?”

“Oh, but, of course, there are heaps of them that I
couldn’t possibly be—women who’ve got
grandchildren or sons old enough to have celebrated their coming
of age.  I’ve only got to consider the ones about my
own age.  I tell you how you might help me this afternoon,
if you don’t mind; go through any of the back numbers of
Country Life and those sort of papers that you can find in
the smoking-room, and see if you come across my portrait with
infant son or anything of that sort.  It won’t take
you ten minutes.  I’ll meet you in the lounge about
tea-time.  Thanks awfully.”

And the Fair Unknown, having graciously pressed Jerton into
the search for her lost identity, rose and left the room. 
As she passed the young man’s table she halted for a moment
and whispered:

“Did you notice that I tipped the waiter a
shilling?  We can cross Lady Ulwight off the list; she would
have died rather than do that.”

At five o’clock Jerton made his way to the hotel lounge;
he had spent a diligent but fruitless quarter of an hour among
the illustrated weeklies in the smoking-room.  His new
acquaintance was seated at a small tea-table, with a waiter
hovering in attendance.

“Only negative information.  I’m not Lady
Befnal.  She disapproves dreadfully of any form of gambling,
so when I recognised a well-known book maker in the hotel lobby I
went and put a tenner on an unnamed filly by William the Third
out of Mitrovitza for the three-fifteen race.  I suppose the
fact of the animal being nameless was what attracted
me.”

“No, came in fourth, the most irritating thing a horse
can do when you’ve backed it win or place.  Anyhow, I
know now that I’m not Lady Befnal.”

“Well, yes, it has rather cleared me out,”
admitted the identity-seeker; “a florin is about all
I’ve got left on me.  The lobster Newburg made my
lunch rather an expensive one, and, of course, I had to tip that
boy for what he did to the Kestrel-Smith locks.  I’ve
got rather a useful idea, though.  I feel certain that I
belong to the Pivot Club; I’ll go back to town and ask the
hall porter there if there are any letters for me.  He knows
all the members by sight, and if there are any letters or
telephone messages waiting for me of course that will solve the
problem.  If he says there aren’t any I shall say:
‘You know who I am, don’t you?’ so I’ll
find out anyway.”

“Of course,” said the lady, when he hinted at the
obstacle, “there’s my fare back to town, and my bill
here and cabs and things.  If you’ll lend me three
pounds that ought to see me through comfortably.  Thanks
ever so.  Then there is the question of that luggage: I
don’t want to be saddled with that for the rest of my
life.  I’ll have it brought down to the hall and you
can pretend to mount guard over it while I’m writing a
letter.  Then I shall just slip away to the station, and you
can wander off to the smoking-room, and they can do what they
like with the things.  They’ll advertise them after a
bit and the owner can claim them.”

Jerton acquiesced in the manœuvre, and duly mounted
guard over the luggage while its temporary owner slipped
unobtrusively out of the hotel.  Her departure was not,
however, altogether unnoticed.  Two gentlemen were strolling
past Jerton, and one of them remarked to the other:

His promenade carried him out of earshot at the critical
moment when he was about to disclose the elusive identity. 
The Lady Who?  Jerton could scarcely run after a total
stranger, break into his conversation, and ask him for
information concerning a chance passer-by.  Besides, it was
desirable that he should keep up the appearance of looking after
the luggage.  In a minute or two, however, the important
personage, the man who knew, came strolling back alone. 
Jerton summoned up all his courage and waylaid him.

“I think I heard you say you knew the lady who went out
of the hotel a few minutes ago, a tall lady, dressed in
grey.  Excuse me for asking if you could tell me her name;
I’ve been talking to her for half an hour;
she—er—she knows all my people and seems to know me,
so I suppose I’ve met her somewhere before, but I’m
blest if I can put a name to her.  Could
you—?”

“Yes, she’s the Lady Champion at golf in my part
of the world.  An awful good sort, and goes about a good
deal in Society, but she has an awkward habit of losing her
memory every now and then, and gets into all sorts of
fixes.  She’s furious, too, if you make any allusion
to it afterwards.  Good day, sir.”

The stranger passed on his way, and before Jerton had had time
to assimilate his information he found his whole attention
centred on an angry-looking lady who was making loud and
fretful-seeming inquiries of the hotel clerks.

“Has any luggage been brought here from the station by
mistake, a dress-basket and dressing-case, with the name
Kestrel-Smith?  It can’t be traced anywhere.  I
saw it put in at Victoria, that I’ll swear. 
Why—there is my luggage! and the locks have been tampered
with!”

Theophil Eshley was an artist by profession, a cattle painter
by force of environment.  It is not to be supposed that he
lived on a ranche or a dairy farm, in an atmosphere pervaded with
horn and hoof, milking-stool, and branding-iron.  His home
was in a park-like, villa-dotted district that only just escaped
the reproach of being suburban.  On one side of his garden
there abutted a small, picturesque meadow, in which an
enterprising neighbour pastured some small picturesque cows of
the Channel Island persuasion.  At noonday in summertime the
cows stood knee-deep in tall meadow-grass under the shade of a
group of walnut trees, with the sunlight falling in dappled
patches on their mouse-sleek coats.  Eshley had conceived
and executed a dainty picture of two reposeful milch-cows in a
setting of walnut tree and meadow-grass and filtered sunbeam, and
the Royal Academy had duly exposed the same on the walls of its
Summer Exhibition.  The Royal Academy encourages orderly,
methodical habits in its children.  Eshley had painted a
successful and acceptable picture of cattle drowsing
picturesquely under walnut trees, and as he had begun, so, of
necessity, he went on.  His “Noontide Peace,” a
study of two dun cows under a walnut tree, was followed by
“A Mid-day Sanctuary,” a study of a walnut tree, with
two dun cows under it.  In due succession there came
“Where the Gad-Flies Cease from Troubling,”
“The Haven of the Herd,” and “A-dream in
Dairyland,” studies of walnut trees and dun cows.  His
two attempts to break away from his own tradition were signal
failures: “Turtle Doves alarmed by Sparrow-hawk” and
“Wolves on the Roman Campagna” came back to his
studio in the guise of abominable heresies, and Eshley climbed
back into grace and the public gaze with “A Shaded Nook
where Drowsy Milkers Dream.”

On a fine afternoon in late autumn he was putting some
finishing touches to a study of meadow weeds when his neighbour,
Adela Pingsford, assailed the outer door of his studio with loud
peremptory knockings.

“Oh, I don’t know what kind,” snapped the
lady.  “A common or garden ox, to use the slang
expression.  It is the garden part of it that I object
to.  My garden has just been put straight for the winter,
and an ox roaming about in it won’t improve matters. 
Besides, there are the chrysanthemums just coming into
flower.”

“I imagine it came in by the gate,” said the lady
impatiently; “it couldn’t have climbed the walls, and
I don’t suppose anyone dropped it from an aeroplane as a
Bovril advertisement.  The immediately important question is
not how it got in, but how to get it out.”

“If it was anxious to go,” said Adela Pingsford
rather angrily, “I should not have come here to chat with
you about it.  I’m practically all alone; the
housemaid is having her afternoon out and the cook is lying down
with an attack of neuralgia.  Anything that I may have
learned at school or in after life about how to remove a large ox
from a small garden seems to have escaped from my memory
now.  All I could think of was that you were a near
neighbour and a cattle painter, presumably more or less familiar
with the subjects that you painted, and that you might be of some
slight assistance.  Possibly I was mistaken.”

“I paint dairy cows, certainly,” admitted Eshley,
“but I cannot claim to have had any experience in
rounding-up stray oxen.  I’ve seen it done on a cinema
film, of course, but there were always horses and lots of other
accessories; besides, one never knows how much of those pictures
are faked.”

Adela Pingsford said nothing, but led the way to her
garden.  It was normally a fair-sized garden, but it looked
small in comparison with the ox, a huge mottled brute, dull red
about the head and shoulders, passing to dirty white on the
flanks and hind-quarters, with shaggy ears and large blood-shot
eyes.  It bore about as much resemblance to the dainty
paddock heifers that Eshley was accustomed to paint as the chief
of a Kurdish nomad clan would to a Japanese tea-shop girl. 
Eshley stood very near the gate while he studied the
animal’s appearance and demeanour.  Adela Pingsford
continued to say nothing.

“How observant you are,” said Adela
bitterly.  “You seem to notice everything.  As a
matter of fact, it has got six chrysanthemums in its mouth at the
present moment.”

The necessity for doing something was becoming
imperative.  Eshley took a step or two in the direction of
the animal, clapped his hands, and made noises of the
“Hish” and “Shoo” variety.  If the
ox heard them it gave no outward indication of the fact.

“If any hens should ever stray into my garden,”
said Adela, “I should certainly send for you to frighten
them out.  You ‘shoo’ beautifully. 
Meanwhile, do you mind trying to drive that ox away?  That
is a Mademoiselle Louise Bichot that he’s begun on
now,” she added in icy calm, as a glowing orange head was
crushed into the huge munching mouth.

“Since you have been so frank about the variety of the
chrysanthemum,” said Eshley, “I don’t mind
telling you that this is an Ayrshire ox.”

The icy calm broke down; Adela Pingsford used language that
sent the artist instinctively a few feet nearer to the ox. 
He picked up a pea-stick and flung it with some determination
against the animal’s mottled flanks.  The operation of
mashing Mademoiselle Louise Bichot into a petal salad was
suspended for a long moment, while the ox gazed with concentrated
inquiry at the stick-thrower.  Adela gazed with equal
concentration and more obvious hostility at the same focus. 
As the beast neither lowered its head nor stamped its feet Eshley
ventured on another javelin exercise with another
pea-stick.  The ox seemed to realise at once that it was to
go; it gave a hurried final pluck at the bed where the
chrysanthemums had been, and strode swiftly up the garden. 
Eshley ran to head it towards the gate, but only succeeded in
quickening its pace from a walk to a lumbering trot.  With
an air of inquiry, but with no real hesitation, it crossed the
tiny strip of turf that the charitable called the croquet lawn,
and pushed its way through the open French window into the
morning-room.  Some chrysanthemums and other autumn herbage
stood about the room in vases, and the animal resumed its
browsing operations; all the same, Eshley fancied that the
beginnings of a hunted look had come into its eyes, a look that
counselled respect.  He discontinued his attempt to
interfere with its choice of surroundings.

“Mr. Eshley,” said Adela in a shaking voice,
“I asked you to drive that beast out of my garden, but I
did not ask you to drive it into my house.  If I must have
it anywhere on the premises I prefer the garden to the
morning-room.”

“Cattle drives are not in my line,” said Eshley;
“if I remember I told you so at the outset.” 
“I quite agree,” retorted the lady, “painting
pretty pictures of pretty little cows is what you’re suited
for.  Perhaps you’d like to do a nice sketch of that
ox making itself at home in my morning-room?”

But the artist marched out of the garden.  In a couple of
minutes he returned, laden with easel, sketching-stool, and
painting materials.

“Do you mean to say that you’re going to sit
quietly down and paint that brute while it’s destroying my
morning-room?” gasped Adela.

“I don’t see what standing you have in the
matter,” said the artist; “you can hardly pretend
that it’s your ox, even by adoption.”

“You seem to forget that the cook has neuralgia,”
said Eshley; “she may be just dozing off into a merciful
sleep and your outcry will waken her.  Consideration for
others should be the guiding principle of people in our station
of life.”

“The man is mad!” exclaimed Adela
tragically.  A moment later it was Adela herself who
appeared to go mad.  The ox had finished the vase-flowers
and the cover of “Israel Kalisch,” and appeared to be
thinking of leaving its rather restricted quarters.  Eshley
noticed its restlessness and promptly flung it some bunches of
Virginia creeper leaves as an inducement to continue the
sitting.

“I forget how the proverb runs,” he observed;
“of something about ‘better a dinner of herbs than a
stalled ox where hate is.’  We seem to have all the
ingredients for the proverb ready to hand.”

“I shall go to the Public Library and get them to
telephone for the police,” announced Adela, and, raging
audibly, she departed.

Some minutes later the ox, awakening probably to the suspicion
that oil cake and chopped mangold was waiting for it in some
appointed byre, stepped with much precaution out of the
morning-room, stared with grave inquiry at the no longer
obtrusive and pea-stick-throwing human, and then lumbered heavily
but swiftly out of the garden.  Eshley packed up his tools
and followed the animal’s example and
“Larkdene” was left to neuralgia and the cook.

The episode was the turning-point in Eshley’s artistic
career.  His remarkable picture, “Ox in a
morning-room, late autumn,” was one of the sensations and
successes of the next Paris Salon, and when it was subsequently
exhibited at Munich it was bought by the Bavarian Government, in
the teeth of the spirited bidding of three meat-extract
firms.  From that moment his success was continuous and
assured, and the Royal Academy was thankful, two years later, to
give a conspicuous position on its walls to his large canvas
“Barbary Apes Wrecking a Boudoir.”

Eshley presented Adela Pingsford with a new copy of
“Israel Kalisch,” and a couple of finely flowering
plants of Madame Adnré Blusset, but nothing in the
nature of a real reconciliation has taken place between them.

It was a hot afternoon, and the railway carriage was
correspondingly sultry, and the next stop was at Templecombe,
nearly an hour ahead.  The occupants of the carriage were a
small girl, and a smaller girl, and a small boy.  An aunt
belonging to the children occupied one corner seat, and the
further corner seat on the opposite side was occupied by a
bachelor who was a stranger to their party, but the small girls
and the small boy emphatically occupied the compartment. 
Both the aunt and the children were conversational in a limited,
persistent way, reminding one of the attentions of a housefly
that refuses to be discouraged.  Most of the aunt’s
remarks seemed to begin with “Don’t,” and
nearly all of the children’s remarks began with
“Why?”  The bachelor said nothing out
loud.  “Don’t, Cyril, don’t,”
exclaimed the aunt, as the small boy began smacking the cushions
of the seat, producing a cloud of dust at each blow.

The child moved reluctantly to the window.  “Why
are those sheep being driven out of that field?” he
asked.

“But there is lots of grass in that field,”
protested the boy; “there’s nothing else but grass
there.  Aunt, there’s lots of grass in that
field.”

“Oh, look at those cows!” exclaimed the
aunt.  Nearly every field along the line had contained cows
or bullocks, but she spoke as though she were drawing attention
to a rarity.

The frown on the bachelor’s face was deepening to a
scowl.  He was a hard, unsympathetic man, the aunt decided
in her mind.  She was utterly unable to come to any
satisfactory decision about the grass in the other field.

The smaller girl created a diversion by beginning to recite
“On the Road to Mandalay.”  She only knew the
first line, but she put her limited knowledge to the fullest
possible use.  She repeated the line over and over again in
a dreamy but resolute and very audible voice; it seemed to the
bachelor as though some one had had a bet with her that she could
not repeat the line aloud two thousand times without
stopping.  Whoever it was who had made the wager was likely
to lose his bet.

“Come over here and listen to a story,” said the
aunt, when the bachelor had looked twice at her and once at the
communication cord.

The children moved listlessly towards the aunt’s end of
the carriage.  Evidently her reputation as a story-teller
did not rank high in their estimation.

In a low, confidential voice, interrupted at frequent
intervals by loud, petulant questionings from her listeners, she
began an unenterprising and deplorably uninteresting story about
a little girl who was good, and made friends with every one on
account of her goodness, and was finally saved from a mad bull by
a number of rescuers who admired her moral character.

“Wouldn’t they have saved her if she hadn’t
been good?” demanded the bigger of the small girls. 
It was exactly the question that the bachelor had wanted to
ask.

“Well, yes,” admitted the aunt lamely, “but
I don’t think they would have run quite so fast to her help
if they had not liked her so much.”

“It’s the stupidest story I’ve ever
heard,” said the bigger of the small girls, with immense
conviction.

The smaller girl made no actual comment on the story, but she
had long ago recommenced a murmured repetition of her favourite
line.

“It’s a very difficult thing to tell stories that
children can both understand and appreciate,” she said
stiffly.

“Once upon a time,” began the bachelor,
“there was a little girl called Bertha, who was
extraordinarily good.”

The children’s momentarily-aroused interest began at
once to flicker; all stories seemed dreadfully alike, no matter
who told them.

“She did all that she was told, she was always truthful,
she kept her clothes clean, ate milk puddings as though they were
jam tarts, learned her lessons perfectly, and was polite in her
manners.”

There was a wave of reaction in favour of the story; the word
horrible in connection with goodness was a novelty that commended
itself.  It seemed to introduce a ring of truth that was
absent from the aunt’s tales of infant life.

“She was so good,” continued the bachelor,
“that she won several medals for goodness, which she always
wore, pinned on to her dress.  There was a medal for
obedience, another medal for punctuality, and a third for good
behaviour.  They were large metal medals and they clicked
against one another as she walked.  No other child in the
town where she lived had as many as three medals, so everybody
knew that she must be an extra good child.”

“Everybody talked about her goodness, and the Prince of
the country got to hear about it, and he said that as she was so
very good she might be allowed once a week to walk in his park,
which was just outside the town.  It was a beautiful park,
and no children were ever allowed in it, so it was a great honour
for Bertha to be allowed to go there.”

“There were no sheep in the park,” said the
bachelor, “because the Prince’s mother had once had a
dream that her son would either be killed by a sheep or else by a
clock falling on him.  For that reason the Prince never kept
a sheep in his park or a clock in his palace.”

“He is still alive, so we can’t tell whether the
dream will come true,” said the bachelor unconcernedly;
“anyway, there were no sheep in the park, but there were
lots of little pigs running all over the place.”

“Black with white faces, white with black spots, black
all over, grey with white patches, and some were white all
over.”

The story-teller paused to let a full idea of the park’s
treasures sink into the children’s imaginations; then he
resumed:

“Bertha was rather sorry to find that there were no
flowers in the park.  She had promised her aunts, with tears
in her eyes, that she would not pick any of the kind
Prince’s flowers, and she had meant to keep her promise, so
of course it made her feel silly to find that there were no
flowers to pick.”

“Because the pigs had eaten them all,” said the
bachelor promptly.  “The gardeners had told the Prince
that you couldn’t have pigs and flowers, so he decided to
have pigs and no flowers.”

There was a murmur of approval at the excellence of the
Prince’s decision; so many people would have decided the
other way.

“There were lots of other delightful things in the
park.  There were ponds with gold and blue and green fish in
them, and trees with beautiful parrots that said clever things at
a moment’s notice, and humming birds that hummed all the
popular tunes of the day.  Bertha walked up and down and
enjoyed herself immensely, and thought to herself: ‘If I
were not so extraordinarily good I should not have been allowed
to come into this beautiful park and enjoy all that there is to
be seen in it,’ and her three medals clinked against one
another as she walked and helped to remind her how very good she
really was.  Just then an enormous wolf came prowling into
the park to see if it could catch a fat little pig for its
supper.”

“Mud-colour all over, with a black tongue and pale grey
eyes that gleamed with unspeakable ferocity.  The first
thing that it saw in the park was Bertha; her pinafore was so
spotlessly white and clean that it could be seen from a great
distance.  Bertha saw the wolf and saw that it was stealing
towards her, and she began to wish that she had never been
allowed to come into the park.  She ran as hard as she
could, and the wolf came after her with huge leaps and
bounds.  She managed to reach a shrubbery of myrtle bushes
and she hid herself in one of the thickest of the bushes. 
The wolf came sniffing among the branches, its black tongue
lolling out of its mouth and its pale grey eyes glaring with
rage.  Bertha was terribly frightened, and thought to
herself: ‘If I had not been so extraordinarily good I
should have been safe in the town at this moment.’ 
However, the scent of the myrtle was so strong that the wolf
could not sniff out where Bertha was hiding, and the bushes were
so thick that he might have hunted about in them for a long time
without catching sight of her, so he thought he might as well go
off and catch a little pig instead.  Bertha was trembling
very much at having the wolf prowling and sniffing so near her,
and as she trembled the medal for obedience clinked against the
medals for good conduct and punctuality.  The wolf was just
moving away when he heard the sound of the medals clinking and
stopped to listen; they clinked again in a bush quite near
him.  He dashed into the bush, his pale grey eyes gleaming
with ferocity and triumph, and dragged Bertha out and devoured
her to the last morsel.  All that was left of her were her
shoes, bits of clothing, and the three medals for
goodness.”

“It is the most beautiful story that I ever
heard,” said the bigger of the small girls, with immense
decision.

“A most improper story to tell to young children! 
You have undermined the effect of years of careful
teaching.”

“At any rate,” said the bachelor, collecting his
belongings preparatory to leaving the carriage, “I kept
them quiet for ten minutes, which was more than you were able to
do.”

“Unhappy woman!” he observed to himself as he
walked down the platform of Templecombe station; “for the
next six months or so those children will assail her in public
with demands for an improper story!”

Treddleford sat in an easeful arm-chair in front of a
slumberous fire, with a volume of verse in his hand and the
comfortable consciousness that outside the club windows the rain
was dripping and pattering with persistent purpose.  A
chill, wet October afternoon was merging into a bleak, wet
October evening, and the club smoking-room seemed warmer and
cosier by contrast.  It was an afternoon on which to be
wafted away from one’s climatic surroundings, and
“The Golden Journey to Samarkand” promised to bear
Treddleford well and bravely into other lands and under other
skies.  He had already migrated from London the rain-swept
to Bagdad the Beautiful, and stood by the Sun Gate “in the
olden time” when an icy breath of imminent annoyance seemed
to creep between the book and himself.  Amblecope, the man
with the restless, prominent eyes and the mouth ready mobilised
for conversational openings, had planted himself in a
neighbouring arm-chair.  For a twelvemonth and some odd
weeks Treddleford had skilfully avoided making the acquaintance
of his voluble fellow-clubman; he had marvellously escaped from
the infliction of his relentless record of tedious personal
achievements, or alleged achievements, on golf links, turf, and
gaming table, by flood and field and covert-side.  Now his
season of immunity was coming to an end.  There was no
escape; in another moment he would be numbered among those who
knew Amblecope to speak to—or rather, to suffer being
spoken to.

The intruder was armed with a copy of Country Life, not
for purposes of reading, but as an aid to conversational
ice-breaking.

“Rather a good portrait of Throstlewing,” he
remarked explosively, turning his large challenging eyes on
Treddleford; “somehow it reminds me very much of
Yellowstep, who was supposed to be such a good thing for the
Grand Prix in 1903.  Curious race that was; I suppose
I’ve seen every race for the Grand Prix for the
last—”

“Be kind enough never to mention the Grand Prix in my
hearing,” said Treddleford desperately; “it awakens
acutely distressing memories.  I can’t explain why
without going into a long and complicated story.”

“Oh, certainly, certainly,” said Amblecope
hastily; long and complicated stories that were not told by
himself were abominable in his eyes.  He turned the pages of
Country Life and became spuriously interested in the
picture of a Mongolian pheasant.

“Not a bad representation of the Mongolian
variety,” he exclaimed, holding it up for his
neighbour’s inspection.  “They do very well in
some covers.  Take some stopping too, once they’re
fairly on the wing.  I suppose the biggest bag I ever made
in two successive days—”

“My aunt, who owns the greater part of
Lincolnshire,” broke in Treddleford, with dramatic
abruptness, “possesses perhaps the most remarkable record
in the way of a pheasant bag that has ever been achieved. 
She is seventy-five and can’t hit a thing, but she always
goes out with the guns.  When I say she can’t hit a
thing, I don’t mean to say that she doesn’t
occasionally endanger the lives of her fellow-guns, because that
wouldn’t be true.  In fact, the chief Government Whip
won’t allow Ministerial M.P.’s to go out with her;
‘We don’t want to incur by-elections
needlessly,’ he quite reasonably observed.  Well, the
other day she winged a pheasant, and brought it to earth with a
feather or two knocked out of it; it was a runner, and my aunt
saw herself in danger of being done out of about the only bird
she’d hit during the present reign.  Of course she
wasn’t going to stand that; she followed it through bracken
and brushwood, and when it took to the open country and started
across a ploughed field she jumped on to the shooting pony and
went after it.  The chase was a long one, and when my aunt
at last ran the bird to a standstill she was nearer home than she
was to the shooting party; she had left that some five miles
behind her.”

“The story rests on my aunt’s authority,”
said Treddleford coldly, “and she is local vice-president
of the Young Women’s Christian Association.  She
trotted three miles or so to her home, and it was not till the
middle of the afternoon that it was discovered that the lunch for
the entire shooting party was in a pannier attached to the
pony’s saddle.  Anyway, she got her bird.”

“Some birds, of course, take a lot of killing,”
said Amblecope; “so do some fish.  I remember once I
was fishing in the Exe, lovely trout stream, lots of fish, though
they don’t run to any great size—”

“One of them did,” announced Treddleford, with
emphasis.  “My uncle, the Bishop of Southmolton, came
across a giant trout in a pool just off the main stream of the
Exe near Ugworthy; he tried it with every kind of fly and worm
every day for three weeks without an atom of success, and then
Fate intervened on his behalf.  There was a low stone bridge
just over this pool, and on the last day of his fishing holiday a
motor van ran violently into the parapet and turned completely
over; no one was hurt, but part of the parapet was knocked away,
and the entire load that the van was carrying was pitched over
and fell a little way into the pool.  In a couple of minutes
the giant trout was flapping and twisting on bare mud at the
bottom of a waterless pool, and my uncle was able to walk down to
him and fold him to his breast.  The van-load consisted of
blotting-paper, and every drop of water in that pool had been
sucked up into the mass of spilt cargo.”

There was silence for nearly half a minute in the
smoking-room, and Treddleford began to let his mind steal back
towards the golden road that led to Samarkand.  Amblecope,
however, rallied, and remarked in a rather tired and dispirited
voice:

“Talking of motor accidents, the narrowest squeak I ever
had was the other day, motoring with old Tommy Yarby in North
Wales.  Awfully good sort, old Yarby, thorough good
sportsman, and the best—”

“It was in North Wales,” said Treddleford,
“that my sister met with her sensational carriage accident
last year.  She was on her way to a garden-party at Lady
Nineveh’s, about the only garden-party that ever comes to
pass in those parts in the course of the year, and therefore a
thing that she would have been very sorry to miss.  She was
driving a young horse that she’d only bought a week or two
previously, warranted to be perfectly steady with motor traffic,
bicycles, and other common objects of the roadside.  The
animal lived up to its reputation, and passed the most explosive
of motor-bikes with an indifference that almost amounted to
apathy.  However, I suppose we all draw the line somewhere,
and this particular cob drew it at travelling wild beast
shows.  Of course my sister didn’t know that, but she
knew it very distinctly when she turned a sharp corner and found
herself in a mixed company of camels, piebald horses, and
canary-coloured vans.  The dogcart was overturned in a ditch
and kicked to splinters, and the cob went home across
country.  Neither my sister nor the groom was hurt, but the
problem of how to get to the Nineveh garden-party, some three
miles distant, seemed rather difficult to solve; once there, of
course, my sister would easily find some one to drive her
home.  ‘I suppose you wouldn’t care for the loan
of a couple of my camels?’ the showman suggested, in
humorous sympathy.  ‘I would,’ said my sister,
who had ridden camel-back in Egypt, and she overruled the
objections of the groom, who hadn’t.  She picked out
two of the most presentable-looking of the beasts and had them
dusted and made as tidy as was possible at short notice, and set
out for the Nineveh mansion.  You may imagine the sensation
that her small but imposing caravan created when she arrived at
the hall door.  The entire garden-party flocked up to
gape.  My sister was rather glad to slip down from her
camel, and the groom was thankful to scramble down from
his.  Then young Billy Doulton, of the Dragoon Guards, who
has been a lot at Aden and thinks he knows camel-language
backwards, thought he would show off by making the beasts kneel
down in orthodox fashion.  Unfortunately camel
words-of-command are not the same all the world over; these were
magnificent Turkestan camels, accustomed to stride up the stony
terraces of mountain passes, and when Doulton shouted at them
they went side by side up the front steps, into the entrance
hall, and up the grand staircase.  The German governess met
them just at the turn of the corridor.  The Ninevehs nursed
her with devoted attention for weeks, and when I last heard from
them she was well enough to go about her duties again, but the
doctor says she will always suffer from Hagenbeck
heart.”

Amblecope got up from his chair and moved to another part of
the room.  Treddleford reopened his book and betook himself
once more across

For a blessed half-hour he disported himself in imagination by
the “gay Aleppo-Gate,” and listened to the
bird-voiced singing-man.  Then the world of to-day called
him back; a page summoned him to speak with a friend on the
telephone.

As Treddleford was about to pass out of the room he
encountered Amblecope, also passing out, on his way to the
billiard-room, where, perchance, some luckless wight might be
secured and held fast to listen to the number of his attendances
at the Grand Prix, with subsequent remarks on Newmarket and the
Cambridgeshire.  Amblecope made as if to pass out first, but
a new-born pride was surging in Treddleford’s breast and he
waved him back.

Teresa, Mrs. Thropplestance, was the richest and most
intractable old woman in the county of Woldshire.  In her
dealings with the world in general her manner suggested a blend
between a Mistress of the Robes and a Master of Foxhounds, with
the vocabulary of both.  In her domestic circle she
comported herself in the arbitrary style that one attributes,
probably without the least justification, to an American
political Boss in the bosom of his caucus.  The late
Theodore Thropplestance had left her, some thirty-five years ago,
in absolute possession of a considerable fortune, a large landed
property, and a gallery full of valuable pictures.  In those
intervening years she had outlived her son and quarrelled with
her elder grandson, who had married without her consent or
approval.  Bertie Thropplestance, her younger grandson, was
the heir-designate to her property, and as such he was a centre
of interest and concern to some half-hundred ambitious mothers
with daughters of marriageable age.  Bertie was an amiable,
easy-going young man, who was quite ready to marry anyone who was
favourably recommended to his notice, but he was not going to
waste his time in falling in love with anyone who would come
under his grandmother’s veto.  The favourable
recommendation would have to come from Mrs. Thropplestance.

Teresa’s house-parties were always rounded off with a
plentiful garnishing of presentable young women and alert,
attendant mothers, but the old lady was emphatically discouraging
whenever any one of her girl guests became at all likely to
outbid the others as a possible granddaughter-in-law.  It
was the inheritance of her fortune and estate that was in
question, and she was evidently disposed to exercise and enjoy
her powers of selection and rejection to the utmost. 
Bertie’s preferences did not greatly matter; he was of the
sort who can be stolidly happy with any kind of wife; he had
cheerfully put up with his grandmother all his life, so was not
likely to fret and fume over anything that might befall him in
the way of a helpmate.

The party that gathered under Teresa’s roof in Christmas
week of the year nineteen-hundred-and-something was of smaller
proportions than usual, and Mrs. Yonelet, who formed one of the
party, was inclined to deduce hopeful augury from this
circumstance.  Dora Yonelet and Bertie were so obviously
made for one another, she confided to the vicar’s wife, and
if the old lady were accustomed to seeing them about a lot
together she might adopt the view that they would make a suitable
married couple.

“People soon get used to an idea if it is dangled
constantly before their eyes,” said Mrs. Yonelet hopefully,
“and the more often Teresa sees those young people
together, happy in each other’s company, the more she will
get to take a kindly interest in Dora as a possible and desirable
wife for Bertie.”

“My dear,” said the vicar’s wife resignedly,
“my own Sybil was thrown together with Bertie under the
most romantic circumstances—I’ll tell you about it
some day—but it made no impression whatever on Teresa; she
put her foot down in the most uncompromising fashion, and Sybil
married an Indian civilian.”

“Quite right of her,” said Mrs. Yonelet with vague
approval; “it’s what any girl of spirit would have
done.  Still, that was a year or two ago, I believe; Bertie
is older now, and so is Teresa.  Naturally she must be
anxious to see him settled.”

The vicar’s wife reflected that Teresa seemed to be the
one person who showed no immediate anxiety to supply Bertie with
a wife, but she kept the thought to herself.

Mrs. Yonelet was a woman of resourceful energy and
generalship; she involved the other members of the house-party,
the deadweight, so to speak, in all manner of exercises and
occupations that segregated them from Bertie and Dora, who were
left to their own devisings—that is to say, to Dora’s
devisings and Bertie’s accommodating acquiescence. 
Dora helped in the Christmas decorations of the parish church,
and Bertie helped her to help.  Together they fed the swans,
till the birds went on a dyspepsia-strike, together they played
billiards, together they photographed the village almshouses,
and, at a respectful distance, the tame elk that browsed in
solitary aloofness in the park.  It was “tame”
in the sense that it had long ago discarded the least vestige of
fear of the human race; nothing in its record encouraged its
human neighbours to feel a reciprocal confidence.

Whatever sport or exercise or occupation Bertie and Dora
indulged in together was unfailingly chronicled and advertised by
Mrs. Yonelet for the due enlightenment of Bertie’s
grandmother.

“Those two inseparables have just come in from a bicycle
ride,” she would announce; “quite a picture they
make, so fresh and glowing after their spin.”

“A picture needing words,” would be Teresa’s
private comment, and as far as Bertie was concerned she was
determined that the words should remain unspoken.

On the afternoon after Christmas Day Mrs. Yonelet dashed into
the drawing-room, where her hostess was sitting amid a circle of
guests and teacups and muffin-dishes.  Fate had placed what
seemed like a trump-card in the hands of the
patiently-manoeuvring mother.  With eyes blazing with
excitement and a voice heavily escorted with exclamation marks
she made a dramatic announcement.

In swift, excited sentences, broken with maternal emotion, she
gave supplementary information as to how the treacherous animal
had ambushed Dora as she was hunting for a strayed golf ball, and
how Bertie had dashed to her rescue with a stable fork and driven
the beast off in the nick of time.

“It was touch and go!  She threw her niblick at it,
but that didn’t stop it.  In another moment she would
have been crushed beneath its hoofs,” panted Mrs.
Yonelet.

“The animal is not safe,” said Teresa, handing her
agitated guest a cup of tea.  “I forget if you take
sugar.  I suppose the solitary life it leads has soured its
temper.  There are muffins in the grate.  It’s
not my fault; I’ve tried to get it a mate for ever so
long.  You don’t know of anyone with a lady elk for
sale or exchange, do you?” she asked the company
generally.

But Mrs. Yonelet was in no humour to listen to talk of elk
marriages.  The mating of two human beings was the subject
uppermost in her mind, and the opportunity for advancing her pet
project was too valuable to be neglected.

“Teresa,” she exclaimed impressively, “after
those two young people have been thrown together so dramatically,
nothing can be quite the same again between them.  Bertie
has done more than save Dora’s life; he has earned her
affection.  One cannot help feeling that Fate has
consecrated them for one another.”

“Exactly what the vicar’s wife said when Bertie
saved Sybil from the elk a year or two ago,” observed
Teresa placidly; “I pointed out to her that he had rescued
Mirabel Hicks from the same predicement a few months previously,
and that priority really belonged to the gardener’s boy,
who had been rescued in the January of that year.  There is
a good deal of sameness in country life, you know.”

“That’s what the mother of the gardener’s
boy said,” remarked Teresa; “she wanted me to have it
destroyed, but I pointed out to her that she had eleven children
and I had only one elk.  I also gave her a black silk skirt;
she said that though there hadn’t been a funeral in her
family she felt as if there had been.  Anyhow, we parted
friends.  I can’t offer you a silk skirt, Emily, but
you may have another cup of tea.  As I have already
remarked, there are muffins in the grate.”

Teresa closed the discussion, having deftly conveyed the
impression that she considered the mother of the gardener’s
boy had shown a far more reasonable spirit than the parents of
other elk-assaulted victims.

“Teresa is devoid of feeling,” said Mrs. Yonelet
afterwards to the vicar’s wife; “to sit there,
talking of muffins, with an appalling tragedy only narrowly
averted—”

“Of course you know whom she really intends Bertie to
marry?” asked the vicar’s wife; “I’ve
noticed it for some time.  The Bickelbys’ German
governess.”

“She’s of quite good family, I believe,”
said the vicar’s wife, “and not at all the
mouse-in-the-back-ground sort of person that governesses are
usually supposed to be.  In fact, next to Teresa,
she’s about the most assertive and combative personality in
the neighbourhood.  She’s pointed out to my husband
all sorts of errors in his sermons, and she gave Sir Laurence a
public lecture on how he ought to handle the hounds.  You
know how sensitive Sir Laurence is about any criticism of his
Mastership, and to have a governess laying down the law to him
nearly drove him into a fit.  She’s behaved like that
to every one, except, of course, Teresa, and every one has been
defensively rude to her in return.  The Bickelbys are simply
too afraid of her to get rid of her.  Now isn’t that
exactly the sort of woman whom Teresa would take a delight in
installing as her successor?  Imagine the discomfort and
awkwardness in the county if we suddenly found that she was to be
the future hostess at the Hall.  Teresa’s only regret
will be that she won’t be alive to see it.”

“But,” objected Mrs. Yonelet, “surely Bertie
hasn’t shown the least sign of being attracted in that
quarter?”

“Oh, she’s quite nice-looking in a way, and
dresses well, and plays a good game of tennis.  She often
comes across the park with messages from the Bickelby mansion,
and one of these days Bertie will rescue her from the elk, which
has become almost a habit with him, and Teresa will say that Fate
has consecrated them to one another.  Bertie might not be
disposed to pay much attention to the consecrations of Fate, but
he would not dream of opposing his grandmother.”

The vicar’s wife spoke with the quiet authority of one
who has intuitive knowledge, and in her heart of hearts Mrs.
Yonelet believed her.

Six months later the elk had to be destroyed.  In a fit
of exceptional moroseness it had killed the Bickelbys’
German governess.  It was an irony of its fate that it
should achieve popularity in the last moments of its career; at
any rate, it established the record of being the only living
thing that had permanently thwarted Teresa Thropplestance’s
plans.

Dora Yonelet broke off her engagement with an Indian civilian,
and married Bertie three months after his grandmother’s
death—Teresa did not long survive the German governess
fiasco.  At Christmas time every year young Mrs.
Thropplestance hangs an extra large festoon of evergreens on the
elk horns that decorate the hall.

“It was a fearsome beast,” she observes to Bertie,
“but I always feel that it was instrumental in bringing us
together.”

“No,” said Janetta, with a note of tired defiance
in her voice; “I’ve written eleven letters to-day
expressing surprise and gratitude for sundry unmerited gifts, but
I haven’t written to the Froplinsons.”

“I don’t dispute the necessity, but I don’t
think the some one should be me,” said Janetta. 
“I wouldn’t mind writing a letter of angry
recrimination or heartless satire to some suitable recipient; in
fact, I should rather enjoy it, but I’ve come to the end of
my capacity for expressing servile amiability.  Eleven
letters to-day and nine yesterday, all couched in the same strain
of ecstatic thankfulness: really, you can’t expect me to
sit down to another.  There is such a thing as writing
oneself out.”

“I’ve written nearly as many,” said Egbert,
“and I’ve had my usual business correspondence to get
through, too.  Besides, I don’t know what it was that
the Froplinsons sent us.”

“A William the Conqueror calendar,” said Janetta,
“with a quotation of one of his great thoughts for every
day in the year.”

“Impossible,” said Egbert; “he didn’t
have three hundred and sixty-five thoughts in the whole of his
life, or, if he did, he kept them to himself.  He was a man
of action, not of introspection.”

“That sounds more probable,” said Egbert;
“well, let’s collaborate on this letter of thanks and
get it done.  I’ll dictate, and you can scribble it
down.  ‘Dear Mrs. Froplinson—thank you and your
husband so much for the very pretty calendar you sent us. 
It was very good of you to think of us.’”

“We sent them something on the twenty-second,”
said Janetta, “so they simply had to think of
us.  There was no getting away from it.”

“Bridge-markers,” said Janetta, “in a
cardboard case, with some inanity about ‘digging for
fortune with a royal spade’ emblazoned on the cover. 
The moment I saw it in the shop I said to myself
‘Froplinsons’ and to the attendant ‘How
much?’  When he said ‘Ninepence,’ I gave
him their address, jabbed our card in, paid tenpence or
elevenpence to cover the postage, and thanked heaven.  With
less sincerity and infinitely more trouble they eventually
thanked me.”

“One is not supposed to notice social deformities of
that sort,” said Janetta; “it wouldn’t be
polite.  Besides, what trouble did they take to find out
whether we read Wordsworth with gladness?   For all
they knew or cared we might be frantically embedded in the belief
that all poetry begins and ends with John Masefield, and it might
infuriate or depress us to have a daily sample of Wordsworthian
products flung at us.”

“Do you realise what that means?” she asked;
“a Wordsworth booklet next Christmas, and another calendar
the Christmas after, with the same problem of having to write
suitable letters of thankfulness.  No, the best thing to do
is to drop all further allusion to the calendar and switch off on
to some other topic.”

“Oh, something like this: ‘What do you think of
the New Year Honours List?  A friend of ours made such a
clever remark when he read it.’  Then you can stick in
any remark that comes into your head; it needn’t be
clever.  The Froplinsons won’t know whether it is or
isn’t.”

“We don’t even know on which side they are in
politics,” objected Egbert; “and anyhow you
can’t suddenly dismiss the subject of the calendar. 
Surely there must be some intelligent remark that can be made
about it.”

“Well, we can’t think of one,” said Janetta
wearily; “the fact is, we’ve both written ourselves
out.  Heavens!  I’ve just remembered Mrs. Stephen
Ludberry.  I haven’t thanked her for what she
sent.”

There was a long silence, the forlorn silence of those who are
bereft of hope and have almost ceased to care.

Presently Egbert started from his seat with an air of
resolution.  The light of battle was in his eyes.

“To neither,” said Egbert, drawing a stack of
notepaper towards him; “I’m going to write to the
editor of every enlightened and influential newspaper in the
Kingdom, I’m going to suggest that there should be a sort
of epistolary Truce of God during the festivities of Christmas
and New Year.  From the twenty-fourth of December to the
third or fourth of January it shall be considered an offence
against good sense and good feeling to write or expect any letter
or communication that does not deal with the necessary events of
the moment.  Answers to invitations, arrangements about
trains, renewal of club subscriptions, and, of course, all the
ordinary everyday affairs of business, sickness, engaging new
cooks, and so forth, these will be dealt with in the usual manner
as something inevitable, a legitimate part of our daily
life.  But all the devastating accretions of correspondence,
incident to the festive season, these should be swept away to
give the season a chance of being really festive, a time of
untroubled, unpunctuated peace and good will.”

“But you would have to make some acknowledgment of
presents received,” objected Janetta; “otherwise
people would never know whether they had arrived
safely.”

“Of course, I have thought of that,” said Egbert;
“every present that was sent off would be accompanied by a
ticket bearing the date of dispatch and the signature of the
sender, and some conventional hieroglyphic to show that it was
intended to be a Christmas or New Year gift; there would be a
counterfoil with space for the recipient’s name and the
date of arrival, and all you would have to do would be to sign
and date the counterfoil, add a conventional hieroglyphic
indicating heartfelt thanks and gratified surprise, put the thing
into an envelope and post it.”

“It sounds delightfully simple,” said Janetta
wistfully, “but people would consider it too cut-and-dried,
too perfunctory.”

“It is not a bit more perfunctory than the present
system,” said Egbert; “I have only the same
conventional language of gratitude at my disposal with which to
thank dear old Colonel Chuttle for his perfectly delicious
Stilton, which we shall devour to the last morsel, and the
Froplinsons for their calendar, which we shall never look
at.  Colonel Chuttle knows that we are grateful for the
Stilton, without having to be told so, and the Froplinsons know
that we are bored with their calendar, whatever we may say to the
contrary, just as we know that they are bored with the
bridge-markers in spite of their written assurance that they
thanked us for our charming little gift.  What is more, the
Colonel knows that even if we had taken a sudden aversion to
Stilton or been forbidden it by the doctor, we should still have
written a letter of hearty thanks around it.  So you see the
present system of acknowledgment is just as perfunctory and
conventional as the counterfoil business would be, only ten times
more tiresome and brain-racking.”

“Your plan would certainly bring the ideal of a Happy
Christmas a step nearer realisation,” said Janetta.

“There are exceptions, of course,” said Egbert,
“people who really try to infuse a breath of reality into
their letters of acknowledgment.  Aunt Susan, for instance,
who writes: ‘Thank you very much for the ham; not such a
good flavour as the one you sent last year, which itself was not
a particularly good one.  Hams are not what they used to
be.’  It would be a pity to be deprived of her
Christmas comments, but that loss would be swallowed up in the
general gain.”

Adventures, according to the proverb, are to the
adventurous.  Quite as often they are to the
non-adventurous, to the retiring, to the constitutionally
timid.  John James Abbleway had been endowed by Nature with
the sort of disposition that instinctively avoids Carlist
intrigues, slum crusades, the tracking of wounded wild beasts,
and the moving of hostile amendments at political meetings. 
If a mad dog or a Mad Mullah had come his way he would have
surrendered the way without hesitation.  At school he had
unwillingly acquired a thorough knowledge of the German tongue
out of deference to the plainly-expressed wishes of a
foreign-languages master, who, though he taught modern subjects,
employed old-fashioned methods in driving his lessons home. 
It was this enforced familiarity with an important commercial
language which thrust Abbleway in later years into strange lands
where adventures were less easy to guard against than in the
ordered atmosphere of an English country town.  The firm
that he worked for saw fit to send him one day on a prosaic
business errand to the far city of Vienna, and, having sent him
there, continued to keep him there, still engaged in humdrum
affairs of commerce, but with the possibilities of romance and
adventure, or even misadventure, jostling at his elbow. 
After two and a half years of exile, however, John James Abbleway
had embarked on only one hazardous undertaking, and that was of a
nature which would assuredly have overtaken him sooner or later
if he had been leading a sheltered, stay-at-home existence at
Dorking or Huntingdon.  He fell placidly in love with a
placidly lovable English girl, the sister of one of his
commercial colleagues, who was improving her mind by a short trip
to foreign parts, and in due course he was formally accepted as
the young man she was engaged to.  The further step by which
she was to become Mrs. John Abbleway was to take place a
twelvemonth hence in a town in the English midlands, by which
time the firm that employed John James would have no further need
for his presence in the Austrian capital.

It was early in April, two months after the installation of
Abbleway as the young man Miss Penning was engaged to, when he
received a letter from her, written from Venice.  She was
still peregrinating under the wing of her brother, and as the
latter’s business arrangements would take him across to
Fiume for a day or two, she had conceived the idea that it would
be rather jolly if John could obtain leave of absence and run
down to the Adriatic coast to meet them.  She had looked up
the route on the map, and the journey did not appear likely to be
expensive.  Between the lines of her communication there lay
a hint that if he really cared for her—

Abbleway obtained leave of absence and added a journey to
Fiume to his life’s adventures.  He left Vienna on a
cold, cheerless day.  The flower shops were full of spring
blooms, and the weekly organs of illustrated humour were full of
spring topics, but the skies were heavy with clouds that looked
like cotton-wool that has been kept over long in a shop
window.

“Snow comes,” said the train official to the
station officials; and they agreed that snow was about to
come.  And it came, rapidly, plenteously.  The train
had not been more than an hour on its journey when the
cotton-wool clouds commenced to dissolve in a blinding downpour
of snowflakes.  The forest trees on either side of the line
were speedily coated with a heavy white mantle, the telegraph
wires became thick glistening ropes, the line itself was buried
more and more completely under a carpeting of snow, through which
the not very powerful engine ploughed its way with increasing
difficulty.  The Vienna-Fiume line is scarcely the best
equipped of the Austrian State railways, and Abbleway began to
have serious fears for a breakdown.  The train had slowed
down to a painful and precarious crawl and presently came to a
halt at a spot where the drifting snow had accumulated in a
formidable barrier.  The engine made a special effort and
broke through the obstruction, but in the course of another
twenty minutes it was again held up.  The process of
breaking through was renewed, and the train doggedly resumed its
way, encountering and surmounting fresh hindrances at frequent
intervals.  After a standstill of unusually long duration in
a particularly deep drift the compartment in which Abbleway was
sitting gave a huge jerk and a lurch, and then seemed to remain
stationary; it undoubtedly was not moving, and yet he could hear
the puffing of the engine and the slow rumbling and jolting of
wheels.  The puffing and rumbling grew fainter, as though it
were dying away through the agency of intervening distance. 
Abbleway suddenly gave vent to an exclamation of scandalised
alarm, opened the window, and peered out into the
snowstorm.  The flakes perched on his eyelashes and blurred
his vision, but he saw enough to help him to realise what had
happened.  The engine had made a mighty plunge through the
drift and had gone merrily forward, lightened of the load of its
rear carriage, whose coupling had snapped under the strain. 
Abbleway was alone, or almost alone, with a derelict railway
waggon, in the heart of some Styrian or Croatian forest.  In
the third-class compartment next to his own he remembered to have
seen a peasant woman, who had entered the train at a small
wayside station.  “With the exception of that
woman,” he exclaimed dramatically to himself, “the
nearest living beings are probably a pack of wolves.”

Before making his way to the third-class compartment to
acquaint his fellow-traveller with the extent of the disaster
Abbleway hurriedly pondered the question of the woman’s
nationality.  He had acquired a smattering of Slavonic
tongues during his residence in Vienna, and felt competent to
grapple with several racial possibilities.

“If she is Croat or Serb or Bosniak I shall be able to
make her understand,” he promised himself.  “If
she is Magyar, heaven help me!  We shall have to converse
entirely by signs.”

He entered the carriage and made his momentous announcement in
the best approach to Croat speech that he could achieve.

The woman shook her head with a movement that might be
intended to convey resignation to the will of heaven, but
probably meant noncomprehension.  Abbleway repeated his
information with variations of Slavonic tongues and generous
displays of pantomime.

She seemed about as much interested as though Abbleway had
told her the result of the municipal elections in Amsterdam.

“They will find out at some station, and when the line
is clear of snow they will send an engine.  It happens that
way sometimes.”

“Many,” said the woman; “just outside this
forest my aunt was devoured three years ago, as she was coming
home from market.  The horse and a young pig that was in the
cart were eaten too.  The horse was a very old one, but it
was a beautiful young pig, oh, so fat.  I cried when I heard
that it was taken.  They spare nothing.”

“They may attack us here,” said Abbleway
tremulously; “they could easily break in, these carriages
are like matchwood.  We may both be devoured.”

“It is the day of Saint Mariä Kleophä, my
name-day.  She would not allow me to be eaten by wolves on
her day.  Such a thing could not be thought of.  You,
yes, but not me.”

“I have here some good eatables,” said the woman
tranquilly; “on my festival day it is natural that I should
have provision with me.  I have five good blood-sausages; in
the town shops they cost twenty-five heller each.  Things
are dear in the town shops.”

“In a railway accident things become very dear,”
said the woman; “these blood-sausages are four kronen
apiece.”

“You cannot get them any cheaper on this train,”
said the woman, with relentless logic, “because there
aren’t any others to get.  In Agram you can buy them
cheaper, and in Paradise no doubt they will be given to us for
nothing, but here they cost four kronen each.  I have a
small piece of Emmenthaler cheese and a honey-cake and a piece of
bread that I can let you have.  That will be another three
kronen, eleven kronen in all.  There is a piece of ham, but
that I cannot let you have on my name-day.”

Abbleway wondered to himself what price she would have put on
the ham, and hurried to pay her the eleven kronen before her
emergency tariff expanded into a famine tariff.  As he was
taking possession of his modest store of eatables he suddenly
heard a noise which set his heart thumping in a miserable fever
of fear.  ‘There was a scraping and shuffling as of
some animal or animals trying to climb up to the footboard. 
In another moment, through the snow-encrusted glass of the
carriage window, he saw a gaunt prick-eared head, with gaping jaw
and lolling tongue and gleaming teeth; a second later another
head shot up.

“There are hundreds of them,” whispered Abbleway;
“they have scented us.  They will tear the carriage to
pieces.  We shall be devoured.”

“Not me, on my name-day.  The holy Mariä
Kleophä would not permit it,” said the woman with
provoking calm.

The heads dropped down from the window and an uncanny silence
fell on the beleaguered carriage.  Abbleway neither moved
nor spoke.  Perhaps the brutes had not clearly seen or
winded the human occupants of the carriage, and had prowled away
on some other errand of rapine.

“It grows cold,” said the woman suddenly, crossing
over to the far end of the carriage, where the heads had
appeared.  “The heating apparatus does not work any
longer.  See, over there beyond the trees, there is a
chimney with smoke coming from it.  It is not far, and the
snow has nearly stopped, I shall find a path through the forest
to that house with the chimney.”

“Not on my name-day,” said the woman obstinately,
and before he could stop her she had opened the door and climbed
down into the snow.  A moment later he hid his face in his
hands; two gaunt lean figures rushed upon her from the
forest.  No doubt she had courted her fate, but Abbleway had
no wish to see a human being torn to pieces and devoured before
his eyes.

When he looked at last a new sensation of scandalised
astonishment took possession of him.  He had been straitly
brought up in a small English town, and he was not prepared to be
the witness of a miracle.  The wolves were not doing
anything worse to the woman than drench her with snow as they
gambolled round her.

“My cousin Karl’s dogs, yes,” she answered;
“that is his inn, over beyond the trees.  I knew it
was there, but I did not want to take you there; he is always
grasping with strangers.  However, it grows too cold to
remain in the train.  Ah, ah, see what comes!”

A whistle sounded, and a relief engine made its appearance,
snorting its way sulkily through the snow.  Abbleway did not
have the opportunity for finding out whether Karl was really
avaricious.

The children were to be driven, as a special treat, to the
sands at Jagborough.  Nicholas was not to be of the party;
he was in disgrace.  Only that morning he had refused to eat
his wholesome bread-and-milk on the seemingly frivolous ground
that there was a frog in it.  Older and wiser and better
people had told him that there could not possibly be a frog in
his bread-and-milk and that he was not to talk nonsense; he
continued, nevertheless, to talk what seemed the veriest
nonsense, and described with much detail the colouration and
markings of the alleged frog.  The dramatic part of the
incident was that there really was a frog in Nicholas’
basin of bread-and-milk; he had put it there himself, so he felt
entitled to know something about it.  The sin of taking a
frog from the garden and putting it into a bowl of wholesome
bread-and-milk was enlarged on at great length, but the fact that
stood out clearest in the whole affair, as it presented itself to
the mind of Nicholas, was that the older, wiser, and better
people had been proved to be profoundly in error in matters about
which they had expressed the utmost assurance.

“You said there couldn’t possibly be a frog in my
bread-and-milk; there was a frog in my
bread-and-milk,” he repeated, with the insistence of a
skilled tactician who does not intend to shift from favourable
ground.

So his boy-cousin and girl-cousin and his quite uninteresting
younger brother were to be taken to Jagborough sands that
afternoon and he was to stay at home.  His cousins’
aunt, who insisted, by an unwarranted stretch of imagination, in
styling herself his aunt also, had hastily invented the
Jagborough expedition in order to impress on Nicholas the
delights that he had justly forfeited by his disgraceful conduct
at the breakfast-table.  It was her habit, whenever one of
the children fell from grace, to improvise something of a
festival nature from which the offender would be rigorously
debarred; if all the children sinned collectively they were
suddenly informed of a circus in a neighbouring town, a circus of
unrivalled merit and uncounted elephants, to which, but for their
depravity, they would have been taken that very day.

A few decent tears were looked for on the part of Nicholas
when the moment for the departure of the expedition
arrived.  As a matter of fact, however, all the crying was
done by his girl-cousin, who scraped her knee rather painfully
against the step of the carriage as she was scrambling in.

“How she did howl,” said Nicholas cheerfully, as
the party drove off without any of the elation of high spirits
that should have characterised it.

“She’ll soon get over that,” said the
soi-disant aunt; “it will be a glorious afternoon
for racing about over those beautiful sands.  How they will
enjoy themselves!”

“Bobby won’t enjoy himself much, and he
won’t race much either,” said Nicholas with a grim
chuckle; “his boots are hurting him.  They’re
too tight.”

“He told you twice, but you weren’t
listening.  You often don’t listen when we tell you
important things.”

Nicholas did not admit the flawlessness of the reasoning; he
felt perfectly capable of being in disgrace and in a gooseberry
garden at the same moment.  His face took on an expression
of considerable obstinacy.  It was clear to his aunt that he
was determined to get into the gooseberry garden,
“only,” as she remarked to herself, “because I
have told him he is not to.”

Now the gooseberry garden had two doors by which it might be
entered, and once a small person like Nicholas could slip in
there he could effectually disappear from view amid the masking
growth of artichokes, raspberry canes, and fruit bushes. 
The aunt had many other things to do that afternoon, but she
spent an hour or two in trivial gardening operations among flower
beds and shrubberies, whence she could keep a watchful eye on the
two doors that led to the forbidden paradise.  She was a
woman of few ideas, with immense powers of concentration.

Nicholas made one or two sorties into the front garden,
wriggling his way with obvious stealth of purpose towards one or
other of the doors, but never able for a moment to evade the
aunt’s watchful eye.  As a matter of fact, he had no
intention of trying to get into the gooseberry garden, but it was
extremely convenient for him that his aunt should believe that he
had; it was a belief that would keep her on self-imposed
sentry-duty for the greater part of the afternoon.  Having
thoroughly confirmed and fortified her suspicions Nicholas
slipped back into the house and rapidly put into execution a plan
of action that had long germinated in his brain.  By
standing on a chair in the library one could reach a shelf on
which reposed a fat, important-looking key.  The key was as
important as it looked; it was the instrument which kept the
mysteries of the lumber-room secure from unauthorised intrusion,
which opened a way only for aunts and such-like privileged
persons.  Nicholas had not had much experience of the art of
fitting keys into keyholes and turning locks, but for some days
past he had practised with the key of the schoolroom door; he did
not believe in trusting too much to luck and accident.  The
key turned stiffly in the lock, but it turned.  The door
opened, and Nicholas was in an unknown land, compared with which
the gooseberry garden was a stale delight, a mere material
pleasure.

Often and often Nicholas had pictured to himself what the
lumber-room might be like, that region that was so carefully
sealed from youthful eyes and concerning which no questions were
ever answered.  It came up to his expectations.  In the
first place it was large and dimly lit, one high window opening
on to the forbidden garden being its only source of
illumination.  In the second place it was a storehouse of
unimagined treasures.  The aunt-by-assertion was one of
those people who think that things spoil by use and consign them
to dust and damp by way of preserving them.  Such parts of
the house as Nicholas knew best were rather bare and cheerless,
but here there were wonderful things for the eye to feast
on.  First and foremost there was a piece of framed tapestry
that was evidently meant to be a fire-screen.  To Nicholas
it was a living, breathing story; he sat down on a roll of Indian
hangings, glowing in wonderful colours beneath a layer of dust,
and took in all the details of the tapestry picture.  A man,
dressed in the hunting costume of some remote period, had just
transfixed a stag with an arrow; it could not have been a
difficult shot because the stag was only one or two paces away
from him; in the thickly-growing vegetation that the picture
suggested it would not have been difficult to creep up to a
feeding stag, and the two spotted dogs that were springing
forward to join in the chase had evidently been trained to keep
to heel till the arrow was discharged.  That part of the
picture was simple, if interesting, but did the huntsman see,
what Nicholas saw, that four galloping wolves were coming in his
direction through the wood?  There might be more than four
of them hidden behind the trees, and in any case would the man
and his dogs be able to cope with the four wolves if they made an
attack?  The man had only two arrows left in his quiver, and
he might miss with one or both of them; all one knew about his
skill in shooting was that he could hit a large stag at a
ridiculously short range.  Nicholas sat for many golden
minutes revolving the possibilities of the scene; he was inclined
to think that there were more than four wolves and that the man
and his dogs were in a tight corner.

But there were other objects of delight and interest claiming
his instant attention: there were quaint twisted candlesticks in
the shape of snakes, and a teapot fashioned like a china duck,
out of whose open beak the tea was supposed to come.  How
dull and shapeless the nursery teapot seemed in comparison! 
And there was a carved sandal-wood box packed tight with aromatic
cotton-wool, and between the layers of cotton-wool were little
brass figures, hump-necked bulls, and peacocks and goblins,
delightful to see and to handle.  Less promising in
appearance was a large square book with plain black covers;
Nicholas peeped into it, and, behold, it was full of coloured
pictures of birds.  And such birds!  In the garden, and
in the lanes when he went for a walk, Nicholas came across a few
birds, of which the largest were an occasional magpie or
wood-pigeon; here were herons and bustards, kites, toucans,
tiger-bitterns, brush turkeys, ibises, golden pheasants, a whole
portrait gallery of undreamed-of creatures.  And as he was
admiring the colouring of the mandarin duck and assigning a
life-history to it, the voice of his aunt in shrill vociferation
of his name came from the gooseberry garden without.  She
had grown suspicious at his long disappearance, and had leapt to
the conclusion that he had climbed over the wall behind the
sheltering screen of the lilac bushes; she was now engaged in
energetic and rather hopeless search for him among the artichokes
and raspberry canes.

“Nicholas, Nicholas!” she screamed, “you are
to come out of this at once.  It’s no use trying to
hide there; I can see you all the time.”

Presently the angry repetitions of Nicholas’ name gave
way to a shriek, and a cry for somebody to come quickly. 
Nicholas shut the book, restored it carefully to its place in a
corner, and shook some dust from a neighbouring pile of
newspapers over it.  Then he crept from the room, locked the
door, and replaced the key exactly where he had found it. 
His aunt was still calling his name when he sauntered into the
front garden.

“Me,” came the answer from the other side of the
wall; “didn’t you hear me?  I’ve been
looking for you in the gooseberry garden, and I’ve slipped
into the rain-water tank.  Luckily there’s no water in
it, but the sides are slippery and I can’t get out. 
Fetch the little ladder from under the cherry
tree—”

“I told you not to, and now I tell you that you
may,” came the voice from the rain-water tank, rather
impatiently.

“Your voice doesn’t sound like
aunt’s,” objected Nicholas; “you may be the
Evil One tempting me to be disobedient.  Aunt often tells me
that the Evil One tempts me and that I always yield.  This
time I’m not going to yield.”

“Now I know that you are the Evil One and not
aunt,” shouted Nicholas gleefully; “when we asked
aunt for strawberry jam yesterday she said there wasn’t
any.  I know there are four jars of it in the store
cupboard, because I looked, and of course you know it’s
there, but she doesn’t, because she said there wasn’t
any.  Oh, Devil, you have sold yourself!”

There was an unusual sense of luxury in being able to talk to
an aunt as though one was talking to the Evil One, but Nicholas
knew, with childish discernment, that such luxuries were not to
be over-indulged in.  He walked noisily away, and it was a
kitchenmaid, in search of parsley, who eventually rescued the
aunt from the rain-water tank.

Tea that evening was partaken of in a fearsome silence. 
The tide had been at its highest when the children had arrived at
Jagborough Cove, so there had been no sands to play on—a
circumstance that the aunt had overlooked in the haste of
organising her punitive expedition.  The tightness of
Bobby’s boots had had disastrous effect on his temper the
whole of the afternoon, and altogether the children could not
have been said to have enjoyed themselves.  The aunt
maintained the frozen muteness of one who has suffered
undignified and unmerited detention in a rain-water tank for
thirty-five minutes.  As for Nicholas, he, too, was silent,
in the absorption of one who has much to think about; it was just
possible, he considered, that the huntsman would escape with his
hounds while the wolves feasted on the stricken stag.

“I am worried,” admitted Suzanne; “not
worried exactly, but anxious.  You see, my birthday happens
next week—”

“Well, old Bertram Kneyght is over in England just now
from the Argentine.  He’s a kind of distant cousin of
my mother’s, and so enormously rich that we’ve never
let the relationship drop out of sight.  Even if we
don’t see him or hear from him for years he is always
Cousin Bertram when he does turn up.  I can’t say
he’s ever been of much solid use to us, but yesterday the
subject of my birthday cropped up, and he asked me to let him
know what I wanted for a present.”

“As a rule when one is confronted with a problem like
that,” said Suzanne, “all one’s ideas vanish;
one doesn’t seem to have a desire in the world.  Now
it so happens that I have been very keen on a little Dresden
figure that I saw somewhere in Kensington; about thirty-six
shillings, quite beyond my means.  I was very nearly
describing the figure, and giving Bertram the address of the
shop.  And then it suddenly struck me that thirty-six
shillings was such a ridiculously inadequate sum for a man of his
immense wealth to spend on a birthday present.  He could
give thirty-six pounds as easily as you or I could buy a bunch of
violets.  I don’t want to be greedy, of course, but I
don’t like being wasteful.”

“The question is,” said Eleanor, “what are
his ideas as to present-giving?  Some of the wealthiest
people have curiously cramped views on that subject.  When
people grow gradually rich their requirements and standard of
living expand in proportion, while their present-giving instincts
often remain in the undeveloped condition of their earlier
days.  Something showy and not-too-expensive in a shop is
their only conception of the ideal gift.  That is why even
quite good shops have their counters and windows crowded with
things worth about four shillings that look as if they might be
worth seven-and-six, and are priced at ten shillings and labelled
seasonable gifts.’”

“I know,” said Suzanne; “that is why it is
so risky to be vague when one is giving indications of
one’s wants.  Now if I say to him: ‘I am going
out to Davos this winter, so anything in the travelling line
would be acceptable,’ he might give me a dressing-bag with
gold-mounted fittings, but, on the other hand, he might give me
Baedeker’s Switzerland, or ‘Skiing without
Tears,’ or something of that sort.”

“He would be more likely to say: ‘She’ll be
going to lots of dances, a fan will be sure to be
useful.’”

“Yes, and I’ve got tons of fans, so you see where
the danger and anxiety lies.  Now if there is one thing more
than another that I really urgently want it is furs.  I
simply haven’t any.  I’m told that Davos is full
of Russians, and they are sure to wear the most lovely sables and
things.  To be among people who are smothered in furs when
one hasn’t any oneself makes one want to break most of the
Commandments.”

“If it’s furs that you’re out for,”
said Eleanor, “you will have to superintend the choice of
them in person.  You can’t be sure that your cousin
knows the difference between silver-fox and ordinary
squirrel.”

“There are some heavenly silver-fox stoles at Goliath
and Mastodon’s,” said Suzanne, with a sigh; “if
I could only inveigle Bertram into their building and take him
for a stroll through the fur department!”

“He lives somewhere near there, doesn’t he?”
said Eleanor.  “Do you know what his habits are? 
Does he take a walk at any particular time of day?”

“He usually walks down to his club about three
o’clock, if it’s a fine day.  That takes him
right past Goliath and Mastodon’s.”

“Let us two meet him accidentally at the street corner
to-morrow,” said Eleanor; “we can walk a little way
with him, and with luck we ought to be able to side-track him
into the shop.  You can say you want to get a hair-net or
something.  When we’re safely there I can say:
‘I wish you’d tell me what you want for your
birthday.’  Then you’ll have everything ready to
hand—the rich cousin, the fur department, and the topic of
birthday presents.”

“It’s a great idea,” said Suzanne;
“you really are a brick.  Come round to-morrow at
twenty to three; don’t be late, we must carry out our
ambush to the minute.”

At a few minutes to three the next afternoon the fur-trappers
walked warily towards the selected corner.  In the near
distance rose the colossal pile of Messrs.  Goliath and
Mastodon’s famed establishment.  The afternoon was
brilliantly fine, exactly the sort of weather to tempt a
gentleman of advancing years into the discreet exercise of a
leisurely walk.

“I say, dear, I wish you’d do something for me
this evening,” said Eleanor to her companion; “just
drop in after dinner on some pretext or other, and stay on to
make a fourth at bridge with Adela and the aunts.  Otherwise
I shall have to play, and Harry Scarisbrooke is going to come in
unexpectedly about nine-fifteen, and I particularly want to be
free to talk to him while the others are playing.”

“Sorry, my dear, no can do,” said Suzanne;
“ordinary bridge at three-pence a hundred, with such
dreadfully slow players as your aunts, bores me to tears.  I
nearly go to sleep over it.”

“But I most particularly want an opportunity to talk
with Harry,” urged Eleanor, an angry glint coming into her
eyes.

“Sorry, anything to oblige, but not that,” said
Suzanne cheerfully; the sacrifices of friendship were beautiful
in her eyes as long as she was not asked to make them.

Mr. Bertram Kneyght greeted his cousin and her friend with
genuine heartiness, and readily accepted their invitation to
explore the crowded mart that stood temptingly at their
elbow.  The plate-glass doors swung open and the trio
plunged bravely into the jostling throng of buyers and
loiterers.

Suzanne, in her anxiety to pilot her cousin to the desired
haven of the fur department, was usually a few paces ahead of the
others, coming back to them now and then if they lingered for a
moment at some attractive counter, with the nervous solicitude of
a parent rook encouraging its young ones on their first flying
expedition.

“It’s Suzanne’s birthday on Wednesday
next,” confided Eleanor to Bertram Kneyght at a moment when
Suzanne had left them unusually far behind; “my birthday
comes the day before, so we are both on the look-out for
something to give each other.”

“Ah,” said Bertram.  “Now, perhaps you
can advise me on that very point.  I want to give Suzanne
something, and I haven’t the least idea what she
wants.”

“She’s rather a problem,” said
Eleanor.  “She seems to have everything one can think
of, lucky girl.  A fan is always useful; she’ll be
going to a lot of dances at Davos this winter.  Yes, I
should think a fan would please her more than anything. 
After our birthdays are over we inspect each other’s muster
of presents, and I always feel dreadfully humble.  She gets
such nice things, and I never have anything worth showing. 
You see, none of my relations or any of the people who give me
presents are at all well off, so I can’t expect them to do
anything more than just remember the day with some little
trifle.  Two years ago an uncle on my mother’s side of
the family, who had come into a small legacy, promised me a
silver-fox stole for my birthday.  I can’t tell you
how excited I was about it, how I pictured myself showing it off
to all my friends and enemies.  Then just at that moment his
wife died, and, of course, poor man, he could not be expected to
think of birthday presents at such a time.  He has lived
abroad ever since, and I never got my fur.  Do you know, to
this day I can scarcely look at a silver-fox pelt in a shop
window or round anyone’s neck without feeling ready to
burst into tears.  I suppose if I hadn’t had the
prospect of getting one I shouldn’t feel that way. 
Look, there is the fan counter, on your left; you can easily slip
away in the crowd.  Get her as nice a one as you can
see—she is such a dear, dear girl.”

“Hullo, I thought I had lost you,” said Suzanne,
making her way through an obstructive knot of shoppers. 
“Where is Bertram?”

“I got separated from him long ago.  I thought he
was on ahead with you,” said Eleanor.  “We shall
never find him in this crush.”

“All our trouble and forethought thrown away,”
said Suzanne sulkily, when they had pushed their way fruitlessly
through half a dozen departments.

“I can’t think why you didn’t grab him by
the arm,” said Eleanor; “I would have if I’d
known him longer, but I’d only just been introduced. 
It’s nearly four now, we’d better have
tea.”

“Thank you very much for the photograph frame.  It
was just what I wanted.  Very good of you.  I say, do
you know what that Kneyght person has given me?  Just what
you said he would—a wretched fan.  What?  Oh yes,
quite a good enough fan in its way, but still . . .”

“Your cousin appears to be one of those rare people of
wealth who take a pleasure in giving good presents,” came
the reply.

“I wondered why he was so anxious to know where she
lived,” snapped Suzanne to herself as she rang off.

A cloud has arisen between the friendships of the two young
women; as far as Eleanor is concerned the cloud has a silver-fox
lining.

Jocantha Bessbury was in the mood to be serenely and
graciously happy.  Her world was a pleasant place, and it
was wearing one of its pleasantest aspects.  Gregory had
managed to get home for a hurried lunch and a smoke afterwards in
the little snuggery; the lunch had been a good one, and there was
just time to do justice to the coffee and cigarettes.  Both
were excellent in their way, and Gregory was, in his way, an
excellent husband.  Jocantha rather suspected herself of
making him a very charming wife, and more than suspected herself
of having a first-rate dressmaker.

“I don’t suppose a more thoroughly contented
personality is to be found in all Chelsea,” observed
Jocantha in allusion to herself; “except perhaps
Attab,” she continued, glancing towards the large
tabby-marked cat that lay in considerable ease in a corner of the
divan.  “He lies there, purring and dreaming, shifting
his limbs now and then in an ecstasy of cushioned comfort. 
He seems the incarnation of everything soft and silky and
velvety, without a sharp edge in his composition, a dreamer whose
philosophy is sleep and let sleep; and then, as evening draws on,
he goes out into the garden with a red glint in his eyes and
slays a drowsy sparrow.”

“As every pair of sparrows hatches out ten or more young
ones in the year, while their food supply remains stationary, it
is just as well that the Attabs of the community should have that
idea of how to pass an amusing afternoon,” said
Gregory.  Having delivered himself of this sage comment he
lit another cigarette, bade Jocantha a playfully affectionate
good-bye, and departed into the outer world.

“Remember, dinner’s a wee bit earlier to-night, as
we’re going to the Haymarket,” she called after
him.

Left to herself, Jocantha continued the process of looking at
her life with placid, introspective eyes.  If she had not
everything she wanted in this world, at least she was very well
pleased with what she had got.  She was very well pleased,
for instance, with the snuggery, which contrived somehow to be
cosy and dainty and expensive all at once.  The porcelain
was rare and beautiful, the Chinese enamels took on wonderful
tints in the firelight, the rugs and hangings led the eye through
sumptuous harmonies of colouring.  It was a room in which
one might have suitably entertained an ambassador or an
archbishop, but it was also a room in which one could cut out
pictures for a scrap-book without feeling that one was
scandalising the deities of the place with one’s
litter.  And as with the snuggery, so with the rest of the
house, and as with the house, so with the other departments of
Jocantha’s life; she really had good reason for being one
of the most contented women in Chelsea.

From being in a mood of simmering satisfaction with her lot
she passed to the phase of being generously commiserating for
those thousands around her whose lives and circumstances were
dull, cheap, pleasureless, and empty.  Work girls, shop
assistants and so forth, the class that have neither the
happy-go-lucky freedom of the poor nor the leisured freedom of
the rich, came specially within the range of her sympathy. 
It was sad to think that there were young people who, after a
long day’s work, had to sit alone in chill, dreary bedrooms
because they could not afford the price of a cup of coffee and a
sandwich in a restaurant, still less a shilling for a theatre
gallery.

Jocantha’s mind was still dwelling on this theme when
she started forth on an afternoon campaign of desultory shopping;
it would be rather a comforting thing, she told herself, if she
could do something, on the spur of the moment, to bring a gleam
of pleasure and interest into the life of even one or two
wistful-hearted, empty-pocketed workers; it would add a good deal
to her sense of enjoyment at the theatre that night.  She
would get two upper circle tickets for a popular play, make her
way into some cheap tea-shop, and present the tickets to the
first couple of interesting work girls with whom she could
casually drop into conversation.  She could explain matters
by saying that she was unable to use the tickets herself and did
not want them to be wasted, and, on the other hand, did not want
the trouble of sending them back.  On further reflection she
decided that it might be better to get only one ticket and give
it to some lonely-looking girl sitting eating her frugal meal by
herself; the girl might scrape acquaintance with her next-seat
neighbour at the theatre and lay the foundations of a lasting
friendship.

With the Fairy Godmother impulse strong upon her, Jocantha
marched into a ticket agency and selected with immense care an
upper circle seat for the “Yellow Peacock,” a play
that was attracting a considerable amount of discussion and
criticism.  Then she went forth in search of a tea-shop and
philanthropic adventure, at about the same time that Attab
sauntered into the garden with a mind attuned to sparrow
stalking.  In a corner of an A.B.C. shop she found an
unoccupied table, whereat she promptly installed herself,
impelled by the fact that at the next table was sitting a young
girl, rather plain of feature, with tired, listless eyes, and a
general air of uncomplaining forlornness.  Her dress was of
poor material, but aimed at being in the fashion, her hair was
pretty, and her complexion bad; she was finishing a modest meal
of tea and scone, and she was not very different in her way from
thousands of other girls who were finishing, or beginning, or
continuing their teas in London tea-shops at that exact
moment.  The odds were enormously in favour of the
supposition that she had never seen the “Yellow
Peacock”; obviously she supplied excellent material for
Jocantha’s first experiment in haphazard benefaction.

Jocantha ordered some tea and a muffin, and then turned a
friendly scrutiny on her neighbour with a view to catching her
eye.  At that precise moment the girl’s face lit up
with sudden pleasure, her eyes sparkled, a flush came into her
cheeks, and she looked almost pretty.  A young man, whom she
greeted with an affectionate “Hullo, Bertie,” came up
to her table and took his seat in a chair facing her. 
Jocantha looked hard at the new-comer; he was in appearance a few
years younger than herself, very much better looking than
Gregory, rather better looking, in fact, than any of the young
men of her set.  She guessed him to be a well-mannered young
clerk in some wholesale warehouse, existing and amusing himself
as best he might on a tiny salary, and commanding a holiday of
about two weeks in the year.  He was aware, of course, of
his good looks, but with the shy self-consciousness of the
Anglo-Saxon, not the blatant complacency of the Latin or
Semite.  He was obviously on terms of friendly intimacy with
the girl he was talking to, probably they were drifting towards a
formal engagement.  Jocantha pictured the boy’s home,
in a rather narrow circle, with a tiresome mother who always
wanted to know how and where he spent his evenings.  He
would exchange that humdrum thraldom in due course for a home of
his own, dominated by a chronic scarcity of pounds, shillings,
and pence, and a dearth of most of the things that made life
attractive or comfortable.  Jocantha felt extremely sorry
for him.  She wondered if he had seen the “Yellow
Peacock”; the odds were enormously in favour of the
supposition that he had not.  The girl had finished her tea
and would shortly be going back to her work; when the boy was
alone it would be quite easy for Jocantha to say: “My
husband has made other arrangements for me this evening; would
you care to make use of this ticket, which would otherwise be
wasted?”  Then she could come there again one
afternoon for tea, and, if she saw him, ask him how he liked the
play.  If he was a nice boy and improved on acquaintance he
could be given more theatre tickets, and perhaps asked to come
one Sunday to tea at Chelsea.  Jocantha made up her mind
that he would improve on acquaintance, and that Gregory would
like him, and that the Fairy Godmother business would prove far
more entertaining than she had originally anticipated.  The
boy was distinctly presentable; he knew how to brush his hair,
which was possibly an imitative faculty; he knew what colour of
tie suited him, which might be intuition; he was exactly the type
that Jocantha admired, which of course was accident. 
Altogether she was rather pleased when the girl looked at the
clock and bade a friendly but hurried farewell to her
companion.  Bertie nodded “good-bye,” gulped
down a mouthful of tea, and then produced from his overcoat
pocket a paper-covered book, bearing the title “Sepoy and
Sahib, a tale of the great Mutiny.”

The laws of tea-shop etiquette forbid that you should offer
theatre tickets to a stranger without having first caught the
stranger’s eye.  It is even better if you can ask to
have a sugar basin passed to you, having previously concealed the
fact that you have a large and well-filled sugar basin on your
own table; this is not difficult to manage, as the printed menu
is generally nearly as large as the table, and can be made to
stand on end.  Jocantha set to work hopefully; she had a
long and rather high-pitched discussion with the waitress
concerning alleged defects in an altogether blameless muffin, she
made loud and plaintive inquiries about the tube service to some
impossibly remote suburb, she talked with brilliant insincerity
to the tea-shop kitten, and as a last resort she upset a milk-jug
and swore at it daintily.  Altogether she attracted a good
deal of attention, but never for a moment did she attract the
attention of the boy with the beautifully-brushed hair, who was
some thousands of miles away in the baking plains of Hindostan,
amid deserted bungalows, seething bazaars, and riotous barrack
squares, listening to the throbbing of tom-toms and the distant
rattle of musketry.

Jocantha went back to her house in Chelsea, which struck her
for the first time as looking dull and over-furnished.  She
had a resentful conviction that Gregory would be uninteresting at
dinner, and that the play would be stupid after dinner.  On
the whole her frame of mind showed a marked divergence from the
purring complacency of Attab, who was again curled up in his
corner of the divan with a great peace radiating from every curve
of his body.

Of all the genuine Bohemians who strayed from time to time
into the would-be Bohemian circle of the Restaurant Nuremberg,
Owl Street, Soho, none was more interesting and more elusive than
Gebhard Knopfschrank.  He had no friends, and though he
treated all the restaurant frequenters as acquaintances he never
seemed to wish to carry the acquaintanceship beyond the door that
led into Owl Street and the outer world.  He dealt with them
all rather as a market woman might deal with chance passers-by,
exhibiting her wares and chattering about the weather and the
slackness of business, occasionally about rheumatism, but never
showing a desire to penetrate into their daily lives or to
dissect their ambitions.

He was understood to belong to a family of peasant farmers,
somewhere in Pomerania; some two years ago, according to all that
was known of him, he had abandoned the labours and
responsibilities of swine tending and goose rearing to try his
fortune as an artist in London.

Well, there was a ship that left Stolpmünde for London
twice a month, that carried few passengers, but carried them
cheaply; the railway fares to Munich or Paris were not
cheap.  Thus it was that he came to select London as the
scene of his great adventure.

The question that had long and seriously agitated the
frequenters of the Nuremberg was whether this goose-boy migrant
was really a soul-driven genius, spreading his wings to the
light, or merely an enterprising young man who fancied he could
paint and was pardonably anxious to escape from the monotony of
rye bread diet and the sandy, swine-bestrewn plains of
Pomerania.  There was reasonable ground for doubt and
caution; the artistic groups that foregathered at the little
restaurant contained so many young women with short hair and so
many young men with long hair, who supposed themselves to be
abnormally gifted in the domain of music, poetry, painting, or
stagecraft, with little or nothing to support the supposition,
that a self-announced genius of any sort in their midst was
inevitably suspect.  On the other hand, there was the
ever-imminent danger of entertaining, and snubbing, an angel
unawares.  There had been the lamentable case of Sledonti,
the dramatic poet, who had been belittled and cold-shouldered in
the Owl Street hall of judgment, and had been afterwards hailed
as a master singer by the Grand Duke Constantine
Constantinovitch—“the most educated of the
Romanoffs,” according to Sylvia Strubble, who spoke rather
as one who knew every individual member of the Russian imperial
family; as a matter of fact, she knew a newspaper correspondent,
a young man who ate bortsch with the air of having
invented it.  Sledonti’s “Poems of Death and
Passion” were now being sold by the thousand in seven
European languages, and were about to be translated into Syrian,
a circumstance which made the discerning critics of the Nuremberg
rather shy of maturing their future judgments too rapidly and too
irrevocably.

As regards Knopfschrank’s work, they did not lack
opportunity for inspecting and appraising it.  However
resolutely he might hold himself aloof from the social life of
his restaurant acquaintances, he was not minded to hide his
artistic performances from their inquiring gaze.  Every
evening, or nearly every evening, at about seven o’clock,
he would make his appearance, sit himself down at his accustomed
table, throw a bulky black portfolio on to the chair opposite
him, nod round indiscriminately at his fellow-guests, and
commence the serious business of eating and drinking.  When
the coffee stage was reached he would light a cigarette, draw the
portfolio over to him, and begin to rummage among its
contents.  With slow deliberation he would select a few of
his more recent studies and sketches, and silently pass them
round from table to table, paying especial attention to any new
diners who might be present.  On the back of each sketch was
marked in plain figures the announcement “Price ten
shillings.”

If his work was not obviously stamped with the hall-mark of
genius, at any rate it was remarkable for its choice of an
unusual and unvarying theme.  His pictures always
represented some well-known street or public place in London,
fallen into decay and denuded of its human population, in the
place of which there roamed a wild fauna, which, from its wealth
of exotic species, must have originally escaped from Zoological
Gardens and travelling beast shows.  “Giraffes
drinking at the fountain pools, Trafalgar Square,” was one
of the most notable and characteristic of his studies, while even
more sensational was the gruesome picture of “Vultures
attacking dying camel in Upper Berkeley Street.” 
There were also photographs of the large canvas on which he had
been engaged for some months, and which he was now endeavouring
to sell to some enterprising dealer or adventurous amateur. 
The subject was “Hyænas asleep in Euston
Station,” a composition that left nothing to be desired in
the way of suggesting unfathomed depths of desolation.

“Of course it may be immensely clever, it may be
something epoch-making in the realm of art,” said Sylvia
Strubble to her own particular circle of listeners, “but,
on the other hand, it may be merely mad.  One mustn’t
pay too much attention to the commercial aspect of the case, of
course, but still, if some dealer would make a bid for that
hyæna picture, or even for some of the sketches, we should
know better how to place the man and his work.”

“We may all be cursing ourselves one of these
days,” said Mrs. Nougat-Jones, “for not having bought
up his entire portfolio of sketches.  At the same time, when
there is so much real talent going about, one does not feel like
planking down ten shillings for what looks like a bit of
whimsical oddity.  Now that picture that he showed us last
week, ‘Sand-grouse roosting on the Albert Memorial,’
was very impressive, and of course I could see there was good
workmanship in it and breadth of treatment; but it didn’t
in the least convey the Albert Memorial to me, and Sir James
Beanquest tells me that sand-grouse don’t roost, they sleep
on the ground.”

Whatever talent or genius the Pomeranian artist might possess,
it certainly failed to receive commercial sanction.  The
portfolio remained bulky with unsold sketches, and the
“Euston Siesta,” as the wits of the Nuremberg
nicknamed the large canvas, was still in the market.  The
outward and visible signs of financial embarrassment began to be
noticeable; the half-bottle of cheap claret at dinner-time gave
way to a small glass of lager, and this in turn was displaced by
water.  The one-and-sixpenny set dinner receded from an
everyday event to a Sunday extravagance; on ordinary days the
artist contented himself with a sevenpenny omelette and some
bread and cheese, and there were evenings when he did not put in
an appearance at all.  On the rare occasions when he spoke
of his own affairs it was observed that he began to talk more
about Pomerania and less about the great world of art.

“It is a busy time there now with us,” he said
wistfully; “the schwines are driven out into the fields
after harvest, and must be looked after.  I could be helping
to look after if I was there.  Here it is difficult to live;
art is not appreciate.”

“Ah, it cost money!  There is the ship passage to
Stolpmünde, and there is money that I owe at my
lodgings.  Even here I owe a few schillings.  If I
could sell some of my sketches—”

“Perhaps,” suggested Mrs. Nougat-Jones, “if
you were to offer them for a little less, some of us would be
glad to buy a few.  Ten shillings is always a consideration,
you know, to people who are not over well off.  Perhaps if
you were to ask six or seven shillings—”

Once a peasant, always a peasant.  The mere suggestion of
a bargain to be struck brought a twinkle of awakened alertness
into the artist’s eyes, and hardened the lines of his
mouth.

“Nine schilling nine pence each,” he snapped, and
seemed disappointed that Mrs. Nougat-Jones did not pursue the
subject further.  He had evidently expected her to offer
seven and fourpence.

The weeks sped by, and Knopfschrank came more rarely to the
restaurant in Owl Street, while his meals on those occasions
became more and more meagre.  And then came a triumphal day,
when he appeared early in the evening in a high state of elation,
and ordered an elaborate meal that scarcely stopped short of
being a banquet.  The ordinary resources of the kitchen were
supplemented by an imported dish of smoked goosebreast, a
Pomeranian delicacy that was luckily procurable at a firm of
delikatessen merchants in Coventry Street, while a
long-necked bottle of Rhine wine gave a finishing touch of
festivity and good cheer to the crowded table.

“He has evidently sold his masterpiece,” whispered
Sylvia Strubble to Mrs. Nougat-Jones, who had come in late.

“Don’t know; he hasn’t said anything yet,
but it must be some American.  Do you see, he has got a
little American flag on the dessert dish, and he has put pennies
in the music box three times, once to play the
‘Star-spangled Banner,’ then a Sousa march, and then
the ‘Star-spangled Banner’ again.  It must be an
American millionaire, and he’s evidently got a very big
price for it; he’s just beaming and chuckling with
satisfaction.”

“Hush! no, don’t.  Let’s buy some of
his sketches, quick, before we are supposed to know that
he’s famous; otherwise he’ll be doubling the
prices.  I am so glad he’s had a success at
last.  I always believed in him, you know.”

For the sum of ten shillings each Miss Strubble acquired the
drawings of the camel dying in Upper Berkeley Street and of the
giraffes quenching their thirst in Trafalgar Square; at the same
price Mrs. Nougat-Jones secured the study of roosting
sand-grouse.  A more ambitious picture, “Wolves and
wapiti fighting on the steps of the Athenæum Club,”
found a purchaser at fifteen shillings.

“And now what are your plans?” asked a young man
who contributed occasional paragraphs to an artistic weekly.

“Ah, there is nossing in it.  One starves. 
Till to-day I have sold not one of my sketches.  To-night
you have bought a few, because I am going away from you, but at
other times, not one.”

“Ah, the rich American,” chuckled the
artist.  “God be thanked.  He dash his car right
into our herd of schwines as they were being driven out to the
fields.  Many of our best schwines he killed, but he paid
all damages.  He paid perhaps more than they were worth,
many times more than they would have fetched in the market after
a month of fattening, but he was in a hurry to get on to
Dantzig.  When one is in a hurry one must pay what one is
asked.  God be thanked for rich Americans, who are always in
a hurry to get somewhere else.  My father and mother, they
have now so plenty of money; they send me some to pay my debts
and come home.  I start on Monday for Stolpmünde and I
do not come back.  Never.”

In time he will be forgotten, but at present Knopfschrank is
almost as sore a subject as Sledonti with some of the frequenters
of the Nuremberg Restaurant, Owl Street, Soho.' WHERE id = 'd00a72c9-4c8f-44a9-9e4f-e77bd3c50827';
