      thunderbolt.” These words of Maupassant to Jose Maria de Heredia on
      the occasion of a memorable meeting are, in spite of their morbid
      solemnity, not an inexact summing up of the brief career during which, for
      ten years, the writer, by turns undaunted and sorrowful, with the
      fertility of a master hand produced poetry, novels, romances and travels,
      only to sink prematurely into the abyss of madness and death. . . . .

In the month of April, 1880, an article appeared in the “Le Gaulois”
      announcing the publication of the Soirees de Medan. It was signed by a
      name as yet unknown: Guy de Maupassant. After a juvenile diatribe against
      romanticism and a passionate attack on languorous literature, the writer
      extolled the study of real life, and announced the publication of the new
      work. It was picturesque and charming. In the quiet of evening, on an
      island, in the Seine, beneath poplars instead of the Neapolitan cypresses
      dear to the friends of Boccaccio, amid the continuous murmur of the
      valley, and no longer to the sound of the Pyrennean streams that murmured
      a faint accompaniment to the tales of Marguerite''s cavaliers, the master
      and his disciples took turns in narrating some striking or pathetic
      episode of the war. And the issue, in collaboration, of these tales in one
      volume, in which the master jostled elbows with his pupils, took on the
      appearance of a manifesto, the tone of a challenge, or the utterance of a
      creed.

In fact, however, the beginnings had been much more simple, and they had
      confined themselves, beneath the trees of Medan, to deciding on a general
      title for the work. Zola had contributed the manuscript of the “Attaque
      du Moulin,” and it was at Maupassant''s house that the five young men
      gave in their contributions. Each one read his story, Maupassant being the
      last. When he had finished Boule de Suif, with a spontaneous impulse, with
      an emotion they never forgot, filled with enthusiasm at this revelation,
      they all rose and, without superfluous words, acclaimed him as a master.

He undertook to write the article for the Gaulois and, in cooperation with
      his friends, he worded it in the terms with which we are familiar,
      amplifying and embellishing it, yielding to an inborn taste for
      mystification which his youth rendered excusable. The essential point, he
      said, is to “unmoor” criticism.

It was unmoored. The following day Wolff wrote a polemical dissertation in
      the Figaro and carried away his colleagues. The volume was a brilliant
      success, thanks to Boule de Suif. Despite the novelty, the honesty of
      effort, on the part of all, no mention was made of the other stories.
      Relegated to the second rank, they passed without notice. From his first
      battle, Maupassant was master of the field in literature.

At once the entire press took him up and said what was appropriate
      regarding the budding celebrity. Biographers and reporters sought
      information concerning his life. As it was very simple and perfectly
      straightforward, they resorted to invention. And thus it is that at the
      present day Maupassant appears to us like one of those ancient heroes
      whose origin and death are veiled in mystery.

I will not dwell on Guy de Maupassant''s younger days. His relatives, his
      old friends, he himself, here and there in his works, have furnished us in
      their letters enough valuable revelations and touching remembrances of the
      years preceding his literary debut. His worthy biographer, H. Edouard
      Maynial, after collecting intelligently all the writings, condensing and
      comparing them, has been able to give us some definite information
      regarding that early period.

I will simply recall that he was born on the 5th of August, 1850, near
      Dieppe, in the castle of Miromesnil which he describes in Une Vie. . . .

Maupassant, like Flaubert, was a Norman, through his mother, and through
      his place of birth he belonged to that strange and adventurous race, whose
      heroic and long voyages on tramp trading ships he liked to recall. And
      just as the author of “Education sentimentale” seems to have
      inherited in the paternal line the shrewd realism of Champagne, so de
      Maupassant appears to have inherited from his Lorraine ancestors their
      indestructible discipline and cold lucidity.

His childhood was passed at Etretat, his beautiful childhood; it was there
      that his instincts were awakened in the unfoldment of his prehistoric
      soul. Years went by in an ecstasy of physical happiness. The delight of
      running at full speed through fields of gorse, the charm of voyages of
      discovery in hollows and ravines, games beneath the dark hedges, a passion
      for going to sea with the fishermen and, on nights when there was no moon,
      for dreaming on their boats of imaginary voyages.

Mme. de Maupassant, who had guided her son''s early reading, and had gazed
      with him at the sublime spectacle of nature, put, off as long as possible
      the hour of separation. One day, however, she had to take the child to the
      little seminary at Yvetot. Later, he became a student at the college at
      Rouen, and became a literary correspondent of Louis Bouilhet. It was at
      the latter''s house on those Sundays in winter when the Norman rain drowned
      the sound of the bells and dashed against the window panes that the school
      boy learned to write poetry.

Vacation took the rhetorician back to the north of Normandy. Now it was
      shooting at Saint Julien l''Hospitalier, across fields, bogs, and through
      the woods. From that time on he sealed his pact with the earth, and those
      “deep and delicate roots” which attached him to his native
      soil began to grow. It was of Normandy, broad, fresh and virile, that he
      would presently demand his inspiration, fervent and eager as a boy''s love;
      it was in her that he would take refuge when, weary of life, he would
      implore a truce, or when he simply wished to work and revive his energies
      in old-time joys. It was at this time that was born in him that voluptuous
      love of the sea, which in later days could alone withdraw him from the
      world, calm him, console him.

In 1870 he lived in the country, then he came to Paris to live; for, the
      family fortunes having dwindled, he had to look for a position. For
      several years he was a clerk in the Ministry of Marine, where he turned
      over musty papers, in the uninteresting company of the clerks of the
      admiralty.

Then he went into the department of Public Instruction, where bureaucratic
      servility is less intolerable. The daily duties are certainly scarcely
      more onerous and he had as chiefs, or colleagues, Xavier Charmes and Leon
      Dierx, Henry Roujon and Rene Billotte, but his office looked out on a
      beautiful melancholy garden with immense plane trees around which black
      circles of crows gathered in winter.

Maupassant made two divisions of his spare hours, one for boating, and the
      other for literature. Every evening in spring, every free day, he ran down
      to the river whose mysterious current veiled in fog or sparkling in the
      sun called to him and bewitched him. In the islands in the Seine between
      Chatou and Port-Marly, on the banks of Sartrouville and Triel he was long
      noted among the population of boatmen, who have now vanished, for his
      unwearying biceps, his cynical gaiety of good-fellowship, his unfailing
      practical jokes, his broad witticisms. Sometimes he would row with frantic
      speed, free and joyous, through the glowing sunlight on the stream;
      sometimes, he would wander along the coast, questioning the sailors,
      chatting with the ravageurs, or junk gatherers, or stretched at full
      length amid the irises and tansy he would lie for hours watching the frail
      insects that play on the surface of the stream, water spiders, or white
      butterflies, dragon flies, chasing each other amid the willow leaves, or
      frogs asleep on the lily-pads.

The rest of his life was taken up by his work. Without ever becoming
      despondent, silent and persistent, he accumulated manuscripts, poetry,
      criticisms, plays, romances and novels. Every week he docilely submitted
      his work to the great Flaubert, the childhood friend of his mother and his
      uncle Alfred Le Poittevin. The master had consented to assist the young
      man, to reveal to him the secrets that make chefs-d''oeuvre immortal. It
      was he who compelled him to make copious research and to use direct
      observation and who inculcated in him a horror of vulgarity and a contempt
      for facility.

Maupassant himself tells us of those severe initiations in the Rue
      Murillo, or in the tent at Croisset; he has recalled the implacable
      didactics of his old master, his tender brutality, the paternal advice of
      his generous and candid heart. For seven years Flaubert slashed,
      pulverized, the awkward attempts of his pupil whose success remained
      uncertain.

Suddenly, in a flight of spontaneous perfection, he wrote Boule de Suif.
      His master''s joy was great and overwhelming. He died two months later.

Until the end Maupassant remained illuminated by the reflection of the
      good, vanished giant, by that touching reflection that comes from the dead
      to those souls they have so profoundly stirred. The worship of Flaubert
      was a religion from which nothing could distract him, neither work, nor
      glory, nor slow moving waves, nor balmy nights.

At the end of his short life, while his mind was still clear: he wrote to
      a friend: “I am always thinking of my poor Flaubert, and I say to
      myself that I should like to die if I were sure that anyone would think of
      me in the same manner.”

During these long years of his novitiate Maupassant had entered the social
      literary circles. He would remain silent, preoccupied; and if anyone,
      astonished at his silence, asked him about his plans he answered simply:
      “I am learning my trade.” However, under the pseudonym of Guy
      de Valmont, he had sent some articles to the newspapers, and, later, with
      the approval and by the advice of Flaubert, he published, in the “Republique
      des Lettres,” poems signed by his name.

These poems, overflowing with sensuality, where the hymn to the Earth
      describes the transports of physical possession, where the impatience of
      love expresses itself in loud melancholy appeals like the calls of animals
      in the spring nights, are valuable chiefly inasmuch as they reveal the
      creature of instinct, the fawn escaped from his native forests, that
      Maupassant was in his early youth. But they add nothing to his glory. They
      are the “rhymes of a prose writer” as Jules Lemaitre said. To
      mould the expression of his thought according to the strictest laws, and
      to “narrow it down” to some extent, such was his aim.
      Following the example of one of his comrades of Medan, being readily
      carried away by precision of style and the rhythm of sentences, by the
      imperious rule of the ballad, of the pantoum or the chant royal,
      Maupassant also desired to write in metrical lines. However, he never
      liked this collection that he often regretted having published. His
      encounters with prosody had left him with that monotonous weariness that
      the horseman and the fencer feel after a period in the riding school, or a
      bout with the foils.

The day following the publication of “Boule de Suif,” his
      reputation began to grow rapidly. The quality of his story was unrivalled,
      but at the same time it must be acknowledged that there were some who, for
      the sake of discussion, desired to place a young reputation in opposition
      to the triumphant brutality of Zola.

From this time on, Maupassant, at the solicitation of the entire press,
      set to work and wrote story after story. His talent, free from all
      influences, his individuality, are not disputed for a moment. With a quick
      step, steady and alert, he advanced to fame, a fame of which he himself
      was not aware, but which was so universal, that no contemporary author
      during his life ever experienced the same. The “meteor” sent
      out its light and its rays were prolonged without limit, in article after
      article, volume on volume.

He was now rich and famous . . . . He is esteemed all the more as they
      believe him to be rich and happy. But they do not know that this young
      fellow with the sunburnt face, thick neck and salient muscles whom they
      invariably compare to a young bull at liberty, and whose love affairs they
      whisper, is ill, very ill. At the very moment that success came to him,
      the malady that never afterwards left him came also, and, seated
      motionless at his side, gazed at him with its threatening countenance. He
      suffered from terrible headaches, followed by nights of insomnia. He had
      nervous attacks, which he soothed with narcotics and anesthetics, which he
      used freely. His sight, which had troubled him at intervals, became
      affected, and a celebrated oculist spoke of abnormality, asymetry of the
      pupils. The famous young man trembled in secret and was haunted by all
      kinds of terrors.

The reader is charmed at the saneness of this revived art and yet, here
      and there, he is surprised to discover, amid descriptions of nature that
      are full of humanity, disquieting flights towards the supernatural,
      distressing conjurations, veiled at first, of the most commonplace, the
      most vertiginous shuddering fits of fear, as old as the world and as
      eternal as the unknown. But, instead of being alarmed, he thinks that the
      author must be gifted with infallible intuition to follow out thus the
      taints in his characters, even through their most dangerous mazes. The
      reader does not know that these hallucinations which he describes so
      minutely were experienced by Maupassant himself; he does not know that the
      fear is in himself, the anguish of fear “which is not caused by the
      presence of danger, or of inevitable death, but by certain abnormal
      conditions, by certain mysterious influences in presence of vague dangers,”
      the “fear of fear, the dread of that horrible sensation of
      incomprehensible terror.”

How can one explain these physical sufferings and this morbid distress
      that were known for some time to his intimates alone? Alas! the
      explanation is only too simple. All his life, consciously or
      unconsciously, Maupassant fought this malady, hidden as yet, which was
      latent in him.

As his malady began to take a more definite form, he turned his steps
      towards the south, only visiting Paris to see his physicians and
      publishers. In the old port of Antibes beyond the causeway of Cannes, his
      yacht, Bel Ami, which he cherished as a brother, lay at anchor and awaited
      him. He took it to the white cities of the Genoese Gulf, towards the palm
      trees of Hyeres, or the red bay trees of Antheor.

After several tragic weeks in which, from instinct, he made a desperate
      fight, on the 1st of January, 1892, he felt he was hopelessly vanquished,
      and in a moment of supreme clearness of intellect, like Gerard de Nerval,
      he attempted suicide. Less fortunate than the author of Sylvia, he was
      unsuccessful. But his mind, henceforth “indifferent to all
      unhappiness,” had entered into eternal darkness.

He was taken back to Paris and placed in Dr. Meuriot''s sanatorium, where,
      after eighteen months of mechanical existence, the “meteor”
      quietly passed away.

For several days in succession fragments of a defeated army had passed
      through the town. They were mere disorganized bands, not disciplined
      forces. The men wore long, dirty beards and tattered uniforms; they
      advanced in listless fashion, without a flag, without a leader. All seemed
      exhausted, worn out, incapable of thought or resolve, marching onward
      merely by force of habit, and dropping to the ground with fatigue the
      moment they halted. One saw, in particular, many enlisted men, peaceful
      citizens, men who lived quietly on their income, bending beneath the
      weight of their rifles; and little active volunteers, easily frightened
      but full of enthusiasm, as eager to attack as they were ready to take to
      flight; and amid these, a sprinkling of red-breeched soldiers, the pitiful
      remnant of a division cut down in a great battle; somber artillerymen,
      side by side with nondescript foot-soldiers; and, here and there, the
      gleaming helmet of a heavy-footed dragoon who had difficulty in keeping up
      with the quicker pace of the soldiers of the line. Legions of irregulars
      with high-sounding names “Avengers of Defeat,” “Citizens
      of the Tomb,” “Brethren in Death”—passed in their
      turn, looking like banditti. Their leaders, former drapers or grain
      merchants, or tallow or soap chandlers—warriors by force of
      circumstances, officers by reason of their mustachios or their money—covered
      with weapons, flannel and gold lace, spoke in an impressive manner,
      discussed plans of campaign, and behaved as though they alone bore the
      fortunes of dying France on their braggart shoulders; though, in truth,
      they frequently were afraid of their own men—scoundrels often brave
      beyond measure, but pillagers and debauchees.

The members of the National Guard, who for the past two months had been
      reconnoitering with the utmost caution in the neighboring woods,
      occasionally shooting their own sentinels, and making ready for fight
      whenever a rabbit rustled in the undergrowth, had now returned to their
      homes. Their arms, their uniforms, all the death-dealing paraphernalia
      with which they had terrified all the milestones along the highroad for
      eight miles round, had suddenly and marvellously disappeared.

The last of the French soldiers had just crossed the Seine on their way to
      Pont-Audemer, through Saint-Sever and Bourg-Achard, and in their rear the
      vanquished general, powerless to do aught with the forlorn remnants of his
      army, himself dismayed at the final overthrow of a nation accustomed to
      victory and disastrously beaten despite its legendary bravery, walked
      between two orderlies.

Then a profound calm, a shuddering, silent dread, settled on the city.
      Many a round-paunched citizen, emasculated by years devoted to business,
      anxiously awaited the conquerors, trembling lest his roasting-jacks or
      kitchen knives should be looked upon as weapons.

Life seemed to have stopped short; the shops were shut, the streets
      deserted. Now and then an inhabitant, awed by the silence, glided swiftly
      by in the shadow of the walls. The anguish of suspense made men even
      desire the arrival of the enemy.

In the afternoon of the day following the departure of the French troops,
      a number of uhlans, coming no one knew whence, passed rapidly through the
      town. A little later on, a black mass descended St. Catherine''s Hill,
      while two other invading bodies appeared respectively on the Darnetal and
      the Boisguillaume roads. The advance guards of the three corps arrived at
      precisely the same moment at the Square of the Hotel de Ville, and the
      German army poured through all the adjacent streets, its battalions making
      the pavement ring with their firm, measured tread.

Orders shouted in an unknown, guttural tongue rose to the windows of the
      seemingly dead, deserted houses; while behind the fast-closed shutters
      eager eyes peered forth at the victors-masters now of the city, its
      fortunes, and its lives, by “right of war.” The inhabitants,
      in their darkened rooms, were possessed by that terror which follows in
      the wake of cataclysms, of deadly upheavals of the earth, against which
      all human skill and strength are vain. For the same thing happens whenever
      the established order of things is upset, when security no longer exists,
      when all those rights usually protected by the law of man or of Nature are
      at the mercy of unreasoning, savage force. The earthquake crushing a whole
      nation under falling roofs; the flood let loose, and engulfing in its
      swirling depths the corpses of drowned peasants, along with dead oxen and
      beams torn from shattered houses; or the army, covered with glory,
      murdering those who defend themselves, making prisoners of the rest,
      pillaging in the name of the Sword, and giving thanks to God to the
      thunder of cannon—all these are appalling scourges, which destroy
      all belief in eternal justice, all that confidence we have been taught to
      feel in the protection of Heaven and the reason of man.

Small detachments of soldiers knocked at each door, and then disappeared
      within the houses; for the vanquished saw they would have to be civil to
      their conquerors.

At the end of a short time, once the first terror had subsided, calm was
      again restored. In many houses the Prussian officer ate at the same table
      with the family. He was often well-bred, and, out of politeness, expressed
      sympathy with France and repugnance at being compelled to take part in the
      war. This sentiment was received with gratitude; besides, his protection
      might be needful some day or other. By the exercise of tact the number of
      men quartered in one''s house might be reduced; and why should one provoke
      the hostility of a person on whom one''s whole welfare depended? Such
      conduct would savor less of bravery than of fool-hardiness. And
      foolhardiness is no longer a failing of the citizens of Rouen as it was in
      the days when their city earned renown by its heroic defenses. Last of
      all-final argument based on the national politeness—the folk of
      Rouen said to one another that it was only right to be civil in one''s own
      house, provided there was no public exhibition of familiarity with the
      foreigner. Out of doors, therefore, citizen and soldier did not know each
      other; but in the house both chatted freely, and each evening the German
      remained a little longer warming himself at the hospitable hearth.

Even the town itself resumed by degrees its ordinary aspect. The French
      seldom walked abroad, but the streets swarmed with Prussian soldiers.
      Moreover, the officers of the Blue Hussars, who arrogantly dragged their
      instruments of death along the pavements, seemed to hold the simple
      townsmen in but little more contempt than did the French cavalry officers
      who had drunk at the same cafes the year before.

But there was something in the air, a something strange and subtle, an
      intolerable foreign atmosphere like a penetrating odor—the odor of
      invasion. It permeated dwellings and places of public resort, changed the
      taste of food, made one imagine one''s self in far-distant lands, amid
      dangerous, barbaric tribes.

The conquerors exacted money, much money. The inhabitants paid what was
      asked; they were rich. But, the wealthier a Norman tradesman becomes, the
      more he suffers at having to part with anything that belongs to him, at
      having to see any portion of his substance pass into the hands of another.

Nevertheless, within six or seven miles of the town, along the course of
      the river as it flows onward to Croisset, Dieppedalle and Biessart,
      boat-men and fishermen often hauled to the surface of the water the body
      of a German, bloated in his uniform, killed by a blow from knife or club,
      his head crushed by a stone, or perchance pushed from some bridge into the
      stream below. The mud of the river-bed swallowed up these obscure acts of
      vengeance—savage, yet legitimate; these unrecorded deeds of bravery;
      these silent attacks fraught with greater danger than battles fought in
      broad day, and surrounded, moreover, with no halo of romance. For hatred
      of the foreigner ever arms a few intrepid souls, ready to die for an idea.

At last, as the invaders, though subjecting the town to the strictest
      discipline, had not committed any of the deeds of horror with which they
      had been credited while on their triumphal march, the people grew bolder,
      and the necessities of business again animated the breasts of the local
      merchants. Some of these had important commercial interests at Havre
      —occupied at present by the French army—and wished to attempt
      to reach that port by overland route to Dieppe, taking the boat from
      there.

Through the influence of the German officers whose acquaintance they had
      made, they obtained a permit to leave town from the general in command.

A large four-horse coach having, therefore, been engaged for the journey,
      and ten passengers having given in their names to the proprietor, they
      decided to start on a certain Tuesday morning before daybreak, to avoid
      attracting a crowd.

The ground had been frozen hard for some time-past, and about three
      o''clock on Monday afternoon—large black clouds from the north shed
      their burden of snow uninterruptedly all through that evening and night.

At half-past four in the morning the travellers met in the courtyard of
      the Hotel de Normandie, where they were to take their seats in the coach.

They were still half asleep, and shivering with cold under their wraps.
      They could see one another but indistinctly in the darkness, and the
      mountain of heavy winter wraps in which each was swathed made them look
      like a gathering of obese priests in their long cassocks. But two men
      recognized each other, a third accosted them, and the three began to talk.
      “I am bringing my wife,” said one. “So am I.”
      “And I, too.” The first speaker added: “We shall not
      return to Rouen, and if the Prussians approach Havre we will cross to
      England.” All three, it turned out, had made the same plans, being
      of similar disposition and temperament.

Still the horses were not harnessed. A small lantern carried by a
      stable-boy emerged now and then from one dark doorway to disappear
      immediately in another. The stamping of horses'' hoofs, deadened by the
      dung and straw of the stable, was heard from time to time, and from inside
      the building issued a man''s voice, talking to the animals and swearing at
      them. A faint tinkle of bells showed that the harness was being got ready;
      this tinkle soon developed into a continuous jingling, louder or softer
      according to the movements of the horse, sometimes stopping altogether,
      then breaking out in a sudden peal accompanied by a pawing of the ground
      by an iron-shod hoof.

A thick curtain of glistening white flakes fell ceaselessly to the ground;
      it obliterated all outlines, enveloped all objects in an icy mantle of
      foam; nothing was to be heard throughout the length and breadth of the
      silent, winter-bound city save the vague, nameless rustle of falling snow—a
      sensation rather than a sound—the gentle mingling of light atoms
      which seemed to fill all space, to cover the whole world.

The man reappeared with his lantern, leading by a rope a
      melancholy-looking horse, evidently being led out against his inclination.
      The hostler placed him beside the pole, fastened the traces, and spent
      some time in walking round him to make sure that the harness was all
      right; for he could use only one hand, the other being engaged in holding
      the lantern. As he was about to fetch the second horse he noticed the
      motionless group of travellers, already white with snow, and said to them:
      “Why don''t you get inside the coach? You''d be under shelter, at
      least.”

This did not seem to have occurred to them, and they at once took his
      advice. The three men seated their wives at the far end of the coach, then
      got in themselves; lastly the other vague, snow-shrouded forms clambered
      to the remaining places without a word.

The floor was covered with straw, into which the feet sank. The ladies at
      the far end, having brought with them little copper foot-warmers heated by
      means of a kind of chemical fuel, proceeded to light these, and spent some
      time in expatiating in low tones on their advantages, saying over and over
      again things which they had all known for a long time.

At last, six horses instead of four having been harnessed to the
      diligence, on account of the heavy roads, a voice outside asked: “Is
      every one there?” To which a voice from the interior replied:
      “Yes,” and they set out.

The vehicle moved slowly, slowly, at a snail''s pace; the wheels sank into
      the snow; the entire body of the coach creaked and groaned; the horses
      slipped, puffed, steamed, and the coachman''s long whip cracked
      incessantly, flying hither and thither, coiling up, then flinging out its
      length like a slender serpent, as it lashed some rounded flank, which
      instantly grew tense as it strained in further effort.

But the day grew apace. Those light flakes which one traveller, a native
      of Rouen, had compared to a rain of cotton fell no longer. A murky light
      filtered through dark, heavy clouds, which made the country more
      dazzlingly white by contrast, a whiteness broken sometimes by a row of
      tall trees spangled with hoarfrost, or by a cottage roof hooded in snow.

Right at the back, in the best seats of all, Monsieur and Madame Loiseau,
      wholesale wine merchants of the Rue Grand-Pont, slumbered opposite each
      other. Formerly clerk to a merchant who had failed in business, Loiseau
      had bought his master''s interest, and made a fortune for himself. He sold
      very bad wine at a very low price to the retail-dealers in the country,
      and had the reputation, among his friends and acquaintances, of being a
      shrewd rascal a true Norman, full of quips and wiles. So well established
      was his character as a cheat that, in the mouths of the citizens of Rouen,
      the very name of Loiseau became a byword for sharp practice.

Above and beyond this, Loiseau was noted for his practical jokes of every
      description—his tricks, good or ill-natured; and no one could
      mention his name without adding at once: “He''s an extraordinary man—Loiseau.”
      He was undersized and potbellied, had a florid face with grayish whiskers.

His wife-tall, strong, determined, with a loud voice and decided manner
      —represented the spirit of order and arithmetic in the business
      house which Loiseau enlivened by his jovial activity.

Beside them, dignified in bearing, belonging to a superior caste, sat
      Monsieur Carre-Lamadon, a man of considerable importance, a king in the
      cotton trade, proprietor of three spinning-mills, officer of the Legion of
      Honor, and member of the General Council. During the whole time the Empire
      was in the ascendancy he remained the chief of the well-disposed
      Opposition, merely in order to command a higher value for his devotion
      when he should rally to the cause which he meanwhile opposed with “courteous
      weapons,” to use his own expression.

Madame Carre-Lamadon, much younger than her husband, was the consolation
      of all the officers of good family quartered at Rouen. Pretty, slender,
      graceful, she sat opposite her husband, curled up in her furs, and gazing
      mournfully at the sorry interior of the coach.

Her neighbors, the Comte and Comtesse Hubert de Breville, bore one of the
      noblest and most ancient names in Normandy. The count, a nobleman advanced
      in years and of aristocratic bearing, strove to enhance by every artifice
      of the toilet, his natural resemblance to King Henry IV, who, according to
      a legend of which the family were inordinately proud, had been the favored
      lover of a De Breville lady, and father of her child —the frail
      one''s husband having, in recognition of this fact, been made a count and
      governor of a province.

A colleague of Monsieur Carre-Lamadon in the General Council, Count Hubert
      represented the Orleanist party in his department. The story of his
      marriage with the daughter of a small shipowner at Nantes had always
      remained more or less of a mystery. But as the countess had an air of
      unmistakable breeding, entertained faultlessly, and was even supposed to
      have been loved by a son of Louis-Philippe, the nobility vied with one
      another in doing her honor, and her drawing-room remained the most select
      in the whole countryside—the only one which retained the old spirit
      of gallantry, and to which access was not easy.

The fortune of the Brevilles, all in real estate, amounted, it was said,
      to five hundred thousand francs a year.

These six people occupied the farther end of the coach, and represented
      Society—with an income—the strong, established society of good
      people with religion and principle.

It happened by chance that all the women were seated on the same side; and
      the countess had, moreover, as neighbors two nuns, who spent the time in
      fingering their long rosaries and murmuring paternosters and aves. One of
      them was old, and so deeply pitted with smallpox that she looked for all
      the world as if she had received a charge of shot full in the face. The
      other, of sickly appearance, had a pretty but wasted countenance, and a
      narrow, consumptive chest, sapped by that devouring faith which is the
      making of martyrs and visionaries.

The man—a well-known character—was Cornudet, the democrat, the
      terror of all respectable people. For the past twenty years his big red
      beard had been on terms of intimate acquaintance with the tankards of all
      the republican cafes. With the help of his comrades and brethren he had
      dissipated a respectable fortune left him by his father, an
      old-established confectioner, and he now impatiently awaited the Republic,
      that he might at last be rewarded with the post he had earned by his
      revolutionary orgies. On the fourth of September—possibly as the
      result of a practical joke—he was led to believe that he had been
      appointed prefect; but when he attempted to take up the duties of the
      position the clerks in charge of the office refused to recognize his
      authority, and he was compelled in consequence to retire. A good sort of
      fellow in other respects, inoffensive and obliging, he had thrown himself
      zealously into the work of making an organized defence of the town. He had
      had pits dug in the level country, young forest trees felled, and traps
      set on all the roads; then at the approach of the enemy, thoroughly
      satisfied with his preparations, he had hastily returned to the town. He
      thought he might now do more good at Havre, where new intrenchments would
      soon be necessary.

The woman, who belonged to the courtesan class, was celebrated for an
      embonpoint unusual for her age, which had earned for her the sobriquet of
      “Boule de Suif” (Tallow Ball). Short and round, fat as a pig,
      with puffy fingers constricted at the joints, looking like rows of short
      sausages; with a shiny, tightly-stretched skin and an enormous bust
      filling out the bodice of her dress, she was yet attractive and much
      sought after, owing to her fresh and pleasing appearance. Her face was
      like a crimson apple, a peony-bud just bursting into bloom; she had two
      magnificent dark eyes, fringed with thick, heavy lashes, which cast a
      shadow into their depths; her mouth was small, ripe, kissable, and was
      furnished with the tiniest of white teeth.

As soon as she was recognized the respectable matrons of the party began
      to whisper among themselves, and the words “hussy” and “public
      scandal” were uttered so loudly that Boule de Suif raised her head.
      She forthwith cast such a challenging, bold look at her neighbors that a
      sudden silence fell on the company, and all lowered their eyes, with the
      exception of Loiseau, who watched her with evident interest.

But conversation was soon resumed among the three ladies, whom the
      presence of this girl had suddenly drawn together in the bonds of
      friendship—one might almost say in those of intimacy. They decided
      that they ought to combine, as it were, in their dignity as wives in face
      of this shameless hussy; for legitimized love always despises its
      easygoing brother.

The three men, also, brought together by a certain conservative instinct
      awakened by the presence of Cornudet, spoke of money matters in a tone
      expressive of contempt for the poor. Count Hubert related the losses he
      had sustained at the hands of the Prussians, spoke of the cattle which had
      been stolen from him, the crops which had been ruined, with the easy
      manner of a nobleman who was also a tenfold millionaire, and whom such
      reverses would scarcely inconvenience for a single year. Monsieur
      Carre-Lamadon, a man of wide experience in the cotton industry, had taken
      care to send six hundred thousand francs to England as provision against
      the rainy day he was always anticipating. As for Loiseau, he had managed
      to sell to the French commissariat department all the wines he had in
      stock, so that the state now owed him a considerable sum, which he hoped
      to receive at Havre.

And all three eyed one another in friendly, well-disposed fashion.
      Although of varying social status, they were united in the brotherhood of
      money—in that vast freemasonry made up of those who possess, who can
      jingle gold wherever they choose to put their hands into their breeches''
      pockets.

The coach went along so slowly that at ten o''clock in the morning it had
      not covered twelve miles. Three times the men of the party got out and
      climbed the hills on foot. The passengers were becoming uneasy, for they
      had counted on lunching at Totes, and it seemed now as if they would
      hardly arrive there before nightfall. Every one was eagerly looking out
      for an inn by the roadside, when, suddenly, the coach foundered in a
      snowdrift, and it took two hours to extricate it.

As appetites increased, their spirits fell; no inn, no wine shop could be
      discovered, the approach of the Prussians and the transit of the starving
      French troops having frightened away all business.

The men sought food in the farmhouses beside the road, but could not find
      so much as a crust of bread; for the suspicious peasant invariably hid his
      stores for fear of being pillaged by the soldiers, who, being entirely
      without food, would take violent possession of everything they found.

About one o''clock Loiseau announced that he positively had a big hollow in
      his stomach. They had all been suffering in the same way for some time,
      and the increasing gnawings of hunger had put an end to all conversation.

Now and then some one yawned, another followed his example, and each in
      turn, according to his character, breeding and social position, yawned
      either quietly or noisily, placing his hand before the gaping void whence
      issued breath condensed into vapor.

Several times Boule de Suif stooped, as if searching for something under
      her petticoats. She would hesitate a moment, look at her neighbors, and
      then quietly sit upright again. All faces were pale and drawn. Loiseau
      declared he would give a thousand francs for a knuckle of ham. His wife
      made an involuntary and quickly checked gesture of protest. It always hurt
      her to hear of money being squandered, and she could not even understand
      jokes on such a subject.

“As a matter of fact, I don''t feel well,” said the count.
      “Why did I not think of bringing provisions?” Each one
      reproached himself in similar fashion.

Cornudet, however, had a bottle of rum, which he offered to his neighbors.
      They all coldly refused except Loiseau, who took a sip, and returned the
      bottle with thanks, saying: “That''s good stuff; it warms one up, and
      cheats the appetite.” The alcohol put him in good humor, and he
      proposed they should do as the sailors did in the song: eat the fattest of
      the passengers. This indirect allusion to Boule de Suif shocked the
      respectable members of the party. No one replied; only Cornudet smiled.
      The two good sisters had ceased to mumble their rosary, and, with hands
      enfolded in their wide sleeves, sat motionless, their eyes steadfastly
      cast down, doubtless offering up as a sacrifice to Heaven the suffering it
      had sent them.

At last, at three o''clock, as they were in the midst of an apparently
      limitless plain, with not a single village in sight, Boule de Suif stooped
      quickly, and drew from underneath the seat a large basket covered with a
      white napkin.

From this she extracted first of all a small earthenware plate and a
      silver drinking cup, then an enormous dish containing two whole chickens
      cut into joints and imbedded in jelly. The basket was seen to contain
      other good things: pies, fruit, dainties of all sorts-provisions, in fine,
      for a three days'' journey, rendering their owner independent of wayside
      inns. The necks of four bottles protruded from among the food. She took a
      chicken wing, and began to eat it daintily, together with one of those
      rolls called in Normandy “Regence.”

All looks were directed toward her. An odor of food filled the air,
      causing nostrils to dilate, mouths to water, and jaws to contract
      painfully. The scorn of the ladies for this disreputable female grew
      positively ferocious; they would have liked to kill her, or throw, her and
      her drinking cup, her basket, and her provisions, out of the coach into
      the snow of the road below.

“Well, well, this lady had more forethought than the rest of us.
      Some people think of everything.”

“Upon my soul, I can''t refuse; I cannot hold out another minute. All
      is fair in war time, is it not, madame?” And, casting a glance on
      those around, he added:

He spread a newspaper over his knees to avoid soiling his trousers, and,
      with a pocketknife he always carried, helped himself to a chicken leg
      coated with jelly, which he thereupon proceeded to devour.

Then Boule le Suif, in low, humble tones, invited the nuns to partake of
      her repast. They both accepted the offer unhesitatingly, and after a few
      stammered words of thanks began to eat quickly, without raising their
      eyes. Neither did Cornudet refuse his neighbor''s offer, and, in
      combination with the nuns, a sort of table was formed by opening out the
      newspaper over the four pairs of knees.

Mouths kept opening and shutting, ferociously masticating and devouring
      the food. Loiseau, in his corner, was hard at work, and in low tones urged
      his wife to follow his example. She held out for a long time, but
      overstrained Nature gave way at last. Her husband, assuming his politest
      manner, asked their “charming companion” if he might be
      allowed to offer Madame Loiseau a small helping.

When the first bottle of claret was opened some embarrassment was caused
      by the fact that there was only one drinking cup, but this was passed from
      one to another, after being wiped. Cornudet alone, doubtless in a spirit
      of gallantry, raised to his own lips that part of the rim which was still
      moist from those of his fair neighbor.

Then, surrounded by people who were eating, and well-nigh suffocated by
      the odor of food, the Comte and Comtesse de Breville and Monsieur and
      Madame Carre-Lamadon endured that hateful form of torture which has
      perpetuated the name of Tantalus. All at once the manufacturer''s young
      wife heaved a sigh which made every one turn and look at her; she was
      white as the snow without; her eyes closed, her head fell forward; she had
      fainted. Her husband, beside himself, implored the help of his neighbors.
      No one seemed to know what to do until the elder of the two nuns, raising
      the patient''s head, placed Boule de Suif''s drinking cup to her lips, and
      made her swallow a few drops of wine. The pretty invalid moved, opened her
      eyes, smiled, and declared in a feeble voice that she was all right again.
      But, to prevent a recurrence of the catastrophe, the nun made her drink a
      cupful of claret, adding: “It''s just hunger —that''s what is
      wrong with you.”

Then Boule de Suif, blushing and embarrassed, stammered, looking at the
      four passengers who were still fasting:

“Hang it all, in such a case as this we are all brothers and sisters
      and ought to assist each other. Come, come, ladies, don''t stand on
      ceremony, for goodness'' sake! Do we even know whether we shall find a
      house in which to pass the night? At our present rate of going we sha''n''t
      be at Totes till midday to-morrow.”

They hesitated, no one daring to be the first to accept. But the count
      settled the question. He turned toward the abashed girl, and in his most
      distinguished manner said:

As usual, it was only the first step that cost. This Rubicon once crossed,
      they set to work with a will. The basket was emptied. It still contained a
      pate de foie gras, a lark pie, a piece of smoked tongue, Crassane pears,
      Pont-Leveque gingerbread, fancy cakes, and a cup full of pickled gherkins
      and onions—Boule de Suif, like all women, being very fond of
      indigestible things.

They could not eat this girl''s provisions without speaking to her. So they
      began to talk, stiffly at first; then, as she seemed by no means forward,
      with greater freedom. Mesdames de Breville and Carre-Lamadon, who were
      accomplished women of the world, were gracious and tactful. The countess
      especially displayed that amiable condescension characteristic of great
      ladies whom no contact with baser mortals can sully, and was absolutely
      charming. But the sturdy Madame Loiseau, who had the soul of a gendarme,
      continued morose, speaking little and eating much.

Conversation naturally turned on the war. Terrible stories were told about
      the Prussians, deeds of bravery were recounted of the French; and all
      these people who were fleeing themselves were ready to pay homage to the
      courage of their compatriots. Personal experiences soon followed, and
      Boule le Suif related with genuine emotion, and with that warmth of
      language not uncommon in women of her class and temperament, how it came
      about that she had left Rouen.

“I thought at first that I should be able to stay,” she said.
      “My house was well stocked with provisions, and it seemed better to
      put up with feeding a few soldiers than to banish myself goodness knows
      where. But when I saw these Prussians it was too much for me! My blood
      boiled with rage; I wept the whole day for very shame. Oh, if only I had
      been a man! I looked at them from my window—the fat swine, with
      their pointed helmets!—and my maid held my hands to keep me from
      throwing my furniture down on them. Then some of them were quartered on
      me; I flew at the throat of the first one who entered. They are just as
      easy to strangle as other men! And I''d have been the death of that one if
      I hadn''t been dragged away from him by my hair. I had to hide after that.
      And as soon as I could get an opportunity I left the place, and here I am.”

She was warmly congratulated. She rose in the estimation of her
      companions, who had not been so brave; and Cornudet listened to her with
      the approving and benevolent smile of an apostle, the smile a priest might
      wear in listening to a devotee praising God; for long-bearded democrats of
      his type have a monopoly of patriotism, just as priests have a monopoly of
      religion. He held forth in turn, with dogmatic self-assurance, in the
      style of the proclamations daily pasted on the walls of the town, winding
      up with a specimen of stump oratory in which he reviled “that
      besotted fool of a Louis-Napoleon.”

But Boule de Suif was indignant, for she was an ardent Bonapartist. She
      turned as red as a cherry, and stammered in her wrath: “I''d just
      like to have seen you in his place—you and your sort! There would
      have been a nice mix-up. Oh, yes! It was you who betrayed that man. It
      would be impossible to live in France if we were governed by such rascals
      as you!”

Cornudet, unmoved by this tirade, still smiled a superior, contemptuous
      smile; and one felt that high words were impending, when the count
      interposed, and, not without difficulty, succeeded in calming the
      exasperated woman, saying that all sincere opinions ought to be respected.
      But the countess and the manufacturer''s wife, imbued with the unreasoning
      hatred of the upper classes for the Republic, and instinct, moreover, with
      the affection felt by all women for the pomp and circumstance of despotic
      government, were drawn, in spite of themselves, toward this dignified
      young woman, whose opinions coincided so closely with their own.

The basket was empty. The ten people had finished its contents without
      difficulty amid general regret that it did not hold more. Conversation
      went on a little longer, though it flagged somewhat after the passengers
      had finished eating.

Night fell, the darkness grew deeper and deeper, and the cold made Boule
      de Suif shiver, in spite of her plumpness. So Madame de Breville offered
      her her foot-warmer, the fuel of which had been several times renewed
      since the morning, and she accepted the offer at once, for her feet were
      icy cold. Mesdames Carre-Lamadon and Loiseau gave theirs to the nuns.

The driver lighted his lanterns. They cast a bright gleam on a cloud of
      vapor which hovered over the sweating flanks of the horses, and on the
      roadside snow, which seemed to unroll as they went along in the changing
      light of the lamps.

All was now indistinguishable in the coach; but suddenly a movement
      occurred in the corner occupied by Boule de Suif and Cornudet; and
      Loiseau, peering into the gloom, fancied he saw the big, bearded democrat
      move hastily to one side, as if he had received a well-directed, though
      noiseless, blow in the dark.

Tiny lights glimmered ahead. It was Totes. The coach had been on the road
      eleven hours, which, with the three hours allotted the horses in four
      periods for feeding and breathing, made fourteen. It entered the town, and
      stopped before the Hotel du Commerce.

The coach door opened; a well-known noise made all the travellers start;
      it was the clanging of a scabbard, on the pavement; then a voice called
      out something in German.

Although the coach had come to a standstill, no one got out; it looked as
      if they were afraid of being murdered the moment they left their seats.
      Thereupon the driver appeared, holding in his hand one of his lanterns,
      which cast a sudden glow on the interior of the coach, lighting up the
      double row of startled faces, mouths agape, and eyes wide open in surprise
      and terror.

Beside the driver stood in the full light a German officer, a tall young
      man, fair and slender, tightly encased in his uniform like a woman in her
      corset, his flat shiny cap, tilted to one side of his head, making him
      look like an English hotel runner. His exaggerated mustache, long and
      straight and tapering to a point at either end in a single blond hair that
      could hardly be seen, seemed to weigh down the corners of his mouth and
      give a droop to his lips.

The two nuns were the first to obey, manifesting the docility of holy
      women accustomed to submission on every occasion. Next appeared the count
      and countess, followed by the manufacturer and his wife, after whom came
      Loiseau, pushing his larger and better half before him.

“Good-day, sir,” he said to the officer as he put his foot to
      the ground, acting on an impulse born of prudence rather than of
      politeness. The other, insolent like all in authority, merely stared
      without replying.

Boule de Suif and Cornudet, though near the door, were the last to alight,
      grave and dignified before the enemy. The stout girl tried to control
      herself and appear calm; the democrat stroked his long russet beard with a
      somewhat trembling hand. Both strove to maintain their dignity, knowing
      well that at such a time each individual is always looked upon as more or
      less typical of his nation; and, also, resenting the complaisant attitude
      of their companions, Boule de Suif tried to wear a bolder front than her
      neighbors, the virtuous women, while he, feeling that it was incumbent on
      him to set a good example, kept up the attitude of resistance which he had
      first assumed when he undertook to mine the high roads round Rouen.

They entered the spacious kitchen of the inn, and the German, having
      demanded the passports signed by the general in command, in which were
      mentioned the name, description and profession of each traveller,
      inspected them all minutely, comparing their appearance with the written
      particulars.

They breathed freely, All were still hungry; so supper was ordered. Half
      an hour was required for its preparation, and while two servants were
      apparently engaged in getting it ready the travellers went to look at
      their rooms. These all opened off a long corridor, at the end of which was
      a glazed door with a number on it.

They were just about to take their seats at table when the innkeeper
      appeared in person. He was a former horse dealer—a large, asthmatic
      individual, always wheezing, coughing, and clearing his throat. Follenvie
      was his patronymic.

They moved restlessly around her; every one wondered and speculated as to
      the cause of this order. The count approached:

“You are wrong, madame, for your refusal may bring trouble not only
      on yourself but also on all your companions. It never pays to resist those
      in authority. Your compliance with this request cannot possibly be fraught
      with any danger; it has probably been made because some formality or other
      was forgotten.”

All added their voices to that of the count; Boule de Suif was begged,
      urged, lectured, and at last convinced; every one was afraid of the
      complications which might result from headstrong action on her part. She
      said finally:

She left the room. All waited for her return before commencing the meal.
      Each was distressed that he or she had not been sent for rather than this
      impulsive, quick-tempered girl, and each mentally rehearsed platitudes in
      case of being summoned also.

All were anxious to know what had happened; but she declined to enlighten
      them, and when the count pressed the point, she silenced him with much
      dignity, saying:

Then they took their places round a high soup tureen, from which issued an
      odor of cabbage. In spite of this coincidence, the supper was cheerful.
      The cider was good; the Loiseaus and the nuns drank it from motives of
      economy. The others ordered wine; Cornudet demanded beer. He had his own
      fashion of uncorking the bottle and making the beer foam, gazing at it as
      he inclined his glass and then raised it to a position between the lamp
      and his eye that he might judge of its color. When he drank, his great
      beard, which matched the color of his favorite beverage, seemed to tremble
      with affection; his eyes positively squinted in the endeavor not to lose
      sight of the beloved glass, and he looked for all the world as if he were
      fulfilling the only function for which he was born. He seemed to have
      established in his mind an affinity between the two great passions of his
      life—pale ale and revolution—and assuredly he could not taste
      the one without dreaming of the other.

Monsieur and Madame Follenvie dined at the end of the table. The man,
      wheezing like a broken-down locomotive, was too short-winded to talk when
      he was eating. But the wife was not silent a moment; she told how the
      Prussians had impressed her on their arrival, what they did, what they
      said; execrating them in the first place because they cost her money, and
      in the second because she had two sons in the army. She addressed herself
      principally to the countess, flattered at the opportunity of talking to a
      lady of quality.

Then she lowered her voice, and began to broach delicate subjects. Her
      husband interrupted her from time to time, saying:

“Yes, madame, these Germans do nothing but eat potatoes and pork,
      and then pork and potatoes. And don''t imagine for a moment that they are
      clean! No, indeed! And if only you saw them drilling for hours, indeed for
      days, together; they all collect in a field, then they do nothing but
      march backward and forward, and wheel this way and that. If only they
      would cultivate the land, or remain at home and work on their high roads!
      Really, madame, these soldiers are of no earthly use! Poor people have to
      feed and keep them, only in order that they may learn how to kill! True, I
      am only an old woman with no education, but when I see them wearing
      themselves out marching about from morning till night, I say to myself:
      When there are people who make discoveries that are of use to people, why
      should others take so much trouble to do harm? Really, now, isn''t it a
      terrible thing to kill people, whether they are Prussians, or English, or
      Poles, or French? If we revenge ourselves on any one who injures us we do
      wrong, and are punished for it; but when our sons are shot down like
      partridges, that is all right, and decorations are given to the man who
      kills the most. No, indeed, I shall never be able to understand it.”

“War is a barbarous proceeding when we attack a peaceful neighbor,
      but it is a sacred duty when undertaken in defence of one''s country.”

“Yes; it''s another matter when one acts in self-defence; but would
      it not be better to kill all the kings, seeing that they make war just to
      amuse themselves?”

Monsieur Carre-Lamadon was reflecting profoundly. Although an ardent
      admirer of great generals, the peasant woman''s sturdy common sense made
      him reflect on the wealth which might accrue to a country by the
      employment of so many idle hands now maintained at a great expense, of so
      much unproductive force, if they were employed in those great industrial
      enterprises which it will take centuries to complete.

But Loiseau, leaving his seat, went over to the innkeeper and began
      chatting in a low voice. The big man chuckled, coughed, sputtered; his
      enormous carcass shook with merriment at the pleasantries of the other;
      and he ended by buying six casks of claret from Loiseau to be delivered in
      spring, after the departure of the Prussians.

But Loiseau, who had been making his observations on the sly, sent his
      wife to bed, and amused himself by placing first his ear, and then his
      eye, to the bedroom keyhole, in order to discover what he called “the
      mysteries of the corridor.”

At the end of about an hour he heard a rustling, peeped out quickly, and
      caught sight of Boule de Suif, looking more rotund than ever in a
      dressing-gown of blue cashmere trimmed with white lace. She held a candle
      in her hand, and directed her steps to the numbered door at the end of the
      corridor. But one of the side doors was partly opened, and when, at the
      end of a few minutes, she returned, Cornudet, in his shirt-sleeves,
      followed her. They spoke in low tones, then stopped short. Boule de Suif
      seemed to be stoutly denying him admission to her room. Unfortunately,
      Loiseau could not at first hear what they said; but toward the end of the
      conversation they raised their voices, and he caught a few words. Cornudet
      was loudly insistent.

“No, my good man, there are times when one does not do that sort of
      thing; besides, in this place it would be shameful.”

Apparently he did not understand, and asked the reason. Then she lost her
      temper and her caution, and, raising her voice still higher, said:

“Why? Can''t you understand why? When there are Prussians in the
      house! Perhaps even in the very next room!”

He was silent. The patriotic shame of this wanton, who would not suffer
      herself to be caressed in the neighborhood of the enemy, must have roused
      his dormant dignity, for after bestowing on her a simple kiss he crept
      softly back to his room. Loiseau, much edified, capered round the bedroom
      before taking his place beside his slumbering spouse.

Then silence reigned throughout the house. But soon there arose from some
      remote part—it might easily have been either cellar or attic—a
      stertorous, monotonous, regular snoring, a dull, prolonged rumbling,
      varied by tremors like those of a boiler under pressure of steam. Monsieur
      Follenvie had gone to sleep.

As they had decided on starting at eight o''clock the next morning, every
      one was in the kitchen at that hour; but the coach, its roof covered with
      snow, stood by itself in the middle of the yard, without either horses or
      driver. They sought the latter in the stables, coach-houses and barns
      —but in vain. So the men of the party resolved to scour the country
      for him, and sallied forth. They found themselves in the square, with the
      church at the farther side, and to right and left low-roofed houses where
      there were some Prussian soldiers. The first soldier they saw was peeling
      potatoes. The second, farther on, was washing out a barber''s shop. Another, bearded to the eyes, was fondling a crying infant, and dandling it
      on his knees to quiet it; and the stout peasant women, whose men-folk were
      for the most part at the war, were, by means of signs, telling their
      obedient conquerors what work they were to do: chop wood, prepare soup,
      grind coffee; one of them even was doing the washing for his hostess, an
      infirm old grandmother.

The count, astonished at what he saw, questioned the beadle who was coming
      out of the presbytery. The old man answered:

“Oh, those men are not at all a bad sort; they are not Prussians, I
      am told; they come from somewhere farther off, I don''t exactly know where.
      And they have all left wives and children behind them; they are not fond
      of war either, you may be sure! I am sure they are mourning for the men
      where they come from, just as we do here; and the war causes them just as
      much unhappiness as it does us. As a matter of fact, things are not so
      very bad here just now, because the soldiers do no harm, and work just as
      if they were in their own homes. You see, sir, poor folk always help one
      another; it is the great ones of this world who make war.”

Cornudet indignant at the friendly understanding established between
      conquerors and conquered, withdrew, preferring to shut himself up in the
      inn.

But they could not find the coach driver. At last he was discovered in the
      village cafe, fraternizing cordially with the officer''s orderly.

“I don''t know. Go and ask him. I am forbidden to harness the horses,
      so I don''t harness them—that''s all.”

They asked for Monsieur Follenvie, but the servant replied that on account
      of his asthma he never got up before ten o''clock. They were strictly
      forbidden to rouse him earlier, except in case of fire.

They wished to see the officer, but that also was impossible, although he
      lodged in the inn. Monsieur Follenvie alone was authorized to interview
      him on civil matters. So they waited. The women returned to their rooms,
      and occupied themselves with trivial matters.

Cornudet settled down beside the tall kitchen fireplace, before a blazing
      fire. He had a small table and a jug of beer placed beside him, and he
      smoked his pipe—a pipe which enjoyed among democrats a consideration
      almost equal to his own, as though it had served its country in serving
      Cornudet. It was a fine meerschaum, admirably colored to a black the shade
      of its owner''s teeth, but sweet-smelling, gracefully curved, at home in
      its master''s hand, and completing his physiognomy. And Cornudet sat
      motionless, his eyes fixed now on the dancing flames, now on the froth
      which crowned his beer; and after each draught he passed his long, thin
      fingers with an air of satisfaction through his long, greasy hair, as he
      sucked the foam from his mustache.

Loiseau, under pretence of stretching his legs, went out to see if he
      could sell wine to the country dealers. The count and the manufacturer
      began to talk politics. They forecast the future of France. One believed
      in the Orleans dynasty, the other in an unknown savior—a hero who
      should rise up in the last extremity: a Du Guesclin, perhaps a Joan of
      Arc? or another Napoleon the First? Ah! if only the Prince Imperial were
      not so young! Cornudet, listening to them, smiled like a man who holds the
      keys of destiny in his hands. His pipe perfumed the whole kitchen.

As the clock struck ten, Monsieur Follenvie appeared. He was immediately
      surrounded and questioned, but could only repeat, three or four times in
      succession, and without variation, the words:

“The officer said to me, just like this: ''Monsieur Follenvie, you
      will forbid them to harness up the coach for those travellers to-morrow.
      They are not to start without an order from me. You hear? That is
      sufficient.''”

Then they asked to see the officer. The count sent him his card, on which
      Monsieur Carre-Lamadon also inscribed his name and titles. The Prussian
      sent word that the two men would be admitted to see him after his luncheon—that
      is to say, about one o''clock.

The ladies reappeared, and they all ate a little, in spite of their
      anxiety. Boule de Suif appeared ill and very much worried.

Loiseau joined the other two; but when they tried to get Cornudet to
      accompany them, by way of adding greater solemnity to the occasion, he
      declared proudly that he would never have anything to do with the Germans,
      and, resuming his seat in the chimney corner, he called for another jug of
      beer.

The three men went upstairs, and were ushered into the best room in the
      inn, where the officer received them lolling at his ease in an armchair,
      his feet on the mantelpiece, smoking a long porcelain pipe, and enveloped
      in a gorgeous dressing-gown, doubtless stolen from the deserted dwelling
      of some citizen destitute of taste in dress. He neither rose, greeted
      them, nor even glanced in their direction. He afforded a fine example of
      that insolence of bearing which seems natural to the victorious soldier.

“I would respectfully call your attention, monsieur, to the fact
      that your general in command gave us a permit to proceed to Dieppe; and I
      do not think we have done anything to deserve this harshness at your
      hands.”

The afternoon was wretched. They could not understand the caprice of this
      German, and the strangest ideas came into their heads. They all
      congregated in the kitchen, and talked the subject to death, imagining all
      kinds of unlikely things. Perhaps they were to be kept as hostages —but
      for what reason? or to be extradited as prisoners of war? or possibly they
      were to be held for ransom? They were panic-stricken at this last
      supposition. The richest among them were the most alarmed, seeing
      themselves forced to empty bags of gold into the insolent soldier''s hands
      in order to buy back their lives. They racked their brains for plausible
      lies whereby they might conceal the fact that they were rich, and pass
      themselves off as poor—very poor. Loiseau took off his watch chain,
      and put it in his pocket. The approach of night increased their
      apprehension. The lamp was lighted, and as it wanted yet two hours to
      dinner Madame Loiseau proposed a game of trente et un. It would distract
      their thoughts. The rest agreed, and Cornudet himself joined the party,
      first putting out his pipe for politeness'' sake.

The count shuffled the cards—dealt—and Boule de Suif had
      thirty-one to start with; soon the interest of the game assuaged the
      anxiety of the players. But Cornudet noticed that Loiseau and his wife
      were in league to cheat.

They were about to sit down to dinner when Monsieur Follenvie appeared,
      and in his grating voice announced:

“The Prussian officer sends to ask Mademoiselle Elisabeth Rousset if
      she has changed her mind yet.”

Boule de Suif stood still, pale as death. Then, suddenly turning crimson
      with anger, she gasped out:

“Kindly tell that scoundrel, that cur, that carrion of a Prussian,
      that I will never consent—you understand?—never, never, never!”

The fat innkeeper left the room. Then Boule de Suif was surrounded,
      questioned, entreated on all sides to reveal the mystery of her visit to
      the officer. She refused at first; but her wrath soon got the better of
      her.

No one was shocked at the word, so great was the general indignation.
      Cornudet broke his jug as he banged it down on the table. A loud outcry
      arose against this base soldier. All were furious. They drew together in
      common resistance against the foe, as if some part of the sacrifice
      exacted of Boule de Suif had been demanded of each. The count declared,
      with supreme disgust, that those people behaved like ancient barbarians.
      The women, above all, manifested a lively and tender sympathy for Boule de
      Suif. The nuns, who appeared only at meals, cast down their eyes, and said
      nothing.

They dined, however, as soon as the first indignant outburst had subsided;
      but they spoke little and thought much.

The ladies went to bed early; and the men, having lighted their pipes,
      proposed a game of ecarte, in which Monsieur Follenvie was invited to
      join, the travellers hoping to question him skillfully as to the best
      means of vanquishing the officer''s obduracy. But he thought of nothing but
      his cards, would listen to nothing, reply to nothing, and repeated, time
      after time: “Attend to the game, gentlemen! attend to the game!”
      So absorbed was his attention that he even forgot to expectorate. The
      consequence was that his chest gave forth rumbling sounds like those of an
      organ. His wheezing lungs struck every note of the asthmatic scale, from
      deep, hollow tones to a shrill, hoarse piping resembling that of a young
      cock trying to crow.

He refused to go to bed when his wife, overcome with sleep, came to fetch
      him. So she went off alone, for she was an early bird, always up with the
      sun; while he was addicted to late hours, ever ready to spend the night
      with friends. He merely said: “Put my egg-nogg by the fire,”
      and went on with the game. When the other men saw that nothing was to be
      got out of him they declared it was time to retire, and each sought his
      bed.

They rose fairly early the next morning, with a vague hope of being
      allowed to start, a greater desire than ever to do so, and a terror at
      having to spend another day in this wretched little inn.

Alas! the horses remained in the stable, the driver was invisible. They
      spent their time, for want of something better to do, in wandering round
      the coach.

Luncheon was a gloomy affair; and there was a general coolness toward
      Boule de Suif, for night, which brings counsel, had somewhat modified the
      judgment of her companions. In the cold light of the morning they almost
      bore a grudge against the girl for not having secretly sought out the
      Prussian, that the rest of the party might receive a joyful surprise when
      they awoke. What more simple?

Besides, who would have been the wiser? She might have saved appearances
      by telling the officer that she had taken pity on their distress. Such a
      step would be of so little consequence to her.

In the afternoon, seeing that they were all bored to death, the count
      proposed a walk in the neighborhood of the village. Each one wrapped
      himself up well, and the little party set out, leaving behind only
      Cornudet, who preferred to sit over the fire, and the two nuns, who were
      in the habit of spending their day in the church or at the presbytery.

The cold, which grew more intense each day, almost froze the noses and
      ears of the pedestrians, their feet began to pain them so that each step
      was a penance, and when they reached the open country it looked so
      mournful and depressing in its limitless mantle of white that they all
      hastily retraced their steps, with bodies benumbed and hearts heavy.

Loiseau, who saw perfectly well how matters stood, asked suddenly “if
      that trollop were going to keep them waiting much longer in this
      Godforsaken spot.” The count, always courteous, replied that they
      could not exact so painful a sacrifice from any woman, and that the first
      move must come from herself. Monsieur Carre-Lamadon remarked that if the
      French, as they talked of doing, made a counter attack by way of Dieppe,
      their encounter with the enemy must inevitably take place at Totes. This
      reflection made the other two anxious.

“How can you think of such a thing, in this snow? And with our
      wives? Besides, we should be pursued at once, overtaken in ten minutes,
      and brought back as prisoners at the mercy of the soldiery.”

Suddenly, at the end of the street, the officer appeared. His tall,
      wasp-like, uniformed figure was outlined against the snow which bounded
      the horizon, and he walked, knees apart, with that motion peculiar to
      soldiers, who are always anxious not to soil their carefully polished
      boots.

He bowed as he passed the ladies, then glanced scornfully at the men, who
      had sufficient dignity not to raise their hats, though Loiseau made a
      movement to do so.

Boule de Suif flushed crimson to the ears, and the three married women
      felt unutterably humiliated at being met thus by the soldier in company
      with the girl whom he had treated with such scant ceremony.

Then they began to talk about him, his figure, and his face. Madame
      Carre-Lamadon, who had known many officers and judged them as a
      connoisseur, thought him not at all bad-looking; she even regretted that
      he was not a Frenchman, because in that case he would have made a very
      handsome hussar, with whom all the women would assuredly have fallen in
      love.

When they were once more within doors they did not know what to do with
      themselves. Sharp words even were exchanged apropos of the merest trifles.
      The silent dinner was quickly over, and each one went to bed early in the
      hope of sleeping, and thus killing time.

They came down next morning with tired faces and irritable tempers; the
      women scarcely spoke to Boule de Suif.

A church bell summoned the faithful to a baptism. Boule de Suif had a
      child being brought up by peasants at Yvetot. She did not see him once a
      year, and never thought of him; but the idea of the child who was about to
      be baptized induced a sudden wave of tenderness for her own, and she
      insisted on being present at the ceremony.

As soon as she had gone out, the rest of the company looked at one another
      and then drew their chairs together; for they realized that they must
      decide on some course of action. Loiseau had an inspiration: he proposed
      that they should ask the officer to detain Boule de Suif only, and to let
      the rest depart on their way.

Monsieur Follenvie was intrusted with this commission, but he returned to
      them almost immediately. The German, who knew human nature, had shown him
      the door. He intended to keep all the travellers until his condition had
      been complied with.

“We''re not going to die of old age here!” she cried. “Since
      it''s that vixen''s trade to behave so with men I don''t see that she has any
      right to refuse one more than another. I may as well tell you she took any
      lovers she could get at Rouen—even coachmen! Yes, indeed, madame—the
      coachman at the prefecture! I know it for a fact, for he buys his wine of
      us. And now that it is a question of getting us out of a difficulty she
      puts on virtuous airs, the drab! For my part, I think this officer has
      behaved very well. Why, there were three others of us, any one of whom he
      would undoubtedly have preferred. But no, he contents himself with the
      girl who is common property. He respects married women. Just think. He is
      master here. He had only to say: ''I wish it!'' and he might have taken us
      by force, with the help of his soldiers.”

The two other women shuddered; the eyes of pretty Madame Carre-Lamadon
      glistened, and she grew pale, as if the officer were indeed in the act of
      laying violent hands on her.

The men, who had been discussing the subject among themselves, drew near.
      Loiseau, in a state of furious resentment, was for delivering up “that
      miserable woman,” bound hand and foot, into the enemy''s power. But
      the count, descended from three generations of ambassadors, and endowed,
      moreover, with the lineaments of a diplomat, was in favor of more tactful
      measures.

The women drew together; they lowered their voices, and the discussion
      became general, each giving his or her opinion. But the conversation was
      not in the least coarse. The ladies, in particular, were adepts at
      delicate phrases and charming subtleties of expression to describe the
      most improper things. A stranger would have understood none of their
      allusions, so guarded was the language they employed. But, seeing that the
      thin veneer of modesty with which every woman of the world is furnished
      goes but a very little way below the surface, they began rather to enjoy
      this unedifying episode, and at bottom were hugely delighted —feeling
      themselves in their element, furthering the schemes of lawless love with
      the gusto of a gourmand cook who prepares supper for another.

Their gaiety returned of itself, so amusing at last did the whole business
      seem to them. The count uttered several rather risky witticisms, but so
      tactfully were they said that his audience could not help smiling. Loiseau
      in turn made some considerably broader jokes, but no one took offence; and
      the thought expressed with such brutal directness by his wife was
      uppermost in the minds of all: “Since it''s the girl''s trade, why
      should she refuse this man more than another?” Dainty Madame
      Carre-Lamadon seemed to think even that in Boule de Suif''s place she would
      be less inclined to refuse him than another.

The blockade was as carefully arranged as if they were investing a
      fortress. Each agreed on the role which he or she was to play, the
      arguments to be used, the maneuvers to be executed. They decided on the
      plan of campaign, the stratagems they were to employ, and the surprise
      attacks which were to reduce this human citadel and force it to receive
      the enemy within its walls.

So absorbed was the attention of all that Boule de Suif''s entrance was
      almost unnoticed. But the count whispered a gentle “Hush!”
      which made the others look up. She was there. They suddenly stopped
      talking, and a vague embarrassment prevented them for a few moments from
      addressing her. But the countess, more practiced than the others in the
      wiles of the drawing-room, asked her:

The girl, still under the stress of emotion, told what she had seen and
      heard, described the faces, the attitudes of those present, and even the
      appearance of the church. She concluded with the words:

Until lunch time the ladies contented themselves with being pleasant to
      her, so as to increase her confidence and make her amenable to their
      advice.

As soon as they took their seats at table the attack began. First they
      opened a vague conversation on the subject of self-sacrifice. Ancient
      examples were quoted: Judith and Holofernes; then, irrationally enough,
      Lucrece and Sextus; Cleopatra and the hostile generals whom she reduced to
      abject slavery by a surrender of her charms. Next was recounted an
      extraordinary story, born of the imagination of these ignorant
      millionaires, which told how the matrons of Rome seduced Hannibal, his
      lieutenants, and all his mercenaries at Capua. They held up to admiration
      all those women who from time to time have arrested the victorious
      progress of conquerors, made of their bodies a field of battle, a means of
      ruling, a weapon; who have vanquished by their heroic caresses hideous or
      detested beings, and sacrificed their chastity to vengeance and devotion.

All was said with due restraint and regard for propriety, the effect
      heightened now and then by an outburst of forced enthusiasm calculated to
      excite emulation.

A listener would have thought at last that the one role of woman on earth
      was a perpetual sacrifice of her person, a continual abandonment of
      herself to the caprices of a hostile soldiery.

The two nuns seemed to hear nothing, and to be lost in thought. Boule de
      Suif also was silent.

During the whole afternoon she was left to her reflections. But instead of
      calling her “madame” as they had done hitherto, her companions
      addressed her simply as “mademoiselle,” without exactly
      knowing why, but as if desirous of making her descend a step in the esteem
      she had won, and forcing her to realize her degraded position.

Just as soup was served, Monsieur Follenvie reappeared, repeating his
      phrase of the evening before:

But at dinner the coalition weakened. Loiseau made three unfortunate
      remarks. Each was cudgeling his brains for further examples of
      self-sacrifice, and could find none, when the countess, possibly without
      ulterior motive, and moved simply by a vague desire to do homage to
      religion, began to question the elder of the two nuns on the most striking
      facts in the lives of the saints. Now, it fell out that many of these had
      committed acts which would be crimes in our eyes, but the Church readily
      pardons such deeds when they are accomplished for the glory of God or the
      good of mankind. This was a powerful argument, and the countess made the
      most of it. Then, whether by reason of a tacit understanding, a thinly
      veiled act of complaisance such as those who wear the ecclesiastical habit
      excel in, or whether merely as the result of sheer stupidity—a
      stupidity admirably adapted to further their designs—the old nun
      rendered formidable aid to the conspirator. They had thought her timid;
      she proved herself bold, talkative, bigoted. She was not troubled by the
      ins and outs of casuistry; her doctrines were as iron bars; her faith knew
      no doubt; her conscience no scruples. She looked on Abraham''s sacrifice as
      natural enough, for she herself would not have hesitated to kill both
      father and mother if she had received a divine order to that effect; and
      nothing, in her opinion, could displease our Lord, provided the motive
      were praiseworthy. The countess, putting to good use the consecrated
      authority of her unexpected ally, led her on to make a lengthy and
      edifying paraphrase of that axiom enunciated by a certain school of
      moralists: “The end justifies the means.”

“Then, sister,” she asked, “you think God accepts all
      methods, and pardons the act when the motive is pure?”

“Undoubtedly, madame. An action reprehensible in itself often
      derives merit from the thought which inspires it.”

And in this wise they talked on, fathoming the wishes of God, predicting
      His judgments, describing Him as interested in matters which assuredly
      concern Him but little.

All was said with the utmost care and discretion, but every word uttered
      by the holy woman in her nun''s garb weakened the indignant resistance of
      the courtesan. Then the conversation drifted somewhat, and the nun began
      to talk of the convents of her order, of her Superior, of herself, and of
      her fragile little neighbor, Sister St. Nicephore. They had been sent for
      from Havre to nurse the hundreds of soldiers who were in hospitals,
      stricken with smallpox. She described these wretched invalids and their
      malady. And, while they themselves were detained on their way by the
      caprices of the Prussian officer, scores of Frenchmen might be dying, whom
      they would otherwise have saved! For the nursing of soldiers was the old
      nun''s specialty; she had been in the Crimea, in Italy, in Austria; and as
      she told the story of her campaigns she revealed herself as one of those
      holy sisters of the fife and drum who seem designed by nature to follow
      camps, to snatch the wounded from amid the strife of battle, and to quell
      with a word, more effectually than any general, the rough and
      insubordinate troopers—a masterful woman, her seamed and pitted face
      itself an image of the devastations of war.

As soon as the meal was over the travellers retired to their rooms, whence
      they emerged the following day at a late hour of the morning.

Luncheon passed off quietly. The seed sown the preceding evening was being
      given time to germinate and bring forth fruit.

In the afternoon the countess proposed a walk; then the count, as had been
      arranged beforehand, took Boule de Suif''s arm, and walked with her at some
      distance behind the rest.

He began talking to her in that familiar, paternal, slightly contemptuous
      tone which men of his class adopt in speaking to women like her, calling
      her “my dear child,” and talking down to her from the height
      of his exalted social position and stainless reputation. He came straight
      to the point.

“So you prefer to leave us here, exposed like yourself to all the
      violence which would follow on a repulse of the Prussian troops, rather
      than consent to surrender yourself, as you have done so many times in your
      life?”

He tried kindness, argument, sentiment. He still bore himself as count,
      even while adopting, when desirable, an attitude of gallantry, and making
      pretty—nay, even tender—speeches. He exalted the service she
      would render them, spoke of their gratitude; then, suddenly, using the
      familiar “thou”:

“And you know, my dear, he could boast then of having made a
      conquest of a pretty girl such as he won''t often find in his own country.”

As soon as they returned she went to her room, and was seen no more. The
      general anxiety was at its height. What would she do? If she still
      resisted, how awkward for them all!

The dinner hour struck; they waited for her in vain. At last Monsieur
      Follenvie entered, announcing that Mademoiselle Rousset was not well, and
      that they might sit down to table. They all pricked up their ears. The
      count drew near the innkeeper, and whispered:

Out of regard for propriety he said nothing to his companions, but merely
      nodded slightly toward them. A great sigh of relief went up from all
      breasts; every face was lighted up with joy.

“By Gad!” shouted Loiseau, “I''ll stand champagne all
      round if there''s any to be found in this place.” And great was
      Madame Loiseau''s dismay when the proprietor came back with four bottles in
      his hands. They had all suddenly become talkative and merry; a lively joy
      filled all hearts. The count seemed to perceive for the first time that
      Madame Carre-Lamadon was charming; the manufacturer paid compliments to
      the countess. The conversation was animated, sprightly, witty, and,
      although many of the jokes were in the worst possible taste, all the
      company were amused by them, and none offended—indignation being
      dependent, like other emotions, on surroundings. And the mental atmosphere
      had gradually become filled with gross imaginings and unclean thoughts.

At dessert even the women indulged in discreetly worded allusions. Their
      glances were full of meaning; they had drunk much. The count, who even in
      his moments of relaxation preserved a dignified demeanor, hit on a
      much-appreciated comparison of the condition of things with the
      termination of a winter spent in the icy solitude of the North Pole and
      the joy of shipwrecked mariners who at last perceive a southward track
      opening out before their eyes.

All stood up, and greeted the toast with acclamation. Even the two good
      sisters yielded to the solicitations of the ladies, and consented to
      moisten their lips with the foaming wine, which they had never before
      tasted. They declared it was like effervescent lemonade, but with a
      pleasanter flavor.

Cornudet had not spoken a word or made a movement; he seemed plunged in
      serious thought, and now and then tugged furiously at his great beard, as
      if trying to add still further to its length. At last, toward midnight,
      when they were about to separate, Loiseau, whose gait was far from steady,
      suddenly slapped him on the back, saying thickly:

Cornudet threw back his head, cast one swift and scornful glance over the
      assemblage, and answered:

A chill fell on all. Loiseau himself looked foolish and disconcerted for a
      moment, but soon recovered his aplomb, and, writhing with laughter,
      exclaimed:

Pressed for an explanation, he related the “mysteries of the
      corridor,” whereat his listeners were hugely amused. The ladies
      could hardly contain their delight. The count and Monsieur Carre-Lamadon
      laughed till they cried. They could scarcely believe their ears.

Then they separated. But Madame Loiseau, who was nothing if not spiteful,
      remarked to her husband as they were on the way to bed that “that
      stuck-up little minx of a Carre-Lamadon had laughed on the wrong side of
      her mouth all the evening.”

“You know,” she said, “when women run after uniforms
      it''s all the same to them whether the men who wear them are French or
      Prussian. It''s perfectly sickening!”

The next morning the snow showed dazzling white tinder a clear winter sun.
      The coach, ready at last, waited before the door; while a flock of white
      pigeons, with pink eyes spotted in the centres with black, puffed out
      their white feathers and walked sedately between the legs of the six
      horses, picking at the steaming manure.

The driver, wrapped in his sheepskin coat, was smoking a pipe on the box,
      and all the passengers, radiant with delight at their approaching
      departure, were putting up provisions for the remainder of the journey.

She seemed rather shamefaced and embarrassed, and advanced with timid step
      toward her companions, who with one accord turned aside as if they had not
      seen her. The count, with much dignity, took his wife by the arm, and
      removed her from the unclean contact.

The girl stood still, stupefied with astonishment; then, plucking up
      courage, accosted the manufacturer''s wife with a humble “Good-morning,
      madame,” to which the other replied merely with a slight and
      insolent nod, accompanied by a look of outraged virtue. Every one suddenly
      appeared extremely busy, and kept as far from Boule de Suif as if her
      skirts had been infected with some deadly disease. Then they hurried to
      the coach, followed by the despised courtesan, who, arriving last of all,
      silently took the place she had occupied during the first part of the
      journey.

The rest seemed neither to see nor to know her—all save Madame
      Loiseau, who, glancing contemptuously in her direction, remarked, half
      aloud, to her husband:

At first no one spoke. Boule de Suif dared not even raise her eyes. She
      felt at once indignant with her neighbors, and humiliated at having
      yielded to the Prussian into whose arms they had so hypocritically cast
      her.

“Delightful! Exceptionally talented, and an artist to the finger
      tips. She sings marvellously and draws to perfection.”

The manufacturer was chatting with the count, and amid the clatter of the
      window-panes a word of their conversation was now and then
      distinguishable: “Shares—maturity—premium—time-limit.”

Loiseau, who had abstracted from the inn the timeworn pack of cards, thick
      with the grease of five years'' contact with half-wiped-off tables, started
      a game of bezique with his wife.

The good sisters, taking up simultaneously the long rosaries hanging from
      their waists, made the sign of the cross, and began to mutter in unison
      interminable prayers, their lips moving ever more and more swiftly, as if
      they sought which should outdistance the other in the race of orisons;
      from time to time they kissed a medal, and crossed themselves anew, then
      resumed their rapid and unintelligible murmur.

His wife thereupon produced a parcel tied with string, from which she
      extracted a piece of cold veal. This she cut into neat, thin slices, and
      both began to eat.

“We may as well do the same,” said the countess. The rest
      agreed, and she unpacked the provisions which had been prepared for
      herself, the count, and the Carre-Lamadons. In one of those oval dishes,
      the lids of which are decorated with an earthenware hare, by way of
      showing that a game pie lies within, was a succulent delicacy consisting
      of the brown flesh of the game larded with streaks of bacon and flavored
      with other meats chopped fine. A solid wedge of Gruyere cheese, which had
      been wrapped in a newspaper, bore the imprint: “Items of News,”
      on its rich, oily surface.

The two good sisters brought to light a hunk of sausage smelling strongly
      of garlic; and Cornudet, plunging both hands at once into the capacious
      pockets of his loose overcoat, produced from one four hard-boiled eggs and
      from the other a crust of bread. He removed the shells, threw them into
      the straw beneath his feet, and began to devour the eggs, letting morsels
      of the bright yellow yolk fall in his mighty beard, where they looked like
      stars.

Boule de Suif, in the haste and confusion of her departure, had not
      thought of anything, and, stifling with rage, she watched all these people
      placidly eating. At first, ill-suppressed wrath shook her whole person,
      and she opened her lips to shriek the truth at them, to overwhelm them
      with a volley of insults; but she could not utter a word, so choked was
      she with indignation.

No one looked at her, no one thought of her. She felt herself swallowed up
      in the scorn of these virtuous creatures, who had first sacrificed, then
      rejected her as a thing useless and unclean. Then she remembered her big
      basket full of the good things they had so greedily devoured: the two
      chickens coated in jelly, the pies, the pears, the four bottles of claret;
      and her fury broke forth like a cord that is overstrained, and she was on
      the verge of tears. She made terrible efforts at self-control, drew
      herself up, swallowed the sobs which choked her; but the tears rose
      nevertheless, shone at the brink of her eyelids, and soon two heavy drops
      coursed slowly down her cheeks. Others followed more quickly, like water
      filtering from a rock, and fell, one after another, on her rounded bosom.
      She sat upright, with a fixed expression, her face pale and rigid, hoping
      desperately that no one saw her give way.

But the countess noticed that she was weeping, and with a sign drew her
      husband''s attention to the fact. He shrugged his shoulders, as if to say:
      “Well, what of it? It''s not my fault.” Madame Loiseau chuckled
      triumphantly, and murmured:

The two nuns had betaken themselves once more to their prayers, first
      wrapping the remainder of their sausage in paper:

Then Cornudet, who was digesting his eggs, stretched his long legs under
      the opposite seat, threw himself back, folded his arms, smiled like a man
      who had just thought of a good joke, and began to whistle the
      Marseillaise.

The faces of his neighbors clouded; the popular air evidently did not find
      favor with them; they grew nervous and irritable, and seemed ready to howl
      as a dog does at the sound of a barrel-organ. Cornudet saw the discomfort
      he was creating, and whistled the louder; sometimes he even hummed the
      words:

The coach progressed more swiftly, the snow being harder now; and all the
      way to Dieppe, during the long, dreary hours of the journey, first in the
      gathering dusk, then in the thick darkness, raising his voice above the
      rumbling of the vehicle, Cornudet continued with fierce obstinacy his
      vengeful and monotonous whistling, forcing his weary and
      exasperated-hearers to follow the song from end to end, to recall every
      word of every line, as each was repeated over and over again with untiring
      persistency.

And Boule de Suif still wept, and sometimes a sob she could not restrain
      was heard in the darkness between two verses of the song.

Besieged Paris was in the throes of famine. Even the sparrows on the roofs
      and the rats in the sewers were growing scarce. People were eating
      anything they could get.

As Monsieur Morissot, watchmaker by profession and idler for the nonce,
      was strolling along the boulevard one bright January morning, his hands in
      his trousers pockets and stomach empty, he suddenly came face to face with
      an acquaintance—Monsieur Sauvage, a fishing chum.

Before the war broke out Morissot had been in the habit, every Sunday
      morning, of setting forth with a bamboo rod in his hand and a tin box on
      his back. He took the Argenteuil train, got out at Colombes, and walked
      thence to the Ile Marante. The moment he arrived at this place of his
      dreams he began fishing, and fished till nightfall.

Every Sunday he met in this very spot Monsieur Sauvage, a stout, jolly,
      little man, a draper in the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette, and also an ardent
      fisherman. They often spent half the day side by side, rod in hand and
      feet dangling over the water, and a warm friendship had sprung up between
      the two.

Some days they did not speak; at other times they chatted; but they
      understood each other perfectly without the aid of words, having similar
      tastes and feelings.

In the spring, about ten o''clock in the morning, when the early sun caused
      a light mist to float on the water and gently warmed the backs of the two
      enthusiastic anglers, Morissot would occasionally remark to his neighbor:

In the autumn, toward the close of day, when the setting sun shed a
      blood-red glow over the western sky, and the reflection of the crimson
      clouds tinged the whole river with red, brought a glow to the faces of the
      two friends, and gilded the trees, whose leaves were already turning at
      the first chill touch of winter, Monsieur Sauvage would sometimes smile at
      Morissot, and say:

As soon as they recognized each other they shook hands cordially, affected
      at the thought of meeting under such changed circumstances.

They entered a small cafe and took an absinthe together, then resumed
      their walk along the pavement.

They were quite unsteady when they came out, owing to the effect of the
      alcohol on their empty stomachs. It was a fine, mild day, and a gentle
      breeze fanned their faces.

The fresh air completed the effect of the alcohol on Monsieur Sauvage. He
      stopped suddenly, saying:

“Why, to the old place. The French outposts are close to Colombes. I
      know Colonel Dumoulin, and we shall easily get leave to pass.”

An hour later they were walking side by side on the-highroad. Presently
      they reached the villa occupied by the colonel. He smiled at their
      request, and granted it. They resumed their walk, furnished with a
      password.

Soon they left the outposts behind them, made their way through deserted
      Colombes, and found themselves on the outskirts of the small vineyards
      which border the Seine. It was about eleven o''clock.

Before them lay the village of Argenteuil, apparently lifeless. The
      heights of Orgement and Sannois dominated the landscape. The great plain,
      extending as far as Nanterre, was empty, quite empty-a waste of
      dun-colored soil and bare cherry trees.

The Prussians! They had never seen them as yet, but they had felt their
      presence in the neighborhood of Paris for months past—ruining
      France, pillaging, massacring, starving them. And a kind of superstitious
      terror mingled with the hatred they already felt toward this unknown,
      victorious nation.

“We''d offer them some fish,” replied Monsieur Sauvage, with
      that Parisian light-heartedness which nothing can wholly quench.

Still, they hesitated to show themselves in the open country, overawed by
      the utter silence which reigned around them.

And they made their way through one of the vineyards, bent double,
      creeping along beneath the cover afforded by the vines, with eye and ear
      alert.

A strip of bare ground remained to be crossed before they could gain the
      river bank. They ran across this, and, as soon as they were at the water''s
      edge, concealed themselves among the dry reeds.

Morissot placed his ear to the ground, to ascertain, if possible, whether
      footsteps were coming their way. He heard nothing. They seemed to be
      utterly alone.

Before them the deserted Ile Marante hid them from the farther shore. The
      little restaurant was closed, and looked as if it had been deserted for
      years.

Monsieur Sauvage caught the first gudgeon, Monsieur Morissot the second,
      and almost every moment one or other raised his line with a little,
      glittering, silvery fish wriggling at the end; they were having excellent
      sport.

They slipped their catch gently into a close-meshed bag lying at their
      feet; they were filled with joy—the joy of once more indulging in a
      pastime of which they had long been deprived.

The sun poured its rays on their backs; they no longer heard anything or
      thought of anything. They ignored the rest of the world; they were
      fishing.

But suddenly a rumbling sound, which seemed to come from the bowels of the
      earth, shook the ground beneath them: the cannon were resuming their
      thunder.

Morissot turned his head and could see toward the left, beyond the banks
      of the river, the formidable outline of Mont-Valerien, from whose summit
      arose a white puff of smoke.

The next instant a second puff followed the first, and in a few moments a
      fresh detonation made the earth tremble.

Others followed, and minute by minute the mountain gave forth its deadly
      breath and a white puff of smoke, which rose slowly into the peaceful
      heaven and floated above the summit of the cliff.

Morissot, who was anxiously watching his float bobbing up and down, was
      suddenly seized with the angry impatience of a peaceful man toward the
      madmen who were firing thus, and remarked indignantly:

And the two began placidly discussing political problems with the sound
      common sense of peaceful, matter-of-fact citizens—agreeing on one
      point: that they would never be free. And Mont-Valerien thundered
      ceaselessly, demolishing the houses of the French with its cannon balls,
      grinding lives of men to powder, destroying many a dream, many a cherished
      hope, many a prospective happiness; ruthlessly causing endless woe and
      suffering in the hearts of wives, of daughters, of mothers, in other
      lands.

But they suddenly trembled with alarm at the sound of footsteps behind
      them, and, turning round, they perceived close at hand four tall, bearded
      men, dressed after the manner of livery servants and wearing flat caps on
      their heads. They were covering the two anglers with their rifles.

In the space of a few seconds they were seized, bound, thrown into a boat,
      and taken across to the Ile Marante.

A shaggy-looking giant, who was bestriding a chair and smoking a long clay
      pipe, addressed them in excellent French with the words:

Then a soldier deposited at the officer''s feet the bag full of fish, which
      he had taken care to bring away. The Prussian smiled.

“Not bad, I see. But we have something else to talk about. Listen to
      me, and don''t be alarmed:

“You must know that, in my eyes, you are two spies sent to
      reconnoitre me and my movements. Naturally, I capture you and I shoot you.
      You pretended to be fishing, the better to disguise your real errand. You
      have fallen into my hands, and must take the consequences. Such is war.

“But as you came here through the outposts you must have a password
      for your return. Tell me that password and I will let you go.”

The two friends, pale as death, stood silently side by side, a slight
      fluttering of the hands alone betraying their emotion.

“No one will ever know,” continued the officer. “You
      will return peacefully to your homes, and the secret will disappear with
      you. If you refuse, it means death-instant death. Choose!”

“Just think that in five minutes you will be at the bottom of that
      water. In five minutes! You have relations, I presume?”

The two fishermen remained silent. The German turned and gave an order in
      his own language. Then he moved his chair a little way off, that he might
      not be so near the prisoners, and a dozen men stepped forward, rifle in
      hand, and took up a position, twenty paces off.

Then he rose quickly, went over to the two Frenchmen, took Morissot by the
      arm, led him a short distance off, and said in a low voice:

Then by chance Morissot''s eyes fell on the bag full of gudgeon lying in
      the grass a few feet from him.

A ray of sunlight made the still quivering fish glisten like silver. And
      Morissot''s heart sank. Despite his efforts at self-control his eyes filled
      with tears.

Monsieur Sauvage fell forward instantaneously. Morissot, being the taller,
      swayed slightly and fell across his friend with face turned skyward and
      blood oozing from a rent in the breast of his coat.

His men dispersed, and presently returned with ropes and large stones,
      which they attached to the feet of the two friends; then they carried them
      to the river bank.

Two soldiers took Morissot by the head and the feet; two others did the
      same with Sauvage. The bodies, swung lustily by strong hands, were cast to
      a distance, and, describing a curve, fell feet foremost into the stream.

Suddenly he caught sight of the net full of gudgeons, lying forgotten in
      the grass. He picked it up, examined it, smiled, and called:

A white-aproned soldier responded to the summons, and the Prussian,
      tossing him the catch of the two murdered men, said:

“Have these fish fried for me at once, while they are still alive;
      they''ll make a tasty dish.”

It was after Bourbaki''s defeat in the east of France. The army, broken up,
      decimated, and worn out, had been obliged to retreat into Switzerland
      after that terrible campaign, and it was only its short duration that
      saved a hundred and fifty thousand men from certain death. Hunger, the
      terrible cold, forced marches in the snow without boots, over bad mountain
      roads, had caused us ''francs-tireurs'', especially, the greatest suffering,
      for we were without tents, and almost without food, always in the van when
      we were marching toward Belfort, and in the rear when returning by the
      Jura. Of our little band that had numbered twelve hundred men on the first
      of January, there remained only twenty-two pale, thin, ragged wretches,
      when we at length succeeded in reaching Swiss territory.

There we were safe, and could rest. Everybody knows what sympathy was
      shown to the unfortunate French army, and how well it was cared for. We
      all gained fresh life, and those who had been rich and happy before the
      war declared that they had never experienced a greater feeling of comfort
      than they did then. Just think. We actually had something to eat every
      day, and could sleep every night.

Meanwhile, the war continued in the east of France, which had been
      excluded from the armistice. Besancon still kept the enemy in check, and
      the latter had their revenge by ravaging Franche Comte. Sometimes we heard
      that they had approached quite close to the frontier, and we saw Swiss
      troops, who were to form a line of observation between us and them, set
      out on their march.

That pained us in the end, and, as we regained health and strength, the
      longing to fight took possession of us. It was disgraceful and irritating
      to know that within two or three leagues of us the Germans were victorious
      and insolent, to feel that we were protected by our captivity, and to feel
      that on that account we were powerless against them.

One day our captain took five or six of us aside, and spoke to us about
      it, long and furiously. He was a fine fellow, that captain. He had been a
      sublieutenant in the Zouaves, was tall and thin and as hard as steel, and
      during the whole campaign he had cut out their work for the Germans. He
      fretted in inactivity, and could not accustom himself to the idea of being
      a prisoner and of doing nothing.

“Confound it!” he said to us, “does it not pain you to
      know that there is a number of uhlans within two hours of us? Does it not
      almost drive you mad to know that those beggarly wretches are walking
      about as masters in our mountains, when six determined men might kill a
      whole spitful any day? I cannot endure it any longer, and I must go there.”

“How? It is not very difficult! Just as if we had not done a thing
      or two within the last six months, and got out of woods that were guarded
      by very different men from the Swiss. The day that you wish to cross over
      into France, I will undertake to get you there.”

“You are forgetting the treaty,” another soldier said; “we
      shall run the risk of doing the Swiss an injury, if Manteuffel learns that
      they have allowed prisoners to return to France.”

“Come,” said the captain, “those are all bad reasons. I
      mean to go and kill some Prussians; that is all I care about. If you do
      not wish to do as I do, well and good; only say so at once. I can quite
      well go by myself; I do not require anybody''s company.”

Naturally we all protested, and, as it was quite impossible to make the
      captain alter his mind, we felt obliged to promise to go with him. We
      liked him too much to leave him in the lurch, as he never failed us in any
      extremity; and so the expedition was decided on.

The captain had a plan of his own, that he had been cogitating over for
      some time. A man in that part of the country whom he knew was going to
      lend him a cart and six suits of peasants'' clothes. We could hide under
      some straw at the bottom of the wagon, which would be loaded with Gruyere
      cheese, which he was supposed to be going to sell in France. The captain
      told the sentinels that he was taking two friends with him to protect his
      goods, in case any one should try to rob him, which did not seem an
      extraordinary precaution. A Swiss officer seemed to look at the wagon in a
      knowing manner, but that was in order to impress his soldiers. In a word,
      neither officers nor men could make it out.

“Get up,” the captain said to the horses, as he cracked his
      whip, while our three men quietly smoked their pipes. I was half
      suffocated in my box, which only admitted the air through those holes in
      front, and at the same time I was nearly frozen, for it was terribly cold.

The Prussian lines were very badly guarded, as the enemy trusted to the
      watchfulness of the Swiss. The sergeant spoke North German, while our
      captain spoke the bad German of the Four Cantons, and so they could not
      understand each other. The sergeant, however, pretended to be very
      intelligent; and, in order to make us believe that he understood us, they
      allowed us to continue our journey; and, after travelling for seven hours,
      being continually stopped in the same manner, we arrived at a small
      village of the Jura in ruins, at nightfall.

What were we going to do? Our only arms were the captain''s whip, our
      uniforms our peasants'' blouses, and our food the Gruyere cheese. Our sole
      wealth consisted in our ammunition, packages of cartridges which we had
      stowed away inside some of the large cheeses. We had about a thousand of
      them, just two hundred each, but we needed rifles, and they must be
      chassepots. Luckily, however, the captain was a bold man of an inventive
      mind, and this was the plan that he hit upon:

While three of us remained hidden in a cellar in the abandoned village, he
      continued his journey as far as Besancon with the empty wagon and one man.
      The town was invested, but one can always make one''s way into a town among
      the hills by crossing the tableland till within about ten miles of the
      walls, and then following paths and ravines on foot. They left their wagon
      at Omans, among the Germans, and escaped out of it at night on foot; so as
      to gain the heights which border the River Doubs; the next day they
      entered Besancon, where there were plenty of chassepots. There were nearly
      forty thousand of them left in the arsenal, and General Roland, a brave
      marine, laughed at the captain''s daring project, but let him have six
      rifles and wished him “good luck.” There he had also found his
      wife, who had been through all the war with us before the campaign in the
      East, and who had been only prevented by illness from continuing with
      Bourbaki''s army. She had recovered, however, in spite of the cold, which
      was growing more and more intense, and in spite of the numberless
      privations that awaited her, she persisted in accompanying her husband. He
      was obliged to give way to her, and they all three, the captain, his wife,
      and our comrade, started on their expedition.

Going was nothing in comparison to returning. They were obliged to travel
      by night, so as to avoid meeting anybody, as the possession of six rifles
      would have made them liable to suspicion. But, in spite of everything, a
      week after leaving us, the captain and his two men were back with us
      again. The campaign was about to begin.

The first night of his arrival he began it himself, and, under pretext of
      examining the surrounding country, he went along the high road.

I must tell you that the little village which served as our fortress was a
      small collection of poor, badly built houses, which had been deserted long
      before. It lay on a steep slope, which terminated in a wooded plain. The
      country people sell the wood; they send it down the slopes, which are
      called coulees, locally, and which lead down to the plain, and there they
      stack it into piles, which they sell thrice a year to the wood merchants.
      The spot where this market is held in indicated by two small houses by the
      side of the highroad, which serve for public houses. The captain had gone
      down there by way of one of these coulees.

He had been gone about half an hour, and we were on the lookout at the top
      of the ravine, when we heard a shot. The captain had ordered us not to
      stir, and only to come to him when we heard him blow his trumpet. It was
      made of a goat''s horn, and could be heard a league off; but it gave no
      sound, and, in spite of our cruel anxiety, we were obliged to wait in
      silence, with our rifles by our side.

It is nothing to go down these coulees; one just lets one''s self slide
      down; but it is more difficult to get up again; one has to scramble up by
      catching hold of the hanging branches of the trees, and sometimes on all
      fours, by sheer strength. A whole mortal hour passed, and he did not come;
      nothing moved in the brushwood. The captain''s wife began to grow
      impatient. What could he be doing? Why did he not call us? Did the shot
      that we had heard proceed from an enemy, and had he killed or wounded our
      leader, her husband? They did not know what to think, but I myself fancied
      either that he was dead or that his enterprise was successful; and I was
      merely anxious and curious to know what he had done.

Suddenly we heard the sound of his trumpet, and we were much surprised
      that instead of coming from below, as we had expected, it came from the
      village behind us. What did that mean? It was a mystery to us, but the
      same idea struck us all, that he had been killed, and that the Prussians
      were blowing the trumpet to draw us into an ambush. We therefore returned
      to the cottage, keeping a careful lookout with our fingers on the trigger,
      and hiding under the branches; but his wife, in spite of our entreaties,
      rushed on, leaping like a tigress. She thought that she had to avenge her
      husband, and had fixed the bayonet to her rifle, and we lost sight of her
      at the moment that we heard the trumpet again; and, a few moments later,
      we heard her calling out to us:

We hastened on, and saw the captain smoking his pipe at the entrance of
      the village, but strangely enough, he was on horseback.

“Ah! ah!” he said to us, “you see that there is
      something to be done here. Here I am on horseback already; I knocked over
      an uhlan yonder, and took his horse; I suppose they were guarding the
      wood, but it was by drinking and swilling in clover. One of them, the
      sentry at the door, had not time to see me before I gave him a sugarplum
      in his stomach, and then, before the others could come out, I jumped on
      the horse and was off like a shot. Eight or ten of them followed me, I
      think; but I took the crossroads through the woods. I have got scratched
      and torn a bit, but here I am, and now, my good fellows, attention, and
      take care! Those brigands will not rest until they have caught us, and we
      must receive them with rifle bullets. Come along; let us take up our
      posts!”

We set out. One of us took up his position a good way from the village on
      the crossroads; I was posted at the entrance of the main street, where the
      road from the level country enters the village, while the two others, the
      captain and his wife, were in the middle of the village, near the church,
      whose tower served for an observatory and citadel.

We had not been in our places long before we heard a shot, followed by
      another, and then two, then three. The first was evidently a chassepot
      —one recognized it by the sharp report, which sounds like the crack
      of a whip—while the other three came from the lancers'' carbines.

The captain was furious. He had given orders to the outpost to let the
      enemy pass and merely to follow them at a distance if they marched toward
      the village, and to join me when they had gone well between the houses.
      Then they were to appear suddenly, take the patrol between two fires, and
      not allow a single man to escape; for, posted as we were, the six of us
      could have hemmed in ten Prussians, if needful.

“That confounded Piedelot has roused them,” the captain said,
      “and they will not venture to come on blindfolded any longer. And
      then I am quite sure that he has managed to get a shot into himself
      somewhere or other, for we hear nothing of him. It serves him right; why
      did he not obey orders?” And then, after a moment, he grumbled in
      his beard: “After all I am sorry for the poor fellow; he is so
      brave, and shoots so well!”

The captain was right in his conjectures. We waited until evening, without
      seeing the uhlans; they had retreated after the first attack; but
      unfortunately we had not seen Piedelot, either. Was he dead or a prisoner?
      When night came, the captain proposed that we should go out and look for
      him, and so the three of us started. At the crossroads we found a broken
      rifle and some blood, while the ground was trampled down; but we did not
      find either a wounded man or a dead body, although we searched every
      thicket, and at midnight we returned without having discovered anything of
      our unfortunate comrade.

“It is very strange,” the captain growled. “They must
      have killed him and thrown him into the bushes somewhere; they cannot
      possibly have taken him prisoner, as he would have called out for help. I
      cannot understand it at all.” Just as he said that, bright flames
      shot up in the direction of the inn on the high road, which illuminated
      the sky.

“Scoundrels! cowards!” he shouted. “I will bet that they
      have set fire to the two houses on the marketplace, in order to have their
      revenge, and then they will scuttle off without saying a word. They will
      be satisfied with having killed a man and set fire to two houses. All
      right. It shall not pass over like that. We must go for them; they will
      not like to leave their illuminations in order to fight.”

“It would be a great stroke of luck if we could set Piedelot free at
      the same time,” some one said.

The five of us set off, full of rage and hope. In twenty minutes we had
      got to the bottom of the coulee, and had not yet seen any one when we were
      within a hundred yards of the inn. The fire was behind the house, and all
      we saw of it was the reflection above the roof. However, we were walking
      rather slowly, as we were afraid of an ambush, when suddenly we heard
      Piedelot''s well-known voice. It had a strange sound, however; for it was
      at the same time—dull and vibrating, stifled and clear, as if he
      were calling out as loud as he could with a bit of rag stuffed into his
      mouth. He seemed to be hoarse and gasping, and the unlucky fellow kept
      exclaiming: “Help! Help!”

We sent all thoughts of prudence to the devil, and in two bounds we were
      at the back of the inn, where a terrible sight met our eyes.

Piedelot was being burned alive. He was writhing in the midst of a heap of
      fagots, tied to a stake, and the flames were licking him with their
      burning tongues. When he saw us, his tongue seemed to stick in his throat;
      he drooped his head, and seemed as if he were going to die. It was only
      the affair of a moment to upset the burning pile, to scatter the embers,
      and to cut the ropes that fastened him.

Poor fellow! In what a terrible state we found him. The evening before he
      had had his left arm broken, and it seemed as if he had been badly beaten
      since then, for his whole body was covered with wounds, bruises and blood.
      The flames had also begun their work on him, and he had two large burns,
      one on his loins and the other on his right thigh, and his beard and hair
      were scorched. Poor Piedelot!

No one knows the terrible rage we felt at this sight! We would have rushed
      headlong at a hundred thousand Prussians; our thirst for vengeance was
      intense. But the cowards had run away, leaving their crime behind them.
      Where could we find them now? Meanwhile, however, the captain''s wife was
      looking after Piedelot, and dressing his wounds as best she could, while
      the captain himself shook hands with him excitedly, and in a few minutes
      he came to himself.

“Good-morning, captain; good-morning, all of you,” he said.
      “Ah! the scoundrels, the wretches! Why, twenty of them came to
      surprise us.”

“Yes; there was a whole band of them, and that is why I disobeyed
      orders, captain, and fired on them, for they would have killed you all,
      and I preferred to stop them. That frightened them, and they did not
      venture to go farther than the crossroads. They were such cowards. Four of
      them shot at me at twenty yards, as if I had been a target, and then they
      slashed me with their swords. My arm was broken, so that I could only use
      my bayonet with one hand.”

“I took good care not to do that, for you would all have come; and
      you would neither have been able to defend me nor yourselves, being only
      five against twenty.”

“I preferred to die by myself, don''t you see! I did not want to
      bring you here, for it would have been a mere ambush.”

“No, I am suffocating. I know that I cannot live much longer. The
      brutes! They tied me to a tree, and beat me till I was half dead, and then
      they shook my broken arm; but I did not make a sound. I would rather have
      bitten my tongue out than have called out before them. Now I can tell what
      I am suffering and shed tears; it does one good. Thank you, my kind
      friends.”

“Yes, yes; I want you to do that. There is, in particular, a woman
      among them who passes as the wife of the lancer whom the captain killed
      yesterday. She is dressed like a lancer, and she tortured me the most
      yesterday, and suggested burning me; and it was she who set fire to the
      wood. Oh! the wretch, the brute! Ah! how I am suffering! My loins, my
      arms!” and he fell back gasping and exhausted, writhing in his
      terrible agony, while the captain''s wife wiped the perspiration from his
      forehead, and we all shed tears of grief and rage, as if we had been
      children. I will not describe the end to you; he died half an hour later,
      previously telling us in what direction the enemy had gone. When he was
      dead we gave ourselves time to bury him, and then we set out in pursuit of
      them, with our hearts full of fury and hatred.

“We will throw ourselves on the whole Prussian army, if it be
      necessary,” the captain said; “but we will avenge Piedelot. We
      must catch those scoundrels. Let us swear to die, rather than not to find
      them; and if I am killed first, these are my orders: All the prisoners
      that you take are to be shot immediately, and as for the lancer''s wife,
      she is to be tortured before she is put to death.”

“She must not be shot, because she is a woman,” the captain''s
      wife said. “If you survive, I am sure that you would not shoot a
      woman. Torturing her will be quite sufficient; but if you are killed in
      this pursuit, I want one thing, and that is to fight with her; I will kill
      her with my own hands, and the others can do what they like with her if
      she kills me.”

“We will outrage her! We will burn her! We will tear her to pieces!
      Piedelot shall be avenged!

The next morning we unexpectedly fell on an outpost of uhlans four leagues
      away. Surprised by our sudden attack, they were not able to mount their
      horses, nor even to defend themselves; and in a few moments we had five
      prisoner, corresponding to our own number. The captain questioned them,
      and from their answers we felt certain that they were the same whom we had
      encountered the previous day. Then a very curious operation took place.
      One of us was told off to ascertain their sex, and nothing can describe
      our joy when we discovered what we were seeking among them, the female
      executioner who had tortured our friend.

The four others were shot on the spot, with their backs to us and close to
      the muzzles of our rifles; and then we turned our attention to the woman.
      What were we going to do with her? I must acknowledge that we were all of
      us in favor of shooting her. Hatred, and the wish to avenge Piedelot, had
      extinguished all pity in us, and we had forgotten that we were going to
      shoot a woman, but a woman reminded us of it, the captain''s wife; at her
      entreaties, therefore, we determined to keep her a prisoner.

The next day we heard that the armistice had been extended to the eastern
      part of France, and we had to put an end to our little campaign. Two of
      us, who belonged to the neighborhood, returned home, so there were only
      four of us, all told: the captain, his wife, and two men. We belonged to
      Besancon, which was still being besieged in spite of the armistice.

“Let us stop here,” said the captain. “I cannot believe
      that the war is going to end like this. The devil take it! Surely there
      are men still left in France; and now is the time to prove what they are
      made of. The spring is coming on, and the armistice is only a trap laid
      for the Prussians. During the time that it lasts, a new army will be
      raised, and some fine morning we shall fall upon them again. We shall be
      ready, and we have a hostage—let us remain here.”

We fixed our quarters there. It was terribly cold, and we did not go out
      much, and somebody had always to keep the female prisoner in sight.

She was sullen, and never said anything, or else spoke of her husband,
      whom the captain had killed. She looked at him continually with fierce
      eyes, and we felt that she was tortured by a wild longing for revenge.
      That seemed to us to be the most suitable punishment for the terrible
      torments that she had made Piedelot suffer, for impotent vengeance is such
      intense pain!

Alas! we who knew how to avenge our comrade ought to have thought that
      this woman would know how to avenge her husband, and have been on our
      guard. It is true that one of us kept watch every night, and that at first
      we tied her by a long rope to the great oak bench that was fastened to the
      wall. But, by and by, as she had never tried to escape, in spite of her
      hatred for us, we relaxed our extreme prudence, and allowed her to sleep
      somewhere else except on the bench, and without being tied. What had we to
      fear? She was at the end of the room, a man was on guard at the door, and
      between her and the sentinel the captain''s wife and two other men used to
      lie. She was alone and unarmed against four, so there could be no danger.

One night when we were asleep, and the captain was on guard, the lancer''s
      wife was lying more quietly in her corner than usual, and she had even
      smiled for the first time since she had been our prisoner during the
      evening. Suddenly, however, in the middle of the night, we were all
      awakened by a terrible cry. We got up, groping about, and at once stumbled
      over a furious couple who were rolling about and fighting on the ground.
      It was the captain and the lancer''s wife. We threw ourselves on them, and
      separated them in a moment. She was shouting and laughing, and he seemed
      to have the death rattle. All this took place in the dark. Two of us held
      her, and when a light was struck a terrible sight met our eyes. The
      captain was lying on the floor in a pool of blood, with an enormous gash
      in his throat, and his sword bayonet, that had been taken from his rifle,
      was sticking in the red, gaping wound. A few minutes afterward he died,
      without having been able to utter a word.

His wife did not shed a tear. Her eyes were dry, her throat was
      contracted, and she looked at the lancer''s wife steadfastly, and with a
      calm ferocity that inspired fear.

“This woman belongs to me,” she said to us suddenly. “You
      swore to me not a week ago to let me kill her as I chose, if she killed my
      husband; and you must keep your oath. You must fasten her securely to the
      fireplace, upright against the back of it, and then you can go where you
      like, but far from here. I will take my revenge on her myself. Leave the
      captain''s body, and we three, he, she and I, will remain here.”

We obeyed, and went away. She promised to write to us to Geneva, as we
      were returning thither.

Two days later I received the following letter, dated the day after we had
      left, that had been written at an inn on the high road:

“MY FRIEND: I am writing to you, according to my promise. For the
      moment I am at the inn, where I have just handed my prisoner over to a
      Prussian officer.

“I must tell you, my friend, that this poor woman has left two
      children in Germany. She had followed her husband, whom she adored, as she
      did not wish him to be exposed to the risks of war by himself, and as her
      children were with their grandparents. I have learned all this since
      yesterday, and it has turned my ideas of vengeance into more humane
      feelings. At the very moment when I felt pleasure in insulting this woman,
      and in threatening her with the most fearful torments, in recalling
      Piedelot, who had been burned alive, and in threatening her with a similar
      death, she looked at me coldly, and said:

“''What have you got to reproach me with, Frenchwoman? You think that
      you will do right in avenging your husband''s death, is not that so?''

“''Very well, then; in killing him, I did what you are going to do in
      burning me. I avenged my husband, for your husband killed him.''

“And in fact she did not seem to have lost courage. Her face was
      calm, and she looked at me without trembling, while I brought wood and
      dried leaves together, and feverishly threw on to them the powder from
      some cartridges, which was to make her funeral pile the more cruel.

“I hesitated in my thoughts of persecution for a moment. But the
      captain was there, pale and covered with blood, and he seemed to be
      looking at me with his large, glassy eyes, and I applied myself to my work
      again after kissing his pale lips. Suddenly, however, on raising my head,
      I saw that she was crying, and I felt rather surprised.

“She continued to sob, but stopping suddenly, she said to me in
      broken words and in a low voice:

“A shiver rare over me, for I guessed that this poor woman had some.
      She asked me to look in a pocketbook which was in her bosom, and in it I
      saw two photographs of quite young children, a boy and a girl, with those
      kind, gentle, chubby faces that German children have. In it there were
      also two locks of light hair and a letter in a large, childish hand, and
      beginning with German words which meant:

“''I could not restrain my tears, my dear friend, and so I untied
      her, and without venturing to look at the face of my poor dead husband,
      who was not to be avenged, I went with her as far as the inn. She is free;
      I have just left her, and she kissed me with tears. I am going upstairs to
      my husband; come as soon as possible, my dear friend, to look for our two
      bodies.''”

I set off with all speed, and when I arrived there was a Prussian patrol
      at the cottage; and when I asked what it all meant, I was told that there
      was a captain of francs-tireurs and his wife inside, both dead. I gave
      their names; they saw that I knew them, and I begged to be allowed to
      arrange their funeral.

“Somebody has already undertaken it,” was the reply. “Go
      in if you wish to, as you know them. You can settle about their funeral
      with their friend.”

I went in. The captain and his wife were lying side by side on a bed, and
      were covered by a sheet. I raised it, and saw that the woman had inflicted
      a similar wound in her throat to that from which her husband had died.

At the side of the bed there sat, watching and weeping, the woman who had
      been mentioned to me as their best friend. It was the lancer''s wife.

There was not a sound in the forest save the indistinct, fluttering sound
      of the snow falling on the trees. It had been snowing since noon; a little
      fine snow, that covered the branches as with frozen moss, and spread a
      silvery covering over the dead leaves in the ditches, and covered the
      roads with a white, yielding carpet, and made still more intense the
      boundless silence of this ocean of trees.

Before the door of the forester''s dwelling a young woman, her arms bare to
      the elbow, was chopping wood with a hatchet on a block of stone. She was
      tall, slender, strong-a true girl of the woods, daughter and wife of a
      forester.

“We are alone to-night, Berthine; you must come in. It is getting
      dark, and there may be Prussians or wolves about.”

“I''ve just finished, mother,” replied the young woman,
      splitting as she spoke an immense log of wood with strong, deft blows,
      which expanded her chest each time she raised her arms to strike. “Here
      I am; there''s no need to be afraid; it''s quite light still.”

Then she gathered up her sticks and logs, piled them in the chimney
      corner, went back to close the great oaken shutters, and finally came in,
      drawing behind her the heavy bolts of the door.

Her husband had been called upon to serve in the army at the beginning of
      the Prussian invasion, and the two women had remained alone with the old
      father, a keeper named Nicolas Pichon, sometimes called Long-legs, who
      refused obstinately to leave his home and take refuge in the town.

This town was Rethel, an ancient stronghold built on a rock. Its
      inhabitants were patriotic, and had made up their minds to resist the
      invaders, to fortify their native place, and, if need be, to stand a siege
      as in the good old days. Twice already, under Henri IV and under Louis
      XIV, the people of Rethel had distinguished themselves by their heroic
      defence of their town. They would do as much now, by gad! or else be
      slaughtered within their own walls.

They had, therefore, bought cannon and rifles, organized a militia, and
      formed themselves into battalions and companies, and now spent their time
      drilling all day long in the square. All-bakers, grocers, butchers,
      lawyers, carpenters, booksellers, chemists-took their turn at military
      training at regular hours of the day, under the auspices of Monsieur
      Lavigne, a former noncommissioned officer in the dragoons, now a draper,
      having married the daughter and inherited the business of Monsieur
      Ravaudan, Senior.

He had taken the rank of commanding officer in Rethel, and, seeing that
      all the young men had gone off to the war, he had enlisted all the others
      who were in favor of resisting an attack. Fat men now invariably walked
      the streets at a rapid pace, to reduce their weight and improve their
      breathing, and weak men carried weights to strengthen their muscles.

And they awaited the Prussians. But the Prussians did not appear. They
      were not far off, however, for twice already their scouts had penetrated
      as far as the forest dwelling of Nicolas Pichon, called Long-legs.

The old keeper, who could run like a fox, had come and warned the town.
      The guns had been got ready, but the enemy had not shown themselves.

Long-legs'' dwelling served as an outpost in the Aveline forest. Twice a
      week the old man went to the town for provisions and brought the citizens
      news of the outlying district.

On this particular day he had gone to announce the fact that a small
      detachment of German infantry had halted at his house the day before,
      about two o''clock in the afternoon, and had left again almost immediately.
      The noncommissioned officer in charge spoke French.

When the old man set out like this he took with him his dogs—two
      powerful animals with the jaws of lions-as a safeguard against the wolves,
      which were beginning to get fierce, and he left directions with the two
      women to barricade themselves securely within their dwelling as soon as
      night fell.

And Berthine was hanging her pot over the fire to warm the soup when she
      suddenly stood still, listening attentively to a sound that had reached
      her through the chimney.

Berthine took the heavy revolver from its hook, slipped it into the pocket
      of her skirt, and, putting her ear to the door, asked:

“My men and I have lost our way in the forest since morning. Open
      the door or I''ll break it down!”

The forester''s daughter had no choice; she shot back the heavy bolts,
      threw open the ponderous shutter, and perceived in the wan light of the
      snow six men, six Prussian soldiers, the same who had visited the house
      the day before.

“I lost my bearings,” replied the officer; “lost them
      completely. Then I recognized this house. I''ve eaten nothing since
      morning, nor my men either.”

“Never mind,” replied the soldier, who seemed a decent sort of
      fellow. “We won''t do you any harm, but you must give us something to
      eat. We are nearly dead with hunger and fatigue.”

Then entered, covered with snow, their helmets sprinkled with a
      creamy-looking froth, which gave them the appearance of meringues. They
      seemed utterly worn out.

“Sit down,” she said, “and I''ll make you some soup. You
      certainly look tired out, and no mistake.”

She put more water in the pot, added butter and potatoes; then, taking
      down a piece of bacon from a hook in the chimney earner, cut it in two and
      slipped half of it into the pot.

The six men watched her movements with hungry eyes. They had placed their
      rifles and helmets in a corner and waited for supper, as well behaved as
      children on a school bench.

The old mother had resumed her spinning, casting from time to time a
      furtive and uneasy glance at the soldiers. Nothing was to be heard save
      the humming of the wheel, the crackling of the fire, and the singing of
      the water in the pot.

But suddenly a strange noise—a sound like the harsh breathing of
      some wild animal sniffing under the door-startled the occupants of the
      room.

The German officer sprang toward the rifles. Berthine stopped him with a
      gesture, and said, smilingly:

The incredulous man wanted to see with his own eyes, and as soon as the
      door was opened he perceived two large grayish animals disappearing with
      long, swinging trot into the darkness.

The men devoured their meal voraciously, with mouths stretched to their
      ears that they might swallow the more. Their round eyes opened at the same
      time as their jaws, and as the soup coursed down their throats it made a
      noise like the gurgling of water in a rainpipe.

The two women watched in silence the movements of the big red beards. The
      potatoes seemed to be engulfed in these moving fleeces.

But, as they were thirsty, the forester''s daughter went down to the cellar
      to draw them some cider. She was gone some time. The cellar was small,
      with an arched ceiling, and had served, so people said, both as prison and
      as hiding-place during the Revolution. It was approached by means of a
      narrow, winding staircase, closed by a trap-door at the farther end of the
      kitchen.

When Berthine returned she was smiling mysteriously to herself. She gave
      the Germans her jug of cider.

The soldiers had finished eating, and were all six falling asleep as they
      sat round the table. Every now and then a forehead fell with a thud on the
      board, and the man, awakened suddenly, sat upright again.

“Go and lie down, all of you, round the fire. There''s lots of room
      for six. I''m going up to my room with my mother.”

And the two women went upstairs. They could be heard locking the door and
      walking about overhead for a time; then they were silent.

The Prussians lay down on the floor, with their feet to the fire and their
      heads resting on their rolled-up cloaks. Soon all six snored loudly and
      uninterruptedly in six different keys.

They had been sleeping for some time when a shot rang out so loudly that
      it seemed directed against the very walls of the house. The soldiers rose
      hastily. Two-then three-more shots were fired.

The door opened hastily, and Berthine appeared, barefooted and only half
      dressed, with her candle in her hand and a scared look on her face.

“There are the French,” she stammered; “at least two
      hundred of them. If they find you here they''ll burn the house down. For
      God''s sake, hurry down into the cellar, and don''t make a sound, whatever
      you do. If you make any noise we are lost.”

The young woman hurriedly raised the small, square trap-door, and the six
      men disappeared one after another down the narrow, winding staircase,
      feeling their way as they went.

But as soon as the spike of the last helmet was out of sight Berthine
      lowered the heavy oaken lid—thick as a wall, hard as steel,
      furnished with the hinges and bolts of a prison cell—shot the two
      heavy bolts, and began to laugh long and silently, possessed with a mad
      longing to dance above the heads of her prisoners.

They made no sound, inclosed in the cellar as in a strong-box, obtaining
      air only from a small, iron-barred vent-hole.

Berthine lighted her fire again, hung the pot over it, and prepared more
      soup, saying to herself:

Then she sat and waited. The heavy pendulum of the clock swung to and fro
      with a monotonous tick.

Every now and then the young woman cast an impatient glance at the dial-a
      glance which seemed to say:

But soon there was a sound of voices beneath her feet. Low, confused words
      reached her through the masonry which roofed the cellar. The Prussians
      were beginning to suspect the trick she had played them, and presently the
      officer came up the narrow staircase, and knocked at the trap-door.

He struck with the butt-end of his gun at the closed oaken door. But it
      would have resisted a battering-ram.

The forester''s daughter heard him go down the stairs again. Then the
      soldiers came one after another and tried their strength against the
      trapdoor. But, finding their efforts useless, they all returned to the
      cellar and began to talk among themselves.

The young woman heard them for a short time, then she rose, opened the
      door of the house; looked out into the night, and listened.

A sound of distant barking reached her ear. She whistled just as a
      huntsman would, and almost immediately two great dogs emerged from the
      darkness, and bounded to her side. She held them tight, and shouted at the
      top of her voice:

“Don''t go in front of the vent-hole!” shouted his daughter.
      “There are Prussians in the cellar!”

“They are the same as were here yesterday. They lost their way, and
      I''ve given them free lodgings in the cellar.”

She told the story of how she had alarmed them by firing the revolver, and
      had shut them up in the cellar.

“Go and fetch Monsieur Lavigne with his men,” she replied.
      “He''ll take them prisoners. He''ll be delighted.”

The old keeper sat down at the table, and began to eat his soup, having
      first filled two plates and put them on the floor for the dogs.

Long-legs set off a quarter of an hour later, and Berthine, with her head
      between her hands, waited.

The prisoners began to make themselves heard again. They shouted, called,
      and beat furiously with the butts of their muskets against the rigid
      trap-door of the cellar.

Then they fired shots through the vent-hole, hoping, no doubt, to be heard
      by any German detachment which chanced to be passing that way.

The forester''s daughter did not stir, but the noise irritated and unnerved
      her. Blind anger rose in her heart against the prisoners; she would have
      been only too glad to kill them all, and so silence them.

Her father had been gone an hour and a half. He must have reached the town
      by now. She conjured up a vision of him telling the story to Monsieur
      Lavigne, who grew pale with emotion, and rang for his servant to bring him
      his arms and uniform. She fancied she could bear the drum as it sounded
      the call to arms. Frightened faces appeared at the windows. The
      citizen-soldiers emerged from their houses half dressed, out of breath,
      buckling on their belts, and hurrying to the commandant''s house.

Then the troop of soldiers, with Long-legs at its head, set forth through
      the night and the snow toward the forest.

A nervous impatience possessed her. The minutes seemed interminable. Would
      the time never come?

At last the clock marked the moment she had fixed on for their arrival.
      And she opened the door to listen for their approach. She perceived a
      shadowy form creeping toward the house. She was afraid, and cried out. But
      it was her father.

Then he gave a shrill whistle. Soon a dark mass loomed up under the trees;
      the advance guard, composed of ten men.

At last the main body of the troop arrived, in all two hundred men, each
      carrying two hundred cartridges.

Monsieur Lavigne, in a state of intense excitement, posted them in such a
      fashion as to surround the whole house, save for a large space left vacant
      in front of the little hole on a level with the ground, through which the
      cellar derived its supply of air.

Still no response. For the space of twenty minutes Monsieur Lavigne called
      on this silent officer to surrender with bag and baggage, promising him
      that all lives should be spared, and that he and his men should be
      accorded military honors. But he could extort no sign, either of consent
      or of defiance. The situation became a puzzling one.

The citizen-soldiers kicked their heels in the snow, slapping their arms
      across their chest, as cabdrivers do, to warm themselves, and gazing at
      the vent-hole with a growing and childish desire to pass in front of it.

At last one of them took the risk-a man named Potdevin, who was fleet of
      limb. He ran like a deer across the zone of danger. The experiment
      succeeded. The prisoners gave no sign of life.

And another soldier crossed the open space before the dangerous vent-hole.
      Then this hazardous sport developed into a game. Every minute a man ran
      swiftly from one side to the other, like a boy playing baseball, kicking
      up the snow behind him as he ran. They had lighted big fires of dead wood
      at which to warm themselves, and the figures of the runners were illumined
      by the flames as they passed rapidly from the camp on the right to that on
      the left.

Maloison was a fat baker, whose corpulent person served to point many a
      joke among his comrades.

He hesitated. They chaffed him. Then, nerving himself to the effort, he
      set off at a little, waddling gait, which shook his fat paunch and made
      the whole detachment laugh till they cried.

He had accomplished about two-thirds of his journey when a long, crimson
      flame shot forth from the vent-hole. A loud report followed, and the fat
      baker fell face forward to the ground, uttering a frightful scream. No one
      went to his assistance. Then he was seen to drag himself, groaning, on
      all-fours through the snow until he was beyond danger, when he fainted.

After the first surprise and fright were over they laughed at him again.
      But Monsieur Lavigne appeared on the threshold of the forester''s dwelling.
      He had formed his plan of attack. He called in a loud voice “I want
      Planchut, the plumber, and his workmen.”

Next, with infinite precaution, he had a small round hole drilled in the
      trap-door; then, making a conduit with the troughs from the pump to this
      opening, he said, with an air of extreme satisfaction:

A shout of frenzied admiration, mingled with uproarious laughter, burst
      from his followers. And the commandant organized relays of men, who were
      to relieve one another every five minutes. Then he commanded:

And, the pump handle having been set in motion, a stream of water trickled
      throughout the length of the piping, and flowed from step to step down the
      cellar stairs with a gentle, gurgling sound.

An hour passed, then two, then three. The commandant, in a state of
      feverish agitation, walked up and down the kitchen, putting his ear to the
      ground every now and then to discover, if possible, what the enemy were
      doing and whether they would soon capitulate.

The enemy was astir now. They could be heard moving the casks about,
      talking, splashing through the water.

Then, about eight o''clock in the morning, a voice came from the vent-hole
      “I want to speak to the French officer.”

A rifle immediately protruded from the hole, and fell into the snow, then
      another and another, until all were disposed of. And the voice which had
      spoken before said:

Then, having filled the kitchen with armed and waiting soldiers, he slowly
      raised the oaken trapdoor.

Four heads appeared, soaking wet, four fair heads with long, sandy hair,
      and one after another the six Germans emerged—scared, shivering and
      dripping from head to foot.

They were seized and bound. Then, as the French feared a surprise, they
      set off at once in two convoys, one in charge of the prisoners, and the
      other conducting Maloison on a mattress borne on poles.

Monsieur Lavigne was decorated as a reward for having captured a Prussian
      advance guard, and the fat baker received the military medal for wounds
      received at the hands of the enemy.

Every Sunday, as soon as they were free, the little soldiers would go for
      a walk. They turned to the right on leaving the barracks, crossed
      Courbevoie with rapid strides, as though on a forced march; then, as the
      houses grew scarcer, they slowed down and followed the dusty road which
      leads to Bezons.

They were small and thin, lost in their ill-fitting capes, too large and
      too long, whose sleeves covered their hands; their ample red trousers fell
      in folds around their ankles. Under the high, stiff shako one could just
      barely perceive two thin, hollow-cheeked Breton faces, with their calm,
      naive blue eyes. They never spoke during their journey, going straight
      before them, the same idea in each one''s mind taking the place of
      conversation. For at the entrance of the little forest of Champioux they
      had found a spot which reminded them of home, and they did not feel happy
      anywhere else.

At the crossing of the Colombes and Chatou roads, when they arrived under
      the trees, they would take off their heavy, oppressive headgear and wipe
      their foreheads.

They always stopped for a while on the bridge at Bezons, and looked at the
      Seine. They stood there several minutes, bending over the railing,
      watching the white sails, which perhaps reminded them of their home, and
      of the fishing smacks leaving for the open.

As soon as they had crossed the Seine, they would purchase provisions at
      the delicatessen, the baker''s, and the wine merchant''s. A piece of
      bologna, four cents'' worth of bread, and a quart of wine, made up the
      luncheon which they carried away, wrapped up in their handkerchiefs. But
      as soon as they were out of the village their gait would slacken and they
      would begin to talk.

Before them was a plain with a few clumps of trees, which led to the
      woods, a little forest which seemed to remind them of that other forest at
      Kermarivan. The wheat and oat fields bordered on the narrow path, and Jean
      Kerderen said each time to Luc Le Ganidec:

And they went on, side by side, their minds full of dim memories of home.
      They saw the fields, the hedges, the forests, and beaches.

Each time they stopped near a large stone on the edge of the private
      estate, because it reminded them of the dolmen of Locneuven.

As soon as they reached the first clump of trees, Luc Le Ganidec would cut
      off a small stick, and, whittling it slowly, would walk on, thinking of
      the folks at home.

From time to time Luc would mention a name, or allude to some boyish prank
      which would give them food for plenty of thought. And the home country, so
      dear and so distant, would little by little gain possession of their
      minds, sending them back through space, to the well-known forms and
      noises, to the familiar scenery, with the fragrance of its green fields
      and sea air. They no longer noticed the smells of the city. And in their
      dreams they saw their friends leaving, perhaps forever, for the dangerous
      fishing grounds.

They were walking slowly, Luc Le Ganidec and Jean Kerderen, contented and
      sad, haunted by a sweet sorrow, the slow and penetrating sorrow of a
      captive animal which remembers the days of its freedom.

And when Luc had finished whittling his stick, they came to a little nook,
      where every Sunday they took their meal. They found the two bricks, which
      they had hidden in a hedge, and they made a little fire of dry branches
      and roasted their sausages on the ends of their knives.

When their last crumb of bread had been eaten and the last drop of wine
      had been drunk, they stretched themselves out on the grass side by side,
      without speaking, their half-closed eyes looking away in the distance,
      their hands clasped as in prayer, their red-trousered legs mingling with
      the bright colors of the wild flowers.

Towards noon they glanced, from time to time, towards the village of
      Bezons, for the dairy maid would soon be coming. Every Sunday she would
      pass in front of them on the way to milk her cow, the only cow in the
      neighborhood which was sent out to pasture.

Soon they would see the girl, coming through the fields, and it pleased
      them to watch the sparkling sunbeams reflected from her shining pail. They
      never spoke of her. They were just glad to see her, without understanding
      why.

She was a tall, strapping girl, freckled and tanned by the open air—a
      girl typical of the Parisian suburbs.

That was all. But the following Sunday, on seeing them, she smiled with
      the kindly smile of a woman who understood their shyness, and she asked:

She went on. But when she came back with her pail full of milk, she
      stopped before them and said:

Both were moved. Then not without difficulty, she poured some milk into
      the bottle in which they had brought their wine. Luc started to drink,
      carefully watching lest he should take more than his share. Then he passed
      the bottle to Jean. She stood before them, her hands on her hips, her pail
      at her feet, enjoying the pleasure that she was giving them. Then she went
      on, saying: “Well, bye-bye until next Sunday!”

For a long time they watched her tall form as it receded in the distance,
      blending with the background, and finally disappeared.

They were sorely perplexed by the problem of choosing something to bring
      to the dairy maid. Luc was in favor of bringing her some chitterlings; but
      Jean, who had a sweet tooth, thought that candy would be the best thing.
      He won, and so they went to a grocery to buy two sous'' worth, of red and
      white candies.

Jean was the first one to notice her. “There she is,” he said;
      and Luc answered: “Yes, there she is.”

Then she started to talk of simple things which might interest them; of
      the weather, of the crops, of her masters.

They didn''t dare to offer their candies, which were slowly melting in
      Jean''s pocket. Finally Luc, growing bolder, murmured:

Then Jean, blushing to the tips of his ears, reached in his pocket, and
      drawing out the little paper bag, handed it to her.

She began to eat the little sweet dainties. The two soldiers sat in front
      of her, moved and delighted.

They thought of her all through the week and often spoke of her: The
      following Sunday she sat beside them for a longer time.

The three of them sat there, side by side, their eyes looking far away in
      the distance, their hands clasped over their knees, and they told each
      other little incidents and little details of the villages where they were
      born, while the cow, waiting to be milked, stretched her heavy head toward
      the girl and mooed.

Soon the girl consented to eat with them and to take a sip of wine. Often
      she brought them plums pocket for plums were now ripe. Her presence
      enlivened the little Breton soldiers, who chattered away like two birds.

One Tuesday something unusual happened to Luc Le Ganidec; he asked for
      leave and did not return until ten o''clock at night.

The following Friday, Luc borrowed ten sons from one of his friends, and
      once more asked and obtained leave for several hours.

When he started out with Jean on Sunday he seemed queer, disturbed,
      changed. Kerderen did not understand; he vaguely suspected something, but
      he could not guess what it might be.

Soon the girl appeared. They watched her approach as they always did. When
      she was near, Luc arose and went towards her. She placed her pail on the
      ground and kissed him. She kissed him passionately, throwing her arms
      around his neck, without paying attention to Jean, without even noticing
      that he was there.

Poor Jean was dazed, so dazed that he could not understand. His mind was
      upset and his heart broken, without his even realizing why.

Jean was not looking at them. He understood now why his friend had gone
      out twice during the week. He felt the pain and the sting which treachery
      and deceit leave in their wake.

Jean followed them with his eyes. He saw them disappear side by side, the
      red trousers of his friend making a scarlet spot against the white road.
      It was Luc who sank the stake to which the cow was tethered. The girl
      stooped down to milk the cow, while he absent-mindedly stroked the
      animal''s glossy neck. Then they left the pail in the grass and disappeared
      in the woods.

Jean could no longer see anything but the wall of leaves through which
      they had passed. He was unmanned so that he did not have strength to
      stand. He stayed there, motionless, bewildered and grieving-simple,
      passionate grief. He wanted to weep, to run away, to hide somewhere, never
      to see anyone again.

Then he saw them coming back again. They were walking slowly, hand in
      hand, as village lovers do. Luc was carrying the pail.

After kissing him again, the girl went on, nodding carelessly to Jean. She
      did not offer him any milk that day.

The two little soldiers sat side by side, motionless as always, silent and
      quiet, their calm faces in no way betraying the trouble in their hearts.
      The sun shone down on them. From time to time they could hear the
      plaintive lowing of the cow. At the usual time they arose to return.

Luc was whittling a stick. Jean carried the empty bottle. He left it at
      the wine merchant''s in Bezons. Then they stopped on the bridge, as they
      did every Sunday, and watched the water flowing by.

Jean leaned over the railing, farther and farther, as though he had seen
      something in the stream which hypnotized him. Luc said to him:

He had hardly said the last word when Jean''s head carried away the rest of
      his body, and the little blue and red soldier fell like a shot and
      disappeared in the water.

Luc, paralyzed with horror, tried vainly to shout for help. In the
      distance he saw something move; then his friend''s head bobbed up out of
      the water only to disappear again.

Farther down he again noticed a hand, just one hand, which appeared and
      again went out of sight. That was all.

Luc ran back to the barracks, crazed, and with eyes and voice full of
      tears, he related the accident: “He leaned—he—he was
      leaning —so far over—that his head carried him away—and—he—fell
      —he fell——”

For a month the hot sun has been parching the fields. Nature is expanding
      beneath its rays; the fields are green as far as the eye can see. The big
      azure dome of the sky is unclouded. The farms of Normandy, scattered over
      the plains and surrounded by a belt of tall beeches, look, from a
      distance, like little woods. On closer view, after lowering the worm-eaten
      wooden bars, you imagine yourself in an immense garden, for all the
      ancient apple-trees, as gnarled as the peasants themselves, are in bloom.
      The sweet scent of their blossoms mingles with the heavy smell of the
      earth and the penetrating odor of the stables. It is noon. The family is
      eating under the shade of a pear tree planted in front of the door;
      father, mother, the four children, and the help—two women and three
      men are all there. All are silent. The soup is eaten and then a dish of
      potatoes fried with bacon is brought on.

From time to time one of the women gets up and takes a pitcher down to the
      cellar to fetch more cider.

The man, a big fellow about forty years old, is watching a grape vine,
      still bare, which is winding and twisting like a snake along the side of
      the house.

At last he says: “Father''s vine is budding early this year. Perhaps
      we may get something from it.”

It was during the war of 1870. The Prussians were occupying the whole
      country. General Faidherbe, with the Northern Division of the army, was
      opposing them.

The Prussians had established their headquarters at this farm. The old
      farmer to whom it belonged, Father Pierre Milon, had received and
      quartered them to the best of his ability.

For a month the German vanguard had been in this village. The French
      remained motionless, ten leagues away; and yet, every night, some of the
      Uhlans disappeared.

Of all the isolated scouts, of all those who were sent to the outposts, in
      groups of not more than three, not one ever returned.

They were picked up the next morning in a field or in a ditch. Even their
      horses were found along the roads with their throats cut.

The country was terrorized. Farmers were shot on suspicion, women were
      imprisoned; children were frightened in order to try and obtain
      information. Nothing could be ascertained.

But, one morning, Father Milon was found stretched out in the barn, with a
      sword gash across his face.

Two Uhlans were found dead about a mile and a half from the farm. One of
      them was still holding his bloody sword in his hand. He had fought, tried
      to defend himself. A court-martial was immediately held in the open air,
      in front of the farm. The old man was brought before it.

He was sixty-eight years old, small, thin, bent, with two big hands
      resembling the claws of a crab. His colorless hair was sparse and thin,
      like the down of a young duck, allowing patches of his scalp to be seen.
      The brown and wrinkled skin of his neck showed big veins which disappeared
      behind his jaws and came out again at the temples. He had the reputation
      of being miserly and hard to deal with.

They stood him up between four soldiers, in front of the kitchen table,
      which had been dragged outside. Five officers and the colonel seated
      themselves opposite him.

“Father Milon, since we have been here we have only had praise for
      you. You have always been obliging and even attentive to us. But to-day a
      terrible accusation is hanging over you, and you must clear the matter up.
      How did you receive that wound on your face?”

“Your silence accuses you, Father Milon. But I want you to answer
      me! Do you understand? Do you know who killed the two Uhlans who were
      found this morning near Calvaire?”

The colonel, surprised, was silent for a minute, looking straight at the
      prisoner. Father Milon stood impassive, with the stupid look of the
      peasant, his eyes lowered as though he were talking to the priest. Just
      one thing betrayed an uneasy mind; he was continually swallowing his
      saliva, with a visible effort, as though his throat were terribly
      contracted.

The man''s family, his son Jean, his daughter-in-law and his two
      grandchildren were standing a few feet behind him, bewildered and
      affrighted.

“Do you also know who killed all the scouts who have been found
      dead, for a month, throughout the country, every morning?”

This time the man seemed moved; the necessity for talking any length of
      time annoyed him visibly. He stammered:

“I warn you that you will have to tell me everything. You might as
      well make up your mind right away. How did you begin?”

The man cast a troubled look toward his family, standing close behind him.
      He hesitated a minute longer, and then suddenly made up his mind to obey
      the order.

“I was coming home one night at about ten o''clock, the night after
      you got here. You and your soldiers had taken more than fifty ecus worth
      of forage from me, as well as a cow and two sheep. I said to myself: ''As
      much as they take from you; just so much will you make them pay back.'' And
      then I had other things on my mind which I will tell you. Just then I
      noticed one of your soldiers who was smoking his pipe by the ditch behind
      the barn. I went and got my scythe and crept up slowly behind him, so that
      he couldn''t hear me. And I cut his head off with one single blow, just as
      I would a blade of grass, before he could say ''Booh!'' If you should look
      at the bottom of the pond, you will find him tied up in a potato-sack,
      with a stone fastened to it.

“I got an idea. I took all his clothes, from his boots to his cap,
      and hid them away in the little wood behind the yard.”

The old man stopped. The officers remained speechless, looking at each
      other. The questioning began again, and this is what they learned.

Once this murder committed, the man had lived with this one thought:
      “Kill the Prussians!” He hated them with the blind, fierce
      hate of the greedy yet patriotic peasant. He had his idea, as he said. He
      waited several days.

He was allowed to go and come as he pleased, because he had shown himself
      so humble, submissive and obliging to the invaders. Each night he saw the
      outposts leave. One night he followed them, having heard the name of the
      village to which the men were going, and having learned the few words of
      German which he needed for his plan through associating with the soldiers.

He left through the back yard, slipped into the woods, found the dead
      man''s clothes and put them on. Then he began to crawl through the fields,
      following along the hedges in order to keep out of sight, listening to the
      slightest noises, as wary as a poacher.

As soon as he thought the time ripe, he approached the road and hid behind
      a bush. He waited for a while. Finally, toward midnight, he heard the
      sound of a galloping horse. The man put his ear to the ground in order to
      make sure that only one horseman was approaching, then he got ready.

An Uhlan came galloping along, carrying dispatches. As he went, he was
      all eyes and ears. When he was only a few feet away, Father Milon dragged
      himself across the road, moaning: “Hilfe! Hilfe!” ( Help!
      Help!) The horseman stopped, and recognizing a German, he thought he was
      wounded and dismounted, coming nearer without any suspicion, and just as
      he was leaning over the unknown man, he received, in the pit of his
      stomach, a heavy thrust from the long curved blade of the sabre. He
      dropped without suffering pain, quivering only in the final throes. Then
      the farmer, radiant with the silent joy of an old peasant, got up again,
      and, for his own pleasure, cut the dead man''s throat. He then dragged the
      body to the ditch and threw it in.

The horse quietly awaited its master. Father Milon mounted him and started
      galloping across the plains.

About an hour later he noticed two more Uhlans who were returning home,
      side by side. He rode straight for them, once more crying “Hilfe!
      Hilfe!”

The Prussians, recognizing the uniform, let him approach without distrust.
      The old man passed between them like a cannon-ball, felling them both, one
      with his sabre and the other with a revolver.

Then he killed the horses, German horses! After that he quickly returned
      to the woods and hid one of the horses. He left his uniform there and
      again put on his old clothes; then going back into bed, he slept until
      morning.

For four days he did not go out, waiting for the inquest to be terminated;
      but on the fifth day he went out again and killed two more soldiers by the
      same stratagem. From that time on he did not stop. Each night he wandered
      about in search of adventure, killing Prussians, sometimes here and
      sometimes there, galloping through deserted fields, in the moonlight, a
      lost Uhlan, a hunter of men. Then, his task accomplished, leaving behind
      him the bodies lying along the roads, the old farmer would return and hide
      his horse and uniform.

He went, toward noon, to carry oats and water quietly to his mount, and he
      fed it well as he required from it a great amount of work.

But one of those whom he had attacked the night before, in defending
      himself slashed the old peasant across the face with his sabre.

However, he had killed them both. He had come back and hidden the horse
      and put on his ordinary clothes again; but as he reached home he began to
      feel faint, and had dragged himself as far as the stable, being unable to
      reach the house.

When he had finished his tale, he suddenly lifted up his head and looked
      proudly at the Prussian officers.

“Yes, I served my time. And then, you had killed my father, who was
      a soldier of the first Emperor. And last month you killed my youngest son,
      Francois, near Evreux. I owed you one for that; I paid. We are quits.”

“Eight for my father, eight for the boy—we are quits. I did
      not seek any quarrel with you. I don''t know you. I don''t even know where
      you come from. And here you are, ordering me about in my home as though it
      were your own. I took my revenge upon the others. I''m not sorry.”

And, straightening up his bent back, the old man folded his arms in the
      attitude of a modest hero.

The Prussians talked in a low tone for a long time. One of them, a
      captain, who had also lost his son the previous month, was defending the
      poor wretch. Then the colonel arose and, approaching Father Milon, said in
      a low voice:

But the man was not listening, and, his eyes fixed on the hated officer,
      while the wind played with the downy hair on his head, he distorted his
      slashed face, giving it a truly terrible expression, and, swelling out his
      chest, he spat, as hard as he could, right in the Prussian''s face.

In less than a minute the old man, still impassive, was pushed up against
      the wall and shot, looking smilingly the while toward Jean, his eldest
      son, his daughter-in-law and his two grandchildren, who witnessed this
      scene in dumb terror.

Paris had just heard of the disaster at Sedan. A republic had been
      declared. All France was wavering on the brink of this madness which
      lasted until after the Commune. From one end of the country to the other
      everybody was playing soldier.

Cap-makers became colonels, fulfilling the duties of generals; revolvers
      and swords were displayed around big, peaceful stomachs wrapped in flaming
      red belts; little tradesmen became warriors commanding battalions of
      brawling volunteers, and swearing like pirates in order to give themselves
      some prestige.

The sole fact of handling firearms crazed these people, who up to that
      time had only handled scales, and made them, without any reason, dangerous
      to all. Innocent people were shot to prove that they knew how to kill; in
      forests which had never seen a Prussian, stray dogs, grazing cows and
      browsing horses were killed.

Each one thought himself called upon to play a great part in military
      affairs. The cafes of the smallest villages, full of uniformed tradesmen,
      looked like barracks or hospitals.

The town of Canneville was still in ignorance of the maddening news from
      the army and the capital; nevertheless, great excitement had prevailed for
      the last month, the opposing parties finding themselves face to face.

The mayor, Viscount de Varnetot, a thin, little old man, a conservative,
      who had recently, from ambition, gone over to the Empire, had seen a
      determined opponent arise in Dr. Massarel, a big, full-blooded man, leader
      of the Republican party of the neighborhood, a high official in the local
      masonic lodge, president of the Agricultural Society and of the firemen''s
      banquet and the organizer of the rural militia which was to save the
      country.

In two weeks, he had managed to gather together sixty-three volunteers,
      fathers of families, prudent farmers and town merchants, and every morning
      he would drill them in the square in front of the town-hall.

When, perchance, the mayor would come to the municipal building, Commander
      Massarel, girt with pistols, would pass proudly in front of his troop, his
      sword in his hand, and make all of them cry: “Long live the
      Fatherland!” And it had been noticed that this cry excited the
      little viscount, who probably saw in it a menace, a threat, as well as the
      odious memory of the great Revolution.

On the morning of the fifth of September, the doctor, in full uniform, his
      revolver on the table, was giving a consultation to an old couple, a
      farmer who had been suffering from varicose veins for the last seven years
      and had waited until his wife had them also, before he would consult the
      doctor, when the postman brought in the paper.

M. Massarel opened it, grew pale, suddenly rose, and lifting his hands to
      heaven in a gesture of exaltation, began to shout at the top of his voice
      before the two frightened country folks:

And as the peasant resumed: “It started with the ants, which began
      to run up and down my legs—-” Dr. Massarel exclaimed:

“Shut up! I haven''t got time to bother with your nonsense. The
      Republic has been proclaimed, the emperor has been taken prisoner, France
      is saved! Long live the Republic!”

The servant, affrighted, hastened in; he was trying to talk so rapidly,
      that he could only stammer:

“My boots, my sword, my cartridge-box and the Spanish dagger which
      is on my night-table! Hasten!”

As the persistent peasant, taking advantage of a moment''s silence,
      continued, “I seemed to get big lumps which hurt me when I walk,”
      the physician, exasperated, roared:

As he equipped himself from head to foot, he gave a series of important
      orders to his servant:

“Run over to Lieutenant Picart and to Second Lieutenant Pommel, and
      tell them that I am expecting them here immediately. Also send me
      Torchebeuf with his drum. Quick! quick!”

When Celeste had gone out, he sat down and thought over the situation and
      the difficulties which he would have to surmount.

The three men arrived together in their working clothes. The commandant,
      who expected to see them in uniform, felt a little shocked.

“Don''t you people know anything? The emperor has been taken
      prisoner, the Republic has been proclaimed. We must act. My position is
      delicate, I might even say dangerous.”

“We must act and not hesitate; minutes count as hours in times like
      these. All depends on the promptness of our decision. You, Picart, go to
      the cure and order him to ring the alarm-bell, in order to get together
      the people, to whom I am going to announce the news. You, Torchebeuf beat
      the tattoo throughout the whole neighborhood as far as the hamlets of
      Gerisaie and Salmare, in order to assemble the militia in the public
      square. You, Pommel, get your uniform on quickly, just the coat and cap.
      We are going to the town-hall to demand Monsieur de Varnetot to surrender
      his powers to me. Do you understand?”

“Now carry out those orders quickly. I will go over to your house
      with you, Pommel, since we shall act together.”

Five minutes later, the commandant and his subordinates, armed to the
      teeth, appeared on the square, just as the little Viscount de Varnetot,
      his legs encased in gaiters as for a hunting party, his gun on his
      shoulder, was coming down the other street at double-quick time, followed
      by his three green-coated guards, their swords at their sides and their
      guns swung over their shoulders.

While the doctor stopped, bewildered, the four men entered the town-hall
      and closed the door behind them.

“They have outstripped us,” muttered the physician, “we
      must now wait for reenforcements. There is nothing to do for the present.”

“The priest refuses to obey,” he said. “He has even
      locked himself in the church with the sexton and beadle.”

On the other side of the square, opposite the white, tightly closed
      town-hall, stood the church, silent and dark, with its massive oak door
      studded with iron.

But just as the perplexed inhabitants were sticking their heads out of the
      windows or coming out on their doorsteps, the drum suddenly began to be
      heard, and Torchebeuf appeared, furiously beating the tattoo. He crossed
      the square running, and disappeared along the road leading to the fields.

The commandant drew his sword, and advanced alone to half way between the
      two buildings behind which the enemy had intrenched itself, and, waving
      his sword over his head, he roared with all his might:

The butcher, the baker and the druggist, much disturbed, were anxiously
      pulling down their shades and closing their shops. The grocer alone kept
      open.

However, the militia were arriving by degrees, each man in a different
      uniform, but all wearing a black cap with gold braid, the cap being the
      principal part of the outfit. They were armed with old rusty guns, the old
      guns which had hung for thirty years on the kitchen wall; and they looked
      a good deal like an army of tramps.

When he had about thirty men about him, the commandant, in a few words,
      outlined the situation to them. Then, turning to his staff: “Let us
      act,” he said.

“Lieutenant Picart, you will advance under the windows of this
      town-hall and summon Monsieur de Varnetot, in the name of the Republic, to
      hand the keys over to me.”

“You''re smart, you are. I don''t care to get killed, thank you. Those
      people in there shoot straight, don''t you forget it. Do your errands
      yourself.”

And, leaving his sword and his revolver in the hands of a soldier, he
      advanced slowly, his eye fastened on the windows, expecting any minute to
      see a gun trained on him.

When he was within a few feet of the building, the doors at both ends,
      leading into the two schools, opened and a flood of children ran out, boys
      from one side, girls from the ether, and began to play around the doctor,
      in the big empty square, screeching and screaming, and making so much
      noise that he could not make himself heard.

“Monsieur, you know that great events have just taken place which
      have changed the entire aspect of the government. The one which you
      represented no longer exists. The one which I represent is taking control.
      Under these painful, but decisive circumstances, I come, in the name of
      the new Republic, to ask you to turn over to me the office which you held
      under the former government.”

“Doctor, I am the mayor of Canneville, duly appointed, and I shall
      remain mayor of Canneville until I have been dismissed by a decree from my
      superiors. As mayor, I am in my place in the townhall, and here I stay.
      Anyhow, just try to get me out.”

The commandant returned to his troop. But before giving any information,
      eyeing Lieutenant Picart from head to foot, he exclaimed:

“You''re a great one, you are! You''re a fine specimen of manhood!
      You''re a disgrace to the army! I degrade you.”

Then the doctor hesitated. What could he do? Attack? But would his men
      obey orders? And then, did he have the right to do so?

An idea struck him. He ran to the telegraph office, opposite the
      town-hall, and sent off three telegrams:

He explained the situation, pointed out the danger which the town would
      run if it should remain in the hands of the royalist mayor; offered his
      faithful services, asked for orders and signed, putting all his titles
      after his name.

Then he returned to his battalion, and, drawing ten francs from his
      pocket, he cried: “Here, my friends, go eat and drink; only leave me
      a detachment of ten men to guard against anybody''s leaving the town-hall.”

But ex-Lieutenant Picart, who had been talking with the watchmaker, heard
      him; he began to laugh, and exclaimed: “By Jove, if they come out,
      it''ll give you a chance to get in. Otherwise I can see you standing out
      there for the rest of your life!”

In the afternoon, he disposed his men about the town as though they were
      in immediate danger of an ambush.

Several times he passed in front of the town-hall and of the church
      without noticing anything suspicious; the two buildings looked as though
      empty.

Everybody was talking about the affair. If the emperor were a prisoner,
      there must have been some kind of treason. They did not know exactly which
      of the republics had returned to power.

Toward nine o''clock, the doctor, alone, noiselessly approached the
      entrance of the public building, persuaded that the enemy must have gone
      to bed; and, as he was preparing to batter down the door with a pick-axe,
      the deep voice of a sentry suddenly called:

Armed militia occupied the square. All the citizens had gathered around
      this troop awaiting developments. Even neighboring villagers had come to
      look on.

Then the doctor, seeing that his reputation was at stake, resolved to put
      an end to the matter in one way or another; and he was about to take some
      measures, undoubtedly energetic ones, when the door of the telegraph
      station opened and the little servant of the postmistress appeared,
      holding in her hands two papers.

First she went to the commandant and gave him one of the despatches; then
      she crossed the empty square, confused at seeing the eyes of everyone on
      her, and lowering her head and running along with little quick steps, she
      went and knocked softly at the door of the barricaded house, as though
      ignorant of the fact that those behind it were armed.

The door opened wide enough to let a man''s hand reach out and receive the
      message; and the young girl returned blushing, ready to cry at being thus
      stared at by the whole countryside.

He was-triumphant; his heart was throbbing with joy and his hands were
      trembling; but Picart, his former subordinate, cried to him from a
      neighboring group:

“That''s all right; but supposing the others don''t come out, what
      good is the telegram going to do you?”

M. Massarel grew pale. He had not thought of that; if the others did not
      come out, he would now have to take some decisive step. It was not only
      his right, but his duty.

The door remained closed. What could he do? The crowd was growing and
      closing around the militia. They were laughing.

One thought especially tortured the doctor. If he attacked, he would have
      to march at the head of his men; and as, with him dead, all strife would
      cease, it was at him and him only that M. de Varnetot and his three guards
      would aim. And they were good shots, very good shots, as Picart had just
      said. But an idea struck him and, turning to Pommel, he ordered:

He would make a flag of truce, a white flag, at the sight of which the
      royalist heart of the mayor would perhaps rejoice.

Pommel returned with the cloth and a broom-stick. With some twine they
      completed the flag, and M. Massarel, grasping it in both hands and holding
      it in front of him, again advanced in the direction of the town-hall. When
      he was opposite the door, he once more called: “Monsieur de
      Varnetot!” The door suddenly opened and M. de Varnetot and his three
      guards appeared on the threshold.

Instinctively the doctor stepped back; then he bowed courteously to his
      enemy, and, choking with emotion, he announced: “I have come,
      monsieur, to make you acquainted with the orders which I have received.”

The nobleman, without returning the bow, answered: “I resign,
      monsieur, but understand that it is neither through fear of, nor obedience
      to, the odious government which has usurped the power.” And,
      emphasizing every word, he declared: “I do not wish to appear, for a
      single day, to serve the Republic. That''s all.”

Massarel, stunned, answered nothing; and M. de Varnetot, walking quickly,
      disappeared around the corner of the square, still followed by his escort.

The doctor, puffed up with pride, returned to the crowd. As soon as he was
      near enough to make himself heard, he cried: “Hurrah! hurrah!
      Victory crowns the Republic everywhere.”

The motionless villagers were looking at him without any signs of triumph
      shining in their eyes.

He looked at them, indignant at their indifference, thinking of what he
      could say or do in order to make an impression to electrify this calm
      peasantry, to fulfill his mission as a leader.

He had an inspiration and, turning to Pommel, he ordered: “Lieutenant,
      go get me the bust of the ex-emperor which is in the meeting room of the
      municipal council, and bring it here with a chair.”

The man presently reappeared, carrying on his right shoulder the plaster
      Bonaparte, and holding in his left hand a cane-seated chair.

M. Massarel went towards him, took the chair, placed the white bust on it,
      then stepping back a few steps, he addressed it in a loud voice:

“Tyrant, tyrant, you have fallen down in the mud. The dying
      fatherland was in its death throes under your oppression. Vengeful Destiny
      has struck you. Defeat and shame have pursued you; you fall conquered, a
      prisoner of the Prussians; and from the ruins of your crumbling empire,
      the young and glorious Republic arises, lifting from the ground your
      broken sword——”

He waited for applause. Not a sound greeted his listening ear. The
      peasants, nonplussed, kept silent; and the white, placid, well-groomed
      statue seemed to look at M. Massarel with its plaster smile, ineffaceable
      and sarcastic.

Thus they stood, face to face, Napoleon on his chair, the physician
      standing three feet away. Anger seized the commandant. What could he do to
      move this crowd and definitely to win over public opinion?

He happened to carry his hand to his stomach, and he felt, under his red
      belt, the butt of his revolver.

Not another inspiration, not another word cane to his mind. Then, he drew
      his weapon, stepped back a few steps and shot the former monarch.

The bullet made a little black hole: like a spot, in his forehead. No
      sensation was created. M. Massarel shot a second time and made a second
      hole, then a third time, then, without stopping, he shot off the three
      remaining shots. Napoleon''s forehead was blown away in a white powder, but
      his eyes, nose and pointed mustache remained intact.

Then in exasperation, the doctor kicked the chair over, and placing one
      foot on what remained of the bust in the position of a conqueror, he
      turned to the amazed public and yelled: “Thus may all traitors die!”

As no enthusiasm was, as yet, visible, the spectators appearing to be dumb
      with astonishment, the commandant cried to the militia: “You may go
      home now.” And he himself walked rapidly, almost ran, towards his
      house.

As soon as he appeared, the servant told him that some patients had been
      waiting in his office for over three hours. He hastened in. They were the
      same two peasants as a few days before, who had returned at daybreak,
      obstinate and patient.

Since the beginning of the campaign Lieutenant Lare had taken two cannon
      from the Prussians. His general had said: “Thank you, lieutenant,”
      and had given him the cross of honor.

As he was as cautious as he was brave, wary, inventive, wily and
      resourceful, he was entrusted with a hundred soldiers and he organized a
      company of scouts who saved the army on several occasions during a
      retreat.

But the invading army entered by every frontier like a surging sea. Great
      waves of men arrived one after the other, scattering all around them a
      scum of freebooters. General Carrel''s brigade, separated from its
      division, retreated continually, fighting each day, but remaining almost
      intact, thanks to the vigilance and agility of Lieutenant Lare, who seemed
      to be everywhere at the same moment, baffling all the enemy''s cunning,
      frustrating their plans, misleading their Uhlans and killing their
      vanguards.

“Lieutenant,” said he, “here is a dispatch from General
      de Lacere, who will be destroyed if we do not go to his aid by sunrise
      to-morrow. He is at Blainville, eight leagues from here. You will start at
      nightfall with three hundred men, whom you will echelon along the road. I
      will follow you two hours later. Study the road carefully; I fear we may
      meet a division of the enemy.”

It had been freezing hard for a week. At two o''clock it began to snow, and
      by night the ground was covered and heavy white swirls concealed objects
      hard by.

Two men walked alone as scouts about three yards ahead. Then came a
      platoon of ten men commanded by the lieutenant himself. The rest followed
      them in two long columns. To the right and left of the little band, at a
      distance of about three hundred feet on either side, some soldiers marched
      in pairs.

The snow, which was still falling, covered them with a white powder in the
      darkness, and as it did not melt on their uniforms, they were hardly
      distinguishable in the night amid the dead whiteness of the landscape.

From time to time they halted. One heard nothing but that indescribable,
      nameless flutter of falling snow—a sensation rather than a sound, a
      vague, ominous murmur. A command was given in a low tone and when the
      troop resumed its march it left in its wake a sort of white phantom
      standing in the snow. It gradually grew fainter and finally disappeared.
      It was the echelons who were to lead the army.

“Turn to the right,” said the lieutenant; “it is the
      Ronfi wood; the chateau is more to the left.”

Presently the command “Halt” was passed along. The detachment
      stopped and waited for the lieutenant, who, accompanied by only ten men,
      had undertaken a reconnoitering expedition to the chateau.

They advanced, creeping under the trees. Suddenly they all remained
      motionless. Around them was a dead silence. Then, quite near them, a
      little clear, musical young voice was heard amid the stillness of the
      wood.

All at once a woman''s shrill cry was heard through the darkness. Two
      prisoners were brought back, an old man and a young girl. The lieutenant
      questioned them, still in a low tone:

“Twelve Uhlans passed by this evening. They shot three keepers and
      hanged the gardener. I was alarmed on account of the little one.”

They rejoined the column and resumed their march across country. The old
      man walked in silence beside the lieutenant, his daughter walking at his
      side. All at once she stopped.

And she sat down. She was shaking with cold and seemed about to lose
      consciousness. Her father wanted to carry her, but he was too old and too
      weak.

“Lieutenant,” said he, sobbing, “we shall only impede
      your march. France before all. Leave us here.”

The officer had given a command. Some men had started off. They came back
      with branches they had cut, and in a minute a litter was ready. The whole
      detachment had joined them by this time.

Two hundred capes were taken off. The young girl was wrapped up in these
      warm soldiers'' capes, gently laid in the litter, and then four'' hardy
      shoulders lifted her up, and like an Eastern queen borne by her slaves she
      was placed in the center of the detachment of soldiers, who resumed their
      march with more energy, more courage, more cheerfulness, animated by the
      presence of a woman, that sovereign inspiration that has stirred the old
      French blood to so many deeds of valor.

At the end of an hour they halted again and every one lay down in the
      snow. Over yonder on the level country a big, dark shadow was moving. It
      looked like some weird monster stretching itself out like a serpent, then
      suddenly coiling itself into a mass, darting forth again, then back, and
      then forward again without ceasing. Some whispered orders were passed
      around among the soldiers, and an occasional little, dry, metallic click
      was heard. The moving object suddenly came nearer, and twelve Uhlans were
      seen approaching at a gallop, one behind the other, having lost their way
      in the darkness. A brilliant flash suddenly revealed to them two hundred
      men lying on the ground before them. A rapid fire was heard, which died
      away in the snowy silence, and all the twelve fell to the ground, their
      horses with them.

They made another halt; some conferences took place. It had stopped
      snowing. A cold wind was driving the clouds, and innumerable stars were
      sparkling in the sky behind them, gradually paling in the rosy light of
      dawn.

A staff officer came forward to receive the detachment. But when he asked
      who was being carried in the litter, the form stirred; two little hands
      moved aside the big blue army capes and, rosy as the dawn, with two eyes
      that were brighter than the stars that had just faded from sight, and a
      smile as radiant as the morn, a dainty face appeared.

The soldiers, wild with delight, clapped their hands and bore the young
      girl in triumph into the midst of the camp, that was just getting to arms.
      Presently General Carrel arrived on the scene. At nine o''clock the
      Prussians made an attack. They beat a retreat at noon.

That evening, as Lieutenant Lare, overcome by fatigue, was sleeping on a
      bundle of straw, he was sent for by the general. He found the commanding
      officer in his tent, chatting with the old man whom they had come across
      during the night. As soon as he entered the tent the general took his
      hand, and addressing the stranger, said:

“My dear comte, this is the young man of whom you were telling me
      just now; he is one of my best officers.”

“My dear lieutenant, you have saved my daughter''s life. I have only
      one way of thanking you. You may come in a few months to tell me—if
      you like her.”

One year later, on the very same day, Captain Lare and Miss
      Louise-Hortense-Genevieve de Ronfi-Quedissac were married in the church of
      St. Thomas Aquinas.

She brought a dowry of six thousand francs, and was said to be the
      prettiest bride that had been seen that year.

The shadows of a balmy night were slowly falling. The women remained in
      the drawing-room of the villa. The men, seated, or astride of garden
      chairs, were smoking outside the door of the house, around a table laden
      with cups and liqueur glasses.

Their lighted cigars shone like eyes in the darkness, which was gradually
      becoming more dense. They had been talking about a frightful accident
      which had occurred the night before—two men and three women drowned
      in the river before the eyes of the guests.

“Horrible, that well-known word, means much more than terrible. A
      frightful accident like this affects, upsets, terrifies; it does not
      horrify. In order that we should experience horror, something more is
      needed than emotion, something more than the spectacle of a dreadful
      death; there must be a shuddering sense of mystery, or a sensation of
      abnormal terror, more than natural. A man who dies, even under the most
      tragic circumstances, does not excite horror; a field of battle is not
      horrible; blood is not horrible; the vilest crimes are rarely horrible.

“It was during the war of 1870. We were retreating toward
      Pont-Audemer, after having passed through Rouen. The army, consisting of
      about twenty thousand men, twenty thousand routed men, disbanded,
      demoralized, exhausted, were going to disband at Havre.

“The earth was covered with snow. The night was falling. They had
      not eaten anything since the day before. They were fleeing rapidly, the
      Prussians not being far off.

“All the Norman country, sombre, dotted with the shadows of the
      trees surrounding the farms, stretched out beneath a black, heavy,
      threatening sky.

“Nothing else could be heard in the wan twilight but the confused
      sound, undefined though rapid, of a marching throng, an endless tramping,
      mingled with the vague clink of tin bowls or swords. The men, bent,
      round-shouldered, dirty, in many cases even in rags, dragged themselves
      along, hurried through the snow, with a long, broken-backed stride.

“The skin of their hands froze to the butt ends of their muskets,
      for it was freezing hard that night. I frequently saw a little soldier
      take off his shoes in order to walk barefoot, as his shoes hurt his weary
      feet; and at every step he left a track of blood. Then, after some time,
      he would sit down in a field for a few minutes'' rest, and he never got up
      again. Every man who sat down was a dead man.

“Should we have left behind us those poor, exhausted soldiers, who
      fondly counted on being able to start afresh as soon as they had somewhat
      refreshed their stiffened legs? But scarcely had they ceased to move, and
      to make their almost frozen blood circulate in their veins, than an
      unconquerable torpor congealed them, nailed them to the ground, closed
      their eyes, and paralyzed in one second this overworked human mechanism.
      And they gradually sank down, their foreheads on their knees, without,
      however, falling over, for their loins and their limbs became as hard and
      immovable as wood, impossible to bend or to stand upright.

“And the rest of us, more robust, kept straggling on, chilled to the
      marrow, advancing by a kind of inertia through the night, through the
      snow, through that cold and deadly country, crushed by pain, by defeat, by
      despair, above all overcome by the abominable sensation of abandonment, of
      the end, of death, of nothingness.

“I saw two gendarmes holding by the arm a curious-looking little
      man, old, beardless, of truly surprising aspect.

“They were looking for an officer, believing that they had caught a
      spy. The word ''spy'' at once spread through the midst of the stragglers,
      and they gathered in a group round the prisoner. A voice exclaimed: ''He
      must be shot!'' And all these soldiers who were falling from utter
      prostration, only holding themselves on their feet by leaning on their
      guns, felt all of a sudden that thrill of furious and bestial anger which
      urges on a mob to massacre.

“I wanted to speak. I was at that time in command of a battalion;
      but they no longer recognized the authority of their commanding officers;
      they would even have shot me.

“One of the gendarmes said: ''He has been following us for the three
      last days. He has been asking information from every one about the
      artillery.''”

“He stammered out some words in some unintelligible dialect. He was,
      indeed, a strange being, with narrow shoulders, a sly look, and such an
      agitated air in my presence that I really no longer doubted that he was a
      spy. He seemed very aged and feeble. He kept looking at me from under his
      eyes with a humble, stupid, crafty air.

“I had not ceased speaking when a terrible shove threw me on my
      back, and in a second I saw the man seized by the furious soldiers, thrown
      down, struck, dragged along the side of the road, and flung against a
      tree. He fell in the snow, nearly dead already.

“And immediately they shot him. The soldiers fired at him, reloaded
      their guns, fired again with the desperate energy of brutes. They fought
      with each other to have a shot at him, filed off in front of the corpse,
      and kept on firing at him, as people at a funeral keep sprinkling holy
      water in front of a coffin.

“And all along the horizon I heard the great noise of this
      panic-stricken army in full flight.

“A panic, the result of these shots fired at this vagabond, had
      filled his very executioners with terror; and, without realizing that they
      were themselves the originators of the scare, they fled and disappeared in
      the darkness.

“I remained alone with the corpse, except for the two gendarmes
      whose duty compelled them to stay with me.

“''He must be searched,'' I said. And I handed them a box of taper
      matches which I had in my pocket. One of the soldiers had another box. I
      was standing between the two.

“The first match went out; we lighted a second. The man continued,
      as he turned out his pockets:

“''A horn-handled pocketknife, check handkerchief, a snuffbox, a bit
      of pack thread, a piece of bread.''

“The second match went out; we lighted a third. The gendarme, after
      having felt the corpse for a long time, said:

“And in order that the two soldiers might help each other in this
      task, I stood between them to hold the lighted match. By the rapid and
      speedily extinguished flame of the match, I saw them take off the garments
      one by one, and expose to view that bleeding bundle of flesh, still warm,
      though lifeless.

“I cannot describe to you the strange and poignant sensation of pain
      that moved my heart. I could not believe it, and I knelt down in the snow
      before this shapeless pulp of flesh to see for myself: it was a woman.

“The two gendarmes, speechless and stunned, waited for me to give my
      opinion on the matter. But I did not know what to think, what theory to
      adopt.

“And I, who had seen some very terrible things in my time, began to
      cry. And I felt, in the presence of this corpse, on that icy cold night,
      in the midst of that gloomy plain; at the sight of this mystery, at the
      sight of this murdered stranger, the meaning of that word ''horror.''

“I had the same sensation last year, while interrogating one of the
      survivors of the Flatters Mission, an Algerian sharpshooter.

“You know the details of that atrocious drama. It is possible,
      however, that you are unacquainted with one of them.

“The colonel travelled through the desert into the Soudan, and
      passed through the immense territory of the Touaregs, who, in that great
      ocean of sand which stretches from the Atlantic to Egypt and from the
      Soudan to Algeria, are a kind of pirates, resembling those who ravaged the
      seas in former days.

“Now, one day we encamped in the middle of the desert, and the Arabs
      declared that, as the spring was still some distance away, they would go
      with all their camels to look for water.

“One man alone warned the colonel that he had been betrayed.
      Flatters did not believe this, and accompanied the convoy with the
      engineers, the doctors, and nearly all his officers.

“The captain of the Arab Intelligence Department at Ouargla, who had
      remained in the camp, took command of the survivors, spahis and
      sharpshooters, and they began to retreat, leaving behind them the baggage
      and provisions, for want of camels to carry them.

“Then they started on their journey through this solitude without
      shade and boundless, beneath the devouring sun, which burned them from
      morning till night.

“One tribe came to tender its submission and brought dates as a
      tribute. The dates were poisoned. Nearly all the Frenchmen died, and,
      among them, the last officer.

“There now only remained a few spahis with their quartermaster,
      Pobeguin, and some native sharpshooters of the Chambaa tribe. They had
      still two camels left. They disappeared one night, along with two, Arabs.

“Then the survivors understood that they would be obliged to eat
      each other, and as soon as they discovered the flight of the two men with
      the two camels, those who remained separated, and proceeded to march, one
      by one, through the soft sand, under the glare of a scorching sun, at a
      distance of more than a gunshot from each other.

“So they went on all day, and when they reached a spring each of
      them came to drink at it in turn, as soon as each solitary marcher had
      moved forward the number of yards arranged upon. And thus they continued
      marching the whole day, raising everywhere they passed, in that level,
      burnt up expanse, those little columns of dust which, from a distance,
      indicate those who are trudging through the desert.

“But one morning one of the travellers suddenly turned round and
      approached the man behind him. And they all stopped to look.

“The man toward whom the famished soldier drew near did not flee,
      but lay flat on the ground, and took aim at the one who was coming toward
      him. When he believed he was within gunshot, he fired. The other was not
      hit, and he continued then to advance, and levelling his gun, in turn, he
      killed his comrade.

“Then from all directions the others rushed to seek their share. And
      he who had killed the fallen man, cutting the corpse into pieces,
      distributed it.

“And they once more placed themselves at fixed distances, these
      irreconcilable allies, preparing for the next murder which would bring
      them together.

“For two days they lived on this human flesh which they divided
      between them. Then, becoming famished again, he who had killed the first
      man began killing afresh. And again, like a butcher, he cut up the corpse
      and offered it to his comrades, keeping only his own portion of it.

“The last Frenchman, Pobeguin, was massacred at the side of a well,
      the very night before the supplies arrived.

I was sitting on the pier of the small port of Obernon, near the village
      of Salis, looking at Antibes, bathed in the setting sun. I had never
      before seen anything so wonderful and so beautiful.

The small town, enclosed by its massive ramparts, built by Monsieur de
      Vauban, extended into the open sea, in the middle of the immense Gulf of
      Nice. The great waves, coming in from the ocean, broke at its feet,
      surrounding it with a wreath of foam; and beyond the ramparts the houses
      climbed up the hill, one after the other, as far as the two towers, which
      rose up into the sky, like the peaks of an ancient helmet. And these two
      towers were outlined against the milky whiteness of the Alps, that
      enormous distant wall of snow which enclosed the entire horizon.

Between the white foam at the foot of the walls and the white snow on the
      sky-line the little city, dazzling against the bluish background of the
      nearest mountain ranges, presented to the rays of the setting sun a
      pyramid of red-roofed houses, whose facades were also white, but so
      different one from another that they seemed to be of all tints.

And the sky above the Alps was itself of a blue that was almost white, as
      if the snow had tinted it; some silvery clouds were floating just over the
      pale summits, and on the other side of the gulf Nice, lying close to the
      water, stretched like a white thread between the sea and the mountain. Two
      great sails, driven by a strong breeze, seemed to skim over the waves. I
      looked upon all this, astounded.

This view was one of those sweet, rare, delightful things that seem to
      permeate you and are unforgettable, like the memory of a great happiness.
      One sees, thinks, suffers, is moved and loves with the eyes. He who can
      feel with the eye experiences the same keen, exquisite and deep pleasure
      in looking at men and things as the man with the delicate and sensitive
      ear, whose soul music overwhelms.

“I have seen Mont Saint-Michel, that monstrous granite jewel, rise
      out of the sand at sunrise.

“I have seen, in the Sahara, Lake Raianechergui, fifty kilometers
      long, shining under a moon as brilliant as our sun and breathing up toward
      it a white cloud, like a mist of milk.

“I have seen, in the Lipari Islands, the weird sulphur crater of the
      Volcanello, a giant flower which smokes and burns, an enormous yellow
      flower, opening out in the midst of the sea, whose stem is a volcano.

“But I have seen nothing more wonderful than Antibes, standing
      against the Alps in the setting sun.

“And I know not how it is that memories of antiquity haunt me;
      verses of Homer come into my mind; this is a city of the ancient East, a
      city of the odyssey; this is Troy, although Troy was very far from the
      sea.”

M. Martini drew the Sarty guide-book out of his pocket and read: “This
      city was originally a colony founded by the Phocians of Marseilles, about
      340 B.C. They gave it the Greek name of Antipolis, meaning counter-city,
      city opposite another, because it is in fact opposite to Nice, another
      colony from Marseilles.

“After the Gauls were conquered, the Romans turned Antibes into a
      municipal city, its inhabitants receiving the rights of Roman citizenship.

“I don''t care what she was. I tell you that I see down there a city
      of the Odyssey. The coast of Asia and the coast of Europe resemble each
      other in their shores, and there is no city on the other coast of the
      Mediterranean which awakens in me the memories of the heroic age as this
      one does.”

A footstep caused me to turn my head; a woman, a large, dark woman, was
      walking along the road which skirts the sea in going to the cape.

“That is Madame Parisse, you know,” muttered Monsieur Martini,
      dwelling on the final syllable.

No, I did not know, but that name, mentioned carelessly, that name of the
      Trojan shepherd, confirmed me in my dream.

I assured him that I did not know it, and I looked after the woman, who
      passed by without seeing us, dreaming, walking with steady and slow step,
      as doubtless the ladies of old walked.

Mademoiselle Combelombe was married, one year before the war of 1870, to
      Monsieur Parisse, a government official. She was then a handsome young
      girl, as slender and lively as she has now become stout and sad.

Unwillingly she had accepted Monsieur Parisse, one of those little fat men
      with short legs, who trip along, with trousers that are always too large.

After the war Antibes was garrisoned by a single battalion commanded by
      Monsieur Jean de Carmelin, a young officer decorated during the war, and
      who had just received his four stripes.

As he found life exceedingly tedious in this fortress this stuffy
      mole-hole enclosed by its enormous double walls, he often strolled out to
      the cape, a kind of park or pine wood shaken by all the winds from the
      sea.

There he met Madame Parisse, who also came out in the summer evenings to
      get the fresh air under the trees. How did they come to love each other?
      Who knows? They met, they looked at each other, and when out of sight they
      doubtless thought of each other. The image of the young woman with the
      brown eyes, the black hair, the pale skin, this fresh, handsome
      Southerner, who displayed her teeth in smiling, floated before the eyes of
      the officer as he continued his promenade, chewing his cigar instead of
      smoking it; and the image of the commanding officer, in his close-fitting
      coat, covered with gold lace, and his red trousers, and a little blond
      mustache, would pass before the eyes of Madame Parisse, when her husband,
      half shaven and ill-clad, short-legged and big-bellied, came home to
      supper in the evening.

As they met so often, they perhaps smiled at the next meeting; then,
      seeing each other again and again, they felt as if they knew each other.
      He certainly bowed to her. And she, surprised, bowed in return, but very,
      very slightly, just enough not to appear impolite. But after two weeks she
      returned his salutation from a distance, even before they were side by
      side.

He spoke to her. Of what? Doubtless of the setting sun. They admired it
      together, looking for it in each other''s eyes more often than on the
      horizon. And every evening for two weeks this was the commonplace and
      persistent pretext for a few minutes'' chat.

Then they ventured to take a few steps together, talking of anything that
      came into their minds, but their eyes were already saying to each other a
      thousand more intimate things, those secret, charming things that are
      reflected in the gentle emotion of the glance, and that cause the heart to
      beat, for they are a better revelation of the soul than the spoken ward.

And then he would take her hand, murmuring those words which the woman
      divines, without seeming to hear them.

And it was agreed between them that they would love each other without
      evidencing it by anything sensual or brutal.

She would have remained indefinitely at this stage of intimacy, but he
      wanted more. And every day he urged her more hotly to give in to his
      ardent desire.

But one evening she said to him casually: “My husband has just gone
      to Marseilles. He will be away four days.”

Jean de Carmelin threw himself at her feet, imploring her to open her door
      to him that very night at eleven o''clock. But she would not listen to him,
      and went home, appearing to be annoyed.

The commandant was in a bad humor all the evening, and the next morning at
      dawn he went out on the ramparts in a rage, going from one exercise field
      to the other, dealing out punishment to the officers and men as one might
      fling stones into a crowd,

On going in to breakfast he found an envelope under his napkin with these
      four words: “To-night at ten.” And he gave one hundred sous
      without any reason to the waiter.

The day seemed endless to him. He passed part of it in curling his hair
      and perfuming himself.

As he was sitting down to the dinner-table another envelope was handed to
      him, and in it he found the following telegram:

The commandant let loose such a vehement oath that the waiter dropped the
      soup-tureen on the floor.

What should he do? He certainly wanted her, that very, evening at whatever
      cost; and he would have her. He would resort to any means, even to
      arresting and imprisoning the husband. Then a mad thought struck him.
      Calling for paper, he wrote the following note:

Toward eight o''clock he sent for Captain Gribois, the second in command,
      and said, rolling between his fingers the crumpled telegram of Monsieur
      Parisse:

“Captain, I have just received a telegram of a very singular nature,
      which it is impossible for me to communicate to you. You will immediately
      have all the gates of the city closed and guarded, so that no one, mind
      me, no one, will either enter or leave before six in the morning. You will
      also have men patrol the streets, who will compel the inhabitants to
      retire to their houses at nine o''clock. Any one found outside beyond that
      time will be conducted to his home ''manu militari''. If your men meet me
      this night they will at once go out of my way, appearing not to know me.
      You understand me?”

The train from Marseilles arrived at the station at nine o''clock sharp,
      left two passengers on the platform and went on toward Nice.

One of them, tall and thin, was Monsieur Saribe, the oil merchant, and the
      other, short and fat, was Monsieur Parisse.

But on arriving at the gate of the port the guards crossed their bayonets,
      commanding them to retire.

Frightened, surprised, cowed with astonishment, they retired to
      deliberate; then, after having taken counsel one with the other, they came
      back cautiously to parley, giving their names.

But the soldiers evidently had strict orders, for they threatened to
      shoot; and the two scared travellers ran off, throwing away their valises,
      which impeded their flight.

Making the tour of the ramparts, they presented themselves at the gate on
      the route to Cannes. This likewise was closed and guarded by a menacing
      sentinel. Messrs. Saribe and Parisse, like the prudent men they were,
      desisted from their efforts and went back to the station for shelter,
      since it was not safe to be near the fortifications after sundown.

The station agent, surprised and sleepy, permitted them to stay till
      morning in the waiting-room.

And they sat there side by side, in the dark, on the green velvet sofa,
      too scared to think of sleeping.

At half-past six in the morning they were informed that the gates were
      open and that people could now enter Antibes.

When they passed through the gates of the city, still somewhat anxious,
      the Commandant de Carmelin, with sly glance and mustache curled up, came
      himself to look at them and question them.

Then he bowed to them politely, excusing himself for having caused them a
      bad night. But he had to carry out orders.

The people of Antibes were scared to death. Some spoke of a surprise
      planned by the Italians, others of the landing of the prince imperial and
      others again believed that there was an Orleanist conspiracy. The truth
      was suspected only later, when it became known that the battalion of the
      commandant had been sent away, to a distance and that Monsieur de Carmelin
      had been severely punished.

Monsieur Martini had finished his story. Madame Parisse returned, her
      promenade being ended. She passed gravely near me, with her eyes fixed on
      the Alps, whose summits now gleamed rosy in the last rays of the setting
      sun.

I longed to speak to her, this poor, sad woman, who would ever be thinking
      of that night of love, now long past, and of the bold man who for the sake
      of a kiss from her had dared to put a city into a state of siege and to
      compromise his whole future.

And to-day he had probably forgotten her, if he did not relate this
      audacious, comical and tender farce to his comrades over their cups.

Had she seen him again? Did she still love him? And I thought: Here is an
      instance of modern love, grotesque and yet heroic. The Homer who should
      sing of this new Helen and the adventure of her Menelaus must be gifted
      with the soul of a Paul de Kock. And yet the hero of this deserted woman
      was brave, daring, handsome, strong as Achilles and more cunning than
      Ulysses.

Major Graf Von Farlsberg, the Prussian commandant, was reading his
      newspaper as he lay back in a great easy-chair, with his booted feet on
      the beautiful marble mantelpiece where his spurs had made two holes, which
      had grown deeper every day during the three months that he had been in the
      chateau of Uville.

A cup of coffee was smoking on a small inlaid table, which was stained
      with liqueur, burned by cigars, notched by the penknife of the victorious
      officer, who occasionally would stop while sharpening a pencil, to jot
      down figures, or to make a drawing on it, just as it took his fancy.

When he had read his letters and the German newspapers, which his orderly
      had brought him, he got up, and after throwing three or four enormous
      pieces of green wood on the fire, for these gentlemen were gradually
      cutting down the park in order to keep themselves warm, he went to the
      window. The rain was descending in torrents, a regular Normandy rain,
      which looked as if it were being poured out by some furious person, a
      slanting rain, opaque as a curtain, which formed a kind of wall with
      diagonal stripes, and which deluged everything, a rain such as one
      frequently experiences in the neighborhood of Rouen, which is the
      watering-pot of France.

For a long time the officer looked at the sodden turf and at the swollen
      Andelle beyond it, which was overflowing its banks; he was drumming a
      waltz with his fingers on the window-panes, when a noise made him turn
      round. It was his second in command, Captain Baron van Kelweinstein.

The major was a giant, with broad shoulders and a long, fan-like beard,
      which hung down like a curtain to his chest. His whole solemn person
      suggested the idea of a military peacock, a peacock who was carrying his
      tail spread out on his breast. He had cold, gentle blue eyes, and a scar
      from a swordcut, which he had received in the war with Austria; he was
      said to be an honorable man, as well as a brave officer.

The captain, a short, red-faced man, was tightly belted in at the waist,
      his red hair was cropped quite close to his head, and in certain lights he
      almost looked as if he had been rubbed over with phosphorus. He had lost
      two front teeth one night, though he could not quite remember how, and
      this sometimes made him speak unintelligibly, and he had a bald patch on
      top of his head surrounded by a fringe of curly, bright golden hair, which
      made him look like a monk.

The commandant shook hands with him and drank his cup of coffee (the sixth
      that morning), while he listened to his subordinate''s report of what had
      occurred; and then they both went to the window and declared that it was a
      very unpleasant outlook. The major, who was a quiet man, with a wife at
      home, could accommodate himself to everything; but the captain, who led a
      fast life, who was in the habit of frequenting low resorts, and enjoying
      women''s society, was angry at having to be shut up for three months in
      that wretched hole.

There was a knock at the door, and when the commandant said, “Come
      in,” one of the orderlies appeared, and by his mere presence
      announced that breakfast was ready. In the dining-room they met three
      other officers of lower rank—a lieutenant, Otto von Grossling, and
      two sub-lieutenants, Fritz Scheuneberg and Baron von Eyrick, a very short,
      fair-haired man, who was proud and brutal toward men, harsh toward
      prisoners and as explosive as gunpowder.

Since he had been in France his comrades had called him nothing but
      Mademoiselle Fifi. They had given him that nickname on account of his
      dandified style and small waist, which looked as if he wore corsets; of
      his pale face, on which his budding mustache scarcely showed, and on
      account of the habit he had acquired of employing the French expression,
      ''Fi, fi donc'', which he pronounced with a slight whistle when he wished to
      express his sovereign contempt for persons or things.

The dining-room of the chateau was a magnificent long room, whose fine old
      mirrors, that were cracked by pistol bullets, and whose Flemish tapestry,
      which was cut to ribbons, and hanging in rags in places from sword-cuts,
      told too well what Mademoiselle Fifi''s occupation was during his spare
      time.

There were three family portraits on the walls a steel-clad knight, a
      cardinal and a judge, who were all smoking long porcelain pipes, which had
      been inserted into holes in the canvas, while a lady in a long, pointed
      waist proudly exhibited a pair of enormous mustaches, drawn with charcoal.
      The officers ate their breakfast almost in silence in that mutilated room,
      which looked dull in the rain and melancholy in its dilapidated condition,
      although its old oak floor had become as solid as the stone floor of an
      inn.

When they had finished eating and were smoking and drinking, they began,
      as usual, to berate the dull life they were leading. The bottles of brandy
      and of liqueur passed from hand to hand, and all sat back in their chairs
      and took repeated sips from their glasses, scarcely removing from their
      mouths the long, curved stems, which terminated in china bowls, painted in
      a manner to delight a Hottentot.

As soon as their glasses were empty they filled them again, with a gesture
      of resigned weariness, but Mademoiselle Fifi emptied his every minute, and
      a soldier immediately gave him another. They were enveloped in a cloud of
      strong tobacco smoke, and seemed to be sunk in a state of drowsy, stupid
      intoxication, that condition of stupid intoxication of men who have
      nothing to do, when suddenly the baron sat up and said: “Heavens!
      This cannot go on; we must think of something to do.” And on hearing
      this, Lieutenant Otto and Sub-lieutenant Fritz, who preeminently possessed
      the serious, heavy German countenance, said: “What, captain?”

He thought for a few moments and then replied: “What? Why, we must
      get up some entertainment, if the commandant will allow us.” “What
      sort of an entertainment, captain?” the major asked, taking his pipe
      out of his mouth. “I will arrange all that, commandant,” the
      baron said. “I will send Le Devoir to Rouen, and he will bring back
      some ladies. I know where they can be found, We will have supper here, as
      all the materials are at hand and; at least, we shall have a jolly
      evening.”

But all the other officers had risen and surrounded their chief, saying:
      “Let the captain have his way, commandant; it is terribly dull here.”
      And the major ended by yielding. “Very well,” he replied, and
      the baron immediately sent for Le Devoir. He was an old non-commissioned
      officer, who had never been seen to smile, but who carried out all the
      orders of his superiors to the letter, no matter what they might be. He
      stood there, with an impassive face, while he received the baron''s
      instructions, and then went out, and five minutes later a large military
      wagon, covered with tarpaulin, galloped off as fast as four horses could
      draw it in the pouring rain. The officers all seemed to awaken from their
      lethargy, their looks brightened, and they began to talk.

Although it was raining as hard as ever, the major declared that it was
      not so dark, and Lieutenant von Grossling said with conviction that the
      sky was clearing up, while Mademoiselle Fifi did not seem to be able to
      keep still. He got up and sat down again, and his bright eyes seemed to be
      looking for something to destroy. Suddenly, looking at the lady with the
      mustaches, the young fellow pulled out his revolver and said: “You
      shall not see it.” And without leaving his seat he aimed, and with
      two successive bullets cut out both the eyes of the portrait.

“Let us make a mine!” he then exclaimed, and the conversation
      was suddenly interrupted, as if they had found some fresh and powerful
      subject of interest. The mine was his invention, his method of
      destruction, and his favorite amusement.

When he left the chateau, the lawful owner, Comte Fernand d''Amoys
      d''Uville, had not had time to carry away or to hide anything except the
      plate, which had been stowed away in a hole made in one of the walls. As
      he was very rich and had good taste, the large drawing-room, which opened
      into the dining-room, looked like a gallery in a museum, before his
      precipitate flight.

Expensive oil paintings, water colors and drawings hung against the walls,
      while on the tables, on the hanging shelves and in elegant glass cupboards
      there were a thousand ornaments: small vases, statuettes, groups of
      Dresden china and grotesque Chinese figures, old ivory and Venetian glass,
      which filled the large room with their costly and fantastic array.

Scarcely anything was left now; not that the things had been stolen, for
      the major would not have allowed that, but Mademoiselle Fifi would every
      now and then have a mine, and on those occasions all the officers
      thoroughly enjoyed themselves for five minutes. The little marquis went
      into the drawing-room to get what he wanted, and he brought back a small,
      delicate china teapot, which he filled with gunpowder, and carefully
      introduced a piece of punk through the spout. This he lighted and took his
      infernal machine into the next room, but he came back immediately and shut
      the door. The Germans all stood expectant, their faces full of childish,
      smiling curiosity, and as soon as the explosion had shaken the chateau,
      they all rushed in at once.

Mademoiselle Fifi, who got in first, clapped his hands in delight at the
      sight of a terra-cotta Venus, whose head had been blown off, and each
      picked up pieces of porcelain and wondered at the strange shape of the
      fragments, while the major was looking with a paternal eye at the large
      drawing-room, which had been wrecked after the fashion of a Nero, and was
      strewn with the fragments of works of art. He went out first and said with
      a smile: “That was a great success this time.”

But there was such a cloud of smoke in the dining-room, mingled with the
      tobacco smoke, that they could not breathe, so the commandant opened the
      window, and all the officers, who had returned for a last glass of cognac,
      went up to it.

The moist air blew into the room, bringing with it a sort of powdery
      spray, which sprinkled their beards. They looked at the tall trees which
      were dripping with rain, at the broad valley which was covered with mist,
      and at the church spire in the distance, which rose up like a gray point
      in the beating rain.

The bells had not rung since their arrival. That was the only resistance
      which the invaders had met with in the neighborhood. The parish priest had
      not refused to take in and to feed the Prussian soldiers; he had several
      times even drunk a bottle of beer or claret with the hostile commandant,
      who often employed him as a benevolent intermediary; but it was no use to
      ask him for a single stroke of the bells; he would sooner have allowed
      himself to be shot. That was his way of protesting against the invasion, a
      peaceful and silent protest, the only one, he said, which was suitable to
      a priest, who was a man of mildness, and not of blood; and every one, for
      twenty-five miles round, praised Abbe Chantavoine''s firmness and heroism
      in venturing to proclaim the public mourning by the obstinate silence of
      his church bells.

The whole village, enthusiastic at his resistance, was ready to back up
      their pastor and to risk anything, for they looked upon that silent
      protest as the safeguard of the national honor. It seemed to the peasants
      that thus they deserved better of their country than Belfort and
      Strassburg, that they had set an equally valuable example, and that the
      name of their little village would become immortalized by that; but, with
      that exception, they refused their Prussian conquerors nothing.

The commandant and his officers laughed among themselves at this
      inoffensive courage, and as the people in the whole country round showed
      themselves obliging and compliant toward them, they willingly tolerated
      their silent patriotism. Little Baron Wilhelm alone would have liked to
      have forced them to ring the bells. He was very angry at his superior''s
      politic compliance with the priest''s scruples, and every day begged the
      commandant to allow him to sound “ding-dong, ding-dong,” just
      once, only just once, just by way of a joke. And he asked it in the
      coaxing, tender voice of some loved woman who is bent on obtaining her
      wish, but the commandant would not yield, and to console himself,
      Mademoiselle Fifi made a mine in the Chateau d''Uville.

The five men stood there together for five minutes, breathing in the moist
      air, and at last Lieutenant Fritz said with a laugh: “The ladies
      will certainly not have fine weather for their drive.” Then they
      separated, each to his duty, while the captain had plenty to do in
      arranging for the dinner.

When they met again toward evening they began to laugh at seeing each
      other as spick and span and smart as on the day of a grand review. The
      commandant''s hair did not look so gray as it was in the morning, and the
      captain had shaved, leaving only his mustache, which made him look as if
      he had a streak of fire under his nose.

In spite of the rain, they left the window open, and one of them went to
      listen from time to time; and at a quarter past six the baron said he
      heard a rumbling in the distance. They all rushed down, and presently the
      wagon drove up at a gallop with its four horses steaming and blowing, and
      splashed with mud to their girths. Five women dismounted, five handsome
      girls whom a comrade of the captain, to whom Le Devoir had presented his
      card, had selected with care.

They had not required much pressing, as they had got to know the Prussians
      in the three months during which they had had to do with them, and so they
      resigned themselves to the men as they did to the state of affairs.

They went at once into the dining-room, which looked still more dismal in
      its dilapidated condition when it was lighted up; while the table covered
      with choice dishes, the beautiful china and glass, and the plate, which
      had been found in the hole in the wall where its owner had hidden it, gave
      it the appearance of a bandits'' inn, where they were supping after
      committing a robbery in the place. The captain was radiant, and put his
      arm round the women as if he were familiar with them; and when the three
      young men wanted to appropriate one each, he opposed them authoritatively,
      reserving to himself the right to apportion them justly, according to
      their several ranks, so as not to offend the higher powers. Therefore, to
      avoid all discussion, jarring, and suspicion of partiality, he placed them
      all in a row according to height, and addressing the tallest, he said in a
      voice of command:

“What is your name?” “Pamela,” she replied,
      raising her voice. And then he said: “Number One, called Pamela, is
      adjudged to the commandant.” Then, having kissed Blondina, the
      second, as a sign of proprietorship, he proffered stout Amanda to
      Lieutenant Otto; Eva, “the Tomato,” to Sub-lieutenant Fritz,
      and Rachel, the shortest of them all, a very young, dark girl, with eyes
      as black as ink, a Jewess, whose snub nose proved the rule which allots
      hooked noses to all her race, to the youngest officer, frail Count Wilhelm
      d''Eyrick.

They were all pretty and plump, without any distinctive features, and all
      had a similarity of complexion and figure.

The three young men wished to carry off their prizes immediately, under
      the pretext that they might wish to freshen their toilets; but the captain
      wisely opposed this, for he said they were quite fit to sit down to
      dinner, and his experience in such matters carried the day. There were
      only many kisses, expectant kisses.

Suddenly Rachel choked, and began to cough until the tears came into her
      eyes, while smoke came through her nostrils. Under pretence of kissing
      her, the count had blown a whiff of tobacco into her mouth. She did not
      fly into a rage and did not say a word, but she looked at her tormentor
      with latent hatred in her dark eyes.

They sat down to dinner. The commandant seemed delighted; he made Pamela
      sit on his right, and Blondina on his left, and said, as he unfolded his
      table napkin: “That was a delightful idea of yours, captain.”

Lieutenants Otto and Fritz, who were as polite as if they had been with
      fashionable ladies, rather intimidated their guests, but Baron von
      Kelweinstein beamed, made obscene remarks and seemed on fire with his
      crown of red hair. He paid the women compliments in French of the Rhine,
      and sputtered out gallant remarks, only fit for a low pothouse, from
      between his two broken teeth.

They did not understand him, however, and their intelligence did not seem
      to be awakened until he uttered foul words and broad expressions, which
      were mangled by his accent. Then they all began to laugh at once like
      crazy women and fell against each other, repeating the words, which the
      baron then began to say all wrong, in order that he might have the
      pleasure of hearing them say dirty things. They gave him as much of that
      stuff as he wanted, for they were drunk after the first bottle of wine,
      and resuming their usual habits and manners, they kissed the officers to
      right and left of them, pinched their arms, uttered wild cries, drank out
      of every glass and sang French couplets and bits of German songs which
      they had picked up in their daily intercourse with the enemy.

Soon the men themselves became very unrestrained, shouted and broke the
      plates and dishes, while the soldiers behind them waited on them stolidly.
      The commandant was the only one who kept any restraint upon himself.

Mademoiselle Fifi had taken Rachel on his knee, and, getting excited, at
      one moment he kissed the little black curls on her neck and at another he
      pinched her furiously and made her scream, for he was seized by a species
      of ferocity, and tormented by his desire to hurt her. He often held her
      close to him and pressed a long kiss on the Jewess'' rosy mouth until she
      lost her breath, and at last he bit her until a stream of blood ran down
      her chin and on to her bodice.

For the second time she looked him full in the face, and as she bathed the
      wound, she said: “You will have to pay for, that!” But he
      merely laughed a hard laugh and said: “I will pay.”

At dessert champagne was served, and the commandant rose, and in the same
      voice in which he would have drunk to the health of the Empress Augusta,
      he drank: “To our ladies!” And a series of toasts began,
      toasts worthy of the lowest soldiers and of drunkards, mingled with
      obscene jokes, which were made still more brutal by their ignorance of the
      language. They got up, one after the other, trying to say something witty,
      forcing themselves to be funny, and the women, who were so drunk that they
      almost fell off their chairs, with vacant looks and clammy tongues
      applauded madly each time.

The captain, who no doubt wished to impart an appearance of gallantry to
      the orgy, raised his glass again and said: “To our victories over
      hearts.” and, thereupon Lieutenant Otto, who was a species of bear
      from the Black Forest, jumped up, inflamed and saturated with drink, and
      suddenly seized by an access of alcoholic patriotism, he cried: “To
      our victories over France!”

Drunk as they were, the women were silent, but Rachel turned round,
      trembling, and said: “See here, I know some Frenchmen in whose
      presence you would not dare say that.” But the little count, still
      holding her on his knee, began to laugh, for the wine had made him very
      merry, and said: “Ha! ha! ha! I have never met any of them myself.
      As soon as we show ourselves, they run away!” The girl, who was in a
      terrible rage, shouted into his face: “You are lying, you dirty
      scoundrel!”

For a moment he looked at her steadily with his bright eyes upon her, as
      he had looked at the portrait before he destroyed it with bullets from his
      revolver, and then he began to laugh: “Ah! yes, talk about them, my
      dear! Should we be here now if they were brave?” And, getting
      excited, he exclaimed: “We are the masters! France belongs to us!”
      She made one spring from his knee and threw herself into her chair, while
      he arose, held out his glass over the table and repeated: “France
      and the French, the woods, the fields and the houses of France belong to
      us!”

The others, who were quite drunk, and who were suddenly seized by military
      enthusiasm, the enthusiasm of brutes, seized their glasses, and shouting,
      “Long live Prussia!” they emptied them at a draught.

The girls did not protest, for they were reduced to silence and were
      afraid. Even Rachel did not say a word, as she had no reply to make. Then
      the little marquis put his champagne glass, which had just been refilled,
      on the head of the Jewess and exclaimed: “All the women in France
      belong to us also!”

At that she got up so quickly that the glass upset, spilling the
      amber-colored wine on her black hair as if to baptize her, and broke into
      a hundred fragments, as it fell to the floor. Her lips trembling, she
      defied the looks of the officer, who was still laughing, and stammered out
      in a voice choked with rage:

He sat down again so as to laugh at his ease; and, trying to speak with
      the Parisian accent, he said: “She is good, very good! Then why did
      you come here, my dear?” She was thunderstruck and made no reply for
      a moment, for in her agitation she did not understand him at first, but as
      soon as she grasped his meaning she said to him indignantly and
      vehemently: “I! I! I am not a woman, I am only a strumpet, and that
      is all that Prussians want.”

Almost before she had finished he slapped her full in the face; but as he
      was raising his hand again, as if to strike her, she seized a small
      dessert knife with a silver blade from the table and, almost mad with
      rage, stabbed him right in the hollow of his neck. Something that he was
      going to say was cut short in his throat, and he sat there with his mouth
      half open and a terrible look in his eyes.

All the officers shouted in horror and leaped up tumultuously; but,
      throwing her chair between the legs of Lieutenant Otto, who fell down at
      full length, she ran to the window, opened it before they could seize her
      and jumped out into the night and the pouring rain.

In two minutes Mademoiselle Fifi was dead, and Fritz and Otto drew their
      swords and wanted to kill the women, who threw themselves at their feet
      and clung to their knees. With some difficulty the major stopped the
      slaughter and had the four terrified girls locked up in a room under the
      care of two soldiers, and then he organized the pursuit of the fugitive as
      carefully as if he were about to engage in a skirmish, feeling quite sure
      that she would be caught.

The table, which had been cleared immediately, now served as a bed on
      which to lay out the lieutenant, and the four officers stood at the
      windows, rigid and sobered with the stern faces of soldiers on duty, and
      tried to pierce through the darkness of the night amid the steady torrent
      of rain. Suddenly a shot was heard and then another, a long way off; and
      for four hours they heard from time to time near or distant reports and
      rallying cries, strange words of challenge, uttered in guttural voices.

In the morning they all returned. Two soldiers had been killed and three
      others wounded by their comrades in the ardor of that chase and in the
      confusion of that nocturnal pursuit, but they had not caught Rachel.

Then the inhabitants of the district were terrorized, the houses were
      turned topsy-turvy, the country was scoured and beaten up, over and over
      again, but the Jewess did not seem to have left a single trace of her
      passage behind her.

When the general was told of it he gave orders to hush up the affair, so
      as not to set a bad example to the army, but he severely censured the
      commandant, who in turn punished his inferiors. The general had said:
      “One does not go to war in order to amuse one''s self and to caress
      prostitutes.” Graf von Farlsberg, in his exasperation, made up his
      mind to have his revenge on the district, but as he required a pretext for
      showing severity, he sent for the priest and ordered him to have the bell
      tolled at the funeral of Baron von Eyrick.

Contrary to all expectation, the priest showed himself humble and most
      respectful, and when Mademoiselle Fifi''s body left the Chateau d''Uville on
      its way to the cemetery, carried by soldiers, preceded, surrounded and
      followed by soldiers who marched with loaded rifles, for the first time
      the bell sounded its funeral knell in a lively manner, as if a friendly
      hand were caressing it. At night it rang again, and the next day, and
      every day; it rang as much as any one could desire. Sometimes even it
      would start at night and sound gently through the darkness, seized with a
      strange joy, awakened one could not tell why. All the peasants in the
      neighborhood declared that it was bewitched, and nobody except the priest
      and the sacristan would now go near the church tower. And they went
      because a poor girl was living there in grief and solitude and provided
      for secretly by those two men.

She remained there until the German troops departed, and then one evening
      the priest borrowed the baker''s cart and himself drove his prisoner to
      Rouen. When they got there he embraced her, and she quickly went back on
      foot to the establishment from which she had come, where the proprietress,
      who thought that she was dead, was very glad to see her.

A short time afterward a patriot who had no prejudices, and who liked her
      because of her bold deed, and who afterward loved her for herself, married
      her and made her a lady quite as good as many others.

The war was over. The Germans occupied France. The whole country was
      pulsating like a conquered wrestler beneath the knee of his victorious
      opponent.

The first trains from Paris, distracted, starving, despairing Paris, were
      making their way to the new frontiers, slowly passing through the country
      districts and the villages. The passengers gazed through the windows at
      the ravaged fields and burned hamlets. Prussian soldiers, in their black
      helmets with brass spikes, were smoking their pipes astride their chairs
      in front of the houses which were still left standing. Others were working
      or talking just as if they were members of the families. As you passed
      through the different towns you saw entire regiments drilling in the
      squares, and, in spite of the rumble of the carriage-wheels, you could
      every moment hear the hoarse words of command.

M. Dubuis, who during the entire siege had served as one of the National
      Guard in Paris, was going to join his wife and daughter, whom he had
      prudently sent away to Switzerland before the invasion.

Famine and hardship had not diminished his big paunch so characteristic of
      the rich, peace-loving merchant. He had gone through the terrible events
      of the past year with sorrowful resignation and bitter complaints at the
      savagery of men. Now that he was journeying to the frontier at the close
      of the war, he saw the Prussians for the first time, although he had done
      his duty on the ramparts and mounted guard on many a cold night.

He stared with mingled fear and anger at those bearded armed men,
      installed all over French soil as if they were at home, and he felt in his
      soul a kind of fever of impotent patriotism, at the same time also the
      great need of that new instinct of prudence which since then has, never
      left us. In the same railway carriage were two Englishmen, who had come to
      the country as sightseers and were gazing about them with looks of quiet
      curiosity. They were both also stout, and kept chatting in their own
      language, sometimes referring to their guidebook, and reading aloud the
      names of the places indicated.

Suddenly the train stopped at a little village station, and a Prussian
      officer jumped up with a great clatter of his sabre on the double
      footboard of the railway carriage. He was tall, wore a tight-fitting
      uniform, and had whiskers up to his eyes. His red hair seemed to be on
      fire, and his long mustache, of a paler hue, stuck out on both sides of
      his face, which it seemed to cut in two.

The Englishmen at once began staring at him, with smiles of newly awakened
      interest, while M. Dubuis made a show of reading a newspaper. He sat
      concealed in his corner like a thief in presence of a gendarme.

The train started again. The Englishmen went on chatting and looking out
      for the exact scene of different battles; and all of a sudden, as one of
      them stretched out his arm toward the horizon as he pointed out a village,
      the Prussian officer remarked in French, extending his long legs and
      lolling backward:

The train rolled on, still passing through hamlets occupied by the
      victorious army. German soldiers could be seen along the roads, on the
      edges of fields, standing in front of gates or chatting outside cafes.
      They covered the soil like African locusts.

“If I had been in command, I''d have taken Paris, burned everything,
      killed everybody. No more France!”

“In twenty years all Europe, all of it, will belong to us. Prussia
      is more than a match for all of them.”

The Englishmen, getting uneasy, no longer replied. Their faces, which had
      become impassive, seemed made of wax behind their long whiskers. Then the
      Prussian officer began to laugh. And still, lolling back, he began to
      sneer. He sneered at the downfall of France, insulted the prostrate enemy;
      he sneered at Austria, which had been recently conquered; he sneered at
      the valiant but fruitless defence of the departments; he sneered at the
      Garde Mobile and at the useless artillery. He announced that Bismarck was
      going to build a city of iron with the captured cannon. And suddenly he
      placed his boots against the thigh of M. Dubuis, who turned away his eyes,
      reddening to the roots of his hair.

The Englishmen seemed to have become indifferent to all that was going on,
      as if they were suddenly shut up in their own island, far from the din of
      the world.

The train whistled, and slackened its pace. They passed a station that had
      been burned down; and then they stopped altogether.

A Prussian detachment occupied the station. Other soldiers were standing
      behind wooden gratings, looking on. The engine was getting up steam before
      starting off again. Then M. Dubuis hurriedly jumped on the platform, and,
      in spite of the warnings of the station master, dashed into the adjoining
      compartment.

He was alone! He tore open his waistcoat, his heart was beating so
      rapidly, and, gasping for breath, he wiped the perspiration from his
      forehead.

The train drew up at another station. And suddenly the officer appeared at
      the carriage door and jumped in, followed close behind by the two
      Englishmen, who were impelled by curiosity. The German sat facing the
      Frenchman, and, laughing still, said:

The German had already pulled out a few hairs, and was still tugging at
      the mustache, when M. Dubuis, with a back stroke of his hand, flung aside
      the officer''s arm, and, seizing him by the collar, threw him down on the
      seat. Then, excited to a pitch of fury, his temples swollen and his eyes
      glaring, he kept throttling the officer with one hand, while with the
      other clenched he began to strike him violent blows in the face. The
      Prussian struggled, tried to draw his sword, to clinch with his adversary,
      who was on top of him. But M. Dubuis crushed him with his enormous weight
      and kept punching him without taking breath or knowing where his blows
      fell. Blood flowed down the face of the German, who, choking and with a
      rattling in his throat, spat out his broken teeth and vainly strove to
      shake off this infuriated man who was killing him.

The Englishmen had got on their feet and came closer in order to see
      better. They remained standing, full of mirth and curiosity, ready to bet
      for, or against, either combatant.

Suddenly M. Dubuis, exhausted by his violent efforts, rose and resumed his
      seat without uttering a word.

The Prussian did not attack him, for the savage assault had terrified and
      astonished the officer as well as causing him suffering. When he was able
      to breathe freely, he said:

“Here is the town of Strasbourg. I''ll get two officers to be my
      seconds, and there will be time before the train leaves the station.”

In a minute the Prussian had found two comrades, who brought pistols, and
      they made their way toward the ramparts.

The Englishmen were continually looking at their watches, shuffling their
      feet and hurrying on with the preparations, uneasy lest they should be too
      late for the train.

While he was answering, “Yes, monsieur,” he noticed that one
      of the Englishmen had opened his umbrella in order to keep off the rays of
      the sun.

M. Dubuis fired at random without delay, and he was amazed to see the
      Prussian opposite him stagger, lift up his arms and fall forward, dead. He
      had killed the officer.

One of the Englishmen exclaimed: “Ah!” He was quivering with
      delight, with satisfied curiosity and joyous impatience. The other, who
      still kept his watch in his hand, seized M. Dubuis'' arm and hurried him in
      double-quick time toward the station, his fellow-countryman marking time
      as he ran beside them, with closed fists, his elbows at his sides, “One,
      two; one, two!”

And all three, running abreast rapidly, made their way to the station like
      three grotesque figures in a comic newspaper.

The train was on the point of starting. They sprang into their carriage.
      Then the Englishmen, taking off their travelling caps, waved them three
      times over their heads, exclaiming:

And gravely, one after the other, they extended their right hands to M.
      Dubuis and then went back and sat down in their own corner.

“Upon my word,” said Colonel Laporte, “although I am old
      and gouty, my legs as stiff as two pieces of wood, yet if a pretty woman
      were to tell me to go through the eye of a needle, I believe I should take
      a jump at it, like a clown through a hoop. I shall die like that; it is in
      the blood. I am an old beau, one of the old school, and the sight of a
      woman, a pretty woman, stirs me to the tips of my toes. There!

“We are all very much alike in France in this respect; we still
      remain knights, knights of love and fortune, since God has been abolished
      whose bodyguard we really were. But nobody can ever get woman out of our
      hearts; there she is, and there she will remain, and we love her, and
      shall continue to love her, and go on committing all kinds of follies on
      her account as long as there is a France on the map of Europe; and even if
      France were to be wiped off the map, there would always be Frenchmen left.

“When I am in the presence of a woman, of a pretty woman, I feel
      capable of anything. By Jove! when I feel her looks penetrating me, her
      confounded looks which set your blood on fire, I should like to do I don''t
      know what; to fight a duel, to have a row, to smash the furniture, in
      order to show that I am the strongest, the bravest, the most daring and
      the most devoted of men.

“But I am not the only one, certainly not; the whole French army is
      like me, I swear to you. From the common soldier to the general, we all
      start out, from the van to the rear guard, when there is a woman in the
      case, a pretty woman. Do you remember what Joan of Arc made us do
      formerly? Come. I will make a bet that if a pretty woman had taken command
      of the army on the eve of Sedan, when Marshal MacMahon was wounded, we
      should have broken through the Prussian lines, by Jove! and had a drink
      out of their guns.

“It was not a Trochu, but a Sainte-Genevieve, who was needed in
      Paris; and I remember a little anecdote of the war which proves that we
      are capable of everything in presence of a woman.

“I was a captain, a simple captain, at the time, and I was in
      command of a detachment of scouts, who were retreating through a district
      which swarmed with Prussians. We were surrounded, pursued, tired out and
      half dead with fatigue and hunger, but we were bound to reach Bar-sur-Tain
      before the morrow, otherwise we should be shot, cut down, massacred. I do
      not know how we managed to escape so far. However, we had ten leagues to
      go during the night, ten leagues through the night, ten leagues through
      the snow, and with empty stomachs, and I thought to myself:

“We had eaten nothing since the day before, and the whole day long
      we remained hidden in a barn, huddled close together, so as not to feel
      the cold so much, unable to speak or even move, and sleeping by fits and
      starts, as one does when worn out with fatigue.

“It was dark by five o''clock, that wan darkness of the snow, and I
      shook my men. Some of them would not get up; they were almost incapable of
      moving or of standing upright; their joints were stiff from cold and
      hunger.

“Before us there was a large expanse of flat, bare country; the snow
      was still falling like a curtain, in large, white flakes, which concealed
      everything under a thick, frozen coverlet, a coverlet of frozen wool One
      might have thought that it was the end of the world.

“They looked at the thick white flakes that were coming down, and
      they seemed to think: ''We have had enough of this; we may just as well die
      here!'' Then I took out my revolver and said:

“''I will shoot the first man who flinches.'' And so they set off, but
      very slowly, like men whose legs were of very little use to them, and I
      sent four of them three hundred yards ahead to scout, and the others
      followed pell-mell, walking at random and without any order. I put the
      strongest in the rear, with orders to quicken the pace of the sluggards
      with the points of their bayonets in the back.

“The snow seemed as if it were going to bury us alive; it powdered
      our kepis and cloaks without melting, and made phantoms of us, a kind of
      spectres of dead, weary soldiers. I said to myself: ''We shall never get
      out of this except by a miracle.''

“Sometimes we had to stop for a few minutes, on account of those who
      could not follow us, and then we heard nothing except the falling snow,
      that vague, almost undiscernible sound made by the falling flakes. Some of
      the men shook themselves, others did not move, and so I gave the order to
      set off again. They shouldered their rifles, and with weary feet we
      resumed our march, when suddenly the scouts fell back. Something had
      alarmed them; they had heard voices in front of them. I sent forward six
      men and a sergeant and waited.

“All at once a shrill cry, a woman''s cry, pierced through the heavy
      silence of the snow, and in a few minutes they brought back two prisoners,
      an old man and a girl, whom I questioned in a low voice. They were
      escaping from the Prussians, who had occupied their house during the
      evening and had got drunk. The father was alarmed on his daughter''s
      account, and, without even telling their servants, they had made their
      escape in the darkness. I saw immediately that they belonged to the better
      class. I invited them to accompany us, and we started off again, the old
      man who knew the road acting as our guide.

“It had ceased snowing, the stars appeared and the cold became
      intense. The girl, who was leaning on her father''s arm, walked unsteadily
      as though in pain, and several times she murmured:

“''I have no feeling at all in my feet''; and I suffered more than she
      did to see that poor little woman dragging herself like that through the
      snow. But suddenly she stopped and said:

“The old man wanted to carry her, but he could not even lift her up,
      and she sank to the ground with a deep sigh. We all gathered round her,
      and, as for me, I stamped my foot in perplexity, not knowing what to do,
      and being unwilling to abandon that man and girl like that, when suddenly
      one of the soldiers, a Parisian whom they had nicknamed Pratique, said:

“''Come, comrades, we must carry the young lady, otherwise we shall
      not show ourselves Frenchmen, confound it!''

“I really believe that I swore with pleasure. ''That is very good of
      you, my children,'' I said; ''and I will take my share of the burden.''

“We could indistinctly see, through the darkness, the trees of a
      little wood on the left. Several of the men went into it, and soon came
      back with a bundle of branches made into a litter.

“''Who will lend his cape? It is for a pretty girl, comrades,''
      Pratique said, and ten cloaks were thrown to him. In a moment the girl was
      lying, warm and comfortable, among them, and was raised upon six
      shoulders. I placed myself at their head, on the right, well pleased with
      my position.

“We started off much more briskly, as if we had had a drink of wine,
      and I even heard some jokes. A woman is quite enough to electrify
      Frenchmen, you see. The soldiers, who had become cheerful and warm, had
      almost reformed their ranks, and an old ''franc-tireur'' who was following
      the litter, waiting for his turn to replace the first of his comrades who
      might give out, said to one of his neighbors, loud enough for me to hear:
      “''I am not a young man now, but by—-, there is nothing like
      the women to put courage into you!''

“We went on, almost without stopping, until three o''clock in the
      morning, when suddenly our scouts fell back once more, and soon the whole
      detachment showed nothing but a vague shadow on the ground, as the men lay
      on the snow. I gave my orders in a low voice, and heard the harsh,
      metallic sound of the cocking, of rifles. For there, in the middle of the
      plain, some strange object was moving about. It looked like some enormous
      animal running about, now stretching out like a serpent, now coiling
      itself into a ball, darting to the right, then to the left, then stopping,
      and presently starting off again. But presently that wandering shape came
      nearer, and I saw a dozen lancers at full gallop, one behind the other.
      They had lost their way and were trying to find it.

“They were so near by that time that I could hear the loud breathing
      of their horses, the clinking of their swords and the creaking of their
      saddles, and cried: ''Fire!''

“Fifty rifle shots broke the stillness of the night, then there were
      four or five reports, and at last one single shot was heard, and when the
      smoke had cleared away, we saw that the twelve men and nine horses had
      fallen. Three of the animals were galloping away at a furious pace, and
      one of them was dragging the dead body of its rider, which rebounded
      violently from the ground; his foot had caught in the stirrup.

“One of the soldiers behind me gave a terrible laugh and said:
      ''There will be some widows there!''

“''Poor fellows!'' she said. But as she was cold, she quickly
      disappeared beneath the cloaks again, and we started off once more. We
      marched on for a long time, and at last the sky began to grow lighter. The
      snow became quite clear, luminous and glistening, and a rosy tint appeared
      in the east. Suddenly a voice in the distance cried:

“The whole detachment halted, and I advanced to give the
      countersign. We had reached the French lines, and, as my men defiled
      before the outpost, a commandant on horseback, whom I had informed of what
      had taken place, asked in a sonorous voice, as he saw the litter pass him:
      ''What have you in there?''

“And immediately a small head covered with light hair appeared,
      dishevelled and smiling, and replied:

“At this the men raised a hearty laugh, and we felt quite
      light-hearted, while Pratique, who was walking by the side of the litter,
      waved his kepi and shouted:

“''Vive la France!'' And I felt really affected. I do not know why,
      except that I thought it a pretty and gallant thing to say.

“It seemed to me as if we had just saved the whole of France and had
      done something that other men could not have done, something simple and
      really patriotic. I shall never forget that little face, you may be sure;
      and if I had to give my opinion about abolishing drums, trumpets and
      bugles, I should propose to replace them in every regiment by a pretty
      girl, and that would be even better than playing the ''Marseillaise: By
      Jove! it would put some spirit into a trooper to have a Madonna like that,
      a live Madonna, by the colonel''s side.”

He was silent for a few moments and then continued, with an air of
      conviction, and nodding his head:

Fifteen years had passed since I was at Virelogne. I returned there in the
      autumn to shoot with my friend Serval, who had at last rebuilt his
      chateau, which the Prussians had destroyed.

I loved that district. It is one of those delightful spots which have a
      sensuous charm for the eyes. You love it with a physical love. We, whom
      the country enchants, keep tender memories of certain springs, certain
      woods, certain pools, certain hills seen very often which have stirred us
      like joyful events. Sometimes our thoughts turn back to a corner in a
      forest, or the end of a bank, or an orchard filled with flowers, seen but
      a single time on some bright day, yet remaining in our hearts like the
      image of certain women met in the street on a spring morning in their
      light, gauzy dresses, leaving in soul and body an unsatisfied desire which
      is not to be forgotten, a feeling that you have just passed by happiness.

At Virelogne I loved the whole countryside, dotted with little woods and
      crossed by brooks which sparkled in the sun and looked like veins carrying
      blood to the earth. You fished in them for crawfish, trout and eels.
      Divine happiness! You could bathe in places and you often found snipe
      among the high grass which grew along the borders of these small water
      courses.

I was stepping along light as a goat, watching my two dogs running ahead
      of me, Serval, a hundred metres to my right, was beating a field of
      lucerne. I turned round by the thicket which forms the boundary of the
      wood of Sandres and I saw a cottage in ruins.

Suddenly I remembered it as I had seen it the last time, in 1869, neat,
      covered with vines, with chickens before the door. What is sadder than a
      dead house, with its skeleton standing bare and sinister?

I also recalled that inside its doors, after a very tiring day, the good
      woman had given me a glass of wine to drink and that Serval had told me
      the history of its people. The father, an old poacher, had been killed by
      the gendarmes. The son, whom I had once seen, was a tall, dry fellow who
      also passed for a fierce slayer of game. People called them “Les
      Sauvage.”

When war was declared the son Sauvage, who was then thirty-three years
      old, enlisted, leaving his mother alone in the house. People did not pity
      the old woman very much because she had money; they knew it.

She remained entirely alone in that isolated dwelling, so far from the
      village, on the edge of the wood. She was not afraid, however, being of
      the same strain as the men folk—a hardy old woman, tall and thin,
      who seldom laughed and with whom one never jested. The women of the fields
      laugh but little in any case, that is men''s business. But they themselves
      have sad and narrowed hearts, leading a melancholy, gloomy life. The
      peasants imbibe a little noisy merriment at the tavern, but their
      helpmates always have grave, stern countenances. The muscles of their
      faces have never learned the motions of laughter.

Mother Sauvage continued her ordinary existence in her cottage, which was
      soon covered by the snows. She came to the village once a week to get
      bread and a little meat. Then she returned to her house. As there was talk
      of wolves, she went out with a gun upon her shoulder—her son''s gun,
      rusty and with the butt worn by the rubbing of the hand—and she was
      a strange sight, the tall “Sauvage,” a little bent, going with
      slow strides over the snow, the muzzle of the piece extending beyond the
      black headdress, which confined her head and imprisoned her white hair,
      which no one had ever seen.

One day a Prussian force arrived. It was billeted upon the inhabitants,
      according to the property and resources of each. Four were allotted to the
      old woman, who was known to be rich.

They were four great fellows with fair complexion, blond beards and blue
      eyes, who had not grown thin in spite of the fatigue which they had
      endured already and who also, though in a conquered country, had remained
      kind and gentle. Alone with this aged woman, they showed themselves full
      of consideration, sparing her, as much as they could, all expense and
      fatigue. They could be seen, all four of them, making their toilet at the
      well in their shirt-sleeves in the gray dawn, splashing with great swishes
      of water their pink-white northern skin, while La Mere Sauvage went and
      came, preparing their soup. They would be seen cleaning the kitchen,
      rubbing the tiles, splitting wood, peeling potatoes, doing up all the
      housework like four good sons around their mother.

But the old woman thought always of her own son, so tall and thin, with
      his hooked nose and his brown eyes and his heavy mustache which made a
      roll of black hair upon his lip. She asked every day of each of the
      soldiers who were installed beside her hearth: “Do you know where
      the French marching regiment, No. 23, was sent? My boy is in it.”

They invariably answered, “No, we don''t know, don''t know a thing at
      all.” And, understanding her pain and her uneasiness—they who
      had mothers, too, there at home—they rendered her a thousand little
      services. She loved them well, moreover, her four enemies, since the
      peasantry have no patriotic hatred; that belongs to the upper class alone.
      The humble, those who pay the most because they are poor and because every
      new burden crushes them down; those who are killed in masses, who make the
      true cannon''s prey because they are so many; those, in fine, who suffer
      most cruelly the atrocious miseries of war because they are the feeblest
      and offer least resistance—they hardly understand at all those
      bellicose ardors, that excitable sense of honor or those pretended
      political combinations which in six months exhaust two nations, the
      conqueror with the conquered.

Now, one morning, when the old woman was alone in the house, she observed,
      far off on the plain, a man coming toward her dwelling. Soon she
      recognized him; it was the postman to distribute the letters. He gave her
      a folded paper and she drew out of her case the spectacles which she used
      for sewing. Then she read:

She did not cry at all. She remained motionless, so overcome and stupefied
      that she did not even suffer as yet. She thought: “There''s Victor
      killed now.” Then little by little the tears came to her eyes and
      the sorrow filled her heart. Her thoughts came, one by one, dreadful,
      torturing. She would never kiss him again, her child, her big boy, never
      again! The gendarmes had killed the father, the Prussians had killed the
      son. He had been cut in two by a cannon-ball. She seemed to see the thing,
      the horrible thing: the head falling, the eyes open, while he chewed the
      corner of his big mustache as he always did in moments of anger.

What had they done with his body afterward? If they had only let her have
      her boy back as they had brought back her husband—with the bullet in
      the middle of the forehead!

But she heard a noise of voices. It was the Prussians returning from the
      village. She hid her letter very quickly in her pocket, and she received
      them quietly, with her ordinary face, having had time to wipe her eyes.

They were laughing, all four, delighted, for they brought with them a fine
      rabbit—stolen, doubtless—and they made signs to the old woman
      that there was to be something good to east.

She set herself to work at once to prepare breakfast, but when it came to
      killing the rabbit, her heart failed her. And yet it was not the first.
      One of the soldiers struck it down with a blow of his fist behind the
      ears.

The beast once dead, she skinned the red body, but the sight of the blood
      which she was touching, and which covered her hands, and which she felt
      cooling and coagulating, made her tremble from head to foot, and she kept
      seeing her big boy cut in two, bloody, like this still palpitating animal.

She sat down at table with the Prussians, but she could not eat, not even
      a mouthful. They devoured the rabbit without bothering themselves about
      her. She looked at them sideways, without speaking, her face so impassive
      that they perceived nothing.

All of a sudden she said: “I don''t even know your names, and here''s
      a whole month that we''ve been together.” They understood, not
      without difficulty, what she wanted, and told their names.

That was not sufficient; she had them written for her on a paper, with the
      addresses of their families, and, resting her spectacles on her great
      nose, she contemplated that strange handwriting, then folded the sheet and
      put it in her pocket, on top of the letter which told her of the death of
      her son.

They were astonished at her taking all this trouble; she explained to them
      that thus they would not be so cold; and they helped her. They heaped the
      stacks of hay as high as the straw roof, and in that manner they made a
      sort of great chamber with four walls of fodder, warm and perfumed, where
      they should sleep splendidly.

At dinner one of them was worried to see that La Mere Sauvage still ate
      nothing. She told him that she had pains in her stomach. Then she kindled
      a good fire to warm herself, and the four Germans ascended to their
      lodging-place by the ladder which served them every night for this
      purpose.

As soon as they closed the trapdoor the old woman removed the ladder, then
      opened the outside door noiselessly and went back to look for more bundles
      of straw, with which she filled her kitchen. She went barefoot in the
      snow, so softly that no sound was heard. From time to time she listened to
      the sonorous and unequal snoring of the four soldiers who were fast
      asleep.

When she judged her preparations to be sufficient, she threw one of the
      bundles into the fireplace, and when it was alight she scattered it over
      all the others. Then she went outside again and looked.

In a few seconds the whole interior of the cottage was illumined with a
      brilliant light and became a frightful brasier, a gigantic fiery furnace,
      whose glare streamed out of the narrow window and threw a glittering beam
      upon the snow.

Then a great cry issued from the top of the house; it was a clamor of men
      shouting heartrending calls of anguish and of terror. Finally the trapdoor
      having given way, a whirlwind of fire shot up into the loft, pierced the
      straw roof, rose to the sky like the immense flame of a torch, and all the
      cottage flared.

Nothing more was heard therein but the crackling of the fire, the cracking
      of the walls, the falling of the rafters. Suddenly the roof fell in and
      the burning carcass of the dwelling hurled a great plume of sparks into
      the air, amid a cloud of smoke.

The old “Sauvage” stood before her ruined dwelling, armed with
      her gun, her son''s gun, for fear one of those men might escape.

When she saw that it was ended, she threw her weapon into the brasier. A
      loud report followed.

She reached her bony arm toward the red heap of fire which was almost out
      and answered with a strong voice:

They did not believe her, they thought that the sudden disaster had made
      her crazy. While all pressed round and listened, she told the story from
      beginning to end, from the arrival of the letter to the last shriek of the
      men who were burned with her house, and never omitted a detail.

When she had finished, she drew two pieces of paper from her pocket, and,
      in order to distinguish them by the last gleams of the fire, she again
      adjusted her spectacles. Then she said, showing one:

“That, that is the death of Victor.” Showing the other, she
      added, indicating the red ruins with a bend of the head: “Here are
      their names, so that you can write home.” She quietly held a sheet
      of paper out to the officer, who held her by the shoulders, and she
      continued:

“You must write how it happened, and you must say to their mothers
      that it was I who did that, Victoire Simon, la Sauvage! Do not forget.”

The officer shouted some orders in German. They seized her, they threw her
      against the walls of her house, still hot. Then twelve men drew quickly up
      before her, at twenty paces. She did not move. She had understood; she
      waited.

An order rang out, followed instantly by a long report. A belated shot
      went off by itself, after the others.

The Prussian officer approached. She was almost cut in two, and in her
      withered hand she held her letter bathed with blood.

“It was by way of reprisal that the Germans destroyed the chateau of
      the district, which belonged to me.”

I thought of the mothers of those four fine fellows burned in that house
      and of the horrible heroism of that other mother shot against the wall.

I should say I did remember that Epiphany supper during the war! exclaimed
      Count de Garens, an army captain.

I was quartermaster of cavalry at the time, and for a fortnight had been
      scouting in front of the German advance guard. The evening before we had
      cut down a few Uhlans and had lost three men, one of whom was that poor
      little Raudeville. You remember Joseph de Raudeville, of course.

Well, on that day my commanding officer ordered me to take six troopers
      and to go and occupy the village of Porterin, where there had been five
      skirmishes in three weeks, and to hold it all night. There were not twenty
      houses left standing, not a dozen houses in that wasps'' nest. So I took
      ten troopers and set out about four o''clock, and at five o''clock, while it
      was still pitch dark, we reached the first houses of Porterin. I halted
      and ordered Marchas—you know Pierre de Marchas, who afterward
      married little Martel-Auvelin, the daughter of the Marquis de Martel-Auvelin—to
      go alone into the village, and to report to me what he saw.

I had selected nothing but volunteers, all men of good family. It is
      pleasant when on duty not to be forced to be on intimate terms with
      unpleasant fellows. This Marchas was as smart as possible, cunning as a
      fox and supple as a serpent. He could scent the Prussians as a dog can
      scent a hare, could discover food where we should have died of hunger
      without him, and obtained information from everybody, and information
      which was always reliable, with incredible cleverness.

In ten minutes he returned. “All right,” he said; “there
      have been no Prussians here for three days. It is a sinister place, is
      this village. I have been talking to a Sister of Mercy, who is caring for
      four or five wounded men in an abandoned convent.”

I ordered them to ride on, and we entered the principal street. On the
      right and left we could vaguely see roofless walls, which were hardly
      visible in the profound darkness. Here and there a light was burning in a
      room; some family had remained to keep its house standing as well as they
      were able; a family of brave or of poor people. The rain began to fall, a
      fine, icy cold rain, which froze as it fell on our cloaks. The horses
      stumbled against stones, against beams, against furniture. Marchas guided
      us, going before us on foot, and leading his horse by the bridle.

“Where are you taking us to?” I asked him. And he replied:
      “I have a place for us to lodge in, and a rare good one.” And
      we presently stopped before a small house, evidently belonging to some
      proprietor of the middle class. It stood on the street, was quite
      inclosed, and had a garden in the rear.

Marchas forced open the lock by means of a big stone which he picked up
      near the garden gate; then he mounted the steps, smashed in the front door
      with his feet and shoulders, lit a bit of wax candle, which he was never
      without, and went before us into the comfortable apartments of some rich
      private individual, guiding us with admirable assurance, as if he lived in
      this house which he now saw for the first time.

Two troopers remained outside to take care of our horses, and Marchas said
      to stout Ponderel, who followed him: “The stables must be on the
      left; I saw that as we came in; go and put the animals up there, for we do
      not need them”; and then, turning to me, he said: “Give your
      orders, confound it all!”

This fellow always astonished me, and I replied with a laugh: “I
      will post my sentinels at the country approaches and will return to you
      here.”

“Very well. Leave me four to look after provisions, to do the
      cooking and to set the table. I will go and find out where the wine is
      hidden.”

I went off, to reconnoitre the deserted streets until they ended in the
      open country, so as to post my sentries there.

Half an hour later I was back, and found Marchas lounging in a great
      easy-chair, the covering of which he had taken off, from love of luxury,
      as he said. He was warming his feet at the fire and smoking an excellent
      cigar, whose perfume filled the room. He was alone, his elbows resting on
      the arms of the chair, his head sunk between his shoulders, his cheeks
      flushed, his eyes bright, and looking delighted.

I heard the noise of plates and dishes in the next room, and Marchas said
      to me, smiling in a contented manner: “This is famous; I found the
      champagne under the flight of steps outside, the brandy—fifty
      bottles of the very finest in the kitchen garden under a pear tree, which
      did not seem to me to be quite straight when I looked at it by the light
      of my lantern. As for solids, we have two fowls, a goose, a duck, and
      three pigeons. They are being cooked at this moment. It is a delightful
      district.”

I sat down opposite him, and the fire in the grate was burning my nose and
      cheeks. “Where did you find this wood?” I asked. “Splendid
      wood,” he replied. “The owner''s carriage. It is the paint
      which is causing all this flame, an essence of punch and varnish. A
      capital house!”

I laughed, for I saw the creature was funny, and he went on: “Fancy
      this being the Epiphany! I have had a bean put into the goose dressing;
      but there is no queen; it is really very annoying!” And I repeated
      like an echo: “It is annoying, but what do you want me to do in the
      matter?” “To find some, of course.” “Some women.
      Women?—you must be mad?” “I managed to find the brandy
      under the pear tree, and the champagne under the steps; and yet there was
      nothing to guide me, while as for you, a petticoat is a sure bait. Go and
      look, old fellow.”

He looked so grave, so convinced, that I could not tell whether he was
      joking or not, and so I replied: “Look here, Marchas, are you having
      a joke with me?” “I never joke on duty.” “But
      where the devil do you expect me to find any women?” “Where
      you like; there must be two or three remaining in the neighborhood, so
      ferret them out and bring them here.”

“Do you want an idea?” “Yes.” “Go and see
      the priest.” “The priest? What for?” “Ask him to
      supper, and beg him to bring a woman with him.” “The priest! A
      woman! Ha! ha! ha!”

But Marchas continued with extraordinary gravity: “I am not
      laughing; go and find the priest and tell him how we are situated, and, as
      he must be horribly dull, he will come. But tell him that we want one
      woman at least, a lady, of course, since we, are all men of the world. He
      is sure to know his female parishioners on the tips of his fingers, and if
      there is one to suit us, and you manage it well, he will suggest her to
      you.”

“Come, come, Marchas, what are you thinking of?” “My
      dear Garens, you can do this quite well. It will even be very funny. We
      are well bred, by Jove! and we will put on our most distinguished manners
      and our grandest style. Tell the abbe who we are, make him laugh, soften
      his heart, coax him and persuade him!” “No, it is impossible.”

He drew his chair close to mine, and as he knew my special weakness, the
      scamp continued: “Just think what a swaggering thing it will be to
      do and how amusing to tell about; the whole army will talk about it, and
      it will give you a famous reputation.”

I hesitated, for the adventure rather tempted me, and he persisted:
      “Come, my little Garens. You are the head of this detachment, and
      you alone can go and call on the head of the church in this neighborhood.
      I beg of you to go, and I promise you that after the war I will relate the
      whole affair in verse in the Revue de Deux Mondes. You owe this much to
      your men, for you have made them march enough during the last month.”

I got up at last and asked: “Where is the priest''s house?”
      “Take the second turning at the end of the street, you will see an
      avenue, and at the end of the avenue you will find the church. The
      parsonage is beside it.” As I went out, he called out: “Tell
      him the bill of fare, to make him hungry!”

I discovered the ecclesiastic''s little house without any difficulty; it
      was by the side of a large, ugly brick church. I knocked at the door with
      my fist, as there was neither bell nor knocker, and a loud voice from
      inside asked: “Who is there?” To which I replied: “A
      quartermaster of hussars.”

I heard the noise of bolts and of a key being turned, and found myself
      face to face with a tall priest with a large stomach, the chest of a
      prizefighter, formidable hands projecting from turned-up sleeves, a red
      face, and the look of a kind man. I gave him a military salute and said:
      “Good-day, Monsieur le Cure.”

He had feared a surprise, some marauders'' ambush, and he smiled as he
      replied: “Good-day, my friend; come in.” I followed him into a
      small room with a red tiled floor, in which a small fire was burning, very
      different to Marchas'' furnace, and he gave me a chair and said: “What
      can I do for you?” “Monsieur, allow me first of all to
      introduce myself”; and I gave him my card, which he took and read
      half aloud: “Le Comte de Garens.”

I continued: “There are eleven of us here, Monsieur l''Abbe, five on
      picket duty, and six installed at the house of an unknown inhabitant. The
      names of the six are: Garens, myself; Pierre de Marchas, Ludovic de
      Ponderel, Baron d''Streillis, Karl Massouligny, the painter''s son, and
      Joseph Herbon, a young musician. I have come to ask you, in their name and
      my own, to do us the honor of supping with us. It is an Epiphany supper,
      Monsieur le Cure, and we should like to make it a little cheerful.”

The priest smiled and murmured: “It seems to me to be hardly a
      suitable occasion for amusing one''s self.” And I replied: “We
      are fighting during the day, monsieur. Fourteen of our comrades have been
      killed in a month, and three fell as late as yesterday. It is war time. We
      stake our life at every moment; have we not, therefore, the right to amuse
      ourselves freely? We are Frenchmen, we like to laugh, and we can laugh
      everywhere. Our fathers laughed on the scaffold! This evening we should
      like to cheer ourselves up a little, like gentlemen, and not like
      soldiers; you understand me, I hope. Are we wrong?”

He replied quickly: “You are quite right, my friend, and I accept
      your invitation with great pleasure.” Then he called out: “Hermance!”

An old bent, wrinkled, horrible peasant woman appeared and said: “What
      do you want?” “I shall not dine at home, my daughter.”
      “Where are you going to dine then?” “With some
      gentlemen, the hussars.”

I felt inclined to say: “Bring your servant with you,” just to
      see Marchas'' face, but I did not venture, and continued: “Do you
      know any one among your parishioners, male or female, whom I could invite
      as well?” He hesitated, reflected, and then said: “No, I do
      not know anybody!”

I persisted: “Nobody! Come, monsieur, think; it would be very nice
      to have some ladies, I mean to say, some married couples! I know nothing
      about your parishioners. The baker and his wife, the grocer, the—the—the—watchmaker—the—shoemaker—the—the
      druggist with Mrs. Druggist. We have a good spread and plenty of wine, and
      we should be enchanted to leave pleasant recollections of ourselves with
      the people here.”

The priest thought again for a long time, and then said resolutely:
      “No, there is nobody.” I began to laugh. “By Jove,
      Monsieur le Cure, it is very annoying not to have an Epiphany queen, for
      we have the bean. Come, think. Is there not a married mayor, or a married
      deputy mayor, or a married municipal councillor or a schoolmaster?”
      “No, all the ladies have gone away.” “What, is there not
      in the whole place some good tradesman''s wife with her good tradesman, to
      whom we might give this pleasure, for it would be a pleasure to them, a
      great pleasure under present circumstances?”

But, suddenly, the cure began to laugh, and laughed so violently that he
      fairly shook, and presently exclaimed: “Ha! ha! ha! I have got what
      you want, yes. I have got what you want! Ha! ha! ha! We will laugh and
      enjoy ourselves, my children; we will have some fun. How pleased the
      ladies will be, I say, how delighted they will be! Ha! ha! Where are you
      staying?”

I described the house, and he understood where it was. “Very good,”
      he said. “It belongs to Monsieur Bertin-Lavaille. I will be there in
      half an hour, with four ladies! Ha! ha! ha! four ladies!”

He went out with me, still laughing, and left me, repeating: “That
      is capital; in half an hour at Bertin-Lavaille''s house.”

I returned quickly, very much astonished and very much puzzled. “Covers
      for how many?” Marchas asked, as soon as he saw me. “Eleven.
      There are six of us hussars, besides the priest and four ladies.” He
      was thunderstruck, and I was triumphant. He repeated: “Four ladies!
      Did you say, four ladies?” “I said four women.” “Real
      women?” “Real women.” “Well, accept my
      compliments!” “I will, for I deserve them.”

He got out of his armchair, opened the door, and I saw a beautiful white
      tablecloth on a long table, round which three hussars in blue aprons were
      setting out the plates and glasses. “There are some women coming!”
      Marchas cried. And the three men began to dance and to cheer with all
      their might.

Everything was ready, and we were waiting. We waited for nearly an hour,
      while a delicious smell of roast poultry pervaded the whole house. At
      last, however, a knock against the shutters made us all jump up at the
      same moment. Stout Ponderel ran to open the door, and in less than a
      minute a little Sister of Mercy appeared in the doorway. She was thin,
      wrinkled and timid, and successively greeted the four bewildered hussars
      who saw her enter. Behind her, the noise of sticks sounded on the tiled
      floor in the vestibule, and as soon as she had come into the drawing-room,
      I saw three old heads in white caps, following each other one by one, who
      came in, swaying with different movements, one inclining to the right,
      while the other inclined to the left. And three worthy women appeared,
      limping, dragging their legs behind them, crippled by illness and deformed
      through old age, three infirm old women, past service, the only three
      pensioners who were able to walk in the home presided over by Sister
      Saint-Benedict.

She had turned round to her invalids, full of anxiety for them, and then,
      seeing my quartermaster''s stripes, she said to me: “I am much
      obliged to you for thinking of these poor women. They have very little
      pleasure in life, and you are at the same time giving them a great treat
      and doing them a great honor.”

I saw the priest, who had remained in the dark hallway, and was laughing
      heartily, and I began to laugh in my turn, especially when I saw Marchas''
      face. Then, motioning the nun to the seats, I said:

“Sit down, sister; we are very proud and very happy that you have
      accepted our unpretentious invitation.”

She took three chairs which stood against the wall, set them before the
      fire, led her three old women to them, settled them on them, took their
      sticks and shawls, which she put into a corner, and then, pointing to the
      first, a thin woman with an enormous stomach, who was evidently suffering
      from the dropsy, she said: “This is Mother Paumelle; whose husband
      was killed by falling from a roof, and whose son died in Africa; she is
      sixty years old.” Then she pointed to another, a tall woman, whose
      head trembled unceasingly: “This is Mother Jean-Jean, who is
      sixty-seven. She is nearly blind, for her face was terribly singed in a
      fire, and her right leg was half burned off.”

Then she pointed to the third, a sort of dwarf, with protruding, round,
      stupid eyes, which she rolled incessantly in all directions, “This
      is La Putois, an idiot. She is only forty-four.”

I bowed to the three women as if I were being presented to some royal
      highnesses, and turning to the priest, I said: “You are an excellent
      man, Monsieur l''Abbe, to whom all of us here owe a debt of gratitude.”

Everybody was laughing, in fact, except Marchas, who seemed furious, and
      just then Karl Massouligny cried: “Sister Saint-Benedict, supper is
      on the table!”

I made her go first with the priest, then I helped up Mother Paumelle,
      whose arm I took and dragged her into the next room, which was no easy
      task, for she seemed heavier than a lump of iron.

Stout Ponderel gave his arm to Mother Jean-Jean, who bemoaned her crutch,
      and little Joseph Herbon took the idiot, La Putois, to the dining-room,
      which was filled with the odor of the viands.

As soon as we were opposite our plates, the sister clapped her hands three
      times, and, with the precision of soldiers presenting arms, the women made
      a rapid sign of the cross, and then the priest slowly repeated the
      Benedictus in Latin. Then we sat down, and the two fowls appeared, brought
      in by Marchas, who chose to wait at table, rather than to sit down as a
      guest to this ridiculous repast.

But I cried: “Bring the champagne at once!” and a cork flew
      out with the noise of a pistol, and in spite of the resistance of the
      priest and of the kind sister, the three hussars, sitting by the side of
      the three invalids, emptied their three full glasses down their throats by
      force.

Massouligny, who possessed the faculty of making himself at home, and of
      being on good terms with every one, wherever he was, made love to Mother
      Paumelle in the drollest manner. The dropsical woman, who had retained her
      cheerfulness in spite of her misfortunes, answered him banteringly in a
      high falsetto voice which appeared as if it were put on, and she laughed
      so heartily at her neighbor''s jokes that it was quite alarming. Little
      Herbon had seriously undertaken the task of making the idiot drunk, and
      Baron d''Streillis, whose wits were not always particularly sharp, was
      questioning old Jean-Jean about the life, the habits, and the rules of the
      hospital.

“Oh! oh! you will make her ill; pray do not make her laugh like
      that, monsieur. Oh! monsieur—” Then she got up and rushed at
      Herbon to take from him a full glass which he was hastily emptying down La
      Putois'' throat, while the priest shook with laughter, and said to the
      sister: “Never mind; just this once, it will not hurt them. Do leave
      them alone.”

After the two fowls they ate the duck, which was flanked by the three
      pigeons and the blackbird, and then the goose appeared, smoking,
      golden-brown, and diffusing a warm odor of hot, browned roast meat. La
      Paumelle, who was getting lively, clapped her hands; La Jean-Jean left off
      answering the baron''s numerous questions, and La Putois uttered grunts of
      pleasure, half cries and half sighs, as little children do when one shows
      them candy. “Allow me to take charge of this animal,” the cure
      said. “I understand these sort of operations better than most
      people.” “Certainly, Monsieur l''Abbe,” and the sister
      said: “How would it be to open the window a little? They are too
      warm, and I am afraid they will be ill.”

I turned to Marchas: “Open the window for a minute.” He did
      so; the cold outer air as it came in made the candles flare, and the steam
      from the goose, which the cure was scientifically carving, with a table
      napkin round his neck, whirl about. We watched him doing it, without
      speaking now, for we were interested in his attractive handiwork, and
      seized with renewed appetite at the sight of that enormous golden-brown
      bird, whose limbs fell one after another into the brown gravy at the
      bottom of the dish. At that moment, in the midst of that greedy silence
      which kept us all attentive, the distant report of a shot came in at the
      open window.

I started to my feet so quickly that my chair fell down behind me, and I
      shouted: “To saddle, all of you! You, Marchas, take two men and go
      and see what it is. I shall expect you back here in five minutes.”
      And while the three riders went off at full gallop through the night, I
      got into the saddle with my three remaining hussars, in front of the steps
      of the villa, while the cure, the sister and the three old women showed
      their frightened faces at the window.

We heard nothing more, except the barking of a dog in the distance. The
      rain had ceased, and it was cold, very cold, and soon I heard the gallop
      of a horse, of a single horse, coming back. It was Marchas, and I called
      out to him: “Well?” “It is nothing; Francois has wounded
      an old peasant who refused to answer his challenge: ''Who goes there?'' and
      who continued to advance in spite of the order to keep off; but they are
      bringing him here, and we shall see what is the matter.”

I gave orders for the horses to be put back in the stable, and I sent my
      two soldiers to meet the others, and returned to the house. Then the cure,
      Marchas, and I took a mattress into the room to lay the wounded man on;
      the sister tore up a table napkin in order to make lint, while the three
      frightened women remained huddled up in a corner.

Soon I heard the rattle of sabres on the road, and I took a candle to show
      a light to the men who were returning; and they soon appeared, carrying
      that inert, soft, long, sinister object which a human body becomes when
      life no longer sustains it.

They put the wounded man on the mattress that had been prepared for him,
      and I saw at the first glance that he was dying. He had the death rattle
      and was spitting up blood, which ran out of the corners of his mouth at
      every gasp. The man was covered with blood! His cheeks, his beard, his
      hair, his neck and his clothes seemed to have been soaked, to have been
      dipped in a red tub; and that blood stuck to him, and had become a dull
      color which was horrible to look at.

The wounded man, wrapped up in a large shepherd''s cloak, occasionally
      opened his dull, vacant eyes, which seemed stupid with astonishment, like
      those of animals wounded by a sportsman, which fall at his feet, more than
      half dead already, stupefied with terror and surprise.

The cure exclaimed: “Ah, it is old Placide, the shepherd from Les
      Moulins. He is deaf, poor man, and heard nothing. Ah! Oh, God! they have
      killed the unhappy man!” The sister had opened his blouse and shirt,
      and was looking at a little blue hole in his chest, which was not bleeding
      any more. “There is nothing to be done,” she said.

The shepherd was gasping terribly and bringing up blood with every last
      breath, and in his throat, to the very depth of his lungs, they could hear
      an ominous and continued gurgling. The cure, standing in front of him,
      raised his right hand, made the sign of the cross, and in a slow and
      solemn voice pronounced the Latin words which purify men''s souls, but
      before they were finished, the old man''s body trembled violently, as if
      something had given way inside him, and he ceased to breathe. He was dead.

When I turned round, I saw a sight which was even more horrible than the
      death struggle of this unfortunate man; the three old women were standing
      up huddled close together, hideous, and grimacing with fear and horror. I
      went up to them, and they began to utter shrill screams, while La
      Jean-Jean, whose burned leg could no longer support her, fell to the
      ground at full length.

Sister Saint-Benedict left the dead man, ran up to her infirm old women,
      and without a word or a look for me, wrapped their shawls round them, gave
      them their crutches, pushed them to the door, made them go out, and
      disappeared with them into the dark night.

I saw that I could not even let a hussar accompany them, for the mere
      rattle of a sword would have sent them mad with fear.

I have no news. We live in the drawing-room, looking out at the rain. We
      cannot go out in this frightful weather, so we have theatricals. How
      stupid they are, my dear, these drawing entertainments in the repertory of
      real life! All is forced, coarse, heavy. The jokes are like cannon balls,
      smashing everything in their passage. No wit, nothing natural, no
      sprightliness, no elegance. These literary men, in truth, know nothing of
      society. They are perfectly ignorant of how people think and talk in our
      set. I do not mind if they despise our customs, our conventionalities, but
      I do not forgive them for not knowing them. When they want to be humorous
      they make puns that would do for a barrack; when they try to be jolly,
      they give us jokes that they must have picked up on the outer boulevard in
      those beer houses artists are supposed to frequent, where one has heard
      the same students'' jokes for fifty years.

So we have taken to Theatricals. As we are only two women, my husband
      takes the part of a soubrette, and, in order to do that, he has shaved off
      his mustache. You cannot imagine, my dear Lucy, how it changes him! I no
      longer recognize him-by day or at night. If he did not let it grow again I
      think I should no longer love him; he looks so horrid like this.

In fact, a man without a mustache is no longer a man. I do not care much
      for a beard; it almost always makes a man look untidy. But a mustache, oh,
      a mustache is indispensable to a manly face. No, you would never believe
      how these little hair bristles on the upper lip are a relief to the eye
      and good in other ways. I have thought over the matter a great deal but
      hardly dare to write my thoughts. Words look so different on paper and the
      subject is so difficult, so delicate, so dangerous that it requires
      infinite skill to tackle it.

Well, when my husband appeared, shaven, I understood at once that I never
      could fall in love with a strolling actor nor a preacher, even if it were
      Father Didon, the most charming of all! Later when I was alone with him
      (my husband) it was worse still. Oh, my dear Lucy, never let yourself be
      kissed by a man without a mustache; their kisses have no flavor, none
      whatever! They no longer have the charm, the mellowness and the snap
      —yes, the snap—of a real kiss. The mustache is the spice.

Imagine placing to your lips a piece of dry—or moist—parchment.
      That is the kiss of the man without a mustache. It is not worth while.

Whence comes this charm of the mustache, will you tell me? Do I know
      myself? It tickles your face, you feel it approaching your mouth and it
      sends a little shiver through you down to the tips of your toes.

And on your neck! Have you ever felt a mustache on your neck? It
      intoxicates you, makes you feel creepy, goes to the tips of your fingers.
      You wriggle, shake your shoulders, toss back your head. You wish to get
      away and at the same time to remain there; it is delightful, but
      irritating. But how good it is!

A lip without a mustache is like a body without clothing; and one must
      wear clothes, very few, if you like, but still some clothing.

I recall a sentence (uttered by a politician) which has been running in my
      mind for three months. My husband, who keeps up with the newspapers, read
      me one evening a very singular speech by our Minister of Agriculture, who
      was called M. Meline. He may have been superseded by this time. I do not
      know.

I was paying no attention, but the name Meline struck me. It recalled, I
      do not exactly know why, the ''Scenes de la vie de boheme''. I thought it
      was about some grisette. That shows how scraps of the speech entered my
      mind. This M. Meline was making this statement to the people of Amiens, I
      believe, and I have ever since been trying to understand what he meant:
      “There is no patriotism without agriculture!” Well, I have
      just discovered his meaning, and I affirm in my turn that there is no love
      without a mustache. When you say it that way it sounds comical, does it
      not?

“There is no patriotism without agriculture,” said M. Meline,
      and he was right, that minister; I now understand why.

From a very different point of view the mustache is essential. It gives
      character to the face. It makes a man look gentle, tender, violent, a
      monster, a rake, enterprising! The hairy man, who does not shave off his
      whiskers, never has a refined look, for his features are concealed; and
      the shape of the jaw and the chin betrays a great deal to those who
      understand.

The man with a mustache retains his own peculiar expression and his
      refinement at the same time.

And how many different varieties of mustaches there are! Sometimes they
      are twisted, curled, coquettish. Those seem to be chiefly devoted to
      women.

Sometimes they are pointed, sharp as needles, and threatening. That kind
      prefers wine, horses and war.

Sometimes they are enormous, overhanging, frightful. These big ones
      generally conceal a fine disposition, a kindliness that borders on
      weakness and a gentleness that savors of timidity.

But what I adore above all in the mustache is that it is French,
      altogether French. It came from our ancestors, the Gauls, and has remained
      the insignia of our national character.

It is boastful, gallant and brave. It sips wine gracefully and knows how
      to laugh with refinement, while the broad-bearded jaws are clumsy in
      everything they do.

I recall something that made me weep all my tears and also—I see it
      now—made me love a mustache on a man''s face.

It was during the war, when I was living with my father. I was a young
      girl then. One day there was a skirmish near the chateau. I had heard the
      firing of the cannon and of the artillery all the morning, and that
      evening a German colonel came and took up his abode in our house. He left
      the following day.

My father was informed that there were a number of dead bodies in the
      fields. He had them brought to our place so that they might be buried
      together. They were laid all along the great avenue of pines as fast as
      they brought them in, on both sides of the avenue, and as they began to
      smell unpleasant, their bodies were covered with earth until the deep
      trench could be dug. Thus one saw only their heads which seemed to
      protrude from the clayey earth and were almost as yellow, with their
      closed eyes.

I wanted to see them. But when I saw those two rows of frightful faces, I
      thought I should faint. However, I began to look at them, one by one,
      trying to guess what kind of men these had been.

The uniforms were concealed beneath the earth, and yet immediately, yes,
      immediately, my dear, I recognized the Frenchmen by their mustache!

Some of them had shaved on the very day of the battle, as though they
      wished to be elegant up to the last; others seemed to have a week''s
      growth, but all wore the French mustache, very plain, the proud mustache
      that seems to say: “Do not take me for my bearded friend, little
      one; I am a brother.”

And I cried, oh, I cried a great deal more than I should if I had not
      recognized them, the poor dead fellows.

The first thing I did was to look at the clock as I entered the
      waiting-room of the station at Loubain, and I found that I had to wait two
      hours and ten minutes for the Paris express.

I had walked twenty miles and felt suddenly tired. Not seeing anything on
      the station walls to amuse me, I went outside and stood there racking my
      brains to think of something to do. The street was a kind of boulevard,
      planted with acacias, and on either side a row of houses of varying shape
      and different styles of architecture, houses such as one only sees in a
      small town, and ascended a slight hill, at the extreme end of which there
      were some trees, as though it ended in a park.

From time to time a cat crossed the street and jumped over the gutters
      carefully. A cur sniffed at every tree and hunted for scraps from the
      kitchens, but I did not see a single human being, and I felt listless and
      disheartened. What could I do with myself? I was already thinking of the
      inevitable and interminable visit to the small cafe at the railway
      station, where I should have to sit over a glass of undrinkable beer and
      the illegible newspaper, when I saw a funeral procession coming out of a
      side street into the one in which I was, and the sight of the hearse was a
      relief to me. It would, at any rate, give me something to do for ten
      minutes.

Suddenly, however, my curiosity was aroused. The hearse was followed by
      eight gentlemen, one of whom was weeping, while the others were chatting
      together, but there was no priest, and I thought to myself:

“This is a non-religious funeral,” and then I reflected that a
      town like Loubain must contain at least a hundred freethinkers, who would
      have made a point of making a manifestation. What could it be, then? The
      rapid pace of the procession clearly proved that the body was to be buried
      without ceremony, and, consequently, without the intervention of the
      Church.

My idle curiosity framed the most complicated surmises, and as the hearse
      passed me, a strange idea struck me, which was to follow it, with the
      eight gentlemen. That would take up my time for an hour, at least, and I
      accordingly walked with the others, with a sad look on my face, and, on
      seeing this, the two last turned round in surprise, and then spoke to each
      other in a low voice.

No doubt they were asking each other whether I belonged to the town, and
      then they consulted the two in front of them, who stared at me in turn.
      This close scrutiny annoyed me, and to put an end to it I went up to them,
      and, after bowing, I said:

“I beg your pardon, gentlemen, for interrupting your conversation,
      but, seeing a civil funeral, I have followed it, although I did not know
      the deceased gentleman whom you are accompanying.”

The other gentleman, who evidently wished to tell me all about it, then
      said: “Yes and no. The clergy have refused to allow us the use of
      the church.”

On hearing this I uttered a prolonged “A-h!” of astonishment.
      I could not understand it at all, but my obliging neighbor continued:

“It is rather a long story. This young woman committed suicide, and
      that is the reason why she cannot be buried with any religious ceremony.
      The gentleman who is walking first, and who is crying, is her husband.”

“You surprise and interest me very much, monsieur. Shall I be
      indiscreet if I ask you to tell me the facts of the case? If I am
      troubling you, forget that I have said anything about the matter.”

“Not at all, not at all. Let us linger a little behind the others,
      and I will tell it you, although it is a very sad story. We have plenty of
      time before getting to the cemetery, the trees of which you see up yonder,
      for it is a stiff pull up this hill.”

“This young woman, Madame Paul Hamot, was the daughter of a wealthy
      merchant in the neighborhood, Monsieur Fontanelle. When she was a mere
      child of eleven, she had a shocking adventure; a footman attacked her and
      she nearly died. A terrible criminal case was the result, and the man was
      sentenced to penal servitude for life.

“The little girl grew up, stigmatized by disgrace, isolated, without
      any companions; and grown-up people would scarcely kiss her, for they
      thought that they would soil their lips if they touched her forehead, and
      she became a sort of monster, a phenomenon to all the town. People said to
      each other in a whisper: ''You know, little Fontanelle,'' and everybody
      turned away in the streets when she passed. Her parents could not even get
      a nurse to take her out for a walk, as the other servants held aloof from
      her, as if contact with her would poison everybody who came near her.

“It was pitiable to see the poor child go and play every afternoon.
      She remained quite by herself, standing by her maid and looking at the
      other children amusing themselves. Sometimes, yielding to an irresistible
      desire to mix with the other children, she advanced timidly, with nervous
      gestures, and mingled with a group, with furtive steps, as if conscious of
      her own disgrace. And immediately the mothers, aunts and nurses would come
      running from every seat and take the children entrusted to their care by
      the hand and drag them brutally away.

“Little Fontanelle remained isolated, wretched, without
      understanding what it meant, and then she began to cry, nearly heartbroken
      with grief, and then she used to run and hide her head in her nurse''s lap,
      sobbing.

“As she grew up, it was worse still. They kept the girls from her,
      as if she were stricken with the plague. Remember that she had nothing to
      learn, nothing; that she no longer had the right to the symbolical wreath
      of orange-flowers; that almost before she could read she had penetrated
      that redoubtable mystery which mothers scarcely allow their daughters to
      guess at, trembling as they enlighten them on the night of their marriage.

“When she went through the streets, always accompanied by her
      governess, as if, her parents feared some fresh, terrible adventure, with
      her eyes cast down under the load of that mysterious disgrace which she
      felt was always weighing upon her, the other girls, who were not nearly so
      innocent as people thought, whispered and giggled as they looked at her
      knowingly, and immediately turned their heads absently, if she happened to
      look at them. People scarcely greeted her; only a few men bowed to her,
      and the mothers pretended not to see her, while some young blackguards
      called her Madame Baptiste, after the name of the footman who had attacked
      her.

“Nobody knew the secret torture of her mind, for she hardly ever
      spoke, and never laughed, and her parents themselves appeared
      uncomfortable in her presence, as if they bore her a constant grudge for
      some irreparable fault.

“An honest man would not willingly give his hand to a liberated
      convict, would he, even if that convict were his own son? And Monsieur and
      Madame Fontanelle looked on their daughter as they would have done on a
      son who had just been released from the hulks. She was pretty and pale,
      tall, slender, distinguished-looking, and she would have pleased me very
      much, monsieur, but for that unfortunate affair.

“Well, when a new sub-prefect was appointed here, eighteen months
      ago, he brought his private secretary with him. He was a queer sort of
      fellow, who had lived in the Latin Quarter, it appears. He saw
      Mademoiselle Fontanelle and fell in love with her, and when told of what
      occurred, he merely said:

“''Bah! That is just a guarantee for the future, and I would rather
      it should have happened before I married her than afterward. I shall live
      tranquilly with that woman.''

“He paid his addresses to her, asked for her hand and married her,
      and then, not being deficient in assurance, he paid wedding calls, as if
      nothing had happened. Some people returned them, others did not; but, at
      last, the affair began to be forgotten, and she took her proper place in
      society.

“She adored her husband as if he had been a god; for, you must
      remember, he had restored her to honor and to social life, had braved
      public opinion, faced insults, and, in a word, performed such a courageous
      act as few men would undertake, and she felt the most exalted and tender
      love for him.

“When she became enceinte, and it was known, the most particular
      people and the greatest sticklers opened their doors to her, as if she had
      been definitely purified by maternity.

“It is strange, but so it is, and thus everything was going on as
      well as possible until the other day, which was the feast of the patron
      saint of our town. The prefect, surrounded by his staff and the
      authorities, presided at the musical competition, and when he had finished
      his speech the distribution of medals began, which Paul Hamot, his private
      secretary, handed to those who were entitled to them.

“As you know, there are always jealousies and rivalries, which make
      people forget all propriety. All the ladies of the town were there on the
      platform, and, in his turn, the bandmaster from the village of Mourmillon
      came up. This band was only to receive a second-class medal, for one
      cannot give first-class medals to everybody, can one? But when the private
      secretary handed him his badge, the man threw it in his face and
      exclaimed:

“''You may keep your medal for Baptiste. You owe him a first-class
      one, also, just as you do me.''

“There were a number of people there who began to laugh. The common
      herd are neither charitable nor refined, and every eye was turned toward
      that poor lady. Have you ever seen a woman going mad, monsieur? Well, we
      were present at the sight! She got up and fell back on her chair three
      times in succession, as if she wished to make her escape, but saw that she
      could not make her way through the crowd, and then another voice in the
      crowd exclaimed:

“And a great uproar, partly of laughter and partly of indignation,
      arose. The word was repeated over and over again; people stood on tiptoe
      to see the unhappy woman''s face; husbands lifted their wives up in their
      arms, so that they might see her, and people asked:

“She did not move now on her state chair, but sat just as if she had
      been put there for the crowd to look at. She could not move, nor conceal
      herself, nor hide her face. Her eyelids blinked quickly, as if a vivid
      light were shining on them, and she breathed heavily, like a horse that is
      going up a steep hill, so that it almost broke one''s heart to see her.
      Meanwhile, however, Monsieur Hamot had seized the ruffian by the throat,
      and they were rolling on the ground together, amid a scene of
      indescribable confusion, and the ceremony was interrupted.

“An hour later, as the Hamots were returning home, the young woman,
      who had not uttered a word since the insult, but who was trembling as if
      all her nerves had been set in motion by springs, suddenly sprang over the
      parapet of the bridge and threw herself into the river before her husband
      could prevent her. The water is very deep under the arches, and it was two
      hours before her body was recovered. Of course, she was dead.”

“It was, perhaps, the best thing she could do under the
      circumstances. There are some things which cannot be wiped out, and now
      you understand why the clergy refused to have her taken into church. Ah!
      If it had been a religious funeral the whole town would have been present,
      but you can understand that her suicide added to the other affair and made
      families abstain from attending her funeral; and then, it is not an easy
      matter here to attend a funeral which is performed without religious
      rites.”

We passed through the cemetery gates and I waited, much moved by what I
      had heard, until the coffin had been lowered into the grave, before I went
      up to the poor fellow who was sobbing violently, to press his hand warmly.
      He looked at me in surprise through his tears and then said:

This subject of Latin that has been dinned into our ears for some time
      past recalls to my mind a story—a story of my youth.

I was finishing my studies with a teacher, in a big central town, at the
      Institution Robineau, celebrated through the entire province for the
      special attention paid there to the study of Latin.

For the past ten years, the Robineau Institute beat the imperial lycee of
      the town at every competitive examination, and all the colleges of the
      subprefecture, and these constant successes were due, they said, to an
      usher, a simple usher, M. Piquedent, or rather Pere Piquedent.

He was one of those middle-aged men quite gray, whose real age it is
      impossible to tell, and whose history we can guess at first glance. Having
      entered as an usher at twenty into the first institution that presented
      itself so that he could proceed to take first his degree of Master of Arts
      and afterward the degree of Doctor of Laws, he found himself so enmeshed
      in this routine that he remained an usher all his life. But his love for
      Latin did not leave him and harassed him like an unhealthy passion. He
      continued to read the poets, the prose writers, the historians, to
      interpret them and penetrate their meaning, to comment on them with a
      perseverance bordering on madness.

One day, the idea came into his head to oblige all the students in his
      class to answer him in Latin only; and he persisted in this resolution
      until at last they were capable of sustaining an entire conversation with
      him just as they would in their mother tongue. He listened to them, as a
      leader of an orchestra listens to his musicians rehearsing, and striking
      his desk every moment with his ruler, he exclaimed:

“Monsieur Plantel, your way of expressing yourself is altogether
      French and in no way Latin. You must understand the genius of a language.
      Look here, listen to me.”

Now, it came to pass that the pupils of the Institution Robineau carried
      off, at the end of the year, all the prizes for composition, translation,
      and Latin conversation.

Next year, the principal, a little man, as cunning as an ape, whom he
      resembled in his grinning and grotesque appearance, had had printed on his
      programmes, on his advertisements, and painted on the door of his
      institution:

“Two honor prizes at the general examinations in competition with
      all the lycees and colleges of France.”

For ten years the Institution Robineau triumphed in the same fashion. Now
      my father, allured by these successes, sent me as a day pupil to
      Robineau''s—or, as we called it, Robinetto or Robinettino''s—and
      made me take special private lessons from Pere Piquedent at the rate of
      five francs per hour, out of which the usher got two francs and the
      principal three francs. I was then eighteen, and was in the philosophy
      class.

These private lessons were given in a little room looking out on the
      street. It so happened that Pere Piquedent, instead of talking Latin to
      me, as he did when teaching publicly in the institution, kept telling me
      his troubles in French. Without relations, without friends, the poor man
      conceived an attachment to me, and poured out his misery to me.

The other ushers disgusted him. He knew nobody in the town, since he had
      no time to devote to making acquaintances.

“Not even the nights, my friend, and that is the hardest thing on
      me. The dream of my life is to have a room with my own furniture, my own
      books, little things that belong to myself and which others may not touch.
      And I have nothing of my own, nothing except my trousers and my
      frock-coat, nothing, not even my mattress and my pillow! I have not four
      walls to shut myself up in, except when I come to give a lesson in this
      room. Do you see what this means—a man forced to spend his life
      without ever having the right, without ever finding the time, to shut
      himself up all alone, no matter where, to think, to reflect, to work, to
      dream? Ah! my dear boy, a key, the key of a door which one can lock—this
      is happiness, mark you, the only happiness!

“Here, all day long, teaching all those restless rogues, and during
      the night the dormitory with the same restless rogues snoring. And I have
      to sleep in the bed at the end of two rows of beds occupied by these
      youngsters whom I must look after. I can never be alone, never! If I go
      out I find the streets full of people, and, when I am tired of walking, I
      go into some cafe crowded with smokers and billiard players. I tell you
      what, it is the life of a galley slave.”

“What, my little friend? I am not a shoemaker, or a joiner, or a
      hatter, or a baker, or a hairdresser. I only know Latin, and I have no
      diploma which would enable me to sell my knowledge at a high price. If I
      were a doctor I would sell for a hundred francs what I now sell for a
      hundred sous; and I would supply it probably of an inferior quality, for
      my title would be enough to sustain my reputation.”

“I have no rest in life except in the hours spent with you. Don''t be
      afraid! you''ll lose nothing by that. I''ll make it up to you in the
      class-room by making you speak twice as much Latin as the others.”

One day, I grew bolder, and offered him a cigarette. He stared at me in
      astonishment at first, then he gave a glance toward the door.

And we went and leaned our elbows on the windowsill looking on the street,
      holding concealed in our hands the little rolls of tobacco. Just opposite
      to us was a laundry. Four women in loose white waists were passing hot,
      heavy irons over the linen spread out before them, from which a warm steam
      arose.

Suddenly, another, a fifth, carrying on her arm a large basket which made
      her stoop, came out to take the customers their shirts, their
      handkerchiefs, and their sheets. She stopped on the threshold as if she
      were already fatigued; then, she raised her eyes, smiled as she saw us
      smoking, flung at us, with her left hand, which was free, the sly kiss
      characteristic of a free-and-easy working-woman, and went away at a slow
      place, dragging her feet as she went.

She was a woman of about twenty, small, rather thin, pale, rather pretty,
      with a roguish air and laughing eyes beneath her ill-combed fair hair.

And he spoke with emotion about the misery of the people. He had a heart
      which swelled with lofty democratic sentiment, and he referred to the
      fatiguing pursuits of the working class with phrases borrowed from
      Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and with sobs in his throat.

Next day, as we were leaning our elbows on the same window sill, the same
      woman perceived us and cried out to us:

“Good-day, scholars!” in a comical sort of tone, while she
      made a contemptuous gesture with her hands.

I flung her a cigarette, which she immediately began to smoke. And the
      four other ironers rushed out to the door with outstretched hands to get
      cigarettes also.

And each day a friendly intercourse was established between the
      working-women of the pavement and the idlers of the boarding school.

Pere Piquedent was really a comical sight. He trembled at being noticed,
      for he might lose his position; and he made timid and ridiculous gestures,
      quite a theatrical display of love signals, to which the women responded
      with a regular fusillade of kisses.

A perfidious idea came into my mind. One day, on entering our room, I said
      to the old usher in a low tone:

“You would not believe it, Monsieur Piquedent, I met the little
      washerwoman! You know the one I mean, the woman who had the basket, and I
      spoke to her!”

“She said to me—why, she said she thought you were very nice.
      The fact of the matter is, I believe, I believe, that she is a little in
      love with you.” I saw that he was growing pale.

But every day I pretended that I had met the little laundress and that I
      had spoken to her about him, so that in the end he believed me, and sent
      her ardent and earnest kisses.

Now it happened that one morning, on my way to the boarding school, I
      really came across her. I accosted her without hesitation, as if I had
      known her for the last ten years.

“Oh! no, I am not fooling! He keeps talking of you all through the
      lesson. I bet that he''ll marry you!”

She ceased laughing. The idea of marriage makes every girl serious. Then
      she repeated, with an incredulous air:

And he wrote a long letter, tenderly affectionate, full of phrases and
      circumlocutions, metaphors and similes, philosophy and academic gallantry;
      and I took on myself the responsibility of delivering it to the young
      woman.

“How well he writes! It is easy to see he has got education! Does he
      really mean to marry me?”

“She loves you, Monsieur Piquedent, and I believe her to be a decent
      girl. It is not right to lead her on and then abandon her.”

I confess I had at the time no plan. I was playing a practical joke a
      schoolboy joke, nothing more. I had been aware of the simplicity of the
      old usher, his innocence and his weakness. I amused myself without asking
      myself how it would turn out. I was eighteen, and I had been for a long
      time looked upon at the lycee as a sly practical joker.

So it was agreed that Pere Piquedent and I should set out in a hack for
      the ferry of Queue de Vache, that we should there pick up Angele, and that
      I should take them into my boat, for in those days I was fond of boating.
      I would then bring them to the Ile des Fleurs, where the three of us would
      dine. I had inflicted myself on them, the better to enjoy my triumph, and
      the usher, consenting to my arrangement, proved clearly that he was losing
      his head by thus risking the loss of his position.

When we arrived at the ferry, where my boat had been moored since morning,
      I saw in the grass, or rather above the tall weeds of the bank, an
      enormous red parasol, resembling a monstrous wild poppy. Beneath the
      parasol was the little laundress in her Sunday clothes. I was surprised.
      She was really pretty, though pale; and graceful, though with a rather
      suburban grace.

Pere Piquedent raised his hat and bowed. She put out her hand toward him,
      and they stared at one another without uttering a word. Then they stepped
      into my boat, and I took the oars. They were seated side by side near the
      stern.

She dipped her hand into the water, skimming the surface, making a thin,
      transparent film like a sheet of glass, which made a soft plashing along
      the side of the boat.

When they were in the restaurant, she took it on herself to speak, and
      ordered dinner, fried fish, a chicken, and salad; then she led us on
      toward the isle, which she knew perfectly.

Until dessert, no question of love arose. I had treated them to champagne,
      and Pere Piquedent was tipsy. Herself slightly the worse, she called out
      to him:

It was thus that these two silly creatures promised marriage to each other
      through the trick of a young scamp. But I did not believe that it was
      serious, nor, indeed, did they, perhaps.

“What do I know? We shall see. With five thousand francs we could do
      many things. You don''t want me to go and live in your boarding school, do
      you?”

“Then we''ll buy a grocer''s shop! Oh! what luck! we''ll buy a grocer''s
      shop. Not on a big scale, of course; with five thousand francs one does
      not go far.”

We got back into the boat. The night was dark, very dark. I saw clearly,
      however, that he had caught her by the waist, and that they were hugging
      each other again and again.

It was a frightful catastrophe. Our escapade was discovered, with the
      result that Pere Piquedent was dismissed. And my father, in a fit of
      anger, sent me to finish my course of philosophy at Ribaudet''s school.

Six months later I took my degree of Bachelor of Arts. Then I went to
      study law in Paris, and did not return to my native town till two years
      later.

At the corner of the Rue de Serpent a shop caught my eye. Over the door
      were the words: “Colonial Products—Piquedent”; then
      underneath, so as to enlighten the most ignorant: “Grocery.”

Piquedent raised his head, left his female customer, and rushed toward me
      with outstretched hands.

A beautiful woman, very plump, abruptly left the cashier''s desk and flung
      herself on my breast. I had some difficulty in recognizing her, she had
      grown so stout.

It was nothing but an accident, an accident pure and simple. On that
      particular evening the princess'' rooms were open, and as they appeared
      dark after the brilliantly lighted parlors, Baron d''Etraille, who was
      tired of standing, inadvertently wandered into an empty bedroom.

He looked round for a chair in which to have a doze, as he was sure his
      wife would not leave before daylight. As soon as he became accustomed to
      the light of the room he distinguished the big bed with its azure-and-gold
      hangings, in the middle of the great room, looking like a catafalque in
      which love was buried, for the princess was no longer young. Behind it, a
      large bright surface looked like a lake seen at a distance. It was a large
      mirror, discreetly covered with dark drapery, that was very rarely let
      down, and seemed to look at the bed, which was its accomplice. One might
      almost fancy that it had reminiscences, and that one might see in it
      charming female forms and the gentle movement of loving arms.

The baron stood still for a moment, smiling, almost experiencing an
      emotion on the threshold of this chamber dedicated to love. But suddenly
      something appeared in the looking-glass, as if the phantoms which he had
      evoked had risen up before him. A man and a woman who had been sitting on
      a low couch concealed in the shadow had arisen, and the polished surface,
      reflecting their figures, showed that they were kissing each other before
      separating.

Baron d''Etraille recognized his wife and the Marquis de Cervigne. He
      turned and went away like a man who is fully master of himself, and waited
      till it was day before taking away the baroness; but he had no longer any
      thoughts of sleeping.

“Madame, I saw you just now in Princesse de Raynes'' room; I need say
      no more, and I am not fond either of reproaches, acts of violence, or of
      ridicule. As I wish to avoid all such things, we shall separate without
      any scandal. Our lawyers will settle your position according to my orders.
      You will be free to live as you please when you are no longer under my
      roof; but, as you will continue to bear my name, I must warn you that
      should any scandal arise I shall show myself inflexible.”

He was more astonished and sad than unhappy. He had loved her dearly
      during the first period of their married life; but his ardor had cooled,
      and now he often amused himself elsewhere, either in a theatre or in
      society, though he always preserved a certain liking for the baroness.

She was very young, hardly four-and-twenty, small, slight—too slight—and
      very fair. She was a true Parisian doll: clever, spoiled, elegant,
      coquettish, witty, with more charm than real beauty. He used to say
      familiarly to his brother, when speaking of her:

“My wife is charming, attractive, but—there is nothing to lay
      hold of. She is like a glass of champagne that is all froth; when you get
      to the wine it is very good, but there is too little of it, unfortunately.”

He walked up and down the room in great agitation, thinking of a thousand
      things. At one moment he was furious, and felt inclined to give the
      marquis a good thrashing, or to slap his face publicly, in the club. But
      he decided that would not do, it would not be good form; he would be
      laughed at, and not his rival, and this thought wounded his vanity. So he
      went to bed, but could not sleep. Paris knew in a few days that the Baron
      and Baroness d''Etraille had agreed to an amicable separation on account of
      incompatibility of temper. No one suspected anything, no one laughed, and
      no one was astonished.

The baron, however, to avoid meeting his wife, travelled for a year, then
      spent the summer at the seaside, and the autumn in shooting, returning to
      Paris for the winter. He did not meet the baroness once.

He did not even know what people said about her. In any case, she took
      care to respect appearances, and that was all he asked for.

He became dreadfully bored, travelled again, restored his old castle of
      Villebosc, which took him two years; then for over a year he entertained
      friends there, till at last, tired of all these so-called pleasures, he
      returned to his mansion in the Rue de Lille, just six years after the
      separation.

He was now forty-five, with a good crop of gray hair, rather stout, and
      with that melancholy look characteristic of those who have been handsome,
      sought after, and liked, but who are deteriorating, daily.

A month after his return to Paris, he took cold on coming out of his club,
      and had such a bad cough that his medical man ordered him to Nice for the
      rest of the winter.

He reached the station only a few minutes before the departure of the
      train on Monday evening, and had barely time to get into a carriage, with
      only one other occupant, who was sitting in a corner so wrapped in furs
      and cloaks that he could not even make out whether it was a man or a
      woman, as nothing of the figure could be seen. When he perceived that he
      could not find out, he put on his travelling cap, rolled himself up in his
      rugs, and stretched out comfortably to sleep.

He did not wake until the day was breaking, and looked at once at his
      fellow-traveller, who had not stirred all night, and seemed still to be
      sound asleep.

M. d''Etraille made use of the opportunity to brush his hair and his beard,
      and to try to freshen himself up a little generally, for a night''s travel
      does not improve one''s appearance when one has attained a certain age.

As one grows older one wakes up in a very different condition. Dull eyes,
      red, swollen cheeks, dry lips, hair and beard disarranged, impart an old,
      fatigued, worn-out look to the face.

The engine whistled, the train stopped, and his neighbor moved. No doubt
      he was awake. They started off again, and then a slanting ray of sunlight
      shone into the carriage and on the sleeper, who moved again, shook
      himself, and then his face could be seen.

It was a young, fair, pretty, plump woman, and the baron looked at her in
      amazement. He did not know what to think. He could really have sworn that
      it was his wife, but wonderfully changed for the better: stouter —why
      she had grown as stout as he was, only it suited her much better than it
      did him.

She looked at him calmly, did not seem to recognize him, and then slowly
      laid aside her wraps. She had that quiet assurance of a woman who is sure
      of herself, who feels that on awaking she is in her full beauty and
      freshness.

The baron was really bewildered. Was it his wife, or else as like her as
      any sister could be? Not having seen her for six years, he might be
      mistaken.

She yawned, and this gesture betrayed her. She turned and looked at him
      again, calmly, indifferently, as if she scarcely saw him, and then looked
      out of the window again.

Yes; it was surely his wife. How could he possibly have doubted it? There
      could certainly not be two noses like that, and a thousand recollections
      flashed through his mind. He felt the old feeling of the intoxication of
      love stealing over him, and he called to mind the sweet odor of her skin,
      her smile when she put her arms on to his shoulders, the soft intonations
      of her voice, all her graceful, coaxing ways.

But how she had changed and improved! It was she and yet not she. She
      seemed riper, more developed, more of a woman, more seductive, more
      desirable, adorably desirable.

And this strange, unknown woman, whom he had accidentally met in a railway
      carriage, belonged to him; he had only to say to her:

He had formerly slept in her arms, existed only in her love, and now he
      had found her again certainly, but so changed that he scarcely knew her.
      It was another, and yet it was she herself. It was some one who had been
      born and had formed and grown since he had left her. It was she, indeed;
      she whom he had loved, but who was now altered, with a more assured smile
      and greater self-possession. There were two women in one, mingling a great
      part of what was new and unknown with many sweet recollections of the
      past. There was something singular, disturbing, exciting about it —a
      kind of mystery of love in which there floated a delicious confusion. It
      was his wife in a new body and in new flesh which lips had never pressed.

And he thought that in a few years nearly every thing changes in us; only
      the outline can be recognized, and sometimes even that disappears.

The blood, the hair, the skin, all changes and is renewed, and when people
      have not seen each other for a long time, when they meet they find each
      other totally different beings, although they are the same and bear the
      same name.

And the heart also can change. Ideas may be modified and renewed, so that
      in forty years of life we may, by gradual and constant transformations,
      become four or five totally new and different beings.

He dwelt on this thought till it troubled him; it had first taken
      possession of him when he surprised her in the princess'' room. He was not
      the least angry; it was not the same woman that he was looking at —that
      thin, excitable little doll of those days.

What was he to do? How should he address her? and what could he say to
      her? Had she recognized him?

The train stopped again. He got up, bowed, and said: “Bertha, do you
      want anything I could bring you?”

She looked at him from head to foot, and answered, without showing the
      slightest surprise, or confusion, or anger, but with the most perfect
      indifference:

He got out and walked up and down the platform a little in order to
      recover himself, and, as it were, to recover his senses after a fall. What
      should he do now? If he got into another carriage it would look as if he
      were running away. Should he be polite or importunate? That would look as
      if he were asking for forgiveness. Should he speak as if he were her
      master? He would look like a fool, and, besides, he really had no right to
      do so.

During his absence she had hastily arranged her dress and hair, and was
      now lying stretched out on the seat, radiant, and without showing any
      emotion.

He turned to her, and said: “My dear Bertha, since this singular
      chance has brought up together after a separation of six years—a
      quite friendly separation—are we to continue to look upon each other
      as irreconcilable enemies? We are shut up together, tete-a-tete, which is
      so much the better or so much the worse. I am not going to get into
      another carriage, so don''t you think it is preferable to talk as friends
      till the end of our journey?”

Then he suddenly stopped, really not knowing what to say; but as he had
      plenty of assurance, he sat down on the middle seat, and said:

“Well, I see I must pay my court to you; so much the better. It is,
      however, really a pleasure, for you are charming. You cannot imagine how
      you have improved in the last six years. I do not know any woman who could
      give me that delightful sensation which I experienced just now when you
      emerged from your wraps. I really could not have thought such a change
      possible.”

Without moving her head or looking at him, she said: “I cannot say
      the same with regard to you; you have certainly deteriorated a great deal.”

“Why?” was her reply. “I am only stating facts. I don''t
      suppose you intend to offer me your love? It must, therefore, be a matter
      of perfect indifference to you what I think about you. But I see it is a
      painful subject, so let us talk of something else. What have you been
      doing since I last saw you?”

He was very nearly saying something brutal, but he checked himself; and
      kissed his wife''s hand:

He went on: “As you have acceded to my first request, shall we now
      talk without any bitterness?”

“Bitterness? I don''t feel any; you are a complete stranger to me; I
      am only trying to keep up a difficult conversation.”

He was still looking at her, fascinated in spite of her harshness, and he
      felt seized with a brutal Beside, the desire of the master.

“I am forty-five”; and then he added: “I forgot to ask
      after Princesse de Raynes. Are you still intimate with her?”

“My dear Bertha, I have changed my mind. You are my wife, and I
      expect you to come with me to-day. You have, I think, improved both
      morally and physically, and I am going to take you back again. I am your
      husband, and it is my right to do so.”

She was stupefied, and looked at him, trying to divine his thoughts; but
      his face was resolute and impenetrable.

“So much the worse for you,” was his reply. “The law
      gives me the power, and I mean to use it.”

They were nearing Marseilles, and the train whistled and slackened speed.
      The baroness rose, carefully rolled up her wraps, and then, turning to her
      husband, said:

“My dear Raymond, do not make a bad use of this tete-a tete which I
      had carefully prepared. I wished to take precautions, according to your
      advice, so that I might have nothing to fear from you or from other
      people, whatever might happen. You are going to Nice, are you not?”

“Not at all; just listen to me, and I am sure that you will leave me
      in peace. In a few moments, when we get to the station, you will see the
      Princesse de Raynes and Comtesse Henriot waiting for me with their
      husbands. I wished them to see as, and to know that we had spent the night
      together in the railway carriage. Don''t be alarmed; they will tell it
      everywhere as a most surprising fact.

“I told you just now that I had most carefully followed your advice
      and saved appearances. Anything else does not matter, does it? Well, in
      order to do so, I wished to be seen with you. You told me carefully to
      avoid any scandal, and I am avoiding it, for, I am afraid—I am
      afraid—”

She waited till the train had quite stopped, and as her friends ran up to
      open the carriage door, she said:

The princess stretched out her arms to embrace her,—and the baroness
      said, painting to the baron, who was dumb with astonishment, and was
      trying to get at the truth:

“You do not recognize Raymond? He has certainly changed a good deal,
      and he agreed to come with me so that I might not travel alone. We take
      little trips like this occasionally, like good friends who cannot live
      together. We are going to separate here; he has had enough of me already.”

She put out her hand, which he took mechanically, and then she jumped out
      on to the platform among her friends, who were waiting for her.

The baron hastily shut the carriage door, for he was too much disturbed to
      say a word or come to any determination. He heard his wife''s voice and
      their merry laughter as they went away.

He never saw her again, nor did he ever discover whether she had told him
      a lie or was speaking the truth.

How is it that the sunlight gives us such joy? Why does this radiance when
      it falls on the earth fill us with the joy of living? The whole sky is
      blue, the fields are green, the houses all white, and our enchanted eyes
      drink in those bright colors which bring delight to our souls. And then
      there springs up in our hearts a desire to dance, to run, to sing, a happy
      lightness of thought, a sort of enlarged tenderness; we feel a longing to
      embrace the sun.

The blind, as they sit in the doorways, impassive in their eternal
      darkness, remain as calm as ever in the midst of this fresh gaiety, and,
      not understanding what is taking place around them, they continually check
      their dogs as they attempt to play.

When, at the close of the day, they are returning home on the arm of a
      young brother or a little sister, if the child says: “It was a very
      fine day!” the other answers: “I could notice that it was
      fine. Loulou wouldn''t keep quiet.”

I knew one of these men whose life was one of the most cruel martyrdoms
      that could possibly be conceived.

He was a peasant, the son of a Norman farmer. As long as his father and
      mother lived, he was more or less taken care of; he suffered little save
      from his horrible infirmity; but as soon as the old people were gone, an
      atrocious life of misery commenced for him. Dependent on a sister of his,
      everybody in the farmhouse treated him as a beggar who is eating the bread
      of strangers. At every meal the very food he swallowed was made a subject
      of reproach against him; he was called a drone, a clown, and although his
      brother-in-law had taken possession of his portion of the inheritance, he
      was helped grudgingly to soup, getting just enough to save him from
      starving.

His face was very pale and his two big white eyes looked like wafers. He
      remained unmoved at all the insults hurled at him, so reserved that one
      could not tell whether he felt them.

Moreover, he had never known any tenderness, his mother having always
      treated him unkindly and caring very little for him; for in country places
      useless persons are considered a nuisance, and the peasants would be glad
      to kill the infirm of their species, as poultry do.

As soon as he finished his soup he went and sat outside the door in summer
      and in winter beside the fireside, and did not stir again all the evening.
      He made no gesture, no movement; only his eyelids, quivering from some
      nervous affection, fell down sometimes over his white, sightless orbs. Had
      he any intellect, any thinking faculty, any consciousness of his own
      existence? Nobody cared to inquire.

For some years things went on in this fashion. But his incapacity for work
      as well as his impassiveness eventually exasperated his relatives, and he
      became a laughingstock, a sort of butt for merriment, a prey to the inborn
      ferocity, to the savage gaiety of the brutes who surrounded him.

It is easy to imagine all the cruel practical jokes inspired by his
      blindness. And, in order to have some fun in return for feeding him, they
      now converted his meals into hours of pleasure for the neighbors and of
      punishment for the helpless creature himself.

The peasants from the nearest houses came to this entertainment; it was
      talked about from door to door, and every day the kitchen of the farmhouse
      was full of people. Sometimes they placed before his plate, when he was
      beginning to eat his soup, some cat or dog. The animal instinctively
      perceived the man''s infirmity, and, softly approaching, commenced eating
      noiselessly, lapping up the soup daintily; and, when they lapped the food
      rather noisily, rousing the poor fellow''s attention, they would prudently
      scamper away to avoid the blow of the spoon directed at random by the
      blind man!

Then the spectators ranged along the wall would burst out laughing, nudge
      each other and stamp their feet on the floor. And he, without ever
      uttering a word, would continue eating with his right hand, while
      stretching out his left to protect his plate.

Another time they made him chew corks, bits of wood, leaves or even filth,
      which he was unable to distinguish.

After this they got tired even of these practical jokes, and the
      brother-in-law, angry at having to support him always, struck him, cuffed
      him incessantly, laughing at his futile efforts to ward off or return the
      blows. Then came a new pleasure—the pleasure of smacking his face.
      And the plough-men, the servant girls and even every passing vagabond were
      every moment giving him cuffs, which caused his eyelashes to twitch
      spasmodically. He did not know where to hide himself and remained with his
      arms always held out to guard against people coming too close to him.

He was placed somewhere on the high-road on market-days, and as soon as he
      heard the sound of footsteps or the rolling of a vehicle, he reached out
      his hat, stammering:

One winter the ground was covered with snow, and it was freezing hard. His
      brother-in-law led him one morning a great distance along the high road in
      order that he might solicit alms. The blind man was left there all day;
      and when night came on, the brother-in-law told the people of his house
      that he could find no trace of the mendicant. Then he added:

“Pooh! best not bother about him! He was cold and got someone to
      take him away. Never fear! he''s not lost. He''ll turn up soon enough
      tomorrow to eat the soup.”

After long hours of waiting, stiffened with the cold, feeling that he was
      dying, the blind man began to walk. Being unable to find his way along the
      road, owing to its thick coating of ice, he went on at random, falling
      into ditches, getting up again, without uttering a sound, his sole object
      being to find some house where he could take shelter.

But, by degrees, the descending snow made a numbness steal over him, and
      his feeble limbs being incapable of carrying him farther, he sat down in
      the middle of an open field. He did not get up again.

The white flakes which fell continuously buried him, so that his body,
      quite stiff and stark, disappeared under the incessant accumulation of
      their rapidly thickening mass, and nothing was left to indicate the place
      where he lay.

His relatives made a pretence of inquiring about him and searching for him
      for about a week. They even made a show of weeping.

The winter was severe, and the thaw did not set in quickly. Now, one
      Sunday, on their way to mass, the farmers noticed a great flight of crows,
      who were whirling incessantly above the open field, and then descending
      like a shower of black rain at the same spot, ever going and coming.

The following week these gloomy birds were still there. There was a crowd
      of them up in the air, as if they had gathered from all corners of the
      horizon, and they swooped down with a great cawing into the shining snow,
      which they covered like black patches, and in which they kept pecking
      obstinately. A young fellow went to see what they were doing and
      discovered the body of the blind man, already half devoured, mangled. His
      wan eyes had disappeared, pecked out by the long, voracious beaks.

And I can never feel the glad radiance of sunlit days without sadly
      remembering and pondering over the fate of the beggar who was such an
      outcast in life that his horrible death was a relief to all who had known
      him.

They had loved each other before marriage with a pure and lofty love. They
      had first met on the sea-shore. He had thought this young girl charming,
      as she passed by with her light-colored parasol and her dainty dress amid
      the marine landscape against the horizon. He had loved her, blond and
      slender, in these surroundings of blue ocean and spacious sky. He could
      not distinguish the tenderness which this budding woman awoke in him from
      the vague and powerful emotion which the fresh salt air and the grand
      scenery of surf and sunshine and waves aroused in his soul.

She, on the other hand, had loved him because he courted her, because he
      was young, rich, kind, and attentive. She had loved him because it is
      natural for young girls to love men who whisper sweet nothings to them.

So, for three months, they had lived side by side, and hand in hand. The
      greeting which they exchanged in the morning before the bath, in the
      freshness of the morning, or in the evening on the sand, under the stars,
      in the warmth of a calm night, whispered low, very low, already had the
      flavor of kisses, though their lips had never met.

Each dreamed of the other at night, each thought of the other on awaking,
      and, without yet having voiced their sentiments, each longing for the
      other, body and soul.

After marriage their love descended to earth. It was at first a tireless,
      sensuous passion, then exalted tenderness composed of tangible poetry,
      more refined caresses, and new and foolish inventions. Every glance and
      gesture was an expression of passion.

But, little by little, without even noticing it, they began to get tired
      of each other. Love was still strong, but they had nothing more to reveal
      to each other, nothing more to learn from each other, no new tale of
      endearment, no unexpected outburst, no new way of expressing the
      well-known, oft-repeated verb.

They tried, however, to rekindle the dwindling flame of the first love.
      Every day they tried some new trick or desperate attempt to bring back to
      their hearts the uncooled ardor of their first days of married life. They
      tried moonlight walks under the trees, in the sweet warmth of the summer
      evenings: the poetry of mist-covered beaches; the excitement of public
      festivals.

He looked at her with a questioning glance, seeing that she was thinking
      of something which she did not wish to tell.

He smiled: “Of course, I understand—you mean in one of the
      cafes which are commonly called bohemian.”

“Yes, that''s it. But take me to one of the big places, one where you
      are known, one where you have already supped—no—dined—well,
      you know—I—I—oh! I will never dare say it!”

“Well, I—I—I want to be taken for your sweetheart—there!
      and I want the boys, who do not know that you are married, to take me for
      such; and you too—I want you to think that I am your sweetheart for
      one hour, in that place which must hold so many memories for you. There!
      And I will play that I am your sweetheart. It''s awful, I know—I am
      abominably ashamed, I am as red as a peony. Don''t look at me!”

Toward seven o''clock they went up the stairs of one of the big cafes on
      the Boulevard, he, smiling, with the look of a conqueror, she, timid,
      veiled, delighted. They were immediately shown to one of the luxurious
      private dining-rooms, furnished with four large arm-chairs and a red plush
      couch. The head waiter entered and brought them the menu. Paul handed it
      to his wife.

After handing his coat to the waiter, he ordered dinner and champagne. The
      waiter looked at the young woman and smiled. He took the order and
      murmured:

Henriette was pleased to hear that this man knew her husband''s name. They
      sat on the couch, side by side, and began to eat.

Ten candles lighted the room and were reflected in the mirrors all around
      them, which seemed to increase the brilliancy a thousand-fold. Henriette
      drank glass after glass in order to keep up her courage, although she felt
      dizzy after the first few glasses. Paul, excited by the memories which
      returned to him, kept kissing his wife''s hands. His eyes were sparkling.

She was feeling strangely excited in this new place, restless, pleased, a
      little guilty, but full of life. Two waiters, serious, silent, accustomed
      to seeing and forgetting everything, to entering the room only when it was
      necessary and to leaving it when they felt they were intruding, were
      silently flitting hither and thither.

Toward the middle of the dinner, Henriette was well under the influence of
      champagne. She was prattling along fearlessly, her cheeks flushed, her
      eyes glistening.

He hesitated, a little perplexed, not knowing whether he should hide his
      adventures or boast of them.

“Because it''s dreadful when you think of it—all those women—and
      always—always the same thing. Oh! it''s dreadful, just the same—more
      than a hundred women!”

He was surprised that she should think that dreadful, and answered, with
      the air of superiority which men take with women when they wish to make
      them understand that they have said something foolish:

“Because with one woman you have a real bond of love which attaches
      you to her, while with a hundred women it''s not the same at all. There is
      no real love. I don''t understand how a man can associate with such women.”

She remained thoughtful, staring at her champagne glass. It was full
      —she drank it in one gulp; then putting it back on the table, she
      threw her arms around her husband''s neck and murmured in his ear:

He threw his arms around her in a passionate embrace. A waiter, who was
      just entering, backed out, closing the door discreetly. In about five
      minutes the head waiter came back, solemn and dignified, bringing the
      fruit for dessert. She was once more holding between her fingers a full
      glass, and gazing into the amber liquid as though seeking unknown things.
      She murmured in a dreamy voice:

The small engine attached to the Neuilly steam-tram whistled as it passed
      the Porte Maillot to warn all obstacles to get out of its way and puffed
      like a person out of breath as it sent out its steam, its pistons moving
      rapidly with a noise as of iron legs running. The train was going along
      the broad avenue that ends at the Seine. The sultry heat at the close of a
      July day lay over the whole city, and from the road, although there was
      not a breath of wind stirring, there arose a white, chalky, suffocating,
      warm dust, which adhered to the moist skin, filled the eyes and got into
      the lungs. People stood in the doorways of their houses to try and get a
      breath of air.

The windows of the steam-tram were open and the curtains fluttered in the
      wind. There were very few passengers inside, because on warm days people
      preferred the outside or the platforms. They consisted of stout women in
      peculiar costumes, of those shopkeepers'' wives from the suburbs, who made
      up for the distinguished looks which they did not possess by ill-assumed
      dignity; of men tired from office-work, with yellow faces, stooped
      shoulders, and with one shoulder higher than the other, in consequence of,
      their long hours of writing at a desk. Their uneasy and melancholy faces
      also spoke of domestic troubles, of constant want of money, disappointed
      hopes, for they all belonged to the army of poor, threadbare devils who
      vegetate economically in cheap, plastered houses with a tiny piece of
      neglected garden on the outskirts of Paris, in the midst of those fields
      where night soil is deposited.

A short, corpulent man, with a puffy face, dressed all in black and
      wearing a decoration in his buttonhole, was talking to a tall, thin man,
      dressed in a dirty, white linen suit, the coat all unbuttoned, with a
      white Panama hat on his head. The former spoke so slowly and hesitatingly
      that it occasionally almost seemed as if he stammered; he was Monsieur
      Caravan, chief clerk in the Admiralty. The other, who had formerly been
      surgeon on board a merchant ship, had set up in practice in Courbevoie,
      where he applied the vague remnants of medical knowledge which he had
      retained after an adventurous life, to the wretched population of that
      district. His name was Chenet, and strange rumors were current as to his
      morality.

Monsieur Caravan had always led the normal life of a man in a Government
      office. For the last thirty years he had invariably gone the same way to
      his office every morning, and had met the same men going to business at
      the same time, and nearly on the same spot, and he returned home every
      evening by the same road, and again met the same faces which he had seen
      growing old. Every morning, after buying his penny paper at the corner of
      the Faubourg Saint Honore, he bought two rolls, and then went to his
      office, like a culprit who is giving himself up to justice, and got to his
      desk as quickly as possible, always feeling uneasy; as though he were
      expecting a rebuke for some neglect of duty of which he might have been
      guilty.

Nothing had ever occurred to change the monotonous order of his existence,
      for no event affected him except the work of his office, perquisites,
      gratuities, and promotion. He never spoke of anything but of his duties,
      either at the office, or at home—he had married the portionless
      daughter of one of his colleagues. His mind, which was in a state of
      atrophy from his depressing daily work, had no other thoughts, hopes or
      dreams than such as related to the office, and there was a constant source
      of bitterness that spoilt every pleasure that he might have had, and that
      was the employment of so many naval officials, tinsmiths, as they were
      called because of their silver-lace as first-class clerks; and every
      evening at dinner he discussed the matter hotly with his wife, who shared
      his angry feelings, and proved to their own satisfaction that it was in
      every way unjust to give places in Paris to men who ought properly to have
      been employed in the navy.

He was old now, and had scarcely noticed how his life was passing, for
      school had merely been exchanged for the office without any intermediate
      transition, and the ushers, at whom he had formerly trembled, were
      replaced by his chiefs, of whom he was terribly afraid. When he had to go
      into the rooms of these official despots, it made him tremble from head to
      foot, and that constant fear had given him a very awkward manner in their
      presence, a humble demeanor, and a kind of nervous stammering.

He knew nothing more about Paris than a blind man might know who was led
      to the same spot by his dog every day; and if he read the account of any
      uncommon events or scandals in his penny paper, they appeared to him like
      fantastic tales, which some pressman had made up out of his own head, in
      order to amuse the inferior employees. He did not read the political news,
      which his paper frequently altered as the cause which subsidized it might
      require, for he was not fond of innovations, and when he went through the
      Avenue of the Champs-Elysees every evening, he looked at the surging crowd
      of pedestrians, and at the stream of carriages, as a traveller might who
      has lost his way in a strange country.

As he had completed his thirty years of obligatory service that year, on
      the first of January, he had had the cross of the Legion of Honor bestowed
      upon him, which, in the semi-military public offices, is a recompense for
      the miserable slavery—the official phrase is, loyal services—of
      unfortunate convicts who are riveted to their desk. That unexpected
      dignity gave him a high and new idea of his own capacities, and altogether
      changed him. He immediately left off wearing light trousers and fancy
      waistcoats, and wore black trousers and long coats, on which his ribbon,
      which was very broad, showed off better. He got shaved every morning,
      manicured his nails more carefully, changed his linen every two days, from
      a legitimate sense of what was proper, and out of respect for the national
      Order, of which he formed a part, and from that day he was another
      Caravan, scrupulously clean, majestic and condescending.

At home, he said, “my cross,” at every moment, and he had
      become so proud of it, that he could not bear to see men wearing any other
      ribbon in their button-holes. He became especially angry on seeing strange
      orders: “Which nobody ought to be allowed to wear in France,”
      and he bore Chenet a particular grudge, as he met him on a tram-car every
      evening, wearing a decoration of one kind or another, white, blue, orange,
      or green.

The conversation of the two men, from the Arc de Triomphe to Neuilly, was
      always the same, and on that day they discussed, first of all, various
      local abuses which disgusted them both, and the Mayor of Neuilly received
      his full share of their censure. Then, as invariably happens in the
      company of medical men, Caravan began to enlarge on the chapter of illness,
      as in that manner, he hoped to obtain a little gratuitous advice, if he
      was careful not to show his hand. His mother had been causing him no
      little anxiety for some time; she had frequent and prolonged fainting
      fits, and, although she was ninety, she would not take care of herself.

Caravan grew quite tender-hearted when he mentioned her great age, and
      more than once asked Doctor Chenet, emphasizing the word doctor—although
      he was not fully qualified, being only an Offcier de Sante—whether
      he had often met anyone as old as that. And he rubbed his hands with
      pleasure; not, perhaps, that he cared very much about seeing the good
      woman last forever here on earth, but because the long duration of his
      mother''s life was, as it were an earnest of old age for himself, and he
      continued:

“In my family, we last long, and I am sure that, unless I meet with
      an accident, I shall not die until I am very old.”

The doctor looked at him with pity, and glanced for a moment at his
      neighbor''s red face, his short, thick neck, his “corporation,”
      as Chenet called it to himself, his two fat, flabby legs, and the
      apoplectic rotundity of the old official; and raising the white Panama hat
      from his head, he said with a snigger:

“I am not so sure of that, old fellow; your mother is as tough as
      nails, and I should say that your life is not a very good one.”

This rather upset Caravan, who did not speak again until the tram put them
      down at their destination, where the two friends got out, and Chenet asked
      his friend to have a glass of vermouth at the Cafe du Globe, opposite,
      which both of them were in the habit of frequenting. The proprietor, who
      was a friend of theirs, held out to them two fingers, which they shook
      across the bottles of the counter; and then they joined three of their
      friends, who were playing dominoes, and who had been there since midday.
      They exchanged cordial greetings, with the usual question: “Anything
      new?” And then the three players continued their game, and held out
      their hands without looking up, when the others wished them “Good-night,”
      and then they both went home to dinner.

Caravan lived in a small two-story house in Courbevaie, near where the
      roads meet; the ground floor was occupied by a hair-dresser. Two bed
      rooms, a dining-room and a kitchen, formed the whole of their apartments,
      and Madame Caravan spent nearly her whole time in cleaning them up, while
      her daughter, Marie-Louise, who was twelve, and her son, Phillip-Auguste,
      were running about with all the little, dirty, mischievous brats of the
      neighborhood, and playing in the gutter.

Caravan had installed his mother, whose avarice was notorious in the
      neighborhood, and who was terribly thin, in the room above them. She was
      always cross, and she never passed a day without quarreling and flying
      into furious tempers. She would apostrophize the neighbors, who were
      standing at their own doors, the coster-mongers, the street-sweepers, and
      the street-boys, in the most violent language; and the latter, to have
      their revenge, used to follow her at a distance when she went out, and
      call out rude things after her.

A little servant from Normandy, who was incredibly giddy and thoughtless,
      performed the household work, and slept on the second floor in the same
      room as the old woman, for fear of anything happening to her in the night.

When Caravan got in, his wife, who suffered from a chronic passion for
      cleaning, was polishing up the mahogany chairs that were scattered about
      the room with a piece of flannel. She always wore cotton gloves, and
      adorned her head with a cap ornamented with many colored ribbons, which
      was always tilted over one ear; and whenever anyone caught her polishing,
      sweeping, or washing, she used to say:

“I am not rich; everything is very simple in my house, but
      cleanliness is my luxury, and that is worth quite as much as any other.”

As she was gifted with sound, obstinate, practical common sense, she led
      her husband in everything. Every evening during dinner, and afterwards
      when they were in their room, they talked over the business of the office
      for a long time, and although she was twenty years younger than he was, he
      confided everything to her as if she took the lead, and followed her
      advice in every matter.

She had never been pretty, and now she had grown ugly; in addition to
      that, she was short and thin, while her careless and tasteless way of
      dressing herself concealed her few small feminine attractions, which might
      have been brought out if she had possessed any taste in dress. Her skirts
      were always awry, and she frequently scratched herself, no matter on what
      part of her person, totally indifferent as to who might see her, and so
      persistently, that anyone who saw her might think that she was suffering
      from something like the itch. The only adornments that she allowed herself
      were silk ribbons, which she had in great profusion, and of various colors
      mixed together, in the pretentious caps which she wore at home.

He fell into a chair, in consternation, for that was the fourth time on
      which he had forgotten a commission that he had promised to do for her.

“It is a fatality,” he said; “it is no good for me to
      think of it all day long, for I am sure to forget it in the evening.”

“Yes, a great piece of news; another tinsmith has been appointed
      second chief clerk.” She became very serious, and said:

“So he succeeds Ramon; this was the very post that I wanted you to
      have. And what about Ramon?”

“There is nothing more to be done in that shop now. And what is the
      name of the new commissioner?”

“''Bonassot-Toulon. Born in 1851. Student Commissioner in 1871.
      Sub-Commissioner in 1875.'' Has he been to sea?” she continued. At
      that question Caravan''s looks cleared up, and he laughed until his sides
      shook.

“As much as Balin—as much as Baffin, his chief.” And he
      added an old office joke, and laughed more than ever:

“It would not even do to send them by water to inspect the
      Point-du-Jour, for they would be sick on the penny steamboats on the
      Seine.”

But she remained as serious as if she had not heard him, and then she said
      in a low voice, as she scratched her chin:

“If we only had a Deputy to fall back upon. When the Chamber hears
      everything that is going on at the Admiralty, the Minister will be turned
      out——”

She was interrupted by a terrible noise on the stairs. Marie-Louise and
      Philippe-Auguste, who had just come in from the gutter, were slapping each
      other all the way upstairs. Their mother rushed at them furiously, and
      taking each of them by an arm she dragged them into the room, shaking them
      vigorously; but as soon as they saw their father, they rushed up to him,
      and he kissed them affectionately, and taking one of them on each knee,
      began to talk to them.

Philippe-Auguste was an ugly, ill-kempt little brat, dirty from head to
      foot, with the face of an idiot, and Marie-Louise was already like her
      mother—spoke like her, repeated her words, and even imitated her
      movements. She also asked him whether there was anything fresh at the
      office, and he replied merrily:

“Your friend, Ramon, who comes and dines here every Sunday, is going
      to leave us, little one. There is a new second head-clerk.”

He stopped laughing, and did not reply, and in order to create a
      diversion, he said, addressing his wife, who was cleaning the windows:

Madame Caravan left off rubbing, turned round pulled her cap up, as it had
      fallen quite on to her back, and said with trembling lips:

“Ah! yes; let us talk about your mother, for she has made a pretty
      scene. Just imagine: a short time ago Madame Lebaudin, the hairdresser''s
      wife, came upstairs to borrow a packet of starch of me, and, as I was not
      at home, your mother chased her out as though she were a beggar; but I
      gave it to the old woman. She pretended not to hear, as she always does
      when one tells her unpleasant truths, but she is no more deaf than I am,
      as you know. It is all a sham, and the proof of it is, that she went up to
      her own room immediately, without saying a word.”

Caravan, embarrassed, did not utter a word, and at that moment the little
      servant came in to announce dinner. In order to let his mother know, he
      took a broom-handle, which always stood in a corner, and rapped loudly on
      the ceiling three times, and then they went into the dining-room. Madame
      Caravan, junior, helped the soup, and waited for the old woman, but she
      did not come, and as the soup was getting cold, they began to eat slowly,
      and when their plates were empty, they waited again, and Madame Caravan,
      who was furious, attacked her husband:

Not knowing which side to take, he sent Marie-Louise to fetch her
      grandmother, and he sat motionless, with his eyes cast down, while his
      wife tapped her glass angrily with her knife. In about a minute, the door
      flew open suddenly, and the child came in again, out of breath and very
      pale, and said hurriedly:

Caravan jumped up, threw his table-napkin down, and rushed upstairs, while
      his wife, who thought it was some trick of her mother-in-law''s, followed
      more slowly, shrugging her shoulders, as if to express her doubt. When
      they got upstairs, however, they found the old woman lying at full length
      in the middle of the room; and when they turned her over, they saw that
      she was insensible and motionless, while her skin looked more wrinkled and
      yellow than usual, her eyes were closed, her teeth clenched, and her thin
      body was stiff.

“Bah! She has only fainted again, that is all, and she has done it
      to prevent us from dining comfortably, you may be sure of that.”

They put her on the bed, undressed her completely, and Caravan, his wife,
      and the servant began to rub her; but, in spite of their efforts, she did
      not recover consciousness, so they sent Rosalie, the servant, to fetch
      Doctor Chenet. He lived a long way off, on the quay, going towards
      Suresnes, and so it was a considerable time before he arrived. He came at
      last, however, and, after having looked at the old woman, felt her pulse,
      and listened for a heart beat, he said: “It is all over.”

Caravan threw himself on the body, sobbing violently; he kissed his
      mother''s rigid face, and wept so that great tears fell on the dead woman''s
      face like drops of water, and, naturally, Madame Caravan, junior, showed a
      decorous amount of grief, and uttered feeble moans as she stood behind her
      husband, while she rubbed her eyes vigorously.

But, suddenly, Caravan raised himself up, with his thin hair in disorder,
      and, looking very ugly in his grief, said:

The doctor stooped over the body, and, handling it with professional
      dexterity, as a shopkeeper might do, when showing off his goods, he said:

He raised the eyelid, and the old woman''s eye appeared altogether
      unaltered, unless, perhaps, the pupil was rather larger, and Caravan felt
      a severe shock at the sight. Then Monsieur Chenet took her thin arm,
      forced the fingers open, and said, angrily, as if he had been
      contradicted:

Caravan fell on the bed, and almost bellowed, while his wife, still
      whimpering, did what was necessary.

She brought the night-table, on which she spread a towel and placed four
      wax candles on it, which she lighted; then she took a sprig of box, which
      was hanging over the chimney glass, and put it between the four candles,
      in a plate, which she filled with clean water, as she had no holy water.
      But, after a moment''s rapid reflection, she threw a pinch of salt into the
      water, no doubt thinking she was performing some sort of act of
      consecration by doing that, and when she had finished, she remained
      standing motionless, and the doctor, who had been helping her, whispered
      to her:

She nodded assent, and, going up to her husband, who was still on his
      knees, sobbing, she raised him up by one arm, while Chenet took him by the
      other.

They put him into a chair, and his wife kissed his forehead, and then
      began to lecture him. Chenet enforced her words and preached firmness,
      courage, and resignation—the very things which are always wanting in
      such overwhelming misfortunes—and then both of them took him by the
      arms again and led him out.

He was crying like a great child, with convulsive sobs; his arms hanging
      down, and his legs weak, and he went downstairs without knowing what he
      was doing, and moving his feet mechanically. They put him into the chair
      which he always occupied at dinner, in front of his empty soup plate. And
      there he sat, without moving, his eyes fixed on his glass, and so
      stupefied with grief, that he could not even think.

In a corner, Madame Caravan was talking with the doctor and asking what
      the necessary formalities were, as she wanted to obtain practical
      information. At last, Monsieur Chenet, who appeared to be waiting for
      something, took up his hat and prepared to go, saying that he had not
      dined yet; whereupon she exclaimed:

“What! you have not dined? Why, stay here, doctor; don''t go. You
      shall have whatever we have, for, of course, you understand that we do not
      fare sumptuously.” He made excuses and refused, but she persisted,
      and said: “You really must stay; at times like this, people like to
      have friends near them, and, besides that, perhaps you will be able to
      persuade my husband to take some nourishment; he must keep up his
      strength.”

She gave Rosalie, who seemed to have lost her head, some orders, and then
      sat down, “to pretend to eat,” as she said, “to keep the
      doctor company.”

The soup was brought in again, and Monsieur Chenet took two helpings. Then
      there came a dish of tripe, which exhaled a smell of onions, and which
      Madame Caravan made up her mind to taste.

“It is excellent,” the doctor said, at which she smiled, and,
      turning to her husband, she said:

“Do take a little, my poor Alfred, only just to put something in
      your stomach. Remember that you have got to pass the night watching by
      her!”

He held out his plate, docilely, just as he would have gone to bed, if he
      had been told to, obeying her in everything, without resistance and
      without reflection, and he ate; the doctor helped himself three times,
      while Madame Caravan, from time to time, fished out a large piece at the
      end of her fork, and swallowed it with a sort of studied indifference.

“By Jove! That is what I am very fond of.” And this time,
      Madame Caravan helped everybody. She even filled the saucers that were
      being scraped by the children, who, being left to themselves, had been
      drinking wine without any water, and were now kicking each other under the
      table.

Chenet remembered that Rossini, the composer, had been very fond of that
      Italian dish, and suddenly he exclaimed:

Nobody listened to him, however. Madame Caravan, who had suddenly grown
      thoughtful, was thinking of all the probable consequences of the event,
      while her husband made bread pellets, which he put on the table-cloth, and
      looked at with a fixed, idiotic stare. As he was devoured by thirst, he
      was continually raising his glass full of wine to his lips, and the
      consequence was that his mind, which had been upset by the shock and
      grief, seemed to become vague, and his ideas danced about as digestion
      commenced.

The doctor, who, meanwhile, had been drinking away steadily, was getting
      visibly drunk, and Madame Caravan herself felt the reaction which follows
      all nervous shocks, and was agitated and excited, and, although she had
      drunk nothing but water, her head felt rather confused.

Presently, Chenet began to relate stories of death that appeared comical
      to him. For in that suburb of Paris, that is full of people from the
      provinces, one finds that indifference towards death which all peasants
      show, were it even their own father or mother; that want of respect, that
      unconscious brutality which is so common in the country, and so rare in
      Paris, and he said:

“Why, I was sent for last week to the Rue du Puteaux, and when I
      went, I found the patient dead and the whole family calmly sitting beside
      the bed finishing a bottle of aniseed cordial, which had been bought the
      night before to satisfy the dying man''s fancy.”

But Madame Caravan was not listening; she was continually thinking of the
      inheritance, and Caravan was incapable of understanding anything further.

Coffee was presently served, and it had been made very strong to give them
      courage. As every cup was well flavored with cognac, it made all their
      faces red, and confused their ideas still more. To make matters still
      worse, Chenet suddenly seized the brandy bottle and poured out “a
      drop for each of them just to wash their mouths out with,” as he
      termed it, and then, without speaking any more, overcome in spite of
      themselves, by that feeling of animal comfort which alcohol affords after
      dinner, they slowly sipped the sweet cognac, which formed a yellowish
      syrup at the bottom of their cups.

The children had fallen asleep, and Rosalie carried them off to bed.
      Caravan, mechanically obeying that wish to forget oneself which possesses
      all unhappy persons, helped himself to brandy again several times, and his
      dull eyes grew bright. At last the doctor rose to go, and seizing his
      friend''s arm, he said:

“Come with me; a little fresh air will do you good. When one is in
      trouble, one must not remain in one spot.”

The other obeyed mechanically, put on his hat, took his stick, and went
      out, and both of them walked arm-in-arm towards the Seine, in the
      starlight night.

The air was warm and sweet, for all the gardens in the neighborhood were
      full of flowers at this season of the year, and their fragrance, which is
      scarcely perceptible during the day, seemed to awaken at the approach of
      night, and mingled with the light breezes which blew upon them in the
      darkness.

The broad avenue with its two rows of gas lamps, that extended as far as
      the Arc de Triomphe, was deserted and silent, but there was the distant
      roar of Paris, which seemed to have a reddish vapor hanging over it. It
      was a kind of continual rumbling, which was at times answered by the
      whistle of a train in the distance, travelling at full speed to the ocean,
      through the provinces.

The fresh air on the faces of the two men rather overcame them at first,
      made the doctor lose his equilibrium a little, and increased Caravan''s
      giddiness, from which he had suffered since dinner. He walked as if he
      were in a dream; his thoughts were paralyzed, although he felt no great
      grief, for he was in a state of mental torpor that prevented him from
      suffering, and he even felt a sense of relief which was increased by the
      mildness of the night.

When they reached the bridge, they turned to the right, and got the fresh
      breeze from the river, which rolled along, calm and melancholy, bordered
      by tall poplar trees, while the stars looked as if they were floating on
      the water and were moving with the current. A slight white mist that
      floated over the opposite banks, filled their lungs with a sensation of
      cold, and Caravan stopped suddenly, for he was struck by that smell from
      the water which brought back old memories to his mind. For, in his mind,
      he suddenly saw his mother again, in Picardy, as he had seen her years
      before, kneeling in front of their door, and washing the heaps of linen at
      her side in the stream that ran through their garden. He almost fancied
      that he could hear the sound of the wooden paddle with which she beat the
      linen in the calm silence of the country, and her voice, as she called out
      to him: “Alfred, bring me some soap.” And he smelled that odor
      of running water, of the mist rising from the wet ground, that marshy
      smell, which he should never forget, and which came back to him on this
      very evening on which his mother had died.

He stopped, seized with a feeling of despair. A sudden flash seemed to
      reveal to him the extent of his calamity, and that breath from the river
      plunged him into an abyss of hopeless grief. His life seemed cut in half,
      his youth disappeared, swallowed up by that death. All the former days
      were over and done with, all the recollections of his youth had been swept
      away; for the future, there would be nobody to talk to him of what had
      happened in days gone by, of the people he had known of old, of his own
      part of the country, and of his past life; that was a part of his
      existence which existed no longer, and the rest might as well end now.

And then he saw “the mother” as she was when young, wearing
      well-worn dresses, which he remembered for such a long time that they
      seemed inseparable from her; he recollected her movements, the different
      tones of her voice, her habits, her predilections, her fits of anger, the
      wrinkles on her face, the movements of her thin fingers, and all her
      well-known attitudes, which she would never have again, and clutching hold
      of the doctor, he began to moan and weep. His thin legs began to tremble,
      his whole stout body was shaken by his sobs, all he could say was:

But his companion, who was still drunk, and who intended to finish the
      evening in certain places of bad repute that he frequented secretly, made
      him sit down on the grass by the riverside, and left him almost
      immediately, under the pretext that he had to see a patient.

Caravan went on crying for some time, and when he had got to the end of
      his tears, when his grief had, so to say, run out, he again felt relief,
      repose and sudden tranquillity.

The tall poplar trees had a silvery sheen on them, and the mist on the
      plain looked like drifting snow; the river, in which the stars were
      reflected, and which had a sheen as of mother-of-pearl, was gently rippled
      by the wind. The air was soft and sweet, and Caravan inhaled it almost
      greedily, and thought that he could perceive a feeling of freshness, of
      calm and of superhuman consolation pervading him.

He actually resisted that feeling of comfort and relief, and kept on
      saying to himself: “My poor mother, my poor mother!” and tried
      to make himself cry, from a kind of conscientious feeling; but he could
      not succeed in doing so any longer, and those sad thoughts, which had made
      him sob so bitterly a shore time before, had almost passed away. In a few
      moments, he rose to go home, and returned slowly, under the influence of
      that serene night, and with a heart soothed in spite of himself.

When he reached the bridge, he saw that the last tramcar was ready to
      start, and behind it were the brightly lighted windows of the Cafe du
      Globe. He felt a longing to tell somebody of his loss, to excite pity, to
      make himself interesting. He put on a woeful face, pushed open the door,
      and went up to the counter, where the landlord still was. He had counted
      on creating a sensation, and had hoped that everybody would get up and
      come to him with outstretched hands, and say: “Why, what is the
      matter with you?” But nobody noticed his disconsolate face, so he
      rested his two elbows on the counter, and, burying his face in his hands,
      he murmured: “Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!”

“Ah!” the other exclaimed, and as a customer at the other end
      of the establishment asked for a glass of Bavarian beer, he went to attend
      to him, leaving Caravan dumfounded at his want of sympathy.

The three domino players were sitting at the same table which they had
      occupied before dinner, totally absorbed in their game, and Caravan went
      up to them, in search of pity, but as none of them appeared to notice him
      he made up his mind to speak.

All three slightly raised their heads at the same instant, but keeping
      their eyes fixed on the pieces which they held in their hands.

“Oh! the devil,” with that false air of sorrow which
      indifferent people assume. Another, who could not find anything to say,
      emitted a sort of sympathetic whistle, shaking his head at the same time,
      and the third turned to the game again, as if he were saying to himself:
      “Is that all!”

Caravan had expected some of these expressions that are said to “come
      from the heart,” and when he saw how his news was received, he left
      the table, indignant at their calmness at their friend''s sorrow, although
      this sorrow had stupefied him so that he scarcely felt it any longer. When
      he got home his wife was waiting for him in her nightgown, and sitting in
      a low chair by the open window, still thinking of the inheritance.

“I beg your pardon, Rosalie is with her, and you can go and take her
      place at three o''clock in the morning, when you have had some sleep.”

He only partially undressed, however, so as to be ready for anything that
      might happen, and after tying a silk handkerchief round his head, he lay
      down to rest, and for some time neither of them spoke. Madame Caravan was
      thinking.

Her nightcap was adorned with a red bow, and was pushed rather to one
      side, as was the way with all the caps she wore, and presently she turned
      towards him and said:

“I call that infamous; here we have been wearing ourselves out for
      ten years in looking after her, and have boarded and lodged her! Your
      sister would not have done so much for her, nor I either, if I had known
      how I was to be rewarded! Yes, it is a disgrace to her memory! I dare say
      that you will tell me that she paid us, but one cannot pay one''s children
      in ready money for what they do; that obligation is recognized after
      death; at any rate, that is how honorable people act. So I have had all my
      worry and trouble for nothing! Oh, that is nice! that is very nice!”

“Of course we must; I had forgotten all about it; I will send her a
      telegram the first thing in the morning.”

“No,” she replied, like a woman who had foreseen everything;
      “no, do not send it before ten or eleven o''clock, so that we may
      have time to turn round before she comes. It does not take more than two
      hours to get here from Charenton, and we can say that you lost your head
      from grief. If we let her know in the course of the day, that will be soon
      enough, and will give us time to look round.”

Caravan put his hand to his forehead, and, in the came timid voice in
      which he always spoke of his chief, the very thought of whom made him
      tremble, he said:

“Why?” she replied. “On occasions like this, it is
      always excusable to forget. Take my advice, and don''t let him know; your
      chief will not be able to say anything to you, and you will put him in a
      nice fix.

“Oh! yes, that I shall, and he will be in a terrible rage, too, when
      he notices my absence. Yes, you are right; it is a capital idea, and when
      I tell him that my mother is dead, he will be obliged to hold his tongue.”

And he rubbed his hands in delight at the joke, when he thought of his
      chief''s face; while upstairs lay the body of the dead old woman, with the
      servant asleep beside it.

But Madame Caravan grew thoughtful, as if she were preoccupied by
      something which she did not care to mention, and at last she said:

“Yes, yes; she said to me (but it was a long time ago, when she
      first came here): ''I shall leave the clock to you, if you look after me
      well.''”

“Well, then, you must go and fetch it out of her room, for if we get
      your sister here, she will prevent us from taking it.”

“I certainly think so; once it is in our possession, she will know
      nothing at all about where it came from; it belongs to us. It is just the
      same with the chest of drawers with the marble top, that is in her room;
      she gave it me one day when she was in a good temper. We will bring it
      down at the same time.”

“Oh! Indeed! Will you never change? You would let your children die
      of hunger, rather than make a move. Does not that chest of drawers belong
      to us, as she gave it to me? And if your sister is not satisfied, let her
      tell me so, me! I don''t care a straw for your sister. Come, get up, and we
      will bring down what your mother gave us, immediately.”

Trembling and vanquished, he got out of bed and began to put on his
      trousers, but she stopped him:

“It is not worth while to dress yourself; your underwear is quite
      enough. I mean to go as I am.”

They both left the room in their night clothes, went upstairs quite
      noiselessly, opened the door and went into the room, where the four
      lighted tapers and the plate with the sprig of box alone seemed to be
      watching the old woman in her rigid repose, for Rosalie, who was lying
      back in the easy chair with her legs stretched out, her hands folded in
      her lap, and her head on one side, was also quite motionless, and was
      snoring with her mouth wide open.

Caravan took the clock, which was one of those grotesque objects that were
      produced so plentifully under the Empire. A girl in gilt bronze was
      holding a cup and ball, and the ball formed the pendulum.

He put the marble slab on his shoulder with considerable effort, and they
      left the room. Caravan had to stoop in the doorway, and trembled as he
      went downstairs, while his wife walked backwards, so as to light him, and
      held the candlestick in one hand, carrying the clock under the other arm.

“We have got over the worst part of the job,” she said;
      “so now let us go and fetch the other things.”

But the bureau drawers were full of the old woman''s wearing apparel, which
      they must manage to hide somewhere, and Madame Caravan soon thought of a
      plan.

“Go and get that wooden packing case in the vestibule; it is hardly
      worth anything, and we may just as well put it here.”

And when he had brought it upstairs they began to fill it. One by one they
      took out all the collars, cuffs, chemises, caps, all the well-worn things
      that had belonged to the poor woman lying there behind them, and arranged
      them methodically in the wooden box in such a manner as to deceive Madame
      Braux, the deceased woman''s other child, who would be coming the next day.

When they had finished, they first of all carried the bureau drawers
      downstairs, and the remaining portion afterwards, each of them holding an
      end, and it was some time before they could make up their minds where it
      would stand best; but at last they decided upon their own room, opposite
      the bed, between the two windows, and as soon as it was in its place
      Madame Caravan filled it with her own things. The clock was placed on the
      chimney-piece in the dining-room, and they looked to see what the effect
      was, and were both delighted with it and agreed that nothing could be
      better. Then they retired, she blew out the candle, and soon everybody in
      the house was asleep.

It was broad daylight when. Caravan opened his eyes again. His mind was
      rather confused when he woke up, and he did not clearly remember what had
      happened for a few minutes; when he did, he felt a weight at his heart,
      and jumped out of bed, almost ready to cry again.

He hastened to the room overhead, where Rosalie was still sleeping in the
      same position as the night before, not having awakened once. He sent her
      to do her work, put fresh tapers in the place of those that had burnt out,
      and then he looked at his mother, revolving in his brain those apparently
      profound thoughts, those religious and philosophical commonplaces which
      trouble people of mediocre intelligence in the presence of death.

But, as his wife was calling him, he went downstairs. She had written out
      a list of what had to be done during the morning, and he was horrified
      when he saw the memorandum:

1. Report the death at the mayor''s office. 2. See the doctor who had
      attended her. 3. Order the coffin. 4. Give notice at the church. 5. Go to
      the undertaker. 6. Order the notices of her death at the printer''s. 7. Go
      to the lawyer. 8. Telegraph the news to all the family.

Besides all this, there were a number of small commissions; so he took his
      hat and went out. As the news had spread abroad, Madame Caravan''s female
      friends and neighbors soon began to come in and begged to be allowed to
      see the body. There had been a scene between husband and wife at the
      hairdresser''s on the ground floor about the matter, while a customer was
      being shaved. The wife, who was knitting steadily, said: “Well,
      there is one less, and as great a miser as one ever meets with. I
      certainly did not care for her; but, nevertheless, I must go and have a
      look at her.”

The husband, while lathering his patient''s chin, said: “That is
      another queer fancy! Nobody but a woman would think of such a thing. It is
      not enough for them to worry you during life, but they cannot even leave
      you at peace when you are dead:” But his wife, without being in the
      least disconcerted, replied: “The feeling is stronger than I am, and
      I must go. It has been on me since the morning. If I were not to see her,
      I should think about it all my life; but when I have had a good look at
      her, I shall be satisfied.”

The knight of the razor shrugged his shoulders and remarked in a low voice
      to the gentleman whose cheek he was scraping: “I just ask you, what
      sort of ideas do you think these confounded females have? I should not
      amuse myself by going to see a corpse!” But his wife had heard him
      and replied very quietly: “But it is so, it is so.” And then,
      putting her knitting on the counter, she went upstairs to the first floor,
      where she met two other neighbors, who had just come, and who were
      discussing the event with Madame Caravan, who was giving them the details,
      and they all went together to the death chamber. The four women went in
      softly, and, one after the other, sprinkled the bed clothes with the salt
      water, knelt down, made the sign of the cross while they mumbled a prayer.
      Then they rose from their knees and looked for some time at the corpse
      with round, wide-open eyes and mouths partly open, while the
      daughter-in-law of the dead woman, with her handkerchief to her face,
      pretended to be sobbing piteously.

When she turned about to walk away whom should she perceive standing close
      to the door but Marie-Louise and Philippe-Auguste, who were curiously
      taking stock of all that was going on. Then, forgetting her pretended
      grief, she threw herself upon them with uplifted hands, crying out in a
      furious voice, “Will you get out of this, you horrid brats!”

Ten minutes later, going upstairs again with another contingent of
      neighbors, she prayed, wept profusely, performed all her duties, and found
      once more her two children, who had followed her upstairs. She again boxed
      their ears soundly, but the next time she paid no heed to them, and at
      each fresh arrival of visitors the two urchins always followed in the
      wake, kneeling down in a corner and imitating slavishly everything they
      saw their mother do.

When the afternoon came the crowds of inquisitive people began to
      diminish, and soon there were no more visitors. Madame Caravan, returning
      to her own apartments, began to make the necessary preparations for the
      funeral ceremony, and the deceased was left alone.

The window of the room was open. A torrid heat entered, along with clouds
      of dust; the flames of the four candles were flickering beside the
      immobile corpse, and upon the cloth which covered the face, the closed
      eyes, the two stretched-out hands, small flies alighted, came, went and
      careered up and down incessantly, being the only companions of the old
      woman for the time being.

Marie-Louise and Philippe-Auguste, however, had now left the house and
      were running up and down the street. They were soon surrounded by their
      playmates, by little girls especially, who were older and who were much
      more interested in all the mysteries of life, asking questions as if they
      were grown people.

“Then your grandmother is dead?” “Yes, she died
      yesterday evening.” “What does a dead person look like?”

Then Marie began to explain, telling all about the candles, the sprig of
      box and the face of the corpse. It was not long before great curiosity was
      aroused in the minds of all the children, and they asked to be allowed to
      go upstairs to look at the departed.

Marie-Louise at once organized a first expedition, consisting of five
      girls and two boys—the biggest and the most courageous. She made
      them take off their shoes so that they might not be discovered. The troupe
      filed into the house and mounted the stairs as stealthily as an army of
      mice.

Once in the chamber, the little girl, imitating her mother, regulated the
      ceremony. She solemnly walked in advance of her comrades, went down on her
      knees, made the sign of the cross, moved her lips as in prayer, rose,
      sprinkled the bed, and while the children, all crowded together, were
      approaching—frightened and curious and eager to look at the face and
      hands of the deceased—she began suddenly to simulate sobbing and to
      bury her eyes in her little handkerchief. Then, becoming instantly
      consoled, on thinking of the other children who were downstairs waiting at
      the door, she ran downstairs followed by the rest, returning in a minute
      with another group, then a third; for all the little ragamuffins of the
      countryside, even to the little beggars in rags, had congregated in order
      to participate in this new pleasure; and each time she repeated her
      mother''s grimaces with absolute perfection.

At length, however, she became tired. Some game or other drew the children
      away from the house, and the old grandmother was left alone, forgotten
      suddenly by everybody.

The room was growing dark, and upon the dry and rigid features of the
      corpse the fitful flames of the candles cast patches of light.

Towards 8 o''clock Caravan ascended to the chamber of death, closed the
      windows and renewed the candles. He was now quite composed on entering the
      room, accustomed already to regard the corpse as though it had been there
      for months. He even went the length of declaring that, as yet, there were
      no signs of decomposition, making this remark just at the moment when he
      and his wife were about to sit down at table. “Pshaw!” she
      responded, “she is now stark and stiff; she will keep for a year.”

The soup was eaten in silence. The children, who had been left to
      themselves all day, now worn out by fatigue, were sleeping soundly on
      their chairs, and nobody ventured to break the silence.

Suddenly the flame of the lamp went down. Madame Caravan immediately
      turned up the wick, a hollow sound ensued, and the light went out. They
      had forgotten to buy oil. To send for it now to the grocer''s would keep
      back the dinner, and they began to look for candles, but none were to be
      found except the tapers which had been placed upon the table upstairs in
      the death chamber.

Madame Caravan, always prompt in her decisions, quickly despatched
      Marie-Louise to fetch two, and her return was awaited in total darkness.

The footsteps of the girl who had ascended the stairs were distinctly
      heard. There was silence for a few seconds and then the child descended
      precipitately. She threw open the door and in a choking voice murmured:
      “Oh! papa, grandmamma is dressing herself!”

Caravan bounded to his feet with such precipitance that his chair fell
      over against the wall. He stammered out: “You say? . . . . What are
      you saying?”

But Marie-Louise, gasping with emotion, repeated: “Grand—grand
      —grandmamma is putting on her clothes, she is coming downstairs.”

Caravan rushed boldly up the staircase, followed by his wife, dumfounded;
      but he came to a standstill before the door of the second floor, overcome
      with terror, not daring to enter. What was he going to see? Madame
      Caravan, more courageous, turned the handle of the door and stepped
      forward into the room.

The old woman was standing up. In awakening from her lethargic sleep,
      before even regaining full consciousness, in turning upon her side and
      raising herself on her elbow, she had extinguished three of the candles
      which burned near the bed. Then, gaining strength, she got off the bed and
      began to look for her clothes. The absence of her chest of drawers had at
      first worried her, but, after a little, she had succeeded in finding her
      things at the bottom of the wooden box, and was now quietly dressing. She
      emptied the plateful of water, replaced the sprig of box behind the
      looking-glass, and arranged the chairs in their places, and was ready to
      go downstairs when there appeared before her her son and daughter-in-law.

Caravan rushed forward, seized her by the hands, embraced her with tears
      in his eyes, while his wife, who was behind him, repeated in a
      hypocritical tone of voice: “Oh, what a blessing! oh, what a
      blessing!”

But the old woman, without being at all moved, without even appearing to
      understand, rigid as a statue, and with glazed eyes, simply asked: “Will
      dinner soon be ready?”

And with an alacrity unusual in him, he took her arm, while Madame
      Caravan, the younger, seized the candle and lighted them downstairs,
      walking backwards in front of them, step by step, just as she had done the
      previous night for her husband, who was carrying the marble.

On reaching the first floor, she almost ran against people who were
      ascending the stairs. It was the Charenton family, Madame Braux, followed
      by her husband.

The wife, tall and stout, with a prominent stomach, opened wide her
      terrified eyes and was ready to make her escape. The husband, a socialist
      shoemaker, a little hairy man, the perfect image of a monkey, murmured
      quite unconcerned: “Well, what next? Is she resurrected?”

As soon as Madame Caravan recognized them, she made frantic gestures to
      them; then, speaking aloud, she said: “Why, here you are! What a
      pleasant surprise!”

But Madame Braux, dumfounded, understood nothing. She responded in a low
      voice: “It was your telegram that brought us; we thought that all
      was over.”

Her husband, who was behind her, pinched her to make her keep silent. He
      added with a sly laugh, which his thick beard concealed: “It was
      very kind of you to invite us here. We set out post haste,” which
      remark showed the hostility which had for a long time reigned between the
      households. Then, just as the old woman reached the last steps, he pushed
      forward quickly and rubbed his hairy face against her cheeks, shouting in
      her ear, on account of her deafness: “How well you look, mother;
      sturdy as usual, hey!”

Madame Braux, in her stupefaction at seeing the old woman alive, whom they
      all believed to be dead, dared not even embrace her; and her enormous bulk
      blocked up the passageway and hindered the others from advancing. The old
      woman, uneasy and suspicious, but without speaking, looked at everyone
      around her; and her little gray eyes, piercing and hard, fixed themselves
      now on one and now on the other, and they were so full of meaning that the
      children became frightened.

Caravan, to explain matters, said: “She has been somewhat ill, but
      she is better now; quite well, indeed, are you not, mother?”

Then the good woman, continuing to walk, replied in a husky voice, as
      though it came from a distance: “It was syncope. I heard you all the
      while.”

An embarrassing silence followed. They entered the dining-room, and in a
      few minutes all sat down to an improvised dinner.

Only M. Braux had retained his self-possession. His gorilla features
      grinned wickedly, while he let fall some words of double meaning which
      painfully disconcerted everyone.

But the door bell kept ringing every second, and Rosalie, distracted, came
      to call Caravan, who rushed out, throwing down his napkin. His
      brother-in-law even asked him whether it was not one of his reception
      days, to which he stammered out in answer: “No, only a few packages;
      nothing more.”

A parcel was brought in, which he began to open carelessly, and the
      mourning announcements with black borders appeared unexpectedly. Reddening
      up to the very eyes, he closed the package hurriedly and pushed it under
      his waistcoat.

His mother had not seen it! She was looking intently at her clock which
      stood on the mantelpiece, and the embarrassment increased in midst of a
      dead silence. Turning her wrinkled face towards her daughter, the old
      woman, in whose eyes gleamed malice, said: “On Monday you must take
      me away from here, so that I can see your little girl. I want so much to
      see her.” Madame Braux, her features all beaming, exclaimed: “Yes,
      mother, that I will,” while Madame Caravan, the younger, who had
      turned pale, was ready to faint with annoyance. The two men, however,
      gradually drifted into conversation and soon became embroiled in a
      political discussion. Braux maintained the most revolutionary and
      communistic doctrines, his eyes glowing, and gesticulating and throwing
      about his arms. “Property, sir,” he said, “is a robbery
      perpetrated on the working classes; the land is the common property of
      every man; hereditary rights are an infamy and a disgrace.” But here
      he suddenly stopped, looking as if he had just said something foolish,
      then added in softer tones: “But this is not the proper moment to
      discuss such things.”

The door was opened and Dr. Chenet appeared. For a moment he seemed
      bewildered, but regaining his usual smirking expression of countenance, he
      jauntily approached the old woman and said: “Aha! mamma; you are
      better to-day. Oh! I never had any doubt but you would come round again;
      in fact, I said to myself as I was mounting the staircase, ''I have an idea
      that I shall find the old lady on her feet once more'';” and as he
      patted her gently on the back: “Ah! she is as solid as the
      Pont-Neuf, she will bury us all; see if she does not.”

He sat down, accepted the coffee that was offered him, and soon began to
      join in the conversation of the two men, backing up Braux, for he himself
      had been mixed up in the Commune.

The old woman, now feeling herself fatigued, wished to retire. Caravan
      rushed forward. She looked him steadily in the eye and said: “You,
      you must carry my clock and chest of drawers upstairs again without a
      moment''s delay.” “Yes, mamma,” he replied, gasping;
      “yes, I will do so.” The old woman then took the arm of her
      daughter and withdrew from the room. The two Caravans remained astounded,
      silent, plunged in the deepest despair, while Braux rubbed his hands and
      sipped his coffee gleefully.

Suddenly Madame Caravan, consumed with rage, rushed at him, exclaiming:
      “You are a thief, a footpad, a cur! I would spit in your face! I—I
      —would——” She could find nothing further to say,
      suffocating as she was with rage, while he went on sipping his coffee with
      a smile.

His wife returning just then, Madame Caravan attacked her sister-in-law,
      and the two women—the one with her enormous bulk, the other
      epileptic and spare, with changed voices and trembling hands flew at one
      another with words of abuse.

Chenet and Braux now interposed, and the latter, taking his better half by
      the shoulders, pushed her out of the door before him, shouting: “Go
      on, you slut; you talk too much”; and the two were heard in the
      street quarrelling until they disappeared from sight.

M. Chenet also took his departure, leaving the Caravans alone, face to
      face. The husband fell back on his chair, and with the cold sweat standing
      out in beads on his temples, murmured: “What shall I say to my chief
      to-morrow?”

He was slowly dying, as consumptives die. I saw him each day, about two
      o''clock, sitting beneath the hotel windows on a bench in the promenade,
      looking out on the calm sea. He remained for some time without moving, in
      the heat of the sun, gazing mournfully at the Mediterranean. Every now and
      then, he cast a glance at the lofty mountains with beclouded summits that
      shut in Mentone; then, with a very slow movement, he would cross his long
      legs, so thin that they seemed like two bones, around which fluttered the
      cloth of his trousers, and he would open a book, always the same book. And
      then he did not stir any more, but read on, read on with his eye and his
      mind; all his wasting body seemed to read, all his soul plunged, lost,
      disappeared, in this book, up to the hour when the cool air made him cough
      a little. Then, he got up and reentered the hotel.

He was a tall German, with fair beard, who breakfasted and dined in his
      own room, and spoke to nobody.

A vague, curiosity attracted me to him. One day, I sat down by his side,
      having taken up a book, too, to keep up appearances, a volume of Musset''s
      poems.

“I am sorry for that. Since chance has thrown us side by side, I
      could have lent you, I could have shown you, an inestimable thing—this
      book which I hold in my hand.”

“It is a copy of my master, Schopenhauer, annotated with his own
      hand. All the margins, as you may see, are covered with his handwriting.”

I took the book from him reverently, and I gazed at these forms
      incomprehensible to me, but which revealed the immortal thoughts of the
      greatest shatterer of dreams who had ever dwelt on earth.

And involuntarily I compared the childish sarcasm, the religious sarcasm
      of Voltaire with the irresistible irony of the German philosopher whose
      influence is henceforth ineffaceable.

Let us protest and let us be angry, let us be indignant, or let us be
      enthusiastic, Schopenhauer has marked humanity with the seal of his
      disdain and of his disenchantment.

A disabused pleasure-seeker, he overthrew beliefs, hopes, poetic ideals
      and chimeras, destroyed the aspirations, ravaged the confidence of souls,
      killed love, dragged down the chivalrous worship of women, crushed the
      illusions of hearts, and accomplished the most gigantic task ever
      attempted by scepticism. He spared nothing with his mocking spirit, and
      exhausted everything. And even to-day those who execrate him seem to carry
      in their own souls particles of his thought.

And he spoke to me about the philosopher and told me about the almost
      supernatural impression which this strange being made on all who came near
      him.

He gave me an account of the interview of the old iconoclast with a French
      politician, a doctrinaire Republican, who wanted to get a glimpse of this
      man, and found him in a noisy tavern, seated in the midst of his
      disciples, dry, wrinkled, laughing with an unforgettable laugh, attacking
      and tearing to pieces ideas and beliefs with a single word, as a dog tears
      with one bite of his teeth the tissues with which he plays.

He repeated for me the comment of this Frenchman as he went away,
      astonished and terrified: “I thought I had spent an hour with the
      devil.”

“He had, indeed, monsieur, a frightful smile, which terrified us
      even after his death. I can tell you an anecdote about it that is not
      generally known, if it would interest you.”

“Schopenhauer had just died, and it was arranged that we should
      watch, in turn, two by two, till morning.

“He was lying in a large apartment, very simple, vast and gloomy.
      Two wax candles were burning on the stand by the bedside.

“It was midnight when I went on watch, together with one of our
      comrades. The two friends whom we replaced had left the apartment, and we
      came and sat down at the foot of the bed.

“The face was not changed. It was laughing. That pucker which we
      knew so well lingered still around the corners of the lips, and it seemed
      to us that he was about to open his eyes, to move and to speak. His
      thought, or rather his thoughts, enveloped us. We felt ourselves more than
      ever in the atmosphere of his genius, absorbed, possessed by him. His
      domination seemed to be even more sovereign now that he was dead. A
      feeling of mystery was blended with the power of this incomparable spirit.

“The bodies of these men disappear, but they themselves remain; and
      in the night which follows the cessation of their heart''s pulsation I
      assure you, monsieur, they are terrifying.

“And in hushed tones we talked about him, recalling to mind certain
      sayings, certain formulas of his, those startling maxims which are like
      jets of flame flung, in a few words, into the darkness of the Unknown
      Life.

“''It seems to me that he is going to speak,'' said my comrade. And we
      stared with uneasiness bordering on fear at the motionless face, with its
      eternal laugh. Gradually, we began to feel ill at ease, oppressed, on the
      point of fainting. I faltered:

“Then, my comrade suggested that we should go into the adjoining
      room, and leave the door open; and I assented to his proposal.

“I took one of the wax candles which burned on the stand, and I left
      the second behind. Then we went and sat down at the other end of the
      adjoining apartment, in such a position that we could see the bed and the
      corpse, clearly revealed by the light.

“But he still held possession of us. One would have said that his
      immaterial essence, liberated, free, all-powerful and dominating, was
      flitting around us. And sometimes, too, the dreadful odor of the
      decomposed body came toward us and penetrated us, sickening and
      indefinable.

“Suddenly a shiver passed through our bones: a sound, a slight
      sound, came from the death-chamber. Immediately we fixed our glances on
      him, and we saw, yes, monsieur, we saw distinctly, both of us, something
      white pass across the bed, fall on the carpet, and vanish under an
      armchair.

“We were on our feet before we had time to think of anything,
      distracted by stupefying terror, ready to run away. Then we stared at each
      other. We were horribly pale. Our hearts throbbed fiercely enough to have
      raised the clothing on our chests. I was the first to speak:

“I took our wax candle and entered first, glancing into all the dark
      corners in the large apartment. Nothing was moving now, and I approached
      the bed. But I stood transfixed with stupor and fright:

“Schopenhauer was no longer laughing! He was grinning in a horrible
      fashion, with his lips pressed together and deep hollows in his cheeks. I
      stammered out:

“But the terrible odor ascended to my nose and stifled me. And I no
      longer moved, but kept staring fixedly at him, terrified as if in the
      presence of an apparition.

“Then my companion, having seized the other wax candle, bent
      forward. Next, he touched my arm without uttering a word. I followed his
      glance, and saw on the ground, under the armchair by the side of the bed,
      standing out white on the dark carpet, and open as if to bite,
      Schopenhauer''s set of artificial teeth.

And as the sun was sinking toward the glittering sea, the consumptive
      German rose from his seat, gave me a parting bow, and retired into the
      hotel.

There were seven of us on a drag, four women and three men; one of the
      latter sat on the box seat beside the coachman. We were ascending, at a
      snail''s pace, the winding road up the steep cliff along the coast.

Setting out from Etretat at break of day in order to visit the ruins of
      Tancarville, we were still half asleep, benumbed by the fresh air of the
      morning. The women especially, who were little accustomed to these early
      excursions, half opened and closed their eyes every moment, nodding their
      heads or yawning, quite insensible to the beauties of the dawn.

It was autumn. On both sides of the road stretched the bare fields,
      yellowed by the stubble of wheat and oats which covered the soil like a
      beard that had been badly shaved. The moist earth seemed to steam. Larks
      were singing high up in the air, while other birds piped in the bushes.

The sun rose at length in front of us, bright red on the plane of the
      horizon, and in proportion as it ascended, growing clearer from minute to
      minute, the country seemed to awake, to smile, to shake itself like a
      young girl leaving her bed in her white robe of vapor. The Comte
      d''Etraille, who was seated on the box, cried:

“Look! look! a hare!” and he extended his arm toward the left,
      pointing to a patch of clover. The animal scurried along, almost hidden by
      the clover, only its large ears showing. Then it swerved across a furrow,
      stopped, started off again at full speed, changed its course, stopped
      anew, uneasy, spying out every danger, uncertain what route to take, when
      suddenly it began to run with great bounds, disappearing finally in a
      large patch of beet-root. All the men had waked up to watch the course of
      the animal.

“We are not at all gallant this morning,” and; regarding his
      neighbor, the little Baroness de Serennes, who struggled against sleep, he
      said to her in a low tone: “You are thinking of your husband,
      baroness. Reassure yourself; he will not return before Saturday, so you
      have still four days.”

“How stupid you are!” Then, shaking off her torpor, she added:
      “Now, let somebody say something to make us laugh. You, Monsieur
      Chenal, who have the reputation of having had more love affairs than the
      Duc de Richelieu, tell us a love story in which you have played a part;
      anything you like.”

Leon Chenal, an old painter, who had once been very handsome, very strong,
      very proud of his physique and very popular with women, took his long
      white beard in his hand and smiled. Then, after a few moments'' reflection,
      he suddenly became serious.

“Ladies, it will not be an amusing tale, for I am going to relate to
      you the saddest love affair of my life, and I sincerely hope that none of
      my friends may ever pass through a similar experience.

“I was twenty-five years of age and was pillaging along the coast of
      Normandy. I call ''pillaging'' wandering about, with a knapsack on one''s
      back, from inn to inn, under the pretext of making studies and sketching
      landscapes. I knew nothing more enjoyable than that happy-go-lucky
      wandering life, in which one is perfectly free, without shackles of any
      kind, without care, without preoccupation, without thinking even of the
      morrow. One goes in any direction one pleases, without any guide save his
      fancy, without any counsellor save his eyes. One stops because a running
      brook attracts one, because the smell of potatoes frying tickles one''s
      olfactories on passing an inn. Sometimes it is the perfume of clematis
      which decides one in his choice or the roguish glance of the servant at an
      inn. Do not despise me for my affection for these rustics. These girls
      have a soul as well as senses, not to mention firm cheeks and fresh lips;
      while their hearty and willing kisses have the flavor of wild fruit. Love
      is always love, come whence it may. A heart that beats at your approach,
      an eye that weeps when you go away are things so rare, so sweet, so
      precious that they must never be despised.

“I have had rendezvous in ditches full of primroses, behind the cow
      stable and in barns among the straw, still warm from the heat of the day.
      I have recollections of coarse gray cloth covering supple peasant skin and
      regrets for simple, frank kisses, more delicate in their unaffected
      sincerity than the subtle favors of charming and distinguished women.

“But what one loves most amid all these varied adventures is the
      country, the woods, the rising of the sun, the twilight, the moonlight.
      These are, for the painter, honeymoon trips with Nature. One is alone with
      her in that long and quiet association. You go to sleep in the fields,
      amid marguerites and poppies, and when you open your eyes in the full
      glare of the sunlight you descry in the distance the little village with
      its pointed clock tower which sounds the hour of noon.

“You sit down by the side of a spring which gushes out at the foot
      of an oak, amid a growth of tall, slender weeds, glistening with life. You
      go down on your knees, bend forward and drink that cold, pellucid water
      which wets your mustache and nose; you drink it with a physical pleasure,
      as though you kissed the spring, lip to lip. Sometimes, when you find a
      deep hole along the course of these tiny brooks, you plunge in quite
      naked, and you feel on your skin, from head to foot, as it were, an icy
      and delicious caress, the light and gentle quivering of the stream.

“You are gay on the hills, melancholy on the edge of ponds, inspired
      when the sun is setting in an ocean of blood-red clouds and casts red
      reflections or the river. And at night, under the moon, which passes
      across the vault of heaven, you think of a thousand strange things which
      would never have occurred to your mind under the brilliant light of day.

“So, in wandering through the same country where we, are this year,
      I came to the little village of Benouville, on the cliff between Yport and
      Etretat. I came from Fecamp, following the coast, a high coast as straight
      as a wall, with its projecting chalk cliffs descending perpendicularly
      into the sea. I had walked since early morning on the short grass, smooth
      and yielding as a carpet, that grows on the edge of the cliff. And,
      singing lustily, I walked with long strides, looking sometimes at the slow
      circling flight of a gull with its white curved wings outlined on the blue
      sky, sometimes at the brown sails of a fishing bark on the green sea. In
      short, I had passed a happy day, a day of liberty and of freedom from
      care.

“A little farmhouse where travellers were lodged was pointed out to
      me, a kind of inn, kept by a peasant woman, which stood in the centre of a
      Norman courtyard surrounded by a double row of beeches.

“Leaving the coast, I reached the hamlet, which was hemmed in by
      great trees, and I presented myself at the house of Mother Lecacheur.

“She was an old, wrinkled and stern peasant woman, who seemed always
      to receive customers under protest, with a kind of defiance.

“It was the month of May. The spreading apple trees covered the
      court with a shower of blossoms which rained unceasingly both upon people
      and upon the grass.

“In five minutes we had come to an agreement, and I deposited my bag
      upon the earthen floor of a rustic room, furnished with a bed, two chairs,
      a table and a washbowl. The room looked into the large, smoky kitchen,
      where the lodgers took their meals with the people of the farm and the
      landlady, who was a widow.

“I washed my hands, after which I went out. The old woman was making
      a chicken fricassee for dinner in the large fireplace in which hung the
      iron pot, black with smoke.

“''I have a lady, an English lady, who has reached years of maturity.
      She occupies the other room.''

“I obtained, by means of an extra five sous a day, the privilege of
      dining alone out in the yard when the weather was fine.

“My place was set outside the door, and I was beginning to gnaw the
      lean limbs of the Normandy chicken, to drink the clear cider and to munch
      the hunk of white bread, which was four days old but excellent.

“Suddenly the wooden gate which gave on the highway was opened, and
      a strange lady directed her steps toward the house. She was very thin,
      very tall, so tightly enveloped in a red Scotch plaid shawl that one might
      have supposed she had no arms, if one had not seen a long hand appear just
      above the hips, holding a white tourist umbrella. Her face was like that
      of a mummy, surrounded with curls of gray hair, which tossed about at
      every step she took and made me think, I know not why, of a pickled
      herring in curl papers. Lowering her eyes, she passed quickly in front of
      me and entered the house.

“That singular apparition cheered me. She undoubtedly was my
      neighbor, the English lady of mature age of whom our hostess had spoken.

“I did not see her again that day. The next day, when I had settled
      myself to commence painting at the end of that beautiful valley which you
      know and which extends as far as Etretat, I perceived, on lifting my eyes
      suddenly, something singular standing on the crest of the cliff, one might
      have said a pole decked out with flags. It was she. On seeing me, she
      suddenly disappeared. I reentered the house at midday for lunch and took
      my seat at the general table, so as to make the acquaintance of this odd
      character. But she did not respond to my polite advances, was insensible
      even to my little attentions. I poured out water for her persistently, I
      passed her the dishes with great eagerness. A slight, almost
      imperceptible, movement of the head and an English word, murmured so low
      that I did not understand it, were her only acknowledgments.

“She was called Miss Harriet. Seeking out a secluded village in
      which to pass the summer, she had been attracted to Benouville some six
      months before and did not seem disposed to leave it. She never spoke at
      table, ate rapidly, reading all the while a small book of the Protestant
      propaganda. She gave a copy of it to everybody. The cure himself had
      received no less than four copies, conveyed by an urchin to whom she had
      paid two sous commission. She said sometimes to our hostess abruptly,
      without preparing her in the least for the declaration:

“''I love the Saviour more than all. I admire him in all creation; I
      adore him in all nature; I carry him always in my heart.''

“And she would immediately present the old woman with one of her
      tracts which were destined to convert the universe.

“In, the village she was not liked. In fact, the schoolmaster having
      pronounced her an atheist, a kind of stigma attached to her. The cure, who
      had been consulted by Madame Lecacheur, responded:

“''She is a heretic, but God does not wish the death of the sinner,
      and I believe her to be a person of pure morals.''

“These words, ''atheist,'' ''heretic,'' words which no one can precisely
      define, threw doubts into some minds. It was asserted, however, that this
      English woman was rich and that she had passed her life in travelling
      through every country in the world because her family had cast her off.
      Why had her family cast her off? Because of her impiety, of course!

“She was, in fact, one of those people of exalted principles; one of
      those opinionated puritans, of which England produces so many; one of
      those good and insupportable old maids who haunt the tables d''hote of
      every hotel in Europe, who spoil Italy, poison Switzerland, render the
      charming cities of the Mediterranean uninhabitable, carry everywhere their
      fantastic manias their manners of petrified vestals, their indescribable
      toilets and a certain odor of india-rubber which makes one believe that at
      night they are slipped into a rubber casing.

“Whenever I caught sight of one of these individuals in a hotel I
      fled like the birds who see a scarecrow in a field.

“Madame Lecacheur, hostile by instinct to everything that was not
      rustic, felt in her narrow soul a kind of hatred for the ecstatic
      declarations of the old maid. She had found a phrase by which to describe
      her, a term of contempt that rose to her lips, called forth by I know not
      what confused and mysterious mental ratiocination. She said: ''That woman
      is a demoniac.'' This epithet, applied to that austere and sentimental
      creature, seemed to me irresistibly droll. I myself never called her
      anything now but ''the demoniac,'' experiencing a singular pleasure in
      pronouncing aloud this word on perceiving her.

“''What do you think, sir? She picked up a toad which had had its paw
      crushed and carried it to her room and has put it in her washbasin and
      bandaged it as if it were a man. If that is not profanation I should like
      to know what is!''

“On another occasion, when walking along the shore she bought a
      large fish which had just been caught, simply to throw it back into the
      sea again. The sailor from whom she had bought it, although she paid him
      handsomely, now began to swear, more exasperated, indeed, than if she had
      put her hand into his pocket and taken his money. For more than a month he
      could not speak of the circumstance without becoming furious and
      denouncing it as an outrage. Oh, yes! She was indeed a demoniac, this Miss
      Harriet, and Mother Lecacheur must have had an inspiration in thus
      christening her.

“The stable boy, who was called Sapeur, because he had served in
      Africa in his youth, entertained other opinions. He said with a roguish
      air: ''She is an old hag who has seen life.''

“The little kind-hearted Celeste did not wait upon her willingly,
      but I was never able to understand why. Probably her only reason was that
      she was a stranger, of another race; of a different tongue and of another
      religion. She was, in fact, a demoniac!

“She passed her time wandering about the country, adoring and
      seeking God in nature. I found her one evening on her knees in a cluster
      of bushes. Having discovered something red through the leaves, I brushed
      aside the branches, and Miss Harriet at once rose to her feet, confused at
      having been found thus, fixing on me terrified eyes like those of an owl
      surprised in open day.

“Sometimes, when I was working among the rocks, I would suddenly
      descry her on the edge of the cliff like a lighthouse signal. She would be
      gazing in rapture at the vast sea glittering in the sunlight and the
      boundless sky with its golden tints. Sometimes I would distinguish her at
      the end of the valley, walking quickly with her elastic English step, and
      I would go toward her, attracted by I know not what, simply to see her
      illuminated visage, her dried-up, ineffable features, which seemed to glow
      with inward and profound happiness.

“I would often encounter her also in the corner of a field, sitting
      on the grass under the shadow of an apple tree, with her little religious
      booklet lying open on her knee while she gazed out at the distance.

“I could not tear myself away from that quiet country neighborhood,
      to which I was attached by a thousand links of love for its wide and
      peaceful landscape. I was happy in this sequestered farm, far removed from
      everything, but in touch with the earth, the good, beautiful, green earth.
      And—must I avow it?—there was, besides, a little curiosity
      which retained me at the residence of Mother Lecacheur. I wished to become
      acquainted a little with this strange Miss Harriet and to know what
      transpires in the solitary souls of those wandering old English women.

“We became acquainted in a rather singular manner. I had just
      finished a study which appeared to me to be worth something, and so it
      was, as it sold for ten thousand francs fifteen years later. It was as
      simple, however, as two and two make four and was not according to
      academic rules. The whole right side of my canvas represented a rock, an
      enormous rock, covered with sea-wrack, brown, yellow and red, across which
      the sun poured like a stream of oil. The light fell upon the rock as
      though it were aflame without the sun, which was at my back, being
      visible. That was all. A first bewildering study of blazing, gorgeous
      light.

“On the left was the sea, not the blue sea, the slate-colored sea,
      but a sea of jade, greenish, milky and solid beneath the deep-colored sky.

“I was so pleased with my work that I danced from sheer delight as I
      carried it back to the inn. I would have liked the whole world to see it
      at once. I can remember that I showed it to a cow that was browsing by the
      wayside, exclaiming as I did so: ''Look at that, my old beauty; you will
      not often see its like again.''

“When I had reached the house I immediately called out to Mother
      Lecacheur, shouting with all my might:

“The rustic approached and looked at my work with her stupid eyes
      which distinguished nothing and could not even tell whether the picture
      represented an ox or a house.

“Miss Harriet just then came home, and she passed behind me just as
      I was holding out my canvas at arm''s length, exhibiting it to our
      landlady. The demoniac could not help but see it, for I took care to
      exhibit the thing in such a way that it could not escape her notice. She
      stopped abruptly and stood motionless, astonished. It was her rock which
      was depicted, the one which she climbed to dream away her time
      undisturbed.

“She uttered a British ''Aoh,'' which was at once so accentuated and
      so flattering that I turned round to her, smiling, and said:

“I colored and was more touched by that compliment than if it had
      come from a queen. I was captured, conquered, vanquished. I could have
      embraced her, upon my honor.

“I passed her some bread, some water, some wine. She now accepted
      these with a little smile of a mummy. I then began to talk about the
      scenery.

“After the meal we rose from the table together and walked leisurely
      across the courtyard; then, attracted doubtless by the fiery glow which
      the setting sun cast over the surface of the sea, I opened the gate which
      led to the cliff, and we walked along side by side, as contented as two
      persons might be who have just learned to understand and penetrate each
      other''s motives and feelings.

“It was one of those warm, soft evenings which impart a sense of
      ease to flesh and spirit alike. All is enjoyment, everything charms. The
      balmy air, laden with the perfume of grasses and the smell of seaweed,
      soothes the olfactory sense with its wild fragrance, soothes the palate
      with its sea savor, soothes the mind with its pervading sweetness.

“We were now walking along the edge of the cliff, high above the
      boundless sea which rolled its little waves below us at a distance of a
      hundred metres. And we drank in with open mouth and expanded chest that
      fresh breeze, briny from kissing the waves, that came from the ocean and
      passed across our faces.

“Wrapped in her plaid shawl, with a look of inspiration as she faced
      the breeze, the English woman gazed fixedly at the great sun ball as it
      descended toward the horizon. Far off in the distance a three-master in
      full sail was outlined on the blood-red sky and a steamship, somewhat
      nearer, passed along, leaving behind it a trail of smoke on the horizon.
      The red sun globe sank slowly lower and lower and presently touched the
      water just behind the motionless vessel, which, in its dazzling
      effulgence, looked as though framed in a flame of fire. We saw it plunge,
      grow smaller and disappear, swallowed up by the ocean.

“Miss Harriet gazed in rapture at the last gleams of the dying day.
      She seemed longing to embrace the sky, the sea, the whole landscape.

“She murmured: ''Aoh! I love—I love'' I saw a tear in her eye.
      She continued: ''I wish I were a little bird, so that I could mount up into
      the firmament.''

“She remained standing as I had often before seen her, perched on
      the cliff, her face as red as her shawl. I should have liked to have
      sketched her in my album. It would have been a caricature of ecstasy.

“I then spoke to her of painting as I would have done to a fellow
      artist, using the technical terms common among the devotees of the
      profession. She listened attentively, eagerly seeking to divine the
      meaning of the terms, so as to understand my thoughts. From time to time
      she would exclaim:

“The next day, on seeing me, she approached me, cordially holding
      out her hand; and we at once became firm friends.

“She was a good creature who had a kind of soul on springs, which
      became enthusiastic at a bound. She lacked equilibrium like all women who
      are spinsters at the age of fifty. She seemed to be preserved in a pickle
      of innocence, but her heart still retained something very youthful and
      inflammable. She loved both nature and animals with a fervor, a love like
      old wine fermented through age, with a sensuous love that she had never
      bestowed on men.

“One thing is certain, that the sight of a bitch nursing her
      puppies, a mare roaming in a meadow with a foal at its side, a bird''s nest
      full of young ones, screaming, with their open mouths and their enormous
      heads, affected her perceptibly.

“Poor, solitary, sad, wandering beings! I love you ever since I
      became acquainted with Miss Harriet.

“I soon discovered that she had something she would like to tell me,
      but dare not, and I was amused at her timidity. When I started out in the
      morning with my knapsack on my back, she would accompany me in silence as
      far as the end of the village, evidently struggling to find words with
      which to begin a conversation. Then she would leave me abruptly and walk
      away quickly with her springy step.

“She remained standing behind me, following all my gestures with
      concentrated attention. Then, suddenly, fearing perhaps that she was
      disturbing me, she said: ''Thank you,'' and walked away.

“But she soon became more friendly, and accompanied me every day,
      her countenance exhibiting visible pleasure. She carried her camp stool
      under her arm, not permitting me to carry it. She would remain there for
      hours, silent and motionless, following with her eyes the point of my
      brush, in its every movement. When I obtained unexpectedly just the effect
      I wanted by a dash of color put on with the palette knife, she
      involuntarily uttered a little ''Ah!'' of astonishment, of joy, of
      admiration. She had the most tender respect for my canvases, an almost
      religious respect for that human reproduction of a part of nature''s work
      divine. My studies appeared to her a kind of religious pictures, and
      sometimes she spoke to me of God, with the idea of converting me.

“Oh, he was a queer, good-natured being, this God of hers! He was a
      sort of village philosopher without any great resources and without great
      power, for she always figured him to herself as inconsolable over
      injustices committed under his eyes, as though he were powerless to
      prevent them.

“She was, however, on excellent terms with him, affecting even to be
      the confidante of his secrets and of his troubles. She would say:

“''God wills'' or ''God does not will,'' just like a sergeant announcing
      to a recruit: ''The colonel has commanded.''

“At the bottom of her heart she deplored my ignorance of the
      intentions of the Eternal, which she endeavored to impart to me.

“Almost every day I found in my pockets, in my hat when I lifted it
      from the ground, in my paintbox, in my polished shoes, standing in front
      of my door in the morning, those little pious tracts which she no doubt,
      received directly from Paradise.

“I treated her as one would an old friend, with unaffected
      cordiality. But I soon perceived that she had changed somewhat in her
      manner, though, for a while, I paid little attention to it.

“When I was painting, whether in my valley or in some country lane,
      I would see her suddenly appear with her rapid, springy walk. She would
      then sit down abruptly, out of breath, as though she had been running or
      were overcome by some profound emotion. Her face would be red, that
      English red which is denied to the people of all other countries; then,
      without any reason, she would turn ashy pale and seem about to faint away.
      Gradually, however, her natural color would return and she would begin to
      speak.

“Then, without warning, she would break off in the middle of a
      sentence, spring up from her seat and walk away so rapidly and so
      strangely that I was at my wits'' ends to discover whether I had done or
      said anything to displease or wound her.

“I finally came to the conclusion that those were her normal
      manners, somewhat modified no doubt in my honor during the first days of
      our acquaintance.

“When she returned to the farm, after walking for hours on the windy
      coast, her long curls often hung straight down, as if their springs had
      been broken. This had hitherto seldom given her any concern, and she would
      come to dinner without embarrassment all dishevelled by her sister, the
      breeze.

“But now she would go to her room and arrange the untidy locks, and
      when I would say, with familiar gallantry, which, however, always offended
      her:

“''You are as beautiful as a star to-day, Miss Harriet,'' a blush
      would immediately rise to her cheeks, the blush of a young girl, of a girl
      of fifteen.

“Then she would suddenly become quite reserved and cease coming to
      watch me paint. I thought, ''This is only a fit of temper; it will blow
      over.'' But it did not always blow over, and when I spoke to her she would
      answer me either with affected indifference or with sullen annoyance.

“She became by turns rude, impatient and nervous. I never saw her
      now except at meals, and we spoke but little. I concluded at length that I
      must have offended her in some way, and, accordingly, I said to her one
      evening:

“''Miss Harriet, why is it that you do not act toward me as formerly?
      What have I done to displease you? You are causing me much pain!''

“''I am just the same with you as formerly. It is not true, not
      true,'' and she ran upstairs and shut herself up in her room.

“Occasionally she would look at me in a peculiar manner. I have
      often said to myself since then that those who are condemned to death must
      look thus when they are informed that their last day has come. In her eye
      there lurked a species of insanity, an insanity at once mystical and
      violent; and even more, a fever, an aggravated longing, impatient and
      impotent, for the unattained and unattainable.

“Nay, it seemed to me there was also going on within her a struggle
      in which her heart wrestled with an unknown force that she sought to
      master, and even, perhaps, something else. But what do I know? What do I
      know?

“For some time I had commenced to work, as soon as daylight
      appeared, on a picture the subject of which was as follows:

“A deep ravine, enclosed, surmounted by two thickets of trees and
      vines, extended into the distance and was lost, submerged in that milky
      vapor, in that cloud like cotton down that sometimes floats over valleys
      at daybreak. And at the extreme end of that heavy, transparent fog one
      saw, or, rather, surmised, that a couple of human beings were approaching,
      a human couple, a youth and a maiden, their arms interlaced, embracing
      each other, their heads inclined toward each other, their lips meeting.

“A first ray of the sun, glistening through the branches, pierced
      that fog of the dawn, illuminated it with a rosy reflection just behind
      the rustic lovers, framing their vague shadows in a silvery background. It
      was well done; yes, indeed, well done.

“I was working on the declivity which led to the Valley of Etretat.
      On this particular morning I had, by chance, the sort of floating vapor
      which I needed. Suddenly something rose up in front of me like a phantom;
      it was Miss Harriet. On seeing me she was about to flee. But I called
      after her, saying: ''Come here, come here, mademoiselle. I have a nice
      little picture for you.''

“She came forward, though with seeming reluctance. I handed her my
      sketch. She said nothing, but stood for a long time, motionless, looking
      at it, and suddenly she burst into tears. She wept spasmodically, like men
      who have striven hard to restrain their tears, but who can do so no longer
      and abandon themselves to grief, though still resisting. I sprang to my
      feet, moved at the sight of a sorrow I did not comprehend, and I took her
      by the hand with an impulse of brusque affection, a true French impulse
      which acts before it reflects.

“She let her hands rest in mine for a few seconds, and I felt them
      quiver as if all her nerves were being wrenched. Then she withdrew her
      hands abruptly, or, rather, snatched them away.

“I recognized that tremor, for I had felt it, and I could not be
      deceived. Ah! the love tremor of a woman, whether she be fifteen or fifty
      years of age, whether she be of the people or of society, goes so straight
      to my heart that I never have any hesitation in understanding it!

“Her whole frail being had trembled, vibrated, been overcome. I knew
      it. She walked away before I had time to say a word, leaving me as
      surprised as if I had witnessed a miracle and as troubled as if I had
      committed a crime.

“I did not go in to breakfast. I went to take a turn on the edge of
      the cliff, feeling that I would just as lief weep as laugh, looking on the
      adventure as both comic and deplorable and my position as ridiculous,
      believing her unhappy enough to go insane.

“I asked myself what I ought to do. It seemed best for me to leave
      the place, and I immediately resolved to do so.

“Somewhat sad and perplexed, I wandered about until dinner time and
      entered the farmhouse just when the soup had been served up.

“I sat down at the table as usual. Miss Harriet was there, eating
      away solemnly, without speaking to any one, without even lifting her eyes.
      Her manner and expression were, however, the same as usual.

“I waited patiently till the meal had been finished, when, turning
      toward the landlady, I said: ''Well, Madame Lecacheur, it will not be long
      now before I shall have to take my leave of you.''

“The good woman, at once surprised and troubled, replied in her
      drawling voice: ''My dear sir, what is it you say? You are going to leave
      us after I have become so accustomed to you?''

“I glanced at Miss Harriet out of the corner of my eye. Her
      countenance did not change in the least. But Celeste, the little servant,
      looked up at me. She was a fat girl, of about eighteen years of age, rosy,
      fresh, as strong as a horse, and possessing the rare attribute of
      cleanliness. I had kissed her at odd times in out-of-the-way corners,
      after the manner of travellers—nothing more.

“The dinner being at length over, I went to smoke my pipe under the
      apple trees, walking up and down from one end of the enclosure to the
      other. All the reflections which I had made during the day, the strange
      discovery of the morning, that passionate and grotesque attachment for me,
      the recollections which that revelation had suddenly called up,
      recollections at once charming and perplexing, perhaps also that look
      which the servant had cast on me at the announcement of my departure—all
      these things, mixed up and combined, put me now in a reckless humor, gave
      me a tickling sensation of kisses on the lips and in my veins a something
      which urged me on to commit some folly.

“Night was coming on, casting its dark shadows under the trees, when
      I descried Celeste, who had gone to fasten up the poultry yard at the
      other end of the enclosure. I darted toward her, running so noiselessly
      that she heard nothing, and as she got up from closing the small trapdoor
      by which the chickens got in and out, I clasped her in my arms and rained
      on her coarse, fat face a shower of kisses. She struggled, laughing all
      the time, as she was accustomed to do in such circumstances. Why did I
      suddenly loose my grip of her? Why did I at once experience a shock? What
      was it that I heard behind me?

“It was Miss Harriet, who had come upon us, who had seen us and who
      stood in front of us motionless as a spectre. Then she disappeared in the
      darkness.

“I was ashamed, embarrassed, more desperate at having been thus
      surprised by her than if she had caught me committing some criminal act.

“I slept badly that night. I was completely unnerved and haunted by
      sad thoughts. I seemed to hear loud weeping, but in this I was no doubt
      deceived. Moreover, I thought several times that I heard some one walking
      up and down in the house and opening the hall door.

“Toward morning I was overcome by fatigue and fell asleep. I got up
      late and did not go downstairs until the late breakfast, being still in a
      bewildered state, not knowing what kind of expression to put on.

“No one had seen Miss Harriet. We waited for her at table, but she
      did not appear. At length Mother Lecacheur went to her room. The English
      woman had gone out. She must have set out at break of day, as she was wont
      to do, in order to see the sun rise.

“The weather was hot, very hot, one of those broiling, heavy days
      when not a leaf stirs. The table had been placed out of doors, under an
      apple tree, and from time to time Sapeur had gone to the cellar to draw a
      jug of cider, everybody was so thirsty. Celeste brought the dishes from
      the kitchen, a ragout of mutton with potatoes, a cold rabbit and a salad.
      Afterward she placed before us a dish of strawberries, the first of the
      season.

“As I wished to wash and freshen these, I begged the servant to go
      and draw me a pitcher of cold water.

“In about five minutes she returned, declaring that the well was
      dry. She had lowered the pitcher to the full extent of the cord and had
      touched the bottom, but on drawing the pitcher up again it was empty.
      Mother Lecacheur, anxious to examine the thing for herself, went and
      looked down the hole. She returned, announcing that one could see clearly
      something in the well, something altogether unusual. But this no doubt was
      bundles of straw, which a neighbor had thrown in out of spite.

“I wished to look down the well also, hoping I might be able to
      clear up the mystery, and I perched myself close to the brink. I perceived
      indistinctly a white object. What could it be? I then conceived the idea
      of lowering a lantern at the end of a cord. When I did so the yellow flame
      danced on the layers of stone and gradually became clearer. All four of us
      were leaning over the opening, Sapeur and Celeste having now joined us.
      The lantern rested on a black-and-white indistinct mass, singular,
      incomprehensible. Sapeur exclaimed:

“''It is a horse. I see the hoofs. It must have got out of the meadow
      during the night and fallen in headlong.''

“But suddenly a cold shiver froze me to the marrow. I first
      recognized a foot, then a leg sticking up; the whole body and the other
      leg were completely under water.

“I stammered out in a loud voice, trembling so violently that the
      lantern danced hither and thither over the slipper:

“But it was necessary to recover the corpse of the dead woman. I
      attached the young man securely by the waist to the end of the pulley rope
      and lowered him very slowly, watching him disappear in the darkness. In
      one hand he held the lantern and a rope in the other. Soon I recognized
      his voice, which seemed to come from the centre of the earth, saying:

“I then saw him fish something out of the water. It was the other
      leg. He then bound the two feet together and shouted anew:

“I began to wind up, but I felt my arms crack, my muscles twitch,
      and I was in terror lest I should let the man fall to the bottom. When his
      head appeared at the brink I asked:

“We both got on the stone slab at the edge of the well and from
      opposite sides we began to haul up the body.

“Mother Lecacheur and Celeste watched us from a distance, concealed
      from view behind the wall of the house. When they saw issuing from the
      hole the black slippers and white stockings of the drowned person they
      disappeared.

“Sapeur seized the ankles, and we drew up the body of the poor
      woman. The head was shocking to look at, being bruised and lacerated, and
      the long gray hair, out of curl forevermore, hanging down tangled and
      disordered.

“We carried her into the room, and as the women did not put in an
      appearance I, with the assistance of the stable lad, dressed the corpse
      for burial.

“I washed her disfigured face. Under the touch of my finger an eye
      was slightly opened and regarded me with that pale, cold look, that
      terrible look of a corpse which seems to come from the beyond. I braided
      as well as I could her dishevelled hair and with my clumsy hands arranged
      on her head a novel and singular coiffure. Then I took off her dripping
      wet garments, baring, not without a feeling of shame, as though I had been
      guilty of some profanation, her shoulders and her chest and her long arms,
      as slim as the twigs of a tree.

“I next went to fetch some flowers, poppies, bluets, marguerites and
      fresh, sweet-smelling grass with which to strew her funeral couch.

“I then had to go through the usual formalities, as I was alone to
      attend to everything. A letter found in her pocket, written at the last
      moment, requested that her body be buried in the village in which she had
      passed the last days of her life. A sad suspicion weighed on my heart. Was
      it not on my account that she wished to be laid to rest in this place?

“Toward evening all the female gossips of the locality came to view
      the remains of the defunct, but I would not allow a single person to
      enter. I wanted to be alone, and I watched beside her all night.

“I looked at the corpse by the flickering light of the candles, at
      this unhappy woman, unknown to us all, who had died in such a lamentable
      manner and so far away from home. Had she left no friends, no relations
      behind her? What had her infancy been? What had been her life? Whence had
      she come thither alone, a wanderer, lost like a dog driven from home? What
      secrets of sufferings and of despair were sealed up in that
      unprepossessing body, in that poor body whose outward appearance had
      driven from her all affection, all love?

“How many unhappy beings there are! I felt that there weighed upon
      that human creature the eternal injustice of implacable nature! It was all
      over with her, without her ever having experienced, perhaps, that which
      sustains the greatest outcasts to wit, the hope of being loved once!
      Otherwise why should she thus have concealed herself, fled from the face
      of others? Why did she love everything so tenderly and so passionately,
      everything living that was not a man?

“I recognized the fact that she believed in a God, and that she
      hoped to receive compensation from the latter for all the miseries she had
      endured. She would now disintegrate and become, in turn, a plant. She
      would blossom in the sun, the cattle would browse on her leaves, the birds
      would bear away the seeds, and through these changes she would become
      again human flesh. But that which is called the soul had been extinguished
      at the bottom of the dark well. She suffered no longer. She had given her
      life for that of others yet to come.

“Hours passed away in this silent and sinister communion with the
      dead. A pale light at length announced the dawn of a new day; then a red
      ray streamed in on the bed, making a bar of light across the coverlet and
      across her hands. This was the hour she had so much loved. The awakened
      birds began to sing in the trees.

“I opened the window to its fullest extent and drew back the
      curtains that the whole heavens might look in upon us, and, bending over
      the icy corpse, I took in my hands the mutilated head and slowly, without
      terror or disgust, I imprinted a kiss, a long kiss, upon those lips which
      had never before been kissed.”

Leon Chenal remained silent. The women wept. We heard on the box seat the
      Count d''Atraille blowing his nose from time to time. The coachman alone
      had gone to sleep. The horses, who no longer felt the sting of the whip,
      had slackened their pace and moved along slowly. The drag, hardly
      advancing at all, seemed suddenly torpid, as if it had been freighted with
      sorrow.

The former soldier, Mederic Rompel, familiarly called Mederic by the
      country folks, left the post office of Roily-le-Tors at the usual hour.
      After passing through the village with his long stride, he cut across the
      meadows of Villaume and reached the bank of the Brindille, following the
      path along the water''s edge to the village of Carvelin, where he commenced
      to deliver his letters. He walked quickly, following the course of the
      narrow river, which frothed, murmured and boiled in its grassy bed beneath
      an arch of willows.

Mederic went on without stopping, with only this thought in his mind:
      “My first letter is for the Poivron family, then I have one for
      Monsieur Renardet; so I must cross the wood.”

His blue blouse, fastened round his waist by a black leather belt, moved
      in a quick, regular fashion above the green hedge of willow trees, and his
      stout stick of holly kept time with his steady tread.

He crossed the Brindille on a bridge consisting of a tree trunk, with a
      handrail of rope, fastened at either end to a stake driven into the
      ground.

The wood, which belonged to Monsieur Renardet, the mayor of Carvelin and
      the largest landowner in the district, consisted of huge old trees,
      straight as pillars and extending for about half a league along the left
      bank of the stream which served as a boundary to this immense dome of
      foliage. Alongside the water large shrubs had grown up in the sunlight,
      but under the trees one found nothing but moss, thick, soft and yielding,
      from which arose, in the still air, an odor of dampness and of dead wood.

Mederic slackened his pace, took off his black cap adorned with red lace
      and wiped his forehead, for it was by this time hot in the meadows, though
      it was not yet eight o''clock in the morning.

He had just recovered from the effects of the heat and resumed his quick
      pace when he noticed at the foot of a tree a knife, a child''s small knife.
      When he picked it up he discovered a thimble and also a needlecase not far
      away.

Having taken up these objects, he thought: “I''ll entrust them to the
      mayor,” and he resumed his journey, but now he kept his eyes open,
      expecting to find something else.

All of a sudden he stopped short, as if he had struck against a wooden
      barrier. Ten paces in front of him lay stretched on her back on the moss a
      little girl, perfectly nude, her face covered with a handkerchief. She was
      about twelve years old.

Meredic advanced on tiptoe, as if he apprehended some danger, and he
      glanced toward the spot uneasily.

What was this? No doubt she was asleep. Then he reflected that a person
      does not go to sleep naked at half-past seven in the morning under the
      cool trees. So, then, she must be dead, and he must be face to face with a
      crime. At this thought a cold shiver ran through his frame, although he
      was an old soldier. And then a murder was such a rare thing in the
      country, and, above all, the murder of a child, that he could not believe
      his eyes. But she had no wound-nothing save a spot of blood on her leg.
      How, then, had she been killed?

He stopped close to her and gazed at her, while he leaned on his stick.
      Certainly he must know her, for he knew all the inhabitants of the
      district; but, not being able to get a look at her face, he could not
      guess her name. He stooped forward in order to take off the handkerchief
      which covered her face, then paused, with outstretched hand, restrained by
      an idea that occurred to him.

Had he the right to disarrange anything in the condition of the corpse
      before the official investigation? He pictured justice to himself as a
      kind of general whom nothing escapes and who attaches as much importance
      to a lost button as to the stab of a knife in the stomach. Perhaps under
      this handkerchief evidence could be found to sustain a charge of murder;
      in fact, if such proof were there it might lose its value if touched by an
      awkward hand.

Then he raised himself with the intention of hastening toward the mayor''s
      residence, but again another thought held him back. If the little girl
      were still alive, by any chance, he could not leave her lying there in
      this way. He sank on his knees very gently, a little distance from her,
      through precaution, and extended his hand toward her foot. It was icy
      cold, with the terrible coldness of death which leaves us no longer in
      doubt. The letter carrier, as he touched her, felt his heart in his mouth,
      as he said himself afterward, and his mouth parched. Rising up abruptly,
      he rushed off under the trees toward Monsieur Renardet''s house.

He walked on faster than ever, with his stick under his arm, his hands
      clenched and his head thrust forward, while his leathern bag, filled with
      letters and newspapers, kept flapping at his side.

The mayor''s residence was at the end of the wood which served as a park,
      and one side of it was washed by the Brindille.

It was a big square house of gray stone, very old, and had stood many a
      siege in former days, and at the end of it was a huge tower, twenty metres
      high, rising out of the water.

From the top of this fortress one could formerly see all the surrounding
      country. It was called the Fox''s tower, without any one knowing exactly
      why; and from this appellation, no doubt, had come the name Renardet,
      borne by the owners of this fief, which had remained in the same family,
      it was said, for more than two hundred years. For the Renardets formed
      part of the upper middle class, all but noble, to be met with so often in
      the province before the Revolution.

Mederic was recognized as a man of standing and authority, and they
      understood that something serious had happened.

As soon as word was brought to Monsieur Renardet, he ordered the postman
      to be sent up to him. Pale and out of breath, with his cap in his hand,
      Mederic found the mayor seated at a long table covered with scattered
      papers.

He was a large, tall man, heavy and red-faced, strong as an ox, and was
      greatly liked in the district, although of an excessively violent
      disposition. Almost forty years old and a widower for the past six months,
      he lived on his estate like a country gentleman. His choleric temperament
      had often brought him into trouble from which the magistrates of
      Roily-le-Tors, like indulgent and prudent friends, had extricated him. Had
      he not one day thrown the conductor of the diligence from the top of his
      seat because he came near running over his retriever, Micmac? Had he not
      broken the ribs of a gamekeeper who abused him for having, gun in hand,
      passed through a neighbor''s property? Had he not even caught by the collar
      the sub-prefect, who stopped over in the village during an administrative
      circuit, called by Monsieur Renardet an electioneering circuit, for he was
      opposed to the government, in accordance with family traditions.

“By God, I''d make a bet it is little Louise Roque! I have just
      learned that she did not go home to her mother last night. Where did you
      find her?”

The postman described the spot, gave full details and offered to conduct
      the mayor to the place.

“No, I don''t need you. Send the watchman, the mayor''s secretary and
      the doctor to me at once, and resume your rounds. Quick, quick, go and
      tell them to meet me in the wood.”

The letter carrier, a man used to discipline, obeyed and withdrew, angry
      and grieved at not being able to be present at the investigation.

The mayor, in his turn, prepared to go out, took his big soft hat and
      paused for a few seconds on the threshold of his abode. In front of him
      stretched a wide sward, in which were three large beds of flowers in full
      bloom, one facing the house and the others at either side of it. Farther
      on the outlying trees of the wood rose skyward, while at the left, beyond
      the Brindille, which at that spot widened into a pond, could be seen long
      meadows, an entirely green flat sweep of country, intersected by trenches
      and hedges of pollard willows.

To the right, behind the stables, the outhouses and all the buildings
      connected with the property, might be seen the village, which was wealthy,
      being mainly inhabited by cattle breeders.

Renardet slowly descended the steps in front of his house, and, turning to
      the left, gained the water''s edge, which he followed at a slow pace, his
      hand behind his back. He walked on, with bent head, and from time to time
      glanced round in search of the persons he had sent for.

When he stood beneath the trees he stopped, took off his hat and wiped his
      forehead as Mederic had done, for the burning sun was darting its fiery
      rays on the earth. Then the mayor resumed his journey, stopped once more
      and retraced his steps. Suddenly, stooping down, he steeped his
      handkerchief in the stream that glided along at his feet and spread it
      over his head, under his hat. Drops of water flowed down his temples over
      his ears, which were always purple, over his strong red neck, and made
      their way, one after the other, under his white shirt collar.

And the doctor appeared under the trees. He was a thin little man, an
      ex-military surgeon, who passed in the neighborhood for a very skillful
      practitioner. He limped, having been wounded while in the service, and had
      to use a stick to assist him in walking.

Next came the watchman and the mayor''s secretary, who, having been sent
      for at the same time, arrived together. They looked scared, and hurried
      forward, out of breath, walking and running alternately to hasten their
      progress, and moving their arms up and down so vigorously that they seemed
      to do more work with them than with their legs.

Far ahead of them under the trees they saw something white on which the
      sun gleamed down through the branches. As they approached they gradually
      distinguished a human form lying there, its head toward the river, the
      face covered and the arms extended as though on a crucifix.

“I am fearfully warm,” said the mayor, and stooping down, he
      again soaked his handkerchief in the water and placed it round his
      forehead.

The doctor hastened his steps, interested by the discovery. As soon as
      they were near the corpse, he bent down to examine it without touching it.
      He had put on his pince-nez, as one does in examining some curious object,
      and turned round very quietly.

“Violated and murdered, as we shall prove presently. This little
      girl, moreover, is almost a woman—look at her throat.”

The doctor lightly drew away the handkerchief which covered her face,
      which looked black, frightful, the tongue protruding, the eyes bloodshot.
      He went on:

“Strangled with the hands without leaving any special trace, neither
      the mark of the nails nor the imprint of the fingers. Quite right. It is
      little Louise Roque, sure enough!”

“There''s nothing for me to do. She''s been dead for the last hour at
      least. We must give notice of the matter to the authorities.”

Renardet, standing up, with his hands behind his back, kept staring with a
      stony look at the little body exposed to view on the grass. He murmured:

“Do you, Principe” (this was his secretary), “go and
      find those clothes for me along the stream. You, Maxime” (this was
      the watchman), “hurry on toward Rouy-le-Tors and bring with you the
      magistrate with the gendarmes. They must be here within an hour. You
      understand?”

“Who knows? Any one is capable of that. Every one in particular and
      nobody in general. No matter, it must be some prowler, some workman out of
      employment. Since we have become a Republic we meet only this kind of
      person along the roads.”

“And without a wife. Having neither a good supper nor a good bed, he
      became reckless. You can''t tell how many men there may be in the world
      capable of a crime at a given moment. Did you know that this little girl
      had disappeared?”

And with the end of his stick he touched one after the other the stiffened
      fingers of the corpse, resting on them as on the keys of a piano.

“Yes, the mother came last night to look for me about nine o''clock,
      the child not having come home at seven to supper. We looked for her along
      the roads up to midnight, but we did not think of the wood. However, we
      needed daylight to carry out a thorough search.”

They remained standing beside the corpse of the young girl, so pale on the
      dark moss. A big blue fly was walking over the body with his lively, jerky
      movements. The two men kept watching this wandering speck.

“How pretty it is, a fly on the skin! The ladies of the last century
      had good reason to paste them on their faces. Why has this fashion gone
      out?”

But, all of a sudden, he turned round, surprised by a shrill noise. A
      woman in a cap and blue apron was running toward them under the trees. It
      was the mother, La Roque. As soon as she saw Renardet she began to shriek:

“My little girl! Where''s my little girl?” so distractedly that
      she did not glance down at the ground. Suddenly she saw the corpse,
      stopped short, clasped her hands and raised both her arms while she
      uttered a sharp, heartrending cry—the cry of a wounded animal. Then
      she rushed toward the body, fell on her knees and snatched away the
      handkerchief that covered the face. When she saw that frightful
      countenance, black and distorted, she rose to her feet with a shudder,
      then sinking to the ground, face downward, she pressed her face against
      the ground and uttered frightful, continuous screams on the thick moss.

Her tall, thin frame, with its close-clinging dress, was palpitating,
      shaken with spasms. One could see her bony ankles and her dried-up calves
      covered with coarse blue stockings shaking horribly. She was digging the
      soil with her crooked fingers, as though she were trying to make a hole in
      which to hide herself.

Renardet felt a strange sensation. Then he gave vent to a sort of loud
      sneeze, and, drawing his handkerchief from his pocket, he began to weep
      internally, coughing, sobbing and blowing his nose noisily.

The man, knowing that the mayor would not brook opposition, set forth
      again with hesitating steps, casting a timid side glance at the corpse.

Distant voices were heard under the trees, a confused sound, the noise of
      an approaching crowd, for Mederic had, in the course of his rounds,
      carried the news from door to door. The people of the neighborhood, dazed
      at first, had gossiped about it in the street, from one threshold to
      another. Then they gathered together. They talked over, discussed and
      commented on the event for some minutes and had now come to see for
      themselves.

They arrived in groups, a little faltering and uneasy through fear of the
      first impression of such a scene on their minds. When they saw the body
      they stopped, not daring to advance, and speaking low. Then they grew
      bolder, went on a few steps, stopped again, advanced once more, and
      presently formed around the dead girl, her mother, the doctor and Renardet
      a close circle, restless and noisy, which crowded forward at the sudden
      impact of newcomers. And now they touched the corpse. Some of them even
      bent down to feel it with their fingers. The doctor kept them back. But
      the mayor, waking abruptly out of his torpor, flew int

UPDATE stories SET original_text = 'One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself
transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back,
and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed
and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover
it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin
compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.

“What’s happened to me?” he thought. It wasn’t a dream.
His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully
between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out
on the table—Samsa was a travelling salesman—and above it there
hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and
housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and
fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her
lower arm towards the viewer.

Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of rain
could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. “How
about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense”, he
thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to
sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn’t get into that
position. However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back
to where he was. He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that
he wouldn’t have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when
he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before.

“Oh, God”, he thought, “what a strenuous career it is that
I’ve chosen! Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like this
takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that
there’s the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections,
bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that you
can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to
Hell!” He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on
his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found
where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots
which he didn’t know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place
with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it
he was overcome by a cold shudder.

He slid back into his former position. “Getting up early all the
time”, he thought, “it makes you stupid. You’ve got to get
enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance,
whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the
contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their
breakfasts. I ought to just try that with my boss; I’d get kicked out on
the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I
didn’t have my parents to think about I’d have given in my notice a
long time ago, I’d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I
think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He’d
fall right off his desk! And it’s a funny sort of business to be sitting
up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there,
especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of
hearing. Well, there’s still some hope; once I’ve got the money
together to pay off my parents’ debt to him—another five or six
years I suppose—that’s definitely what I’ll do. That’s
when I’ll make the big change. First of all though, I’ve got to get
up, my train leaves at five.”

And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers.
“God in Heaven!” he thought. It was half past six and the hands
were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like
quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed that
it had been set for four o’clock as it should have been; it certainly
must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that
furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all
the more deeply because of that. What should he do now? The next train went at
seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the
collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at all feel
particularly fresh and lively. And even if he did catch the train he would not
avoid his boss’s anger as the office assistant would have been there to
see the five o’clock train go, he would have put in his report about
Gregor’s not being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the
boss’s man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he
reported sick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in
five years of service Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss would
certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse
his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the doctor’s recommendation
not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that
many were workshy. And what’s more, would he have been entirely wrong in
this case? Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping
for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.

He was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to get out
of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven. There was a cautious knock
at the door near his head. “Gregor”, somebody called—it was
his mother—“it’s quarter to seven. Didn’t you want to
go somewhere?” That gentle voice! Gregor was shocked when he heard his
own voice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had
before. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and uncontrollable
squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out at first but then there
was a sort of echo which made them unclear, leaving the hearer unsure whether
he had heard properly or not. Gregor had wanted to give a full answer and
explain everything, but in the circumstances contented himself with saying:
“Yes, mother, yes, thank-you, I’m getting up now.” The change
in Gregor’s voice probably could not be noticed outside through the
wooden door, as his mother was satisfied with this explanation and shuffled
away. But this short conversation made the other members of the family aware
that Gregor, against their expectations was still at home, and soon his father
came knocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist.
“Gregor, Gregor”, he called, “what’s wrong?” And
after a short while he called again with a warning deepness in his voice:
“Gregor! Gregor!” At the other side door his sister came
plaintively: “Gregor? Aren’t you well? Do you need anything?”
Gregor answered to both sides: “I’m ready, now”, making an
effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by enunciating very
carefully and putting long pauses between each, individual word. His father
went back to his breakfast, but his sister whispered: “Gregor, open the
door, I beg of you.” Gregor, however, had no thought of opening the door,
and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit, acquired from his
travelling, of locking all doors at night even when he was at home.

The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed,
to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. Only then would he
consider what to do next, as he was well aware that he would not bring his
thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in bed. He remembered that he had
often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps caused by lying awkwardly, but that
had always turned out to be pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginings
would slowly resolve themselves today. He did not have the slightest doubt that
the change in his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold,
which was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.

It was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow himself up
a little and they fell off by themselves. But it became difficult after that,
especially as he was so exceptionally broad. He would have used his arms and
his hands to push himself up; but instead of them he only had all those little
legs continuously moving in different directions, and which he was moreover
unable to control. If he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first
one that would stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he
wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about
painfully. “This is something that can’t be done in bed”,
Gregor said to himself, “so don’t keep trying to do it”.

The first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out of the
bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not imagine what it
looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it went so slowly; and
finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly shoved himself forwards with
all the force he could gather, he chose the wrong direction, hit hard against
the lower bedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower
part of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive.

So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first,
carefully turning his head to the side. This he managed quite easily, and
despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually followed
slowly in the direction of the head. But when he had at last got his head out
of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself
fall it would be a miracle if his head were not injured, so he became afraid to
carry on pushing himself forward the same way. And he could not knock himself
out now at any price; better to stay in bed than lose consciousness.

It took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier, but when
he lay there sighing, and was once more watching his legs as they struggled
against each other even harder than before, if that was possible, he could
think of no way of bringing peace and order to this chaos. He told himself once
more that it was not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensible
thing to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could at whatever
sacrifice. At the same time, though, he did not forget to remind himself that
calm consideration was much better than rushing to desperate conclusions. At
times like this he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly
as he could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was
enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to offer
him. “Seven o’clock, already”, he said to himself when the
clock struck again, “seven o’clock, and there’s still a fog
like this.” And he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as
if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back to their real
and natural state.

But then he said to himself: “Before it strikes quarter past seven
I’ll definitely have to have got properly out of bed. And by then
somebody will have come round from work to ask what’s happened to me as
well, as they open up at work before seven o’clock.” And so he set
himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed
all at the same time. If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and
kept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it. His back
seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to it falling onto
the carpet. His main concern was for the loud noise he was bound to make, and
which even through all the doors would probably raise concern if not alarm. But
it was something that had to be risked.

When Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed—the new method
was more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock back and
forth—it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody came
to help him. Two strong people—he had his father and the maid in
mind—would have been more than enough; they would only have to push their
arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend down with the
load and then be patient and careful as he swang over onto the floor, where,
hopefully, the little legs would find a use. Should he really call for help
though, even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked? Despite all
the difficulty he was in, he could not suppress a smile at this thought.

After a while he had already moved so far across that it would have been hard
for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard. The time was now ten past
seven and he would have to make a final decision very soon. Then there was a
ring at the door of the flat. “That’ll be someone from work”,
he said to himself, and froze very still, although his little legs only became
all the more lively as they danced around. For a moment everything remained
quiet. “They’re not opening the door”, Gregor said to
himself, caught in some nonsensical hope. But then of course, the maid’s
firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it. Gregor only needed to hear
the visitor’s first words of greeting and he knew who it was—the
chief clerk himself. Why did Gregor have to be the only one condemned to work
for a company where they immediately became highly suspicious at the slightest
shortcoming? Were all employees, every one of them, louts, was there not one of
them who was faithful and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience
that he couldn’t get out of bed if he didn’t spend at least a
couple of hours in the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to
let one of the trainees make enquiries—assuming enquiries were even
necessary—did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they have to
show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious that only the chief
clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate it? And more because
these thoughts had made him upset than through any proper decision, he swang
himself with all his force out of the bed. There was a loud thump, but it
wasn’t really a loud noise. His fall was softened a little by the carpet,
and Gregor’s back was also more elastic than he had thought, which made
the sound muffled and not too noticeable. He had not held his head carefully
enough, though, and hit it as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and
rubbed it against the carpet.

“Something’s fallen down in there”, said the chief clerk in
the room on the left. Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort
that had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too; you
had to concede that it was possible. But as if in gruff reply to this question,
the chief clerk’s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots could now
be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right, Gregor’s
sister whispered to him to let him know: “Gregor, the chief clerk is
here.” “Yes, I know”, said Gregor to himself; but without
daring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.

“Gregor”, said his father now from the room to his left, “the
chief clerk has come round and wants to know why you didn’t leave on the
early train. We don’t know what to say to him. And anyway, he wants to
speak to you personally. So please open up this door. I’m sure
he’ll be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.” Then
the chief clerk called “Good morning, Mr. Samsa”. “He
isn’t well”, said his mother to the chief clerk, while his father
continued to speak through the door. “He isn’t well, please believe
me. Why else would Gregor have missed a train! The lad only ever thinks about
the business. It nearly makes me cross the way he never goes out in the
evenings; he’s been in town for a week now but stayed home every evening.
He sits with us in the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train
timetables. His idea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw. He’s made
a little frame, for instance, it only took him two or three evenings,
you’ll be amazed how nice it is; it’s hanging up in his room;
you’ll see it as soon as Gregor opens the door. Anyway, I’m glad
you’re here; we wouldn’t have been able to get Gregor to open the
door by ourselves; he’s so stubborn; and I’m sure he isn’t
well, he said this morning that he is, but he isn’t.”
“I’ll be there in a moment”, said Gregor slowly and
thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any word of the
conversation. “Well I can’t think of any other way of explaining
it, Mrs. Samsa”, said the chief clerk, “I hope it’s nothing
serious. But on the other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce ever
become slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like, we
simply have to overcome it because of business considerations.”
“Can the chief clerk come in to see you now then?”, asked his
father impatiently, knocking at the door again. “No”, said Gregor.
In the room on his right there followed a painful silence; in the room on his
left his sister began to cry.

So why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably only just
got up and had not even begun to get dressed. And why was she crying? Was it
because he had not got up, and had not let the chief clerk in, because he was
in danger of losing his job and if that happened his boss would once more
pursue their parents with the same demands as before? There was no need to
worry about things like that yet. Gregor was still there and had not the
slightest intention of abandoning his family. For the time being he just lay
there on the carpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in would
seriously have expected him to let the chief clerk in. It was only a minor
discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later on, it
was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot. And it seemed
to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace instead of disturbing
him with talking at him and crying. But the others didn’t know what was
happening, they were worried, that would excuse their behaviour.

The chief clerk now raised his voice, “Mr. Samsa”, he called to
him, “what is wrong? You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more
than yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and unnecessary concern
to your parents and you fail—and I mention this just by the way—you
fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite unheard of.
I’m speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your employer, and
really must request a clear and immediate explanation. I am astonished, quite
astonished. I thought I knew you as a calm and sensible person, and now you
suddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims. This morning, your
employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure to appear, it’s
true—it had to do with the money that was recently entrusted to
you—but I came near to giving him my word of honour that that could not
be the right explanation. But now that I see your incomprehensible stubbornness
I no longer feel any wish whatsoever to intercede on your behalf. And nor is
your position all that secure. I had originally intended to say all this to you
in private, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good reason I
don’t see why your parents should not also learn of it. Your turnover has
been very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that it’s not the time of
year to do especially good business, we recognise that; but there simply is no
time of year to do no business at all, Mr. Samsa, we cannot allow there to
be.”

“But Sir”, called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in
the excitement, “I’ll open up immediately, just a moment. I’m
slightly unwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven’t been able to get up.
I’m still in bed now. I’m quite fresh again now, though. I’m
just getting out of bed. Just a moment. Be patient! It’s not quite as
easy as I’d thought. I’m quite alright now, though. It’s
shocking, what can suddenly happen to a person! I was quite alright last night,
my parents know about it, perhaps better than me, I had a small symptom of it
last night already. They must have noticed it. I don’t know why I
didn’t let you know at work! But you always think you can get over an
illness without staying at home. Please, don’t make my parents suffer!
There’s no basis for any of the accusations you’re making;
nobody’s ever said a word to me about any of these things. Maybe you
haven’t read the latest contracts I sent in. I’ll set off with the
eight o’clock train, as well, these few hours of rest have given me
strength. You don’t need to wait, sir; I’ll be in the office soon
after you, and please be so good as to tell that to the boss and recommend me
to him!”

And while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was saying, he
made his way over to the chest of drawers—this was easily done, probably
because of the practise he had already had in bed—where he now tried to
get himself upright. He really did want to open the door, really did want to
let them see him and to speak with the chief clerk; the others were being so
insistent, and he was curious to learn what they would say when they caught
sight of him. If they were shocked then it would no longer be Gregor’s
responsibility and he could rest. If, however, they took everything calmly he
would still have no reason to be upset, and if he hurried he really could be at
the station for eight o’clock. The first few times he tried to climb up
on the smooth chest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave
himself one last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body was
in serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it. Now he let himself
fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of it
with his little legs. By now he had also calmed down, and kept quiet so that he
could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.

“Did you understand a word of all that?” the chief clerk asked his
parents, “surely he’s not trying to make fools of us”.
“Oh, God!” called his mother, who was already in tears, “he
could be seriously ill and we’re making him suffer. Grete! Grete!”
she then cried. “Mother?” his sister called from the other side.
They communicated across Gregor’s room. “You’ll have to go
for the doctor straight away. Gregor is ill. Quick, get the doctor. Did you
hear the way Gregor spoke just now?” “That was the voice of an
animal”, said the chief clerk, with a calmness that was in contrast with
his mother’s screams. “Anna! Anna!” his father called into
the kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping his hands, “get a
locksmith here, now!” And the two girls, their skirts swishing,
immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the front door of the flat
as they went. How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly? There was
no sound of the door banging shut again; they must have left it open; people
often do in homes where something awful has happened.

Gregor, in contrast, had become much calmer. So they couldn’t understand
his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to him, clearer than
before—perhaps his ears had become used to the sound. They had realised,
though, that there was something wrong with him, and were ready to help. The
first response to his situation had been confident and wise, and that made him
feel better. He felt that he had been drawn back in among people, and from the
doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprising
achievements—although he did not really distinguish one from the other.
Whatever was said next would be crucial, so, in order to make his voice as
clear as possible, he coughed a little, but taking care to do this not too
loudly as even this might well sound different from the way that a human coughs
and he was no longer sure he could judge this for himself. Meanwhile, it had
become very quiet in the next room. Perhaps his parents were sat at the table
whispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed against the
door and listening.

Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. Once there he let
go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself upright against it
using the adhesive on the tips of his legs. He rested there a little while to
recover from the effort involved and then set himself to the task of turning
the key in the lock with his mouth. He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper
teeth—how was he, then, to grasp the key?—but the lack of teeth
was, of course, made up for with a very strong jaw; using the jaw, he really
was able to start the key turning, ignoring the fact that he must have been
causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over
the key and dripped onto the floor. “Listen”, said the chief clerk
in the next room, “he’s turning the key.” Gregor was greatly
encouraged by this; but they all should have been calling to him, his father
and his mother too: “Well done, Gregor”, they should have cried,
“keep at it, keep hold of the lock!” And with the idea that they
were all excitedly following his efforts, he bit on the key with all his
strength, paying no attention to the pain he was causing himself. As the key
turned round he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright
with his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the whole
weight of his body as needed. The clear sound of the lock as it snapped back
was Gregor’s sign that he could break his concentration, and as he
regained his breath he said to himself: “So, I didn’t need the
locksmith after all”. Then he lay his head on the handle of the door to
open it completely.

Because he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide open before he
could be seen. He had first to slowly turn himself around one of the double
doors, and he had to do it very carefully if he did not want to fall flat on
his back before entering the room. He was still occupied with this difficult
movement, unable to pay attention to anything else, when he heard the chief
clerk exclaim a loud “Oh!”, which sounded like the soughing of the
wind. Now he also saw him—he was the nearest to the door—his hand
pressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by a steady
and invisible force. Gregor’s mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed
despite the chief clerk’s being there, looked at his father. Then she
unfolded her arms, took two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the
floor into her skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head
disappeared down onto her breast. His father looked hostile, and clenched his
fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room. Then he looked
uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his hands and wept so
that his powerful chest shook.

So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the other
door which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half of his body
could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant over to one side as
he peered out at the others. Meanwhile the day had become much lighter; part of
the endless, grey-black building on the other side of the street—which
was a hospital—could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular
line of windows piercing its faÃ§ade; the rain was still falling, now throwing
down large, individual droplets which hit the ground one at a time. The washing
up from breakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, for
Gregor’s father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and he
would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of different
newspapers. On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph of Gregor when he
was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand and a carefree smile on his
face as he called forth respect for his uniform and bearing. The door to the
entrance hall was open and as the front door of the flat was also open he could
see onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way down below.

“Now, then”, said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one to
have kept calm, “I’ll get dressed straight away now, pack up my
samples and set off. Will you please just let me leave? You can see”, he
said to the chief clerk, “that I’m not stubborn and I like to do my
job; being a commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling I
couldn’t earn my living. So where are you going, in to the office? Yes?
Will you report everything accurately, then? It’s quite possible for
someone to be temporarily unable to work, but that’s just the right time
to remember what’s been achieved in the past and consider that later on,
once the difficulty has been removed, he will certainly work with all the more
diligence and concentration. You’re well aware that I’m seriously
in debt to our employer as well as having to look after my parents and my
sister, so that I’m trapped in a difficult situation, but I will work my
way out of it again. Please don’t make things any harder for me than they
are already, and don’t take sides against me at the office. I know that
nobody likes the travellers. They think we earn an enormous wage as well as
having a soft time of it. That’s just prejudice but they have no
particular reason to think better of it. But you, sir, you have a better
overview than the rest of the staff, in fact, if I can say this in confidence,
a better overview than the boss himself—it’s very easy for a
businessman like him to make mistakes about his employees and judge them more
harshly than he should. And you’re also well aware that we travellers
spend almost the whole year away from the office, so that we can very easily
fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints, and it’s
almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort of thing, we don’t
usually even hear about them, or if at all it’s when we arrive back home
exhausted from a trip, and that’s when we feel the harmful effects of
what’s been going on without even knowing what caused them. Please,
don’t go away, at least first say something to show that you grant that
I’m at least partly right!”

But the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to speak,
and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his trembling shoulders
as he left. He did not keep still for a moment while Gregor was speaking, but
moved steadily towards the door without taking his eyes off him. He moved very
gradually, as if there had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room. It
was only when he had reached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement,
drew his foot from the living room, and rushed forward in a panic. In the hall,
he stretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there, there
were some supernatural force waiting to save him.

Gregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk go away
in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into extreme danger.
That was something his parents did not understand very well; over the years,
they had become convinced that this job would provide for Gregor for his entire
life, and besides, they had so much to worry about at present that they had
lost sight of any thought for the future. Gregor, though, did think about the
future. The chief clerk had to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally
won over; the future of Gregor and his family depended on it! If only his
sister were here! She was clever; she was already in tears while Gregor was
still lying peacefully on his back. And the chief clerk was a lover of women,
surely she could persuade him; she would close the front door in the entrance
hall and talk him out of his shocked state. But his sister was not there,
Gregor would have to do the job himself. And without considering that he still
was not familiar with how well he could move about in his present state, or
that his speech still might not—or probably would not—be
understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself through the opening; tried to
reach the chief clerk on the landing who, ridiculously, was holding on to the
banister with both hands; but Gregor fell immediately over and, with a little
scream as he sought something to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs.
Hardly had that happened than, for the first time that day, he began to feel
alright with his body; the little legs had the solid ground under them; to his
pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; they were even making the effort to
carry him where he wanted to go; and he was soon believing that all his sorrows
would soon be finally at an end. He held back the urge to move but swayed from
side to side as he crouched there on the floor. His mother was not far away in
front of him and seemed, at first, quite engrossed in herself, but then she
suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting:
“Help, for pity’s sake, Help!” The way she held her head
suggested she wanted to see Gregor better, but the unthinking way she was
hurrying backwards showed that she did not; she had forgotten that the table
was behind her with all the breakfast things on it; when she reached the table
she sat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing; without even
seeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of
coffee was pouring down onto the carpet.

“Mother, mother”, said Gregor gently, looking up at her. He had
completely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not help himself
snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the flow of coffee. That set
his mother screaming anew, she fled from the table and into the arms of his
father as he rushed towards her. Gregor, though, had no time to spare for his
parents now; the chief clerk had already reached the stairs; with his chin on
the banister, he looked back for the last time. Gregor made a run for him; he
wanted to be sure of reaching him; the chief clerk must have expected
something, as he leapt down several steps at once and disappeared; his shouts
resounding all around the staircase. The flight of the chief clerk seemed,
unfortunately, to put Gregor’s father into a panic as well. Until then he
had been relatively self controlled, but now, instead of running after the
chief clerk himself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he ran after him,
Gregor’s father seized the chief clerk’s stick in his right hand
(the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with his hat and
overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with his left, and used
them to drive Gregor back into his room, stamping his foot at him as he went.
Gregor’s appeals to his father were of no help, his appeals were simply
not understood, however much he humbly turned his head his father merely
stamped his foot all the harder. Across the room, despite the chilly weather,
Gregor’s mother had pulled open a window, leant far out of it and pressed
her hands to her face. A strong draught of air flew in from the street towards
the stairway, the curtains flew up, the newspapers on the table fluttered and
some of them were blown onto the floor. Nothing would stop Gregor’s
father as he drove him back, making hissing noises at him like a wild man.
Gregor had never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go
very slowly. If Gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would have been
back in his room straight away, but he was afraid that if he took the time to
do that his father would become impatient, and there was the threat of a lethal
blow to his back or head from the stick in his father’s hand any moment.
Eventually, though, Gregor realised that he had no choice as he saw, to his
disgust, that he was quite incapable of going backwards in a straight line; so
he began, as quickly as possible and with frequent anxious glances at his
father, to turn himself round. It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was
able to see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in fact now
and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a distance as to
which way to turn. If only his father would stop that unbearable hissing! It
was making Gregor quite confused. When he had nearly finished turning round,
still listening to that hissing, he made a mistake and turned himself back a
little the way he had just come. He was pleased when he finally had his head in
front of the doorway, but then saw that it was too narrow, and his body was too
broad to get through it without further difficulty. In his present mood, it
obviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double doors so
that Gregor would have enough space to get through. He was merely fixed on the
idea that Gregor should be got back into his room as quickly as possible. Nor
would he ever have allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as
preparation for getting through the doorway. What he did, making more noise
than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards all the harder as if there had been
nothing in the way; it sounded to Gregor as if there was now more than one
father behind him; it was not a pleasant experience, and Gregor pushed himself
into the doorway without regard for what might happen. One side of his body
lifted itself, he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the
white door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it, soon he
was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by himself, the
little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while those on the other
side were pressed painfully against the ground. Then his father gave him a
hefty shove from behind which released him from where he was held and sent him
flying, and heavily bleeding, deep into his room. The door was slammed shut
with the stick, then, finally, all was quiet.' WHERE id = '37175469-a552-4750-a691-1f066ed2a616';

UPDATE stories SET original_text = 'IN writing this ponderous tome, the author’s desire has been to describe
      the eminent characters and remarkable events of our annals in such a form
      and style that the YOUNG may make acquaintance with them of their own
      accord. For this purpose, while ostensibly relating the adventures of a
      chair, he has endeavored to keep a distinct and unbroken thread of
      authentic history. The chair is made to pass from one to another of those
      personages of whom he thought it most desirable for the young reader to
      have vivid and familiar ideas, and whose lives and actions would best
      enable him to give picturesque sketches of the times. On its sturdy oaken
      legs it trudges diligently from one scene to another, and seems always to
      thrust itself in the way, with most benign complacency, whenever an
      historical personage happens to be looking round for a seat.

There is certainly no method by which the shadowy outlines of departed men
      and women can be made to assume the hues of life more effectually than by
      connecting their images with the substantial and homely reality of a
      fireside chair. It causes us to feel at once that these characters of
      history had a private and familiar existence, and were not wholly
      contained within that cold array of outward action which we are compelled
      to receive as the adequate representation of their lives. If this
      impression can be given, much is accomplished.

Setting aside Grandfather and his auditors, and excepting the adventures
      of the chair, which form the machinery of the work, nothing in the ensuing
      pages can be termed fictitious. The author, it is true, has sometimes
      assumed the license of filling up the outline of history with details for
      which he has none but imaginative authority, but which, he hopes, do not
      violate nor give a false coloring to the truth. He believes that, in this
      respect, his narrative will not be found to convey ideas and impressions
      of which the reader may hereafter find it necessary to purge his mind.

The author’s great doubt is, whether he has succeeded in writing a book
      which will be readable by the class for whom he intends it. To make a
      lively and entertaining narrative for children, with such unmalleable
      material as is presented by the sombre, stern, and rigid characteristics
      of the Puritans and their descendants, is quite as difficult an attempt as
      to manufacture delicate playthings out of the granite, rocks on which New
      England is founded.

GRANDFATHER had been sitting in his old arm-chair all that pleasant
      afternoon, while the children were pursuing their various sports far off
      or near at hand, Sometimes you would have said, “Grandfather is asleep;”
       hut still, even when his eyes were closed, his thoughts were with the
      young people, playing among the flowers and shrubbery of the garden.

He heard the voice of Laurence, who had taken possession of a heap of
      decayed branches which the gardener had lopped from the fruit-trees, and
      was building a little hut for his cousin Clara and himself. He heard
      Clara’s gladsome voice, too, as she weeded and watered the flower-bed
      which had been given her for her own. He could have counted every footstep
      that Charley took, as he trundled his wheelbarrow along the gravel-walk.
      And though’ Grandfather was old and gray-haired, yet his heart leaped with
      joy whenever little Alice came fluttering, like a butterfly, into the
      room. Sire had made each of the children her playmate in turn, and now
      made Grandfather her playmate too, and thought him the merriest of them
      all.

At last the children grew weary of their sports, because a summer
      afternoon is like a long lifetime to the young. So they came into the room
      together, and clustered round Grandfather’s great chair. Little Alice, who
      was hardly five years old, took the privilege of the youngest, and climbed
      his knee. It was a pleasant thing to behold that fair and golden-haired
      child in the lap of the old man, and to think that, different as they
      were, the hearts of both could be gladdened with the same joys.

“Grandfather,” said little Alice, laying her head back upon his arm, “I am
      very tired now. You must tell me a story to make me go to sleep.”

“That is not what story-tellers like,” answered Grandfather, smiling.
      “They are better satisfied when they can keep their auditors awake.”

“But here are Laurence, and Charley, and I,” cried cousin Clara, who was
      twice as old as little Alice. “We will all three keep wide awake. And
      pray, Grandfather, tell us a story about this strange-looking old chair.”

Now, the chair in which Grandfather sat was made of oak, which had grown
      dark with age, but had been rubbed and polished till it shone as bright as
      mahogany. It was very large and heavy, and had a back that rose high above
      Grandfather’s white head. This back was curiously carved in open work, so
      as to represent flowers, and foliage, and other devices, which the
      children had often gazed at, but could never understand what they meant.
      On the very tip-top of the chair, over the head of Grandfather himself,
      was a likeness of a lion’s head, which had such a savage grin that you
      would almost expect to hear it growl and snarl.

The children had seen Grandfather sitting in this chair ever since they
      could remember anything. Perhaps the younger of them supposed that he and
      the chair had come into the world together, and that both had always been
      as old as they were now. At this time, however, it happened to be the
      fashion for ladies to adorn their drawing-rooms with the oldest and oddest
      chairs that could be found. It seemed to cousin Clara that, if these
      ladies could have seen Grandfather’s old chair, they would have thought it
      worth all the rest together. She wondered if it were not even older than
      Grandfather himself, and longed to know all about its history.

“Well, child,” said Grandfather, patting Clara’s cheek, “I can tell you a
      great many stories of my chair. Perhaps your cousin Laurence would like to
      hear them too. They would teach him something about the history and
      distinguished people of his country which he has never read in any of his
      schoolbooks.”

Cousin Laurence was a boy of twelve, a bright scholar, in whom an early
      thoughtfulness and sensibility began to show themselves. His young fancy
      kindled at the idea of knowing all the adventures of this venerable chair.
      He looked eagerly in Grandfather’s face; and even Charley, a bold, brisk,
      restless little fellow of nine, sat himself down on the carpet, and
      resolved to be quiet for at least ten minutes, should the story last so
      long.

Meantime, little Alice was already asleep; so Grandfather, being much
      pleased with such an attentive audience, began to talk about matters that
      happened long ago.

BUT before relating the adventures of the chairs found it necessary to
      speak of circumstances that caused the first settlement of New England.
      For it will soon be perceived that the story of this remarkable chair
      cannot be told without telling a great deal of the history of the country.

So Grandfather talked about the Puritans, {Foot Note: It is more precise
      to give the name of Pilgrims to those Englishmen who went to Holland and
      afterward to Plymouth. They were sometimes called Separatists because they
      separated themselves from the church of England, sometimes Brownists after
      the name of one of their eminent ministers. The Puritans formed a great
      political as well as religious party in England, and did not at first
      separate themselves from the church of England, though those who came to
      this country did so at once.} as those persons were called who thought it
      sinful to practise certain religious forms and ceremonies of the Church of
      England. These Puritans suffered so much persecuted in England that, in
      1607, many of them went over to Holland, and lived ten or twelve years at
      Amsterdam and Leyden. But they feared that, if they continued there much
      longer, they should cease to be England, and should adopt all the manners,
      and ideas, and feelings of the Dutch. For this and other reasons, in the
      year 1620 they embarked on board the ship Mayflower, and crossed the
      ocean, to the shores of Cape Cod. There they made a settlement, and called
      it Plymouth, which, though now a part of Massachusetts, was for a long
      time a colony by itself. And thus was formed the earliest settlement of
      the Puritans in America.

Meantime, those of the Puritans who remained in England continued to
      suffer grievous persecution on account of their religious opinions. They
      began to look around them for some spot where they might worship God, not
      as the king and bishops thought fit, but according to the dictates of
      their own consciences. When their brethren had gone from Holland to
      America, they bethought themselves that they likewise might find refuge
      from persecution there. Several gentlemen among them purchased a tract of
      country on the coast of Massachusetts Bay, and obtained a charter from
      King Charles, which authorized them to make laws for the settlers. In the
      year 1628 they sent over a few people, with John Endicott at their bead,
      to commence a plantation at Salem. {Foot Note: The Puritans had a liking
      for Biblical names for their children, and they sometimes gave names out
      of the Bible to places, Salem means Peace. The Indian name was Naumkeag.}
      Peter Palfrey, Roger Conant, and one or two more had built houses there in
      1626, and may be considered as the first settlers of that ancient town.
      Many other Puritans prepared to follow Endicott.

“And now we come to the chair, my dear children,” said Grandfather. “This
      chair is supposed to have been made of an oak-tree which grew in the park
      of the English Earl of Lincoln between two and three centuries ago. In its
      younger days it used, probably, to stand in the hall of the earl’s castle.
      Do not you see the coat of arms of the family of Lincoln carved in the
      open work of the back? But when his daughter, the Lady Arbella, was
      married to a certain Mr. Johnson, the earl gave her this valuable chair.”

“He was a gentleman of great wealth, who agreed with the Puritans in their
      religious opinions,” answered Grandfather. “And as his belief was the same
      as theirs, he resolved that he would live and die with them. Accordingly,
      in the month of April, 1630, he left his pleasant abode and all his
      comforts in England, and embarked, with Lady Arbella, on board of a ship
      bound for America.”

As Grandfather was frequently impeded by the questions and observations of
      his young auditors, we deem it advisable to omit all such prattle as is
      not essential to the story. We have taken some pains to find out exactly
      what Grandfather said, and here offer to our readers, as nearly as
      possible in his own words, the story of the Lady Arbella.

The ship in which Mr. Johnson and his lady embarked, taking Grandfather’s
      chair along with them, was called the Arbella, in honor of the lady
      herself. A fleet of ten or twelve vessels, with many hundred passengers,
      left England about the same time; for a multitude of people, who were
      discontented with the king’s government and oppressed by the bishops, were
      flocking over to the New World. One of the vessels in the fleet was that
      same Mayflower which had carried the Puritan Pilgrims to Plymouth. And
      now, my children, I would have you fancy yourselves in the cabin of the
      good ship Arbella; because, if you could behold the passengers aboard that
      vessel, you would feel what a blessing and honor it was for New England to
      have such settlers. They were the best men and women of their day.

Among the passengers was John Winthrop, who had sold the estate of his
      forefathers, and was going to prepare a new home for his wife and children
      in the wilderness. He had the king’s charter in his keeping, and was
      appointed the first governor of Massachusetts. Imagine him a person of
      grave and benevolent aspect, dressed in a black velvet suit, with a broad
      ruff around his neck, and a peaked beard upon his chin. {Foot Note: There
      is a statue representing John Winthrop in Scollay Square in Boston. He
      holds the charter in his hand, and a Bible is under his arm.} There was
      likewise a minister of the gospel whom the English bishops had forbidden
      to preach, but who knew that he should have liberty both to preach and
      pray in the forests of America. He wore a black cloak, called a Geneva
      cloak, and had a black velvet cap, fitting close to his head, as was the
      fashion of almost all the Puritan clergymen. In their company came Sir
      Richard Saltonstall, who had been one of the five first projectors of the
      new colony. He soon returned to his native country. But his descendants
      still remain in New England; and the good old family name is as much
      respected in our days as it was in those of Sir Richard.

Not only these, but several other men of wealth and pious ministers were
      in the cabin of the Arbella. One had banished himself forever from the old
      hall where his ancestors had lived for hundreds of years. Another had left
      his quiet parsonage, in a country town of England. Others had come from
      the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge, where they had gained great fame
      for their learning. And here they all were, tossing upon the uncertain and
      dangerous sea, and bound for a home that was more dangerous than even the
      sea itself. In the cabin, likewise, sat the Lady Arbella in her chair,
      with a gentle and sweet expression on her face, but looking too pale and
      feeble to endure the hardships of the wilderness.

Every morning and evening the Lady Arbella gave up her great chair to one
      of the ministers, who took his place in it and read passages from the
      Bible to his companions. And thus, with prayers, and pious conversation,
      and frequent singing of hymns, which the breezes caught from their lips
      and scattered far over the desolate waves, they prosecuted their voyage,
      and sailed into the harbor of Salem in the month of June.

At that period there were but six or eight dwellings in the town; and
      these were miserable hovels, with roofs of straw and wooden chimneys. The
      passengers in the fleet either built huts with bark and branches of trees,
      or erected tents of cloth till they could provide themselves with better
      shelter. Many of them went to form a settlement at Charlestown. It was
      thought fit that the Lady Arbella should tarry in Salem for a time; she
      was probably received as a guest into the family of John Endicott. He was
      the chief person in the plantation, and had the only comfortable house
      which the new-comers had beheld since they left England. So now, children,
      you must imagine Grandfather’s chair in the midst of a new scene.

Suppose it a hot summer’s day, and the lattice-windows of a chamber in Mr.
      Endicott’s house thrown wide open. The Lady Arbella, looking paler than
      she did on shipboard, is sitting in her chair, and thinking mournfully of
      far-off England. She rises and goes to the window. There, amid patches Of
      garden ground and cornfield, she sees the few wretched hovels of the
      settlers, with the still ruder wigwams and cloth tents of the passengers
      who had arrived in the same fleet with herself. Far and near stretches the
      dismal forest of pine-trees, which throw their black shadows over the
      whole land, and likewise over the heart of this poor lady.

All the inhabitants of the little village are busy. One is clearing a spot
      on the verge of the forest for his homestead; another is hewing the trunk
      of a fallen pine-tree, in order to build himself a dwelling; a third is
      hoeing in his field of Indian corn. Here comes a huntsman out of the
      woods, dragging a bear which he has shot, and shouting to the neighbors to
      lend him a hand. There goes a man to the sea-shore, with a spade and a
      bucket, to dig a mess of clams, which were a principal article of food
      with the first settlers. Scattered here and there are two or three dusky
      figures, clad in mantles of fur, with ornaments of bone hanging from their
      ears, and the feathers of wild birds in their coal-black hair. They have
      belts of shellwork slung across their shoulders, and are armed with bows
      and arrows, and flint-headed spears. These are an Indian sagamore and his
      attendants, who have come to gaze at the labors of the white men. And now
      rises a cry that a pack of wolves have seized a young calf in the pasture;
      and every man snatches up his gun or pike and runs in chase of the
      marauding beasts.

Poor Lady Arbella watches all these sights, and feels that this New World
      is fit only for rough and hardy people. None should be here but those who
      can struggle with wild beasts and wild men, and can toil in the heat or
      cold, and can keep their hearts firm against all difficulties and dangers.
      But she is not of these. Her gentle and timid spirit sinks within her;
      and, turning away from the window, she sits down in the great chair and
      wonders whereabouts in the wilderness her friends will dig her grave.

Mr. Johnson had gone, with Governor Winthrop and most of the other
      passengers, to Boston, where he intended to build a house for Lady Arbella
      and himself. Boston was then covered with wild woods, and had fewer
      inhabitants, even, than Salem. During her husband’s absence, poor Lady
      Arbella felt herself growing ill, and was hardly able to stir from the
      great chair. Whenever John Endicott noticed her despondency he doubtless
      addressed her with words of comfort. “Cheer up, my good lady!” he would
      say.

“In a little time you will love this rude life of the wilderness as I do.”
       But Endicott’s heart was as bold and resolute as iron, and he could not
      understand why a woman’s heart should not be of iron too.

Still, however, he spoke kindly to the lady, and then hastened forth to
      till his cornfield and set out fruit-trees, or to bargain with the Indians
      for furs, or perchance to oversee the building of a fort. Also, being a
      magistrate, he had often to punish some idler or evil doer, by ordering
      him to be set in the stocks or scourged at the whipping-post. Often, too,
      as was the custom of the times, he and Mr. Higginson, the minister of
      Salem, held long religious talks together. Thus John Endicott was a man of
      multifarious business, and had no time to look back regretfully to his
      native land. He felt himself fit for the New World and for the work that
      he had to do, and set himself resolutely to accomplish it.

What a contrast, my dear children, between this bold, rough, active man,
      and the gentle Lady Arbella, who was fading away, like a pale English
      flower, in the shadow of the forest! And now the great chair was often
      empty, because Lady Arbella grew too weak to arise from bed.

Meantime, her husband had pitched upon a spot for their new home. He
      returned from Boston to Salem, travelling through the woods on foot, and
      leaning on his pilgrim’s staff. His heart yearned within him; for he was
      eager to tell his wife of the new home which he had chosen. But when he
      beheld her pale and hollow cheek, and found how her strength was wasted,
      he must have known that her appointed home was in a better land. Happy for
      him then—happy both for him and her—if they remembered that
      there was a path to heaven, as well from this heathen wilderness as from
      the Christian land whence they had come. And so, in one short month from
      her arrival, the gentle Lady Arbella faded away and died. They dug a grave
      for her in the new soil, where the roots of the pine-trees impeded their
      spades; and when her bones had rested there nearly two hundred years, and
      a city had sprung up around them, a church of stone was built upon the
      spot.

Charley, almost at the commencement of the foregoing narrative, had
      galloped away, with a prodigious clatter, upon Grandfather’s stick, and
      was not yet returned. So large a boy should have been ashamed to ride upon
      a stick. But Laurence and Clara had listened attentively, and were
      affected by this true story of the gentle lady who had come so far to die
      so soon. Grandfather had supposed that little Alice was asleep; but
      towards the close of the story, happening to look down upon her, he saw
      that her blue eyes were wide open, and fixed earnestly upon his face. The
      tears had gathered in them, like dew upon a delicate flower; but when
      Grandfather ceased to speak, the sunshine of her smile broke forth again.

“Oh, the lady must have been so glad to get to heaven!” exclaimed little
      Alice. “Grandfather, what became of Mr. Johnson?” asked Clara.

“His heart appears to have been quite broken,” answered Grandfather; “for
      he died at Boston within a month after the death of his wife. He was
      buried in the very same tract of ground where he had intended to build a
      dwelling for Lady Arbella and himself. Where their house would have stood,
      there was his grave.”

“The people loved and respected Mr. Johnson so much,” continued
      Grandfather, “that it was the last request of many of them, when they
      died, that they might be buried as near as possible to this good man’s
      grave. And so the field became the first burial ground in Boston. When you
      pass through Tremont Street, along by King’s Chapel, you see a
      burial-ground, containing many old grave-stones and monuments. That was
      Mr. Johnson’s field.”

“How sad is the thought,” observed Clara, “that one of the first things
      which the settlers had to do, when they came to the New World, was to set
      apart a burial-ground!”

“Perhaps,” said Laurence, “if they had found no need of burial-grounds
      here, they would have been glad, after a few years, to go back to
      England.”

Grandfather looked at Laurence, to discover whether he knew how profound
      and true a thing he had said.

NOT long after Grandfather had told the story of his great chair, there
      chanced to be a rainy day. Our friend Charley, after disturbing the
      household with beat of drum and riotous shouts, races up and down the
      staircase, overturning of chairs, and much other uproar, began to feel the
      quiet and confinement within doors intolerable. But as the rain came down
      in a flood, the little fellow was hopelessly a prisoner, and now stood
      with sullen aspect at a window, wondering whether the sun itself were not
      extinguished by so much moisture in the sky.

Charley had already exhausted the less eager activity of the other
      children; and they had betaken themselves to occupations that did not
      admit of his companionship. Laurence sat in a recess near the book-ease,
      reading, not for the first time, the Midsummer Night’s Dream. Clara was
      making a rosary of beads for a little figure of a Sister of Charity, who
      was to attend the Bunker Hill fair and lend her aid in erecting the
      Monument. Little Alice sat on Grandfather’s footstool, with a picture-book
      in her hand; and, for every picture, the child was telling Grandfather a
      story. She did not read from the book (for little Alice had not much skill
      in reading), but told the story out of her own heart and mind.

Charley was too big a boy, of course, to care anything about little
      Alice’s stories, although Grandfather appeared to listen with a good deal
      of interest. Often in a young child’s ideas and fancies, there, is
      something which it requires the thought of a lifetime to comprehend. But
      Charley was of opinion that, if a story must be told, it had better be
      told by Grandfather than little Alice.

Now, Grandfather remembered that Charley had galloped away upon a stick in
      the midst of the narrative of poor Lady Arbella, and I know not whether he
      would have thought it worth while to tell another story merely to gratify
      such an inattentive auditor as Charley. But Laurence laid down his book
      and seconded the request. Clara drew her chair nearer to Grandfather; and
      little Alice immediately closed her picture-book and looked up into his
      face. Grandfather had not the heart to disappoint them.

He mentioned several persons who had a share in the settlement of our
      country, and who would be well worthy of remembrance, if we could find
      room to tell about them all. Among the rest, Grandfather spoke of the
      famous Hugh Peters, a minister of the gospel, who did much good to the
      inhabitants of Salem. Mr. Peters afterwards went back to England, and was
      chaplain to Oliver Cromwell; but Grandfather did not tell the children
      what became of this upright and zealous man at last. In fact, his auditors
      were growing impatient to hear more about the history of the chair.

“After the death of Mr. Johnson,” said he, “Grandfather’s chair came into
      the possession of Roger Williams. He was a clergyman, who arrived at
      Salem, and settled there in 1631. Doubtless the good man has spent many a
      studious hour in this old chair, either penning a sermon or reading some
      abstruse book of theology, till midnight came upon him unawares. At that
      period, as there were few lamps or candles to be had, people used to read
      or work by the light of pitch-pine torches. These supplied the place of
      the ‘midnight oil’ to the learned men of New England.”

Grandfather went on to talk about Roger Williams, and told the children
      several particulars, which we have not room to repeat.

“ROGER WILLIAMS,” said Grandfather, “did not keep possession of the chair
      a great while. His opinions of civil and religious matters differed, in
      many respects, from those of the rulers and clergymen of Massachusetts.
      Now, the wise men of those days believed that the country could not be
      safe unless all the inhabitants thought and felt alike.”

“Possibly there are some who believe it,” said Grandfather; “but they have
      not so much power to act upon their belief as the magistrates and
      ministers had in the days of Roger Williams. They had the power to deprive
      this good man of his home, and to send him out from the midst of them in
      search of a new place of rest. He was banished in 1634, and went first to
      Plymouth colony; but as the people there held the same opinions as those
      of Massachusetts, he was not suffered to remain among them. However, the
      wilderness was wide enough; so Roger Williams took his staff and travelled
      into the forest and made treaties with the Indians, and began a plantation
      which he called Providence.”

“Yes, Charley,” replied Grandfather; “but when Roger Williams travelled
      thither, over hills and valleys, and through the tangled woods, and across
      swamps and streams, it was a journey of several days. Well, his little
      plantation has now grown to be a populous city; and the inhabitants have a
      great veneration for Roger Williams. His name is familiar in the mouths of
      all, because they see it on their bank-bills. How it would have perplexed
      this good clergyman if he had been told that he should give his name to
      the ROGER WILLIAMS BANK!”

“When he was driven from Massachusetts,” said Lawrence, “and began his
      journey into the woods, he must have felt as if he were burying himself
      forever from the sight and knowledge of men. Yet the whole country has now
      heard of him, and will remember him forever.”

“Yes,” answered Grandfather; “it often happens that the outcasts of one
      generation are those who are reverenced as the wisest and best of men by
      the next. The securest fame is that which comes after a man’s death. But
      let us return to our story. When Roger Williams was banished, he appears
      to have given the chair to Mrs. Anne Hutchinson. At all events, it was in
      her possession in 1687. She was a very sharp-witted and well-instructed
      lady, and was so conscious of her own wisdom and abilities that she
      thought it a pity that the world should not have the benefit of them. She
      therefore used to hold lectures in Boston once or twice a week, at which
      most of the women attended. Mrs. Hutchinson presided at these meetings,
      sitting with great state and dignity in Grandfather’s chair.”

“Grandfather, was it positively this very chair?” demanded Clara, laying
      her hand upon its carved elbow.

“Why not, my dear Clara?” said Grandfather. “Well, Mrs. Hutchinson’s
      lectures soon caused a great disturbance; for the ministers of Boston did
      not think it safe and proper that a woman should publicly instruct the
      people in religious doctrines. Moreover, she made the matter worse by
      declaring that the Rev. Mr. Cotton was the only sincerely pious and holy
      clergyman in New England. Now, the clergy of those days had quite as much
      share in the government of the country, though indirectly, as the
      magistrates themselves; so you may imagine what a host of powerful enemies
      were raised up against Mrs. Hutchinson. A synod was convened; that is to
      say, an assemblage of all the ministers in Massachusetts. They declared
      that there were eighty-two erroneous opinions on religious subjects
      diffused among the people, and that Mrs. Hutchinson’s opinions were of the
      number.”

“If they had eighty-two wrong opinions,” observed Charley, “I don’t see
      how they could have any right ones.”

“Mrs. Hutchinson had many zealous friends and converts,” continued
      Grandfather. “She was favored by young Henry Vane, who had come over from
      England a year or two before, and had since been chosen governor of the
      colony, at the age of twenty-four. But Winthrop and most of the other
      leading men, as well as the ministers, felt an abhorrence of her
      doctrines. Thus two opposite parties were formed; and so fierce were the
      dissensions that it was feared the consequence would be civil war and
      bloodshed. But Winthrop and the ministers being the most powerful, they
      disarmed and imprisoned Mrs. Hutchinson’s adherents. She, like Roger
      Williams, was banished.”

“Dear Grandfather, did they drive the poor woman into the woods?”
       exclaimed little Alice, who contrived to feel a human interest even in
      these discords of polemic divinity.

“They did, my darling,” replied Grandfather; “and the end of her life was
      so sad you must not hear it. At her departure, it appears, from the best
      authorities, that she gave the great Chair to her friend Henry Vane. He
      was a young man of wonderful talents and great learning, who had imbibed
      the religious opinions of the Puritans, and left England with the
      intention of spending his life in Massachusetts. The people chose him
      governor; but the controversy about Mrs. Hutchinson, and other troubles,
      caused him to leave country in 1637. You may read the subsequent events of
      his life in the History of England.”

“Yes, Grandfather,” cried Laurence; “and we may read them better in Mr.
      Upham’s biography of Vane. And what a beautiful death he died, long
      afterwards! beautiful, though it was on a scaffold.”

“Many of the most beautiful deaths have been there,” said Grandfather.
      “The enemies of a great and good man can in no other way make him so
      glorious as by giving him the crown of martyrdom.”

In order that the children might fully understand the all-important
      history of the chair, Grandfather now thought fit to speak of the progress
      that was made in settling several colonies. The settlement of Plymouth, in
      1620, has already been mentioned. In 1635 Mr. Hooker and Mr. Stone, two
      ministers, went on foot from Massachusetts to Connecticut, through the
      pathless woods, taking their whole congregation along with them. They
      founded the town of Hartford. In 1638 Mr. Davenport, a very celebrated
      minister, went, with other people, and began a plantation at New Haven. In
      the same year, some persons who had been persecuted in Massachusetts went
      to the Isle of Rhodes, since called Rhode Island, and settled there. About
      this time, also, many settlers had gone to Maine, and were living without
      any regular government. There were likewise settlers near Piscataqua
      River, in the region which is now called New Hampshire.

Thus, at various points along the coast of New England, there were
      communities of Englishmen. Though these communities were independent of
      one another, yet they had a common dependence upon England; and, at so
      vast a distance from their native home, the inhabitants must all have felt
      like brethren. They were fitted to become one united People at a future
      period. Perhaps their feelings of brotherhood were the stronger because
      different nations had formed settlements to the north and to the south. In
      Canada and Nova Scotia were colonies of French. On the banks of the Hudson
      River was a colony of Dutch, who had taken possession of that region many
      years before, and called it New Netherlands.

Grandfather, for aught I know, might have gone on to speak of Maryland and
      Virginia; for the good old gentleman really seemed to suppose that the
      whole surface of the United States was not too broad a foundation to place
      the four legs of his chair upon. But, happening to glance at Charley, he
      perceived that this naughty boy was growing impatient and meditating
      another ride upon a stick. So here, for the present, Grandfather suspended
      the history of his chair.

The children had now learned to look upon the chair with an interest which
      was almost the same as if it were a conscious being, and could remember
      the many famous people whom it had held within its arms.

Even Charley, lawless as he was, seemed to feel that this venerable chair
      must not be clambered upon nor overturned, although he had no scruple in
      taking such liberties With every other chair in the house. Clara treated
      it with still greater reverence, often taking occasion to smooth its
      cushion, and to brush the dust from the carved flowers and grotesque
      figures of its oaken back and arms. Laurence would sometimes sit a whole
      hour, especially at twilight, gazing at the chair, and, by the spell of
      his imaginations, summoning up its ancient occupants to appear in it
      again.

Little Alice evidently employed herself in a similar way; for once when
      Grandfather had gone abroad, the child was heard talking with the gentle
      Lady Arbella, as if she were still sitting in the chair. So sweet a child
      as little Alice may fitly talk with angels, such as the Lady Arbella had
      long since become.

Grandfather was soon importuned for more stories about the chair. He had
      no difficulty in relating them; for it really seemed as if every person
      noted in our early history had, on some occasion or other, found repose
      within its comfortable arms. If Grandfather took pride in anything, it was
      in being the possessor of such an honorable and historic elbow-chair.

“I know not precisely who next got possession of the chair after Governor
      Vane went back to England,” said Grandfather. “But there is reason to
      believe that President Dunster sat in it, when he held the first
      Commencement at Harvard College. You have often heard, children, how
      careful our forefathers were to give their young people a good education.
      They had scarcely cut down trees enough to make room for their own
      dwellings before they began to think of establishing a college. Their
      principal object was, to rear up pious and learned ministers; and hence
      old writers call Harvard College a school of the prophets.”

“It is a long while since I took my degree, Charley. You must ask some of
      the recent graduates,” answered Grandfather. “As I was telling you,
      President Dunster sat in Grandfather’s chair in 1642, when he conferred
      the degree of bachelor of arts on nine young men. They were the first in
      America who had received that honor. And now, my dear auditors, I must
      confess that there are contradictory statements and some uncertainty about
      the adventures of the chair for a period of almost ten years. Some say
      that it was occupied by your own ancestor, William Hawthorne, first
      speaker of the House of Representatives. I have nearly satisfied myself,
      however, that, during most of this questionable period, it was literally
      the chair of state. It gives me much pleasure to imagine that several
      successive governors of Massachusetts sat in it at the council board.”

“But, Grandfather,” interposed Charley, who was a matter-of-fact little
      person, “what reason have you, to imagine so?”

“With Charley’s permission, I will,” replied Grandfather, smiling. “Let us
      consider it settled, therefore, that Winthrop, Bellingham, Dudley, and
      Endicott, each of them, when chosen governor, took his seat in our great
      chair on election day. In this chair, likewise, did those excellent
      governors preside while holding consultations with the chief councillors
      of the province, who were styled assistants. The governor sat in this
      chair, too, whenever messages were brought to him from the chamber of
      representatives.”

And here Grandfather took occasion to talk rather tediously about the
      nature and forms of government that established themselves, almost
      spontaneously, in Massachusetts and the other New England colonies.
      Democracies were the natural growth of the New World. As to Massachusetts,
      it was at first intended that the colony should be governed by a council
      in London. But in a little while the people had the whole power in their
      own hands, and chose annually the governor, the councillors, and the
      representatives. The people of Old England had never enjoyed anything like
      the liberties and privileges which the settlers of New England now
      possessed. And they did not adopt these modes of government after long
      study, but in simplicity, as if there were no other way for people to be
      ruled.

“But, Laurence,” continued Grandfather, “when you want instruction on
      these points, you must seek it in Mr. Bancroft’s History. I am merely
      telling the history of a chair. To proceed. The period during which the
      governors sat in our chair was not very full of striking incidents. The
      province was now established on a secure foundation; but it did not
      increase so rapidly as at first, because the Puritans were no longer
      driven from England by persecution. However, there was still a quiet and
      natural growth. The Legislature incorporated towns, and made new purchases
      of lands from the Indians. A very memorable event took place in 1643. The
      colonies of Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven formed a
      union, for the purpose of assisting each other in difficulties, for mutual
      defence against their enemies. They called themselves the United Colonies
      of New England.”

“No,” replied Grandfather; “the different colonies did not compose one
      nation together; it was merely a confederacy among the governments: It
      somewhat resembled the league of the Amphictyons, which you remember in
      Grecian history. But to return to our chair. In 1644 it was highly
      honored; for Governor Endicott sat in it when he gave audience to an
      ambassador from the French governor of Acadia, or Nova Scotia. A treaty of
      peace between Massachusetts and the French colony was then signed.”

“Did England allow Massachusetts to make war and peace with foreign
      countries?” asked Laurence.

“Massachusetts and the whole of New England was then almost independent of
      the mother country,” said Grandfather. “There was now a civil war in
      England; and the king, as you may well suppose, had his hands full at
      home, and could pay but little attention to these remote colonies. When
      the Parliament got the power into their hands, they likewise had enough to
      do in keeping down the Cavaliers. Thus New England, like a young and hardy
      lad whose father and mother neglect it, was left to take care of itself.
      In 1649 King Charles was beheaded. Oliver Cromwell then became Protector
      of England; and as he was a Puritan himself, and had risen by the valor of
      the English Puritans, he showed himself a loving and indulgent father to
      the Puritan colonies in America.”

Grandfather might have continued to talk in this dull manner nobody knows
      how long; but suspecting that Charley would find the subject rather dry,
      he looked sidewise at that vivacious little fellow, and saw him give an
      involuntary yawn. Whereupon Grandfather proceeded with the history of the
      chair, and related a very entertaining incident, which will be found in
      the next chapter.

“ACCORDING to the most authentic records, my dear children,” said
      Grandfather, “the chair, about this time, had the misfortune to break its
      leg. It was probably on account of this accident that it ceased to be the
      seat of the governors of Massachusetts; for, assuredly, it would have been
      ominous of evil to the commonwealth if the chair of state had tottered
      upon three legs. Being therefore sold at auction,—alas I what a
      vicissitude for a chair that had figured in such high company!—our
      venerable friend was knocked down to a certain Captain John Hull. This old
      gentleman, on carefully examining the maimed chair, discovered that its
      broken leg might be clamped with iron and made as serviceable as ever.”

“Here is the very leg that was broken!” exclaimed Charley, throwing
      himself down on the floor to look at it. “And here are the iron clamps.
      How well it was mended!”

When they had all sufficiently examined the broken leg, Grandfather told
      them a story about Captain John Hull and the Pine-tree Shillings.

The Captain John Hull aforesaid was the mint-master of Massachusetts, and
      coined all the money that was made there. This was a new line of business,
      for, in the earlier days of the colony, the current coinage consisted of
      gold and silver money of England, Portugal, and Spain. These coins being
      scarce, the people were often forced to barter their commodities instead
      of selling them.

For instance, if a man wanted to buy a coat, he perhaps exchanged a
      bear-skin for it. If he wished for a barrel of molasses, he might purchase
      it with a pile of pine boards. Musket-bullets were used instead of
      farthings. The Indians had a sort of money, called wampum, which was made
      of clam-shells; and this strange sort of specie was likewise taken in
      payment of debts by the English settlers. Bank-bills had never been heard
      of. There was not money enough of any kind, in many parts of the country,
      to pay the salaries of the ministers; so that they sometimes had to take
      quintals of fish, bushels of corn, or cords of wood, instead of silver or
      gold.

As the people grew more numerous, and their trade one with another
      increased, the want of current money was still more sensibly felt. To
      supply the demand, the General Court passed a law for establishing a
      coinage of shillings, sixpences, and threepences. Captain John Hull was
      appointed to manufacture this money, and was to have about one shilling
      out of every twenty to pay him for the trouble of making them.

Hereupon all the old silver in the colony was handed over to Captain John
      Hull. The battered silver cans and tankards, I suppose, and silver
      buckles, and broken spoons, and silver buttons of worn-out coats, and
      silver hilts of swords that had figured at court,—all such curious
      old articles were doubtless thrown into the melting-pot together. But by
      far the greater part of the silver consisted of bullion from the mines of
      South America, which the English buccaneers—who were little better
      than pirates—had taken from the Spaniards and brought to
      Massachusetts.

All this old and new silver being melted down and coined, the result was
      an immense amount of splendid shillings, sixpences, and threepences. Each
      had the date, 1652, on the one side, and the figure of a pine-tree on the
      other. Hence they were called pine-tree shillings. And for every twenty
      shillings that he coined, you will remember, Captain John Hull was
      entitled to put one shilling into his own pocket.

The magistrates soon began to suspect that the mint master would have the
      best of the bargain. They offered him a large sum of money if he would but
      give up that twentieth shilling which he was continually dropping into his
      own pocket. But Captain Hull declared himself perfectly satisfied with the
      shilling. And well he might be; for so diligently did he labor, that, in a
      few years, his pockets, his money-bags, and his strong box were
      overflowing with pine-tree shillings. This was probably the case when he
      came into possession of Grandfather’s chair; and, as he had worked so hard
      at the mint, it was certainly proper that he should have a comfortable
      chair to rest him self in.

When the mint-master had grown very rich, a young man, Samuel Sewall by
      name, came a-courting to his only daughter. His daughter—whose name
      I do not know, but we will call her Betsey—was a fine, hearty
      damsel, by no means so slender as some young ladies of our own days. On
      the contrary, having always fed heartily on pumpkin-pies, doughnuts,
      Indian puddings, and other Puritan dainties, she was as round and plump as
      a pudding herself. With this round, rosy Miss Betsey did Samuel Sewall
      fall in love. As he was a young man of good character, industrious in his
      business, and a member of the church, the mint-master very readily gave
      his consent.

“Yes, you may take her,” said he, in his rough way, “and you’ll find her a
      heavy burden enough!”

On the wedding day, we may suppose that honest John Hull dressed himself
      in a plum-colored coat, all the buttons of which were made of pine-tree
      shillings. The buttons of his waistcoat were sixpences; and the knees of
      his small-clothes were buttoned with silver threepences. Thus attired, he
      sat with great dignity in Grandfather’s chair; and, being a portly old
      gentleman, he completely filled it from elbow to elbow. On the opposite
      side of the room, between her bride-maids, sat Miss Betsey. She was
      blushing with all her might, and looked like a full-blown peony, or a
      great red apple.

There, too, was the bridegroom, dressed in a fine purple coat and
      gold-lace waistcoat, with as much other finery as the Puritan laws and
      customs would allow him to put on. His hair was cropped close to his head,
      because Governor Endicott had forbidden any man to wear it below the ears.
      But he was a very personable young man; and so thought the bridemaids and
      Miss Betsey herself.

The mint-master also was pleased with his new Son-in-law; especially as he
      had courted Miss Betsey out of pure love, and had said nothing at all
      about her portion. So, when the marriage ceremony was over, Captain Hull
      whispered a word to two of his men-servants, who immediately went out, and
      soon returned, lugging in a large pair of scales. They were such a pair as
      wholesale merchants use for weighing bulky commodities; and quite a bulky
      commodity was now to be weighed in them.

Miss Betsey—or Mrs. Sewall, as we must now call her—did as she
      was bid, like a dutiful child, without any question of the why and
      wherefore. But what her father could mean, unless to make her husband pay
      for her by the pound (in which case she would have been a dear bargain),
      she had not the least idea.

The box to which the mint-master pointed was a huge, square, iron-bound,
      oaken chest; it was big enough, my children, for all four of you to play
      at hide-and-seek in. The servants tugged with might and main, but could
      not lift this enormous receptacle, and were finally obliged to drag it
      across the floor. Captain Hull then took a key from his girdle, unlocked
      the chest, and lifted its ponderous lid. Behold! it was full to the brim
      of bright pine-tree shillings, fresh from the mint; and Samuel Sewall
      began to think that his father-in-law had got possession of all the money
      in the Massachusetts treasury. But it was only the mint-master’s honest
      share of the coinage.

Then the servants, at Captain Hull’s command, heaped double handfuls of
      shillings into one side of the scales, while Betsey remained in the other.
      Jingle, jingle, went the shillings, as handful after handful was thrown
      in, till, plump and ponderous as she was, they fairly weighed the young
      lady from the floor.

“There, son Sewall!” cried the honest mint-master, resuming his seat in
      Grandfather’s chair, “take these shillings for my daughter’s portion. Use
      her kindly, and thank Heaven for her. It is not every wife that’s worth
      her weight in silver!”

The children laughed heartily at this legend, and would hardly be
      convinced but that Grandfather had made it out of his own head. He assured
      them faithfully, however, that he had found it in the pages of a grave
      historian, and had merely tried to tell it in a somewhat funnier style. As
      for Samuel Sewall, he afterwards became chief justice of Massachusetts.

“Well, Grandfather,” remarked Clara, “if wedding portions nowadays were
      paid as Miss Betsey’s was, young ladies would not pride themselves upon an
      airy figure, as many of them do.”

WHEN his little audience next assembled round the chair, Grandfather gave
      them a doleful history of the Quaker persecution, which began in 1656, and
      raged for about three years in Massachusetts.

He told them how, in the first place, twelve of the converts of George
      Fox, the first Quaker in the world, had come over from England. They
      seemed to be impelled by an earnest love for the souls of men, and a pure
      desire to make known what they considered a revelation from Heaven. But
      the rulers looked upon them as plotting the downfall of all government and
      religion. They were banished from the colony. In a little while, however,
      not only the first twelve had returned, but a multitude of other Quakers
      had come to rebuke the rulers and to preach against the priests and
      steeple-houses.

Grandfather described the hatred and scorn with which these enthusiasts
      were received. They were thrown into dungeons; they were beaten with many
      stripes, women as well as men; they were driven forth into the wilderness,
      and left to the tender mercies of tender mercies of wild beasts and
      Indians. The children were amazed hear that the more the Quakers were
      scourged, and imprisoned, and banished, the more did the sect increase,
      both by the influx of strangers and by converts from among the Puritans,
      But Grandfather told them that God had put something into the soul of man,
      which always turned the cruelties of the persecutor to naught.

He went on to relate that, in 1659, two Quakers, named William Robinson
      and Marmaduke Stephenson, were hanged at Boston. A woman had been
      sentenced to die with them, but was reprieved on condition of her leaving
      the colony. Her name was Mary Dyer. In the year 1660 she returned to
      Boston, although she knew death awaited her there; and, if Grandfather had
      been correctly informed, an incident had then taken place which connects
      her with our story. This Mary Dyer had entered the mint-master’s dwelling,
      clothed in sackcloth and ashes, and seated herself in our great chair with
      a sort of dignity and state. Then she proceeded to deliver what she called
      a message from Heaven, but in the midst of it they dragged her to prison.

“Grandfather,” cried Charley, clinching his fist, “I would have fought for
      that poor Quaker woman!”

“Ah, but if a sword had been drawn for her,” said Laurence, “it would have
      taken away all the beauty of her death.”

It seemed as if hardly any of the preceding stories had thrown such an
      interest around Grandfather’s chair as did the fact that the poor,
      persecuted, wandering Quaker woman had rested in it for a moment. The
      children were so much excited that Grandfather found it necessary to bring
      his account of the persecution to a close.

“In 1660, the same year in which Mary Dyer was executed,” said he,
      “Charles II. was restored to the throne of his fathers. This king had many
      vices; but he would not permit blood to be shed, under pretence of
      religion, in any part of his dominions. The Quakers in England told him
      what had been done to their brethren in Massachusetts; and he sent orders
      to Governor Endicott to forbear all such proceedings in future. And so
      ended the Quaker persecution,—one of the most mournful passages in
      the history of our forefathers.”

Grandfather then told his auditors, that, shortly after the above
      incident, the great chair had been given by the mint-master to the Rev.
      Mr. John Eliot. He was the first minister of Roxbury. But besides
      attending to the pastoral duties there, he learned the language of the red
      men, and often went into the woods to preach to them. So earnestly did he
      labor for their conversion that he has always been called the apostle to
      the Indians. The mention of this holy man suggested to Grandfather the
      propriety of giving a brief sketch of the history of the Indians, so far
      as they were connected with the English colonists.

A short period before the arrival of the first Pilgrims at Plymouth there
      had been a very grievous plague among the red men; and the sages and
      ministers of that day were inclined to the opinion that Providence had
      sent this mortality in order to make room for the settlement of the
      English. But I know not why we should suppose that an Indian’s life is
      less precious, in the eye of Heaven, than that of a white man. Be that as
      it may, death had certainly been very busy with the savage tribes.

In many places the English found the wigwams deserted and the cornfields
      growing to waste, with none to harvest the grain. There were heaps of
      earth also, which, being dug open, proved to be Indian graves, containing
      bows and flint-headed spears and arrows; for the Indians buried the dead
      warrior’s weapons along with him. In some spots there were skulls and
      other human bones lying unburied. In 1633, and the year afterwards, the
      small-pox broke out among the Massachusetts Indians, multitudes of whom
      died by this terrible disease of the Old World. These misfortunes made
      them far less powerful than they had formerly been.

For nearly half a century after the arrival of the English the red men
      showed themselves generally inclined to peace and amity. They often made
      submission when they might have made successful war. The Plymouth
      settlers, led by the famous Captain Miles Standish, slew some of them, in
      1623, without any very evident necessity for so doing. In 1636, and the
      following year, there was the most dreadful war that had yet occurred
      between the Indians and the English. The Connecticut settlers, assisted by
      a celebrated Indian chief named Uncas, bore the brunt of this war, with
      but little aid from Massachusetts. Many hundreds of the hostile Indians
      were slain or burned in their wigwams. Sassacus, their sachem, fled to
      another tribe, after his own people were defeated; but he was murdered by
      them, and his head was sent to his English enemies.

From that period down to the time of King Philip’s War, which will be
      mentioned hereafter, there was not much trouble with the Indians. But the
      colonists were always on their guard, and kept their weapons ready for the
      conflict.

“I have sometimes doubted,” said Grandfather, when he had told these
      things to the Children,—“I have sometimes doubted whether there was
      more than a single man among our forefathers who realized that an Indian
      possesses a mind, and a heart, and an immortal soul. That single man was
      John Eliot. All the rest of the early settlers seemed to think that the
      Indians were an inferior race of beings, whom the Creator had merely
      allowed to keep possession of this beautiful country till the white men
      should be in want of it.”

“Did the pious men of those days never try to make Christian of them?”
       asked Laurence. “Sometimes, it is true,” answered Grandfather, “the
      magistrates and ministers would talk about civilizing and converting the
      red people. But, at the bottom of their hearts, they would have had almost
      as much expectation of civilizing the wild bear of the woods and making
      him fit for paradise. They felt no faith in the success of any such
      attempts, because they had no love for the poor Indians. Now, Eliot was
      full of love for them; and therefore so full of faith and hope that he
      spent the labor of a lifetime in their behalf.”

“Ah, Charley, there spoke the very spirit of our forefathers.” replied
      Grandfather. “But Mr. Eliot a better spirit. He looked upon them as his
      brethren. He persuaded as many of them as he could to leave off their idle
      and wandering habits, and to build houses and cultivate the earth, as the
      English did. He established schools among them and taught many of the
      Indians how to read. He taught them, likewise, how to pray. Hence they
      were called ‘praying Indians.’ Finally, having spent the best years of his
      life for their good, Mr. Eliot resolved to spend the remainder in doing
      them a yet greater benefit.”

“He sat down in his study,” continued Grandfather, “and began a
      translation of the Bible into the Indian tongue. It was while he was
      engaged in this pious work that the mint-master gave him our great chair.
      His toil needed it and deserved it.”

“O Grandfather, tell us all about that Indian Bible!” exclaimed Laurence.
      “I have seen it in the library of the Athenaeum; and the tears came into
      my eyes to think that there were no Indians left to read it.”

As Grandfather was a great admirer of the apostle Eliot, he was glad to
      comply with the earnest request which Laurence had made at the close of
      the last chapter. So he proceeded to describe how good Mr. Eliot labored,
      while he was at work upon the Indian Bible.

My dear children, what a task would you think it, even with a long
      lifetime before you, were you bidden to copy every chapter, and verse, and
      word, in yonder family Bible! Would not this be a heavy toil? But if the
      task were, not to write off the English Bible, but to learn a language
      utterly unlike all other tongues, a language which hitherto had never been
      learned, except by the Indians themselves, from their mothers’ lips,—a
      language never written, and the strange words of which seemed
      inexpressible by letters,—if the task were, first to learn this new
      variety of speech, and then to translate the Bible into it, and to do it
      so carefully that not one idea throughout the holy book should be changed,—what
      would induce you to undertake this toil? Yet this was what the apostle
      Eliot did.

It was a mighty work for a man, now growing old, to take upon himself. And
      what earthly reward could he expect from it? None; no reward on earth. But
      he believed that the red men were the descendants of those lost tribes of
      Israel of whom history has been able to tell us nothing for thousands of
      years. He hoped that God had sent the English across the ocean, Gentiles
      as they were, to enlighten this benighted portion of his once chosen race.
      And when he should be summoned hence, he trusted to meet blessed spirits
      in another world, whose bliss would have been earned by his patient toil
      in translating the word of God. This hope and trust were far dearer to him
      than anything that earth could offer.

Sometimes, while thus at work, he was visited by learned men, who desired
      to know what literary undertaking Mr. Eliot had in hand. They, like
      himself, had been bred in the studious cloisters of a university, and were
      supposed to possess all the erudition which mankind has hoarded up from
      age to age. Greek and Latin were as familiar to them as the bab-ble of
      their childhood. Hebrew was like their mother tongue. They had grown gray
      in study; their eyes were bleared with poring over print and manuscript by
      the light of the midnight lamp.

And yet, how much had they left unlearned! Mr. Eliot would put into their
      hands some of the pages which he had been writing; and behold! the
      gray-headed men stammered over the long, strange words, like a little
      child in his first attempts to read. Then would the apostle call to him an
      Indian boy, one of his scholars, and show him the manuscript which had so
      puzzled the learned Englishmen.

“Read this, my child,” would he say; “these are some brethren of mine, who
      would fain hear the sound of thy native tongue.”

Then would the Indian boy cast his eyes over the mysterious page, and read
      it so skilfully that it sounded like wild music. It seemed as if the
      forest leaves were singing in the ears of his auditors, and as the roar of
      distant streams were poured through the young Indian’s voice. Such were
      the sounds amid which the language of the red man had been formed; and
      they were still heard to echo in it.

The lesson being over, Mr. Eliot would give the Indian boy an apple or a
      cake, and bid him leap forth into the open air which his free nature
      loved. The Apostle was kind to children, and even shared in their sports
      sometimes. And when his visitors had bidden him farewell, the good man
      turned patiently to his toil again.

No other Englishman had ever understood the Indian character so well, nor
      possessed so great an influence over the New England tribes, as the
      apostle did. His advice and assistance must often have been valuable to
      his countrymen in their transactions with the Indians. Occasionally,
      perhaps, the governor and some of the councillors came to visit Mr. Eliot.
      Perchance they were seeking some method to circumvent the forest people.
      They inquired, it may be, how they could obtain possession of such and
      such a tract of their rich land. Or they talked of making the Indians
      their servants; as if God had destined them for perpetual bondage to the
      more powerful white man.

Perhaps, too, some warlike captain, dressed in his buff coat, with a
      corselet beneath it, accompanied the governor and councillors. Laying his
      hand upon his sword hilt, he would declare that the only method of dealing
      with the red men was to meet them with the sword drawn and the musket
      presented.

“Treat these sons of the forest as men and brethren,” he would say; “and
      let us endeavor to make them Christians. Their forefathers were of that
      chosen race whom God delivered from Egyptian bondage. Perchance he has
      destined us to deliver the children from the more cruel bondage of
      ignorance and idolatry. Chiefly for this end, it may be, we were directed
      across the ocean.”

When these other visitors were gone, Mr. Eliot bent himself again over the
      half-written page. He dared hardly relax a moment from his toil. He felt
      that, in the book which he was translating, there was a deep human as well
      as heavenly wisdom, which would of itself suffice to civilize and refine
      the savage tribes. Let the Bible be diffused among them, and all earthly
      good would follow. But how slight a consideration was this, when he
      reflected that the eternal welfare of a whole race of men depended upon
      his accomplishment of the task which he had set himself! What if his hands
      should be palsied? What if his mind should lose its vigor? What if death
      should come upon him ere the work were done? Then must the red man wander
      in the dark wilderness of heathenism forever.

Impelled by such thoughts as these, he sat writing in the great chair when
      the pleasant summer breeze came in through his open casement; and also
      when the fire of forest logs sent up its blaze and smoke, through the
      broad stone chimney, into the wintry air. Before the earliest bird sang in
      the morning the apostle’s lamp was kindled; and, at midnight, his weary
      head was not yet upon its pillow. And at length, leaning back in the great
      chair, he could say to himself, with a holy triumph, “The work is
      finished!”

It was finished. Here was a Bible for the Indians. Those long-lost
      descendants of the ten tribes of Israel would now learn the history of
      their forefathers. That grace which the ancient Israelites had forfeited
      was offered anew to their children.

There is no impiety in believing that, when his long life was over, the
      apostle of the Indians was welcomed to the celestial abodes by the
      prophets of ancient days and by those earliest apostles and evangelists
      who had drawn their inspiration from the immediate presence of the
      Saviour. They first had preached truth and salvation to the world. And
      Eliot, separated from them by many centuries, yet full of the same spirit,
      has borne the like message to the New World of the west. Since the first
      days of Christianity, there has been no man more worthy to be numbered in
      the brotherhood of the apostles than Eliot.

“My heart is not satisfied to think,” observed Laurence, “that Mr. Eliot’s
      labors have done no good except to a few Indians of his own time.
      Doubtless he would not have regretted his toil, if it were the means of
      saving but a single soul. But it is a grievous thing to me that he should
      have toiled so hard to translate the Bible, and now the language and the
      people are gone! The Indian Bible itself is almost the only relic of
      both.”

“Laurence,” said his Grandfather, “if ever you should doubt that man is
      capable of disinterested zeal for his brother’s good, then remember how
      the apostle Eliot toiled. And if you should feel your own self-interest
      pressing upon your heart too closely, then think of Eliot’s Indian Bible.
      It is good for the world that such a man has lived and left this emblem of
      his life.”

The tears gushed into the eyes of Laurence, and he acknowledged that Eliot
      had not toiled in vain. Little Alice put up her arms to Grandfather, and
      drew down his white head beside her own golden locks.

And, doubtless, good Mr. Eliot would gladly receive the kiss of so sweet a
      child as little Alice, and would think it a portion of his reward in
      heaven.

Grandfather now observed that Dr. Francis had written a very beautiful
      Life of Eliot, which he advised Laurence to peruse. He then spoke of King
      Philip’s War, which began in 1675, and terminated with the death of King
      Philip, in the following year. Philip was a proud, fierce Indian, whom Mr.
      Eliot had vainly endeavored to convert to the Christian faith.

“It must have been a great anguish to the apostle,” continued Grandfather,
      “to hear of mutual slaughter and outrage between his own countrymen and
      those for whom he felt the affection of a father. A few of the praying
      Indians joined the followers of King Philip. A greater number fought on
      the side of the English. In the course of the war the little community of
      red people whom Mr. Eliot had begun to civilize was scattered, and
      probably never was restored to a flourishing condition. But his zeal did
      not grow cold; and only about five years before his death he took great
      pains in preparing a new edition of the Indian Bible.”

“I do wish, Grandfather,” cried Charley, “you would tell us all about the
      battles in King Philip’s War.”

“No, Charley,” replied Grandfather, “I have no time to spare in talking
      about battles. You must be content with knowing that it was the bloodiest
      war that the Indians had ever waged against the white men; and that, at
      its close, the English set King Philip’s head upon a pole.”

“Their most noted captain was Benjamin Church, a very famous warrior,”
       said Grandfather. “But I assure you, Charley, that neither Captain Church,
      nor any of the officers and soldiers who fought in King Philip’s War, did
      anything a thousandth part so glorious as Mr. Eliot did when he translated
      the Bible for the Indians.”

The children were now accustomed to assemble round Grandfather’s chair at
      all their unoccupied moments; and often it was a striking picture to
      behold the white-headed old sire, with this flowery wreath of young people
      around him. When he talked to them, it was the past speaking to the
      present, or rather to the future,—for the children were of a
      generation which had not become actual. Their part in life, thus far, was
      only to be happy and to draw knowledge from a thousand sources. As yet, it
      was not their time to do.

Sometimes, as Grandfather gazed at their fair, unworldly countenances, a
      mist of tears bedimmed his spectacles. He almost regretted that it was
      necessary for them to know anything of the past or to provide aught for
      the future. He could have wished that they might be always the happy,
      youthful creatures who had hitherto sported around his chair, without
      inquiring whether it had a history. It grieved him to think that his
      little Alice, who was a flower bud fresh from paradise, must open her
      leaves to the rough breezes of the world, or ever open them in any clime.
      So sweet a child she was, that it seemed fit her infancy should be
      immortal.

But such repinings were merely flitting shadows across the old man’s
      heart. He had faith enough to believe, and wisdom enough to know, that the
      bloom of the flower would be even holier and happier than its bud. Even
      within himself, though Grandfather was now at that period of life when the
      veil of mortality is apt to hang heavily over the soul, still, in his
      inmost being he was conscious of something that he would not have
      exchanged for the best happiness of childhood. It was a bliss to which
      every sort of earthly experience—all that he had enjoyed, or
      suffered or seen, or heard, or acted, with the broodings of his soul upon
      the whole—had contributed somewhat. In the same manner must a bliss,
      of which now they could have no conception, grow up within these children,
      and form a part of their sustenance for immortality.

So Grandfather, with renewed cheerfulness, continued his history of the
      chair, trusting that a profounder wisdom than his own would extract, from
      these flowers and weeds of Time, a fragrance that might last beyond all
      time.

At this period of the story Grandfather threw a glance backward as far as
      the year 1660. He spoke of the ill-concealed reluctance with which the
      Puritans in America had acknowledged the sway of Charles II. on his
      restoration to his father’s throne. When death had stricken Oliver
      Cromwell, that mighty protector had no sincerer mourners than in New
      England. The new king had been more than a year upon the throne before his
      accession was proclaimed in Boston, although the neglect to perform the
      ceremony might have subjected the rulers to the charge of treason.

During the reign of Charles II., however, the American colonies had but
      little reason to complain of harsh or tyrannical treatment. But when
      Charles died, in 1685, and was succeeded by his brother James, the
      patriarchs of New England began to tremble. King James was known to be of
      an arbitrary temper. It was feared by the Puritans that he would assume
      despotic power. Our forefathers felt that they had no security either for
      their religion or their liberties.

The result proved that they had reason for their apprehensions. King James
      caused the charters of all the American colonies to be taken away. The old
      charter of Massachusetts, which the people regarded as a holy thing and as
      the foundation of all their liberties, was declared void. The colonists
      were now no longer freemen; they were entirely dependent on the king’s
      pleasure. At first, in 1685, King James appointed Joseph Dudley, a native
      of Massachusetts, to be president of New England. But soon afterwards, Sir
      Edmund Andros, an officer of the English army, arrived, with a commission
      to be governor-general of New England and New York.

The king had given such powers to Sir Edmund Andros that there was now no
      liberty, nor scarcely any law, in the colonies over which he ruled. The
      inhabitants were not allowed to choose representatives, and consequently
      had no voice whatever in the government, nor control over the measures
      that were adopted. The councillors with whom the governor consulted on
      matters of state were appointed by himself. This sort of government was no
      better than an absolute despotism.

“The people suffered much wrong while Sir Edmund Andros ruled over them,”
       continued Grandfather; “and they were apprehensive of much more. He had
      brought some soldiers with him from England, who took possession of the
      old fortress on Castle Island and of the fortification on Fort Hill.
      Sometimes it was rumored that a general massacre of the inhabitants was to
      be perpetrated by these soldiers. There were reports, too, that all the
      ministers were to be slain or imprisoned.”

“Because they were the leaders of the people, Charley,” said Grandfather.
      “A minister was a more formidable man than a general, in those days. Well,
      while these things were going on in America, King James had so misgoverned
      the people of England that they sent over to Holland for the Prince of
      Orange. He had married the king’s daughter, and was therefore considered
      to have a claim to the crown. On his arrival in England, the Prince of
      Orange was proclaimed king, by the name of William III. Poor old King
      James made his escape to France.”

Grandfather told how, at the first intelligence of the landing of the
      Prince of Orange in England, the people of Massachusetts rose in their
      strength and overthrew the government of Sir Edmund Andros. He, with
      Joseph Dudley, Edmund Randolph, and his other principal adherents, was
      thrown into prison. Old Simon Bradstreet, who had been governor when King
      James took away the charter, was called by the people to govern them
      again.

“Governor Bradstreet was a venerable old man, nearly ninety years of age,”
       said Grandfather. “He came over with the first settlers, and had been the
      intimate companion of all those excellent and famous men who laid the
      foundation of our country. They were all gone before him to the grave, and
      Bradstreet was the last of the Puritans.”

Grandfather paused a moment and smiled, as if he had something very
      interesting to tell his auditors. He then proceeded:—

“And now, Laurence,—now, Clara,—now, Charley,—now, my
      dear little Alice,—what chair do you think had been placed in the
      council chamber, for old Governor Bradstreet to take his seat in? Would
      you believe that it was this very chair in which Grandfather now sits, and
      of which he is telling you the history?”

“I am glad to hear it, with all my heart!” cried Charley, after a shout of
      delight. “I thought Grandfather had quite forgotten the chair.”

“It was a solemn and affecting sight,” said Grandfather, “when this
      venerable patriarch, with his white beard flowing down upon his breast,
      took his seat in his chair of state. Within his remembrance, and even
      since his mature age, the site where now stood the populous town had been
      a wild and forest-covered peninsula. The province, now so fertile and
      spotted with thriving villages, had been a desert wilderness. He was
      surrounded by a shouting multitude, most of whom had been born in the
      country which he had helped to found. They were of one generation, and he
      of another. As the old man looked upon them, and beheld new faces
      everywhere, he must have felt that it was now time for him to go whither
      his brethren had gone before him.”

“All of them,” replied Grandfather. “Winthrop had been dead forty years.
      Endicott died, a very old man, in 1665. Sir Henry Vane was beheaded, in
      London, at the beginning of the reign of Charles II. And Haynes, Dudley,
      Bellingham, and Leverett, who had all been governors of Massachusetts,
      were now likewise in their graves. Old Simon Bradstreet was the sole
      representative of that departed brotherhood. There was no other public man
      remaining to connect the ancient system of government and manners with the
      new system which was about to take its place. The era of the Puritans was
      now completed.”

“I am sorry for it!” observed Laurence; “for though they were so stern,
      yet it seems to me that there was something warm and real about them. I
      think, Grandfather, that each of these old governors should have his
      statue set up in our State House, Sculptured out of the hardest of New
      England granite.”

“It would not be amiss, Laurence,” said Grandfather; “but perhaps clay, or
      some other perishable material, might suffice for some of their
      successors. But let us go back to our chair. It was occupied by Governor
      Bradstreet from April, 1689, until May, 1692. Sir William Phips then
      arrived in Boston with a new charter from King William and a commission to
      be governor.”

“AND what became of the chair?” inquired Clara, “The outward aspect of our
      chair,” replied Grandfather, “was now somewhat the worse for its long and
      arduous services. It was considered hardly magnificent enough to be
      allowed to keep its place in the council chamber of Massachusetts. In
      fact, it was banished as an article of useless lumber. But Sir William
      Phips happened to see it, and, being much pleased with its construction,
      resolved to take the good old chair into his private mansion. Accordingly,
      with his own gubernatorial hands, he repaired one of its arms, which had
      been slightly damaged.”

“Why, Grandfather, here is the very arm!” interrupted Charley, in great
      wonderment. “And did Sir William Phips put in these screws with his own
      hands? I am sure he did it beautifully! But how came a governor to know
      how to mend a chair?”

“I will tell you a story about the early life of Sir William Phips,” said
      Grandfather. “You will then perceive that he well knew how to use his
      hands.”

Picture to yourselves, my dear children, a handsome, old-fashioned room,
      with a large, open cupboard at one end, in which is displayed a
      magnificent gold cup, with some other splendid articles of gold and silver
      plate. In another part of the room, opposite to a tall looking-glass,
      stands our beloved chair, newly polished, and adorned with a gorgeous
      cushion of crimson velvet tufted with gold.

In the chair sits a man of strong and sturdy frame, whose face has been
      roughened by northern tempests and blackened by the burning sun of the
      West Indies. He wears an immense periwig, flowing down over his shoulders.
      His coat has a wide embroidery of golden foliage; and his waistcoat,
      likewise, is all flowered over and bedizened with gold. His red, rough
      hands, which have done many a good day’s work with the hammer and adze,
      are half covered by the delicate lace ruffles at his wrists. On a table
      lies his silver-hilted sword; and in a corner of the room stands his
      gold-headed cane, made of a beautifully polished West India wood.

Somewhat such an aspect as this did Sir William Phips present when he sat
      in Grandfather’s chair after the king had appointed him governor of
      Massachusetts. Truly there was need that the old chair should be varnished
      and decorated with a crimson cushion, in order to make it suitable for
      such a magnificent-looking personage.

But Sir William Phips had not always worn a gold-embroidered coat, nor
      always sat so much at his ease as he did in Grandfather’s chair. He was a
      poor man’s son, and was born in the province of Maine, where he used to
      tend sheep upon the hills in his boyhood and youth. Until he had grown to
      be a man, he did not even know how to read and write. Tired of tending
      sheep, he next apprenticed himself to a ship-carpenter, and spent about
      four years in hewing the crooked limbs of oak-trees into knees for
      vessels.

In 1673, when he was twenty-two years old, he came to Boston, and soon
      afterwards was married to a widow lady, who had property enough to set him
      up in business. It was not long, however, before he lost all the money
      that he had acquired by his marriage, and became a poor man again. Still
      he was not discouraged. He often told his wife that, some time or other,
      he should be very rich, and would build a “fair brick house” in the Green
      Lane of Boston.

Do not suppose, children, that he had been to a fortune-teller to inquire
      his destiny. It was his own energy and spirit of enterprise, and his
      resolution to lead an industrious life, that made him look forward with so
      much confidence to better days.

Several years passed away, and William Phips had not yet gained the riches
      which he promised to himself. During this time he had begun to follow the
      sea for a living. In the year 1684 he happened to hear of a Spanish ship
      which had been cast away near the Bahama Islands, and which was supposed
      to contain a great deal of gold and silver. Phips went to the place in a
      small vessel, hoping that he should be able to recover some of the
      treasure from the wreck. He did not succeed, however, in fishing up gold
      and silver enough to pay the expenses of his voyage.

But, before he returned, he was told of another Spanish ship, or galleon,
      which had been east away near Porto de la Plata. She had now lain as much
      as fifty years beneath the waves. This old ship had been laden with
      immense wealth; and, hitherto, nobody had thought of the possibility of
      recovering any part of it from the deep sea which was rolling and tossing
      it about. But though it was now an old story, and the most aged people had
      almost forgotten that such a vessel had been wrecked, William Phips
      resolved that the sunken treasure should again be brought to light.

He went to London and obtained admittance to King James, who had not yet
      been driven from his throne. He told the king of the vast wealth that was
      lying at the bottom of the sea. King James listened with attention, and
      thought this a fine opportunity to fill his treasury with Spanish gold. He
      appointed William Phips to be captain of a vessel, called the Rose Algier,
      carrying eighteen guns and ninety-five men. So now he was Captain Phips of
      the English navy.

Captain Phips sailed from England in the Rose Algier, and cruised for
      nearly two years in the West Indies, endeavoring to find the wreck of the
      Spanish ship. But the sea is so wide and deep that it is no easy matter to
      discover the exact spot where a sunken vessel lies. The prospect of
      success seemed very small; and most people would have thought that Captain
      Phips was as far from having money enough to build a “fair brick house” as
      he was while he tended sheep.

The seamen of the Rose Algier became discouraged, and gave up all hope of
      making their fortunes by discovering the Spanish wreck. They wanted to
      compel Captain Phips to turn pirate. There was a much better prospect,
      they thought, of growing rich by plundering vessels which still sailed in
      the sea than by seeking for a ship that had lain beneath the waves full
      half a century. They broke out in open mutiny; but were finally mastered
      by Phips, and compelled to obey his orders. It would have been dangerous,
      however, to continue much longer at sea with such a crew of mutinous
      sailors; and, besides, the Rose Algier was leaky and unseaworthy. So
      Captain Phips judged it best to return to England.

Before leaving the West Indies, he met with a Spaniard, an old man, who
      remembered the wreck of the Spanish ship, and gave him directions how to
      find the very spot. It was on a reef of rocks, a few leagues from Porto de
      la Plata.

On his arrival in England, therefore, Captain Phips solicited the king to
      let him have another vessel and send him back again to the West Indies.
      But King James, who had probably expected that the Rose Algier would
      return laden with gold, refused to have anything more to do with the
      affair. Phips might never have been able to renew the search if the Duke
      of Albemarle and some other noblemen had not lent their assistance. They
      fitted out a ship, and gave the command to Captain Phips. He sailed from
      England, and arrived safely at Porto de la Plata, where he took an adze
      and assisted his men to build a large boat.

The boat was intended for the purpose of going closer to the reef of rocks
      than a large vessel could safely venture. When it was finished, the
      captain sent several men in it to examine the spot where the Spanish ship
      was said to have been wrecked. They were accompanied by some Indians, who
      were skilful divers, and could go down a great way into the depths of the
      sea.

The boat’s crew proceeded to the reef of rocks, and rowed round and round
      it a great many times. They gazed down into the water, which was so
      transparent that it seemed as if they could have seen the gold and silver
      at the bottom, had there been any of those precious metals there. Nothing,
      however, could they see, nothing more valuable than a curious sea shrub,
      which was growing beneath the water, in a crevice of the reef of rocks. It
      flaunted to and fro with the swell and reflux of the waves, and looked as
      bright and beautiful as if its leaves were gold.

“We won’t go back empty-handed,” cried an English sailor; and then he
      spoke to one of the Indian divers. “Dive down and bring me that pretty sea
      shrub there. That’s the only treasure we shall find.”

Down plunged the diver, and soon rose dripping from the water, holding the
      sea shrub in his hand. But he had learned some news at the bottom of the
      sea.

“There are some ship’s guns,” said he, the moment he had drawn breath,
      “some great cannon, among the rocks, near where the shrub was growing.”

No sooner had he spoken than the English sailors knew that they had found
      the very spot where the Spanish galleon had been wrecked, so many years
      before. The other Indian divers immediately plunged over the boat’s side
      and swam headlong down, groping among the rocks and sunken cannon. In a
      few moments one of them rose above the water with a heavy lump of silver
      in his arms. The single lump was worth more than a thousand dollars. The
      sailors took it into the boat, and then rowed back as speedily as they
      could, being in haste to inform Captain Phips of their good luck.

But, confidently as the captain had hoped to find the Spanish wreck, yet,
      now that it was really found, the news seemed too good to be true. He
      could not believe it till the sailors showed him the lump of silver.

Hereupon the captain and all the crew set to work, with iron rakes and
      great hooks and lines, fishing for gold and silver at the bottom of the
      sea. Up came the treasure in abundance. Now they beheld a table of solid
      silver, once the property of an old Spanish grandee. Now they found a
      sacramental vessel, which had been destined as a gift to some Catholic
      church. Now they drew up a golden cup, fit for the King of Spain to drink
      his wine out of. Perhaps the bony hand of its former owner had been
      grasping the precious cup, and was drawn up along with it. Now their rakes
      or fishing-lines were loaded with masses of silver bullion. There were
      also precious stones among the treasure, glittering and sparkling, so that
      it is a wonder how their radiance could have been concealed.

There is something sad and terrible in the idea of snatching all this
      wealth from the devouring ocean, which had possessed it for such a length
      of years. It seems as if men had no right to make themselves rich with it.
      It ought to have been left with the skeletons of the ancient Spaniards,
      who had been drowned when the ship was wrecked, and whose bones were now
      scattered among the gold and silver.

But Captain Phips and his crew were troubled with no such thoughts as
      these. After a day or two they lighted on another part of the wreck, where
      they found a great many bags of silver dollars. But nobody could have
      guessed that these were money-bags. By remaining so long in the salt
      water, they had become covered over with a crust which had the appearance
      of stone, so that it was necessary to break them in pieces with hammers
      and axes. When this was done, a stream of silver dollars gushed out upon
      the deck of the vessel.

The whole value of the recovered treasure, plate, bullion, precious
      stones, and all, was estimated at more than two millions of dollars. It
      was dangerous even to look at such a vast amount of wealth. A sea-captain,
      who had assisted Phips in the enterprise, utterly lost his reason at the
      sight of it. He died two years afterwards, still raving about the
      treasures that lie at the bottom of the sea. It would have been better for
      this man if he had left the skeletons of the shipwrecked Spaniards in
      quiet possession of their wealth.

Captain Phips and his men continued to fish up plate, bullion, and
      dollars, as plentifully as ever, till their provisions grew short. Then,
      as they could not feed upon gold and silver any more than old King Midas
      could, they found it necessary to go in search of better sustenance. Phips
      resolved to return to England. He arrived there in 1687, and was received
      with great joy by the Duke of Albemarle and other English lords who had
      fitted out the vessel. Well they might rejoice; for they took by far the
      greater part of the treasure to themselves.

The captain’s share, however, was enough to make him comfortable for the
      rest of his days. It also enabled him to fulfil his promise to his wife,
      by building a “fair brick house” in the Green Lane of Boston. The Duke of
      Albemarle sent Mrs. Phips a magnificent gold cup, worth at least five
      thousand dollars. Before Captain Phips left London, King James made him a
      knight; so that, instead of the obscure ship-carpenter who had formerly
      dwelt among them, the inhabitants of Boston welcomed him on his return as
      the rich and famous Sir William Phips.

“Sir William Phips,” continued Grandfather, “was too active and
      adventurous a man to sit still in the quiet enjoyment of his good fortune.
      In the year 1690 he went on a military expedition against the French
      colonies in America, conquered the whole province of Acadia, and returned
      to Boston with a great deal of plunder.”

“Ask Laurence what he thinks,” replied Grandfather, with a smile. “Well,
      in the same year, Sir William took command of an expedition against
      Que-bec, but did not succeed in capturing the city. In 1692, being then in
      London, King William III. appointed him governor of Massachusetts. And
      now, my dear children, having followed Sir William Phips through all his
      adventures and hardships till we find him comfortably seated in
      Grandfather’s chair, we will here bid him farewell. May he be as happy in
      ruling a people as he was while he tended sheep!”

Charley, whose fancy had been greatly taken by the adventurous disposition
      of Sir William Phips, was eager to know how he had acted and what happened
      to him while he held the office of governor. But Grandfather had made up
      his mind to tell no more stories for the present.

“Possibly, one of these days, I may go on with the adventures of the
      chair,” said he. “But its history becomes very obscure just at this point;
      and I must search into some old books and manuscripts before proceeding
      further. Besides, it is now a good time to pause in our narrative; because
      the new charter, which Sir William Phips brought over from England, formed
      a very important epoch in the history of the province.”

“Really, Grandfather,” observed Laurence, “this seems to be the most
      remarkable chair, in the world. Its history cannot be told without
      intertwining it with the lives of distinguished men and the great events
      that have befallen the country.”

“True, Laurence,’” replied Grandfather, smiling; “we must write a book
      with some such title as this: MEMOIRS OF MY OWN TIMES, BY GRANDFATHER’S
      CHAIR.”

“But, after all,” continued Grandfather, “any other old chair, if it
      possessed memory and a hand to write its recollections, could record
      stranger stories than any that I have told you. From generation to
      generation, a chair sits familiarly in the midst of human interests, and
      is witness to the most secret and confidential intercourse that mortal man
      can hold with his fellow. The human heart may best be read in the fireside
      chair. And as to external events, Grief and Joy keep a continual
      vicissitude around it and within it. Now we see the glad face and glowing
      form of Joy, sitting merrily in the old chair, and throwing a warm
      firelight radiance over all the household. Now, while we thought not of
      it, the dark-clad mourner, Grief, has stolen into the place of Joy, but
      not to retain it long. The imagination can hardly grasp so wide a subject
      as is embraced in the experience of a family chair.”

“It makes my breath flutter, my heart thrill, to think of it,” said
      Laurence. “Yes, a family chair must have a deeper history than a chair of
      state.”

“Oh yes!” cried Clara, expressing a woman’s feeling of the point in
      question; “the history of a country is not nearly so interesting as that
      of a single family would be.”

“But the history of a country is more easily told,” said Grandfather. “So,
      if we proceed with our narrative of the chair, I shall still confine
      myself to its connection with public events.”

Good old Grandfather now rose and quitted the room, while the children
      remained gazing at the chair. Laurence, so vivid was his conception of
      past times, would hardly have deemed it strange if its former occupants,
      one after another, had resumed the seat which they had each left vacant
      such a dim length of years ago.

First, the gentle and lovely Lady Arbella would have been seen in the old
      chair, almost sinking out of its arms for very weakness; then Roger
      Williams, in his cloak and band, earnest, energetic, and benevolent; then
      the figure of Anne Hutchinson, with the like gesture as when she presided
      at the assemblages of women; then the dark, intellectual face of Vane,
      “young in years, but in sage counsel old.” Next would have appeared the
      successive governors, Winthrop, Dudley, Bellingham, and Endicott, who sat
      in the chair while it was a chair of state. Then its ample seat would have
      been pressed by the comfortable, rotund corporation of the honest
      mint-master. Then the half-frenzied shape of Mary Dyer, the persecuted
      Quaker woman, clad in sackcloth and ashes would have rested in it for a
      moment. Then the holy, apostolic form of Eliot would have sanctified it.
      Then would have arisen, like the shade of departed Puritanism, the
      venerable dignity of the white-bearded Governor Bradstreet. Lastly, on the
      gorgeous crimson cushion of Grandfather’s chair would have shone the
      purple and golden magnificence of Sir William Phips. But all these, with
      the other historic personages, in the midst of whom the chair had so often
      stood, had passed, both in substance and shadow, from the scene of ages.
      Yet here stood the chair, with the old Lincoln coat of arms, and the oaken
      flowers and foliage, and the fierce lion’s head at the summit, the whole,
      apparently, in as perfect preservation as when it had first been placed in
      the Earl of Lincoln’s hall. And what vast changes of society and of
      nations had been wrought by sudden convulsions or by slow degrees since
      that era!

“This Chair had stood firm when the thrones of kings were overturned!”
       thought Laurence. “Its oaken frame has proved stronger than many frames of
      government!”

More the thoughtful and imaginative boy might have mused; but now a large
      yellow cat, a great favorite with all the children, leaped in at the open
      window. Perceiving that Grandfather’s chair was empty, and having often
      before experienced its comforts, puss laid herself quietly down upon the
      cushion. Laurence, Clara, Charley, and little Alice all laughed at the
      idea of such a successor to the worthies of old times.

“Pussy,” said little Alice, putting out her hand, into which the cat laid
      a velvet paw, “you look very wise. Do tell us a story about GRANDFATHER’S
      CHAIR!”

MR. ELIOT had been for some time assiduously employed in learning the
      Indian language. To accomplish this, he secured the assistance of one of
      the natives, who could speak English. Eliot, at the close of his Indian
      Grammar, mentions him as “a pregnant-witted young man, who had been a
      servant in an English house, who pretty well understood his own language,
      and had a clear pronunciation.” He took this Indian into his family, and
      by constant intercourse with him soon become sufficiently conversant with
      the vocabulary and construction of the language to translate the ten
      commandments, the Lord’s prayer, and several passages of Scripture,
      besides composing exhortations and prayers.

Mr. Eliot must have found his task anything but easy or inviting. He was
      to learn a dialect, in which he could be assisted by no affinity with the
      languages he already knew. He was to do this without the help of any
      written or printed specimens, with nothing in the shape of a grammar or
      analysis, but merely by oral communication with his Indian instructor, or
      with other natives, who, however comparatively intelligent, must from the
      nature of the case have been very imperfect teachers. He applied himself
      to the work with great patience and sagacity, carefully acting the
      differences between the Indian and the English modes of constructing
      words; and, having once got a clew to this, he pursued every noun and verb
      he could think of through all possible variations. In this way he arrived
      at analyses and rules, which he could apply for himself in a general
      manner.

Neal says that Eliot was able to speak the language intelligibly after
      conversing with the Indian servant a few months. This, in a limited sense,
      may be true; but he is said to have been engaged two years in the process
      of learning, before he went to preached to the Indians. In that time he
      acquired a somewhat ready facility in the use of that dialect, by means of
      which he was to carry the instructions of spiritual truth to the men of
      the forest, though as late as 1649 he still lamented his want of skill in
      this respect.

Notice having been given of his intention [of instructing the Indians],
      Mr. Eliot, in company with three others, whose names are not mentioned,
      having implored the divine blessing on the undertaking, made his first
      visit to the Indians on the 28th of October, 1646 at a place afterwards
      called Nonantum; a spot that has the honor of being the first on which a
      civilized and Christian settlement of Indians was effected within the
      English colonies of North America. This name was given to the high grounds
      in the north, east part of Newton, and to the bounds of that town and
      Watertown. At a short distance from the wigwams, they were met by Waban, a
      leading man among the Indians at that place, accompanied by others, and
      were welcomed with “English salutations.” Waban, who is described as “the
      chief minister of justice among them,” had before shown a better
      disposition than any other native to receive the religious instruction of
      the Christians, and had voluntarily proposed to have his eldest son
      educated by them. His son had been accordingly placed at school in Dedham,
      whence he had now come to attend the meeting.

The Indians assembled in Waban’s wigwam; and thither Mr. Eliot and his
      friends were conducted. When the company were all collected and quiet, a
      religious service was begun with prayer. This was uttered in English; the
      reason for which, as given by Mr. Eliot and his companions, was, that he
      did not then feel sufficiently acquainted with the Indian language to use
      it in that service.

The same difficulty would not occur in preaching, since for this, we may
      suppose, he had sufficiently prepared his thoughts and expressions to make
      his discourse intelligible on all important points; and if he should, in
      some parts, fail of being, understood, he could repeat or correct himself,
      till he should succeed better. Besides, he took with him an interpretor,
      who was frequently able to express his instructions more distinctly than
      he could himself. Though the prayer was unintelligible to the Indians,
      yet, as they knew what the nature of the service was, Mr. Eliot believed
      it might not be without an effect in subduing their feelings so as to
      prepare them better to listen to the preaching.

Mr. Eliot then began his sermon, or address, from Ezek. xxxvii. 9, 10. The
      word wind, in this passage, suggested to the minds of some, who afterwards
      gave an account of this meeting, a coincidence which might, in the spirit
      of the times, be construed into a special appointment of Providence. The
      name of Waban signified, in the Indian tongue, wind; so that when the
      preacher uttered the words, “say to the wind,” it was as if he had
      proclaimed, “say to Waban.” As this man afterwards exerted much influence
      in awaking the attention of his fellow savages to Christianity, it might
      seem that in this first visit of the messengers of the gospel he was
      singled out by a special call to work in the cause. It is not surprising
      that the Indians were struck with the coincidence. Mr. Eliot gave no
      countenance to a superstitious use of the circumstance, and took care to
      tell them that, when he chose his text, he had no thought of any such
      application.

The sermon was an hour and a quarter long. One cannot but suspect that Mr.
      Eliot injudiciously crowded too much into one address. It would seem to
      have been better, for the first time at least, to have given a shorter
      sermon, and to have touched upon fewer subjects. But he was doubtless
      borne on by his zeal to do much in a good cause; and, as we have reason to
      think, by the attentive, though vague, curiosity of the Indians.

Thus ended a conference three hours long, at the end of which the Indians
      affirmed that they were not weary, and requested their visitors to come
      again. They expressed a wish to build a town and live together. Mr. Eliot
      promised to intercede for them with the court. He and his companions then
      gave the men some tobacco, and the children some apples, and bade them
      farewell.

A fortnight afterwards, on the 11th of November, Mr. Eliot and his friends
      repeated their visit to the wigwam of Waban. This meeting was more
      numerous than the former. The religious service was opened, as before,
      with a prayer in English. This was followed by a few brief and plain
      questions addressed to the children, admitting short and easy answers. The
      children seemed well disposed to listen and learn. To encourage them, Mr.
      Eliot gave them occasionally an apple or a cake; and the adults were
      requested to repeat to them the instructions that had been given. He then
      preached to the assembly in their own language, telling them that he had
      come to bring them good news from God, and show them how wicked men might
      become good and happy; and, in general, discoursing on nearly the same
      topics as he had treated at his first visit.

“O GRANDFATHER, dear Grandfather,” cried little Alice, “pray tell us some
      more stories about your chair!”

How long a time had fled since the children bad felt any curiosity to hear
      the sequel of this venerable chair’s adventures! Summer was now past and
      gone, and the better part of autumn likewise. Dreary, chill November was
      howling out of doors, and vexing the atmosphere with sudden showers of
      wintry rain, or sometimes with gusts of snow, that rattled like small
      pebbles against the windows.

When the weather began to grow cool, Grandfather’s chair had been removed
      from the summer parlor into a smaller and snugger room. It now stood by
      the side of a bright, blazing wood-fire. Grandfather loved a wood-fire far
      better than a grate of glowing anthracite, or than the dull heat of an
      invisible furnace, which seems to think that it has done its duty in
      merely warming the house. But the wood-fire is a kindly, cheerful,
      sociable spirit, sympathizing with mankind, and knowing that to create
      warmth is but one of the good offices which are expected from it.
      Therefore it dances on the hearth, and laughs broadly throughout the room,
      and plays a thousand antics, and throws a joyous glow over all the faces
      that encircle it.

In the twilight of the evening the fire grew brighter and more cheerful.
      And thus, perhaps, there was something in Grandfather’s heart that cheered
      him most with its warmth and comfort in the gathering twilight of old age.
      He had been gazing at the red embers as intently as if his past life were
      all pictured there, or as if it were a prospect of the future world, when
      little Alice’s voice aroused him. “Dear Grandfather,” repeated the little
      girl, more earnestly, “do talk to us again about your chair.”

Laurence, and Clara, and Charley, and little Alice had been attracted to
      other objects for two or three months past. They had sported in the
      gladsome sunshine of the present, and so had forgotten the shadowy region
      of the past, in the midst of which stood Grandfather’s chair. But now, in
      the autumnal twilight, illuminated by the flickering blaze of the
      wood-fire, they looked at the old chair, and thought that it had never
      before worn such an interesting aspect. There it stood in the venerable
      majesty of more than two hundred years. The light from the hearth quivered
      upon the flowers and foliage that were wrought into its oaken back; and
      the lion’s head at the summit seemed almost to move its jaws and shake its
      mane.

“Does little Alice speak for all of you?” asked Grandfather. “Do you wish
      me to go on with the adventures of the chair?’

“Oh yes, yes, Grandfather!” cried Clara. “The dear old chair! How strange
      that we should have forgotten it so long!”

“Oh, pray begin, Grandfather,” said Laurence, “for I think, when we talk
      about old times, it should be in the early evening, before the candles are
      lighted. The shapes of the famous persons who once sat in the chair will
      be more apt to come back, and be seen among us, in this glimmer and
      pleasant gloom, than they would in the vulgar daylight. And, besides, we
      can make pictures of all that you tell us among the glowing embers and
      white ashes.”

Our friend Charley, too, thought the evening the best time to hear
      Grandfather’s stories, because he could not then be playing out of doors.
      So finding his young auditors unanimous in their petition, the good old
      gentleman took up the narrative of the historic chair at the point where
      he had dropped it.

“You recollect, my dear children,” said Grandfather, “that we took leave
      of the chair in 1692, while it was occupied by Sir William Phips. This
      fortunate treasure-seeker, you will remember, had come over from England,
      with King William’s commission, to be governor of Massachusetts. Within
      the limits of this province were now included the old colony of Plymouth,
      and the territories of Maine and Nova Scotia. Sir William Phips had
      likewise brought a new charter from the king, which served instead of a
      constitution, and set forth the method in which the province was to be
      governed.”

“No,” replied Grandfather. “Under the first charter, the people had been
      the source of all power. Winthrop, Endicott, Bradstreet, and the rest of
      them had been governors by the choice of the people, without any
      interference of the king. But henceforth the governor was to hold his
      station solely by the king’s appointment and during his pleasure; and the
      same was the case with the lieutenant-governor and some other high
      officers. The people, however, were still allowed to choose
      representatives; and the governor’s council was chosen by the General
      Court.”

“Would the inhabitants have elected Sir William Phips,” asked Laurence,
      “if the choice of governor had been left to them?”

“He might probably have been a successful candidate,” answered
      Grandfather; “for his adventures and military enterprises had gained him a
      sort of renown, which always goes a great way with the people. And he had
      many popular characteristics,—being a kind warm-hearted man, not
      ashamed of his low origin nor haughty in his present elevation. Soon after
      his arrival, he proved that he did not blush to recognize his former
      associates.”

“He made a grand festival at his new brick house,” said Grandfather, “and
      invited all the ship-carpenters of Boston to be his guests. At the head of
      the table, in our great chair, sat Sir William Phips himself, treating
      these hard-handed men as his brethren, cracking jokes with them, and
      talking familiarly about old times. I know not whether he wore his
      embroidered dress; but I rather choose to imagine that he had on a suit of
      rough clothes, such as he used to labor in while he was Phips the
      ship-carpenter.”

“An aristocrat need not be ashamed of the trade,” observed Laurence; “for
      the Czar Peter the Great once served an apprenticeship to it.”

“History says but little about his merits as a ship-carpenter,” answered
      Grandfather; “but, as a governor, a great deal of fault was found with
      him. Almost as soon as he assumed the government, he became engaged in a
      very frightful business, which might have perplexed a wiser and better
      cultivated head than his. This was the witchcraft delusion.”

And here Grandfather gave his auditors such details of this melancholy
      affair as he thought it fit for them to know. They shuddered to hear that
      a frenzy, which led to the death of many innocent persons, had originated
      in the wicked arts of a few children. They belonged to the Rev. Mr.
      Parris, minister of Salem. These children complained of being pinched and
      pricked with pins, and otherwise tormented by the shapes of men and women,
      who were supposed to have power to haunt them invisibly, both in darkness
      and daylight. Often in the midst of their family and friends the children
      would pretend to be seized with strange convulsions, and would cry out
      that the witches were afflicting them.

These stories spread abroad, and caused great tumult and alarm. From the
      foundation of New England, it had been the custom of the inhabitants, in
      all matters of doubt and difficulty, to look to their ministers for
      counsel. So they did now; but, unfortunately, the ministers and wise men
      were more deluded than the illiterate people. Cotton Mather, a very
      learned and eminent clergyman, believed that the whole country was full of
      witches and wizards, who had given up their hopes of heaven, and signed a
      covenant with the evil one.

Nobody could be certain that his nearest neighbor or most intimate friend
      was not guilty of this imaginary crime. The number of those who pretended
      to be afflicted by witchcraft grew daily more numerous; and they bore
      testimony against many of the best and worthiest people. A minister, named
      George Burroughs, was among the accused. In the months of August and
      September, 1692, he and nineteen other innocent men and women were put to
      death. The place of execution was a high hill, on the outskirts of Salem;
      so that many of the sufferers, as they stood beneath the gallows, could
      discern their own habitations in the town.

The martyrdom of these guiltless persons seemed only to increase the
      madness. The afflicted now grew bolder in their accusations. Many people
      of rank and wealth were either thrown into prison or compelled to flee for
      their lives. Among these were two sons of old Simon Bradstreet, the last
      of the Puritan governors. Mr. Willard, a pious minister of Boston, was
      cried out upon as a wizard in open court. Mrs. Hale, the wife of the
      minister of Beverly, was likewise accused. Philip English, a rich merchant
      of Salem, found it necessary to take flight, leaving his property and
      business in confusion. But a short time afterwards, the Salem people were
      glad to invite him back.

“The boldest thing that the accusers did,” continued Grandfather, “was to
      cry out against the governor’s own beloved wife. Yes, the lady of Sir
      William Phips was accused of being a witch and of flying through the air
      to attend witch-meetings. When the governor heard this he probably
      trembled, so that our great chair shook beneath him.”

“Dear Grandfather,” cried little Alice, clinging closer to his knee, “is
      it true that witches ever come in the night-time to frighten little
      children?”

“No, no, dear little Alice,” replied Grandfather. “Even if there were any
      witches, they would flee away from the presence of a pure-hearted child.
      But there are none; and our forefathers soon became convinced that they
      had been led into a terrible delusion. All the prisoners on account of
      witchcraft were set free. But the innocent dead could not be restored to
      life and the hill where they were executed will always remind people of
      the saddest and most humiliating passage in our history.”

Grandfather then said that the next remarkable event, while Sir William
      Phips remained in the chair, was the arrival at Boston of an English fleet
      in 1698. It brought an army which was intended for the conquest of Canada.
      But a malignant disease, more fatal than the smallpox, broke out among the
      soldiers and sailors, and destroyed the greater part of them. The
      infection spread into the town of Boston, and made much havoc there. This
      dreadful sickness caused the governor and Sir Francis Wheeler, who was
      commander of the British forces, to give up all thoughts of attacking
      Canada.

“Soon after this,” said Grandfather, “Sir William Phips quarrelled with
      the captain of an English frigate, and also with the collector of Boston.
      Being a man of violent temper, he gave each of them a sound beating with
      his cane.”

“He was a bold fellow,” observed Charley, who was himself somewhat
      addicted to a similar mode or settling disputes.

“More bold than wise,” replied Grandfather; “for complaints were carried
      to the king, and Sir William Phips was summoned to England to make the
      best answer he could. Accordingly he went to London, where, in 1695, he
      was seized with a malignant fever, of which he died. Had he lived longer,
      he would probably have gone again in search of sunken treasure. He had
      heard of a Spanish ship, which was cast away in 1502, during the lifetime
      of Columbus. Bovadilla, Roldan, and many other Spaniards were lost in her,
      together with the immense wealth of which they had robbed the South
      American kings.”

“Why, Grandfather!” exclaimed Laurence, “what magnificent ideas the
      governor had! Only think of recovering all that old treasure which had
      lain almost two centuries under the sea! Methinks Sir William Phips ought
      to have been buried in the ocean when he died, so that he might have gone
      down among the sunken ships and cargoes of treasure which he was always
      dreaming about in his lifetime.”

“He was buried in one of the crowded cemeteries of London,” said
      Grandfather. “As he left no children, his estate was inherited by his
      nephew, from whom is descended the present Marquis of Normandy. The noble
      Marquis is not aware, perhaps, that the prosperity of his family
      originated in the successful enterprise of a New England ship-carpenter.”

“At the death of Sir William Phips,” proceeded Grandfather, “our chair was
      bequeathed to Mr. Ezekiel Cheever, a famous schoolmaster in Boston. This
      old gentleman came from London in 1637, and had been teaching school ever
      since; so that there were now aged men, grandfathers like myself, to whom
      Master Cheever had taught their alphabet. He was a person of venerable
      aspect, and wore a long white beard.”

“Yes, in his school,” answered Grandfather; “and we may safely say that it
      had never before been regarded with such awful reverence,—no, not
      even when the old governors of Massachusetts sat in it. Even you, Charley,
      my boy, would have felt some respect for the chair if you had seen it
      occupied by this famous schoolmaster.”

And here grandfather endeavored to give his auditors an idea how matters
      were managed in schools above a hundred years ago. As this will probably
      be an interesting subject to our readers, we shall make a separate sketch
      of it, and call it The Old-Fashioned School.

Now, imagine yourselves, my children, in Master Ezekiel Cheever’s
      school-room. It is a large, dingy room, with a sanded floor, and is
      lighted by windows that turn on hinges and have little diamond-shaped
      panes of glass. The scholars sit on long benches, with desks before them.
      At one end of the room is a great fireplace, so very spacious that there
      is room enough for three or four boys to stand in each of the chimney
      corners. This was the good old fashion of fireplaces when there was wood
      enough in the forests to keep people warm without their digging into the
      bowels of the earth for coal.

It is a winter’s day when we take our peep into the school-room. See what
      great logs of wood have been rolled into the fireplace, and what a broad,
      bright blaze goes leaping up the chimney! And every few moments a vast
      cloud of smoke is puffed into the room, which sails slowly over the heads
      of the scholars, until it gradually settles upon the walls and ceiling.
      They are blackened with the smoke of many years already.

Next look at our old historic chair! It is placed, you perceive, in the
      most comfortable part of the room, where the generous glow of the fire is
      sufficiently felt without being too intensely hot. How stately the old
      chair looks, as if it remembered its many famous occupants, but yet were
      conscious that a greater man is sitting in it now! Do you see the
      venerable schoolmaster, severe in aspect, with a black skullcap on his
      head, like an ancient Puritan, and the snow of his white beard drifting
      down to his very girdle? What boy would dare to play; or whisper, or even
      glance aside from his book; while Master Cheever is on the lookout behind
      his spectacles? For such offenders, if any such there be, a rod of birch
      is hanging over the fireplace, and a heavy ferule lies on the master’s
      desk.

And now school is begun. What a murmur of multitudinous tongues, like the
      whispering leaves of a wind-stirred oak, as the scholars con over their
      various tasks! Buzz! buzz! buzz! Amid just such a murmur has Master
      Cheever spent above sixty years; and long habit has made it as pleasant to
      him as the hum of a beehive when the insects are busy in the sunshine.

Now a class in Latin is called to recite. Forth steps a rowel
      queer-looking little fellows, wearing square-skirted coats and
      small-clothes, with buttons at the knee. They look like so many
      grandfathers in their second-childhood. These lads are to be sent to
      Cambridge and educated for the learned professions. Old Master Cheever had
      lived so long, and seen so many generations of school-boys grow up to be
      men, that now he can almost prophesy what sort of a man each boy will be.
      One urchin shall hereafter be a doctor, and administer pills and potions,
      and stalk gravely through life, perfumed with assafoetida. Another shall
      wrangle at the bar, and fight his way to wealth and honors and, in his
      declining age, shall be a worshipful member of his Majesty’s council. A
      third-and he is the master’s favorite—shall be a worthy successor to
      the old Puritan ministers now in their graves; he shall preach with great
      unction and effect, and leave volumes of sermons, in print and manuscript,
      for the benefit of future generations.

But, as they are merely school-boys now, their business is to construe
      Virgil. Poor Virgil! whose verses, which he took so much pains to polish,
      have been misscanned, and misparsed, and misinterpreted by so many
      generations of idle school-boys. There, sit down, ye Latinists. Two or
      three of you, I fear, are doomed to feel the master’s ferule.

Next comes a class in arithmetic. These boys are to be the merchants,
      shopkeepers, and mechanics of a future period. Hitherto they have traded
      only in marbles and apples. Hereafter some will send vessels to England
      for broadcloths and all sorts of manufactured wares, and to the West
      Indies for sugar, and rum, and coffee. Others will stand behind counters,
      and measure tape, and ribbon, and cambric by the yard. Others will upheave
      the blacksmith’s hammer, or drive the plane over the carpenter’s bench, or
      take the lapstone and the awl and learn the trade of shoemaking. Many will
      follow the sea, and become bold, rough sea-captains.

This class of boys, in short, must supply the world with those active,
      skilful hands, and clear, sagacious heads, without which the affairs of
      life would be thrown into confusion by the theories of studious and
      visionary men. Wherefore, teach them their multiplication-table, good
      Master Cheever, and whip them well when they deserve it; for much of the
      country’s welfare depends on these boys.

But, alas! while, we have been thinking of other matters, Master Cheever’s
      watchful eye has caught two boys at play. Now we shall see awful times.
      The two malefactors are summoned before the master’s chair, wherein he
      sits with the terror of a judge upon his brow. Our old chair is now a
      judgment-seat. Ah, Master Cheever has taken down that terrible birch rod!
      Short is the trial,—the sentence quickly passed,—and now the
      judge prepares to execute it in person. Thwack! thwack! thwack! In these
      good old times, a schoolmaster’s blows were well laid on.

See, the birch rod has lost several of its twigs, and will hardly serve
      for another execution. Mercy on his, what a bellowing the urchins make! My
      ears are almost deafened, though the clamor comes through the far length
      of a hundred and fifty years. There, go to your seats, poor boys; and do
      not cry, sweet little Alice, for they have ceased to feel the pain a long
      time since.

And thus the forenoon passes away. Now it is twelve o’clock. The master
      looks at his great silver watch, and then, with tiresome deliberation,
      puts the ferule into his desk. The little multitude await the word of
      dismissal with almost irrepressible impatience.

The boys retire, treading softly until they have passed the threshold;
      but, fairly out of the schoolroom, lo, what a joyous shout! what a
      scampering and trampling of feet! what a sense of recovered freedom
      expressed in the merry uproar of all their voices! What care they for the
      ferule and birch rod now? Were boys created merely to study Latin and
      arithmetic? No; the better purposes of their being are to sport, to leap,
      to run, to shout, to slide upon the ice, to snowball.

Happy boys! Enjoy your playtime now, and come again to study and to feel
      the birch rod and the ferule to-morrow; not till to-morrow; for to-day is
      Thursday lecture; and, ever since the settlement of Massachusetts, there
      has been no school on Thursday afternoons. Therefore sport, boys, while
      you may, for the morrow cometh, with the birch rod and the ferule; and
      after that another morrow, with troubles of its own.

Now the master has set everything to rights, and is ready to go home to
      dinner. Yet he goes reluctantly. The old man has spent so much of his life
      in the smoky, noisy, buzzing school-room, that, when he has a holiday, he
      feels as if his place were lost and himself a stranger in the world. But
      forth he goes; and there stands our old chair, vacant and solitary, till
      good Master Cheever resumes his seat in it to-morrow morning.

“Grandfather,” said Charley, “I wonder whether the boys did not use to
      upset the old chair when the schoolmaster was out.”

“There is a tradition,” replied Grandfather, “that one of its arms was
      dislocated in some such manner. But I cannot believe that any school-boy
      would behave so naughtily.”

As it was now later than little Alice’s usual bedtime, Grandfather broke
      off his narrative, promising to talk more about Master Cheever and his
      scholars some other evening.

“Master Ezekiel Cheever,” said he, “died in 1707, after having taught
      school about seventy years. It would require a pretty good scholar in
      arithmetic to tell how many stripes he had inflicted, and how many birch
      rods he had worn out, during all that time, in his fatherly tenderness for
      his pupils. Almost all the great men of that period, and for many years
      back, had been whipped into eminence by Master Cheever. Moreover, he had
      written a Latin Accidence, which was used in schools more than half a
      century after his death; so that the good old man, even in his grave, was
      still the cause of trouble and stripes to idle schoolboys.”

Grandfather proceeded to say, that, when Master Cheever died, he
      bequeathed the chair to the most learned man that was educated at his
      school, or that had ever been born in America. This was the renowned
      Cotton Mather, minister of the Old North Church in Boston.

“Yes, Laurence,” replied Grandfather. “The Magnalia is a strange, pedantic
      history, in which true events and real personages move before the reader
      with the dreamy aspect which they wore in Cotton Mather’s singular mind.
      This huge volume, however, was written and published before our chair came
      into his possession. But, as he was the author of more books than there
      are days in the year, we may conclude that he wrote a great deal while
      sitting in this chair.”

“I am tired of these schoolmasters and learned men,” said Charley. “I wish
      some stirring man, that knew how to do something in the world, like Sir
      William Phips, would sit in the chair.”

“Such men seldom have leisure to sit quietly in a chair,” said
      Grandfather. “We must make the best of such people as we have.”

As Cotton Mather was a very distinguished man, Grandfather took some pains
      to give the children a lively conception of his character. Over the door
      of his library were painted these words, BE SHORT,—as a warning to
      visitors that they must not do the world so much harm as needlessly to
      interrupt this great man’s wonderful labors. On entering the room you
      would probably behold it crowded, and piled, and heaped with books. There
      were huge, ponderous folios, and quartos, and little duodecimos, in
      English, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Chaldaic, and all other languages that
      either originated at the confusion of Babel or have since come into use.

All these books, no doubt, were tossed about in confusion, thus forming a
      visible emblem of the manner in which their contents were crowded into
      Cotton Mather’s brain. And in the middle of the room stood table, on
      which, besides printed volumes, were strewn manuscript sermons, historical
      tracts, and political pamphlets, all written in such a queer, blind,
      crabbed, fantastical hand, that a writing-master would have gone raving
      mad at the sight of them. By this table stood Grandfather’s chair, which
      seemed to have contracted an air of deep erudition, as if its cushion were
      stuffed with Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and other hard matters.

In this chair, from one year’s end to another, sat that prodigious
      bookworm, Cotton Mather, sometimes devouring a great book, and sometimes
      scribbling one as big. In Grandfather’s younger days there used to be a
      wax figure of him in one of the Boston museums, representing a solemn,
      dark-visaged person, in a minister’s black gown, and with a black-letter
      volume before him.

“It is difficult, my children,” observed Grandfather, “to make you
      understand such a character as Cotton Mather’s, in whom there was so much
      good, and yet so many failings and frailties. Undoubtedly he was a pious
      man. Often he kept fasts; and once, for three whole days, he allowed
      himself not a morsel of food, but spent the time in prayer and religious
      meditation. Many a live-long night did he watch and pray. These fasts and
      vigils made him meagre and haggard, and probably caused him to appear as
      if he hardly belonged to the world.”

“He was the chief agent of the mischief,” answered Grandfather; “but we
      will not suppose that he acted otherwise than conscientiously. He believed
      that there were evil spirits all about the world. Doubtless he imagined
      that they were hidden in the corners and crevices of his library, and that
      they peeped out from among the leaves of many of his books, as he turned
      them over, at midnight. He supposed that these unlovely demons were
      everywhere, in the sunshine as well as in the darkness, and that they were
      hidden in men’s hearts, and stole into their most secret thoughts.”

Here Grandfather was interrupted by little Alice, who hid her face in his
      lap, and murmured a wish that he would not talk any more about Cotton
      Mather and the evil spirits. Grandfather kissed her, and told her that
      angels were the only spirits whom she had anything to do with.

A new War between France and England had broken out in 1702, and had been
      raging ever since. In the course of it, New England suffered much injury
      from the French and Indians, who often came through the woods from Canada
      and assaulted the frontier towns. Villages were sometimes burned, and the
      inhabitants slaughtered, within a day’s ride of Boston. The people of New
      England had a bitter hatred against the French, not only for the mischief
      which they did with their own hands, but because they incited the Indians
      to hostility.

The New-Englanders knew that they could never dwell in security until the
      provinces of France should be subdued and brought under the English
      government. They frequently, in time of war, undertook military
      expeditions against Acadia and Canada, and sometimes besieged the
      fortresses by which those territories were defended. But the most earnest
      wish of their hearts was to take Quebec, and so get possession of the
      whole province of Canada. Sir William Phips had once attempted it, but
      without success.

Fleets and soldiers were often sent from England to assist the colonists
      in their warlike undertakings. In 1710 Port Royal, a fortress of Acadia,
      was taken by the English. The next year, in the month of June, a fleet,
      commanded by Admiral Sir Hovenden Walker, arrived in Boston Harbor. On
      board of this fleet was the English General Hill, with seven regiments of
      soldiers, who had been fighting under the Duke of Marlborough in Flanders.
      The government of Massachusetts was called upon to find provisions for the
      army and fleet, and to raise more men to assist in taking Canada.

What with recruiting and drilling of soldiers, there was now nothing but
      warlike bustle in the streets of Boston. The drum and fife, the rattle of
      arms, and the shouts of boys were heard from morning till night. In about
      a month the fleet set sail, carrying four regiments from New England and
      New York, besides the English soldiers. The whole army amounted to at
      least seven thousand men. They steered for the mouth of the river St.
      Lawrence.

“Cotton Mather prayed most fervently for their success,” continued
      Grandfather, “both in his pulpit and when he kneeled down in the solitude
      of his library, resting his face on our old chair. But Providence ordered
      the result otherwise. In a few weeks tidings were received that eight or
      nine of the vessels had been wrecked in the St. Lawrence, and that above a
      thousand drowned soldiers had been washed ashore on the banks of that
      mighty river. After this misfortune Sir Hovenden Walker set sail for
      England; and many pious people began to think it a sin even to wish for
      the conquest of Canada.”

“Nor did they, as we shall see,” replied Grandfather. “However, no more
      attempts were made during this war, which came to a close in 1713. The
      people of New England were probably glad of some repose; for their young
      men had been made soldiers, till many of them were fit for nothing else.
      And those who remained at home had been heavily taxed to pay for the arms,
      ammunition; fortifications, and all the other endless expenses of a war.
      There was great need of the prayers of Cotton Mather and of all pious men,
      not only on account of the sufferings of the people, but because the old
      moral and religious character of New England was in danger of being
      utterly lost.”

“How glorious it would have been,” remarked Laurence, “if our forefathers
      could have kept the country unspotted with blood!”

“Yes,” said Grandfather; “but there was a stern, warlike spirit in them
      from the beginning. They seem never to have thought of questioning either
      the morality or piety of war.”

The next event which Grandfather spoke of was one that Cotton Mather, as
      well as most of the other inhabitants of New England, heartily rejoiced
      at. This was the accession of the Elector of Hanover to the throne of
      England, in 1714, on the death of Queen Anne. Hitherto the people had been
      in continual dread that the male line of the Stuarts, who were descended
      from the beheaded King Charles and the banished King James, would be
      restored to the throne.

“The importance of this event,” observed Grandfather, “was a thousand
      times greater than that of a Presidential election in our own days. If the
      people dislike their President, they may get rid of him in four years;
      whereas a dynasty of kings may wear the crown for an unlimited period.”

The German elector was proclaimed king from the balcony of the town-house
      in Boston, by the title of George I.; while the trumpets sounded and the
      people cried amen. That night the town was illuminated; and Cotton Mather
      threw aside book and pen, and left Grandfather’s chair vacant, while he
      walked hither and thither to witness the rejoicings.

“COTTON MATHER,” continued Grandfather, “was a bitter enemy to Governor
      Dudley; and nobody exulted more than he when that crafty politician was
      removed from the government, and succeeded by Colonel Shute. This took
      place in 1716. The new governor had been an officer in the renowned Duke
      of Marlborough’s army, and had fought in some of the great battles in
      Flanders.”

“I am afraid you will be disappointed, Charley,” answered Grandfather. “It
      is true that Colonel Shute had probably never led so unquiet a life while
      fighting the French as he did now, while governing this province of
      Massachusetts Bay. But his troubles consisted almost entirely of
      dissensions with the Legislature. The king had ordered him to lay claim to
      a fixed salary; but the representatives of the people insisted upon paying
      him only such sums from year to year as they saw fit.”

Grandfather here explained some of the circumstances that made the
      situation of a colonial governor so difficult and irksome. There was not
      the same feeling towards the chief magistrate now that had existed while
      he was chosen by the free suffrages of the people, it was felt that as the
      king appointed the governor, and as he held his office during the king’s
      pleasure, it would be his great object to please the king. But the people
      thought that a governor ought to have nothing in view but the best
      interests of those whom he governed.

“The governor,” remarked Grandfather, “had two masters to serve,—the
      king, who appointed him; and the people, on whom he depended for his pay.
      Few men in this position would have ingenuity enough to satisfy either
      party. Colonel Shute, though a good-natured, well-meaning man, succeeded
      so ill with the people, that, in 1722, he suddenly went away to England
      and made Complaint to King George. In the meantime Lieutenant-Governor
      Dummer directed the affairs of the province, and carried on a long and
      bloody war with the Indians.”

“It still remained in Cotton Mather’s library,” replied Grandfather; “and
      I must not omit to tell you an incident which is very much to the honor of
      this celebrated man. It is the more proper, too, that you should hear it,
      because it will show you what a terrible calamity the smallpox was to our
      forefathers. The history of the province (and, of course, the history of
      our chair) would be incomplete without particular mention of it.”

Accordingly Grandfather told the children a story, to which, for want of a
      better title, we shall give that of The Rejected Blessing.

One day, in 1721, Doctor Cotton Mather sat in his library reading a book
      that had been published by the Royal Society of London. But every few
      moments he laid the book upon the table, and leaned back in Grandfather’s
      chair with an aspect of deep care and disquietude. There were certain
      things which troubled him exceedingly, so that he could hardly fix his
      thoughts upon what he read.

It was now a gloomy time in Boston. That terrible disease; the small-pox,
      had recently made its appearance in the town. Ever since the first
      settlement of the country this awful pestilence had come at intervals, and
      swept away multitudes of the inhabitants. Whenever it commenced its
      ravages, nothing seemed to stay its progress until there were no more
      victims for it to seize upon. Oftentimes hundreds of people at once lay
      groaning with its agony; and when it departed, its deep footsteps were
      always to be traced in many graves.

The people never felt secure from this calamity. Sometimes, perhaps, it
      was brought into the country by a poor sailor, who had caught the
      infection in foreign parts, and came hither to die and to be the cause of
      many deaths. Sometimes, no doubt, it followed in the train of the pompous
      governors when they came over from England. Sometimes the disease lay
      hidden in the cargoes of ships, among silks, and brocades, and other
      costly merchandise which was imported for the rich people to wear. And
      sometimes it started up seemingly of its own accord, and nobody could tell
      whence it came. The physician, being called to attend the sick person,
      would look at him, and say, “It is the small-pox! Let the patient be
      carried to the hospital.”

And now this dreadful sickness had shown itself again in Boston. Cotton
      Mather was greatly afflicted for the sake of the whole province. He had
      children, too, who were exposed to the danger. At that very moment he
      heard the voice of his youngest son, for whom his heart was moved with
      apprehension.

“Alas! I fear for that poor child,” said Cotton Mather to himself. “What
      shall I do for my son Samuel?”

Again he attempted to drive away these thoughts by taking up the book
      which he had been reading. And now, all of a sudden, his attention became
      fixed. The book contained a printed letter that an Italian physician had
      written upon the very subject about which Cotton Mather was so anxiously
      meditating. He ran his eye eagerly over the pages; and, behold! a method
      was disclosed to him by which the small-pox might be robbed of its worst
      terrors. Such a method was known in Greece. The physicians of Turkey, too,
      those long-bearded Eastern sages, had been acquainted with it for many
      years. The negroes of Africa, ignorant as they were, had likewise
      practised it, and thus had shown themselves wiser than the white men.

“Of a truth,” ejaculated Cotton Mather, clasping his hands and looking up
      to heaven, “it was a merciful Providence that brought this book under mine
      eye. I will procure a consultation of physicians, and see whether this
      wondrous inoculation may not stay the progress of the destroyer.”

So he arose from Grandfather’s chair and went out of the library. Near the
      door he met his son Samuel, who seemed downcast and out of spirits. The
      boy had heard, probably, that some of his playmates were taken ill with
      the small-pox. But, as his father looked cheerfully at him, Samuel took
      courage, trusting that either the wisdom of so learned a minister would
      find some remedy for the danger, or else that his prayers would secure
      protection from on high.

Meanwhile Cotton Mather took his staff and three-cornered hat and walked
      about the streets, calling at the houses of all the physicians in Boston.
      They were a very wise fraternity; and their huge wigs, and black dresses,
      and solemn visages made their wisdom appear even profounder than it was.
      One after another he acquainted them with the discovery which he had hit
      upon.

But the grave and sagacious personages would scarcely listen to him. The
      oldest doctor in town contented himself with remarking that no such thing
      as inoculation was mentioned by Galen or Hippocrates; and it was
      impossible that modern physicians should be wiser than those old sages. A
      second held up his hands in dumb astonishment and horror at the mad-ness
      of what Cotton Mather proposed to do. A third told him, in pretty plain
      terms, that he knew not what he was talking about. A fourth requested, in
      the name of the whole medical fraternity, that Cotton Mather would confine
      his attention to people’s souls, and leave the physicians to take care of
      their bodies. In short, there was but a single doctor among them all who
      would grant the poor minister so much as a patient hearing, This was
      Doctor Zabdiel Boylston. He looked into the matter like a man of sense,
      and finding, beyond a doubt, that inoculation had rescued many from death,
      he resolved to try the experiment in his own family.

And so he did. But when the other physicians heard of it they arose in
      great fury and began a war of words, written, printed, and spoken, against
      Cotton Mather and Doctor Boylston. To hear them talk, you would have
      supposed that these two harmless and benevolent men had plotted the ruin
      of the country.

The people, also, took the alarm. Many, who thought themselves more pious
      than their neighbors, contended that, if Providence had ordained them to
      die of the small-pox, it was sinful to aim at preventing it. The strangest
      reports were in circulation. Some said that Doctor Boylston had contrived
      a method for conveying the gout, rheumatism, sick-headache, asthma, and
      all other diseases from one person to another, and diffusing them through
      the whole community. Others flatly affirmed that the evil one had got
      possession of Cotton Mather, and was at the bottom of the whole business.

You must observe, children, that Cotton Mather’s fellow-citizens were
      generally inclined to doubt the wisdom of any measure which he might
      propose to them. They recollected how he had led them astray in the old
      witchcraft delusion; and now, if he thought and acted ever so wisely, it
      was difficult for him to get the credit of it.

The people’s wrath grew so hot at his attempt to guard them from the
      small-pox that he could not walk the streets in peace. Whenever the
      venerable form of the old minister, meagre and haggard with fasts and
      vigils, was seen approaching, hisses were heard, and shouts of derision,
      and scornful and bitter laughter. The women snatched away their children
      from his path, lest he should do them a mischief. Still, however, bending
      his head meekly, and perhaps stretching out his hands to bless those who
      reviled him, he pursued his way. But the tears came into his eyes to think
      how blindly the people rejected the means of safety that were offered
      them.

Indeed, there were melancholy sights enough in the streets of Boston to
      draw forth the tears of a compassionate man. Over the door of almost every
      dwelling a red flag was fluttering in the air. This was the signal that
      the small-pox had entered the house and attacked some member of the
      family; or perhaps the whole family, old and young, were struggling at
      once with the pestilence. Friends and relatives, when they met one another
      in the streets, would hurry onward without a grasp of the hand or scarcely
      a word of greeting, lest they should catch or communicate the contagion;
      and often a coffin was borne hastily along.

“Alas! alas!” said Cotton Mather to himself, “what shall be done for this
      poor, misguided people? Oh that Providence would open their eyes, and
      enable them to discern good from evil!”

So furious, however, were the people, that they threatened vengeance
      against any person who should dare to practise inoculation, though it were
      only in his own family. This was a hard case for Cotton Mather, who saw no
      other way to rescue his poor child Samuel from the disease. But he
      resolved to save him, even if his house should be burned over his head.

“I will not be turned aside,” said he. “My townsmen shall see that I have
      faith in this thing, when I make the experiment on my beloved son, whose
      life is dearer to me than my own. And when I have saved Samuel,
      peradventure they will be persuaded to save themselves.”

Accordingly Samuel was inoculated; and so was Mr. Walter, a son-in-law of
      Cotton Mather. Doctor Boyleston, likewise, inoculated many persons; and
      while hundreds died who had caught the contagion from the garments of the
      sick, almost all were preserved who followed the wise physician’s advice.

But the people were not yet convinced of their mistake. One night a
      destructive little instrument, called a hand-grenade, was thrown into
      Cotton Mather’s window, and rolled under Grandfather’s chair. It was
      supposed to be filled with gunpowder, the explosion of which would have
      blown the poor minister to atoms. But the best informed historians are of
      opinion that the grenade contained only brimstone and assafoetida, and was
      meant to plague Cotton Mather with a very evil perfume.

This is no strange thing in human experience. Men who attempt to do the
      world mere good than the world is able entirely to comprehend are almost
      invariably held in bad odor. But yet, if the wise and good man can wait
      awhile, either the present generation or posterity will do him justice. So
      it proved in the case which we have been speaking of. In after years, when
      inoculation was universally practised, and thousands were saved from death
      by it, the people remembered old Cotton Mather, then sleeping in his
      grave. They acknowledged that the very thing for which they had so reviled
      and persecuted him was the best and wisest thing he ever did.

“No, Clara,” replied Grandfather. “But it is right that you should know
      what a dark shadow this disease threw over the times of our forefathers.
      And now, if you wish to learn more about Cotton Mather, you must read his
      biography, written by Mr. Peabody, of Springfield. You will find it very
      entertaining and instructive; but perhaps the writer is somewhat too harsh
      in his judgment of this singular man. He estimates him fairly, indeed, and
      understands him well; but he unriddles his character rather by acuteness
      than by sympathy. Now, his life should have been written by one who,
      knowing all his faults, would nevertheless love him.”

So Grandfather made an end of Cotton Mather, telling his auditors that he
      died in 1728, at the age of sixty-five, and bequeathed the chair to Elisha
      Cooke. This gentleman was a famous advocate of the people’s rights.

The same year William Burner, a son of the celebrated Bishop Burnet,
      arrived in Boston with the commission of governor. He was the first that
      had been appointed since the departure of Colonel Shute, Governor Burnet
      took up his residence with Mr. Cooke while the Province House was
      undergoing repairs. During this period he was always complimented with a
      seat in Grandfather’s chair; and so comfortable did he find it, that, on
      removing to the Province House, he could not bear to leave it behind him.
      Mr. Cooke, therefore, requested his acceptance of it.

“I should think,” said Laurence, “that the people would have petitioned
      the king always to appoint a native-born New-Englander to govern them.”

“Undoubtedly it was a grievance,” answered Grandfather, “to see men placed
      in this station who perhaps had neither talents nor virtues to fit them
      for it, and who certainly could have no natural affection for the country.
      The king generally bestowed the governorships of the American colonies
      upon needy noblemen, or hangers-on at court, or disbanded officers. The
      people knew that such persons would be very likely to make the good of the
      country subservient to the wishes of the king. The Legislature, therefore,
      endeavored to keep as much power as possible in their own hands, by
      refusing to settle a fixed salary upon the governors. It was thought
      better to pay them according to their deserts.”

Grandfather could not help smiling at the simplicity of Charley’s
      question. Nevertheless, it put the matter in a very plain point of view.

He then described the character of Governor Bur-net, representing him as a
      good scholar, possessed of much ability, and likewise of unspotted
      integrity. His story affords a striking example how unfortunate it is for
      a man, who is placed as ruler over a country to be compelled to aim at
      anything but the good of the people. Governor Burnet was so chained down
      by his instructions from the king that he could not act as he might
      otherwise have wished. Consequently, his whole term of office was wasted
      in quarrels with the Legislature.

“I am afraid, children,” said Grandfather, “that Governor Burner found but
      little rest or comfort in our old chair. Here he used to sit, dressed in a
      coat which was made of rough, shaggy cloth outside, but of smooth velvet
      within. It was said that his own character resembled that coat; for his
      outward manner was rough, but his inward disposition soft and kind. It is
      a pity that such a man could not have been kept free from trouble. But so
      harassing were his disputes with the representatives of the people that he
      fell into a fever, of which he died in 1729. The Legislature had refused
      him a salary while alive; but they appropriated money enough to give him a
      splendid and pompous funeral.”

And now Grandfather perceived that little Alice had fallen fast asleep,
      with her head upon his footstool. Indeed, as Clara observed, she had been
      sleeping from the time of Sir Hovenden Walker’s expedition against Quebec
      until the death of Governor Burnet,—a period of about eighteen
      years. And yet, after so long a nap, sweet little Alice was a
      golden-haired child of scarcely five years old.

“It puts me in mind,” said Laurence, “of the story of the enchanted
      princess, who slept many a hundred years, and awoke as young and beautiful
      as ever.”

A FEW evenings afterwards, cousin Clara happened inquire of Grandfather
      whether the old chair had never been present at a ball. At the same time
      little Alice brought forward a doll, with whom she had been holding a long
      conversation.

These questions led Grandfather to talk about the fashions and manners
      which now began to be introduced from England into the provinces. The
      simplicity of the good old Puritan times was fast disappearing. This was
      partly owing to the increasing number and wealth of the inhabitants, and
      to the additions which they continually received by the arrival and
      settlement of people from beyond the sea.

Another cause of a pompous and artificial mode of life, among those who
      could afford it, was that the example was set by the royal governors.
      Under the old charter, the governors were the representatives of the
      people, and therefore their way of living had probably been marked by a
      popular simplicity. But now, as they represented the person of the king,
      they thought it necessary to preserve the dignity of their station by the
      practice of high and gorgeous ceremonials. And, besides, the profitable
      offices under the government were filled by men who had lived in London,
      and had there contracted fashionable and luxurious habits of living which
      they would not now lay aside. The wealthy people of the province imitated
      them; and thus began a general change in social life.

“So, my dear Clara,” said Grandfather, “after our chair had entered the
      Province House, it must often have been present at balls and festivals;
      though I cannot give you a description of any particular one. But I doubt
      not that they were very magnificent; and slaves in gorgeous liveries
      waited on the guests, and offered them wine in goblets of massive silver.”

“Yes, black slaves and white,” replied Grandfather. “Our ancestors not
      only brought negroes from Africa, but Indians from South America, and
      white people from Ireland. These last were sold, not for life, but for a
      certain number of years, in order to pay the expenses of their voyage
      across the Atlantic. Nothing was more common than to see a lot of likely
      Irish girls advertised for sale in the newspapers. As for the little negro
      babies, they were offered to be giver away like young kittens.”

“Perhaps Alice would have liked one to play with, instead of her doll,”
       said Charley, laughing.

“Now, as for this pretty doll, my little Alice,” said Grandfather, “I wish
      you could have seen what splendid dresses the ladies wore in those times.
      They had silks, and satins, and damasks, and brocades, and high
      head-dresses, and all sorts of fine things. And they used to wear hooped
      petticoats of such enormous size that it was quite a journey to walk round
      them.”

“With full as much magnificence as the ladies,” answered Grandfather. “For
      their holiday suits they had coats of figured velvet, crimson, green,
      blue, and all other gay colors, embroidered with gold or silver lace.
      Their waistcoats, which were five times as large as modern ones, were very
      splendid. Sometimes the whole waistcoat, which came down almost to the
      knees, was made of gold brocade.”

“And then,” continued Grandfather, “they wore various sorts of periwigs,
      such as the tie, the Spencer, the brigadier, the major, the Albemarle, the
      Ramillies, the feather-top, and the full-bottom. Their three-cornered hats
      were laced with gold or silver. They had shining buckles at the knees of
      their small-clothes, and buckles likewise in their shoes. They wore swords
      with beautiful hilts, either of silver, or sometimes of polished steel,
      inlaid with gold.”

“And an embroidered crimson velvet coat,” said Clara, laughing, “and a
      gold brocade waistcoat down to your knees.”

“And a periwig,” added little Alice, soberly, not knowing what was the
      article of dress which she recommended to our friend Charley.

Grandfather smiled at the idea of Charley’s sturdy little figure in such a
      grotesque caparison. He then went on with the history of the chair, and
      told the children that, in 1730, King George II. appointed Jonathan
      Belcher to be governor of Massachusetts in place of the deceased Governor
      Burner. Mr. Belcher was a native of the province, but had spent much of
      his life in Europe.

The new governor found Grandfather’s chair in the Province House. He was
      struck with its noble and stately aspect, but was of opinion that age and
      hard services had made it scarcely so fit for courtly company as when it
      stood in the Earl of Lincoln’s hall. Wherefore, as Governor Belcher was
      fond of splendor, he employed a skilful artist to beautify the chair. This
      was done by polishing and varnishing it, and by gilding the carved work of
      the elbows, and likewise the oaken flowers of the back. The lion’s head
      now shone like a veritable lump of gold. Finally Governor Belcher gave the
      chair a cushion of blue damask, with a rich golden fringe.

“Our good old chair being thus glorified,” proceeded Grandfather, “it
      glittered with a great deal more splendor than it had exhibited just a
      century before, when the Lady Arbella brought it over from England. Most
      people mistook it for a chair of the latest London fashion. And this may
      serve for an example, that there is almost always an old and timeworn
      substance under all the glittering show of new invention.”

“Grandfather, I cannot see any of the gilding,” remarked Charley, who had
      been examining the chair very minutely.

“You will not wonder that it has been rubbed off,” replied Grandfather,
      “when you hear all the adventures that have since befallen the chair.
      Gilded it was; and the handsomest room in the Province House was adorned
      by it.”

There was not much to interest the children in what happened during the
      years that Governor Belcher remained in the chair. At first, like Colonel
      Shute and Governor Burner, he was engaged in disputing with the
      Legislature about his salary. But, as he found it impossible to get a
      fixed sum, he finally obtained the king’s leave to accept whatever the
      Legislature chose to give him. And thus the people triumphed, after this
      long contest for the privilege of expending their own money as they saw
      fit.

The remainder of Governor Belcher’s term of office was principally taken
      up in endeavoring to settle the currency. Honest John Hull’s pine-tree
      shillings had long ago been worn out, or lost, or melted down again; and
      their place was supplied by bills of paper or parchment, which were
      nominally valued at threepence and upwards. The value of these bills kept
      continually sinking, because the real hard money could not be obtained for
      them. They were a great deal worse than the old Indian currency of
      clam-shells. These disorders of the circulating medium were a source of
      endless plague and perplexity to the rulers and legislators, not only in
      Governor Belcher’s days, but for many years before and afterwards.

Finally the people suspected that Governor Belcher was secretly
      endeavoring to establish the Episcopal mode of worship in the provinces.
      There was enough of the old Puritan spirit remaining to cause most of the
      true sons of New England to look with horror upon such an attempt. Great
      exertions were made to induce the king to remove the governor.
      Accordingly, in 1740, he was compelled to resign his office, and
      Grandfather’s chair into the bargain, to Mr. Shirley.

“WILLIAM SHIRLEY,” said Grandfather, “had come from England a few years
      before, and begun to practise law in Boston. You will think, perhaps,
      that, as he had been a lawyer, the new governor used to sit in our great
      chair reading heavy law-books from morning till night. On the contrary, he
      was as stirring and active a governor as Massachusetts ever had. Even Sir
      William Phips hardly equalled him. The first year or two of his
      administration was spent in trying to regulate the currency. But in 1744,
      after a peace of more than thirty years, war broke out between France and
      England.”

“Not exactly, Charley,” said Grandfather; “though you have made a pretty
      shrewd conjecture. He planned, in 1745, an expedition against Louisburg.
      This was a fortified city, on the island of Cape Breton, near Nova Scotia.
      Its walls were of immense height and strength, and were defended by
      hundreds of heavy cannon. It was the strongest fortress which the French
      possessed in America; and if the king of France had guessed Governor
      Shirley’s intentions, he would have sent all the ships he could muster to
      protect it.”

As the siege of Louisburg was one of the most remarkable events that ever
      the inhabitants of New England were engaged in, Grandfather endeavored to
      give his auditors a lively idea of the spirit with which they set about
      it. We shall call his description The Provincial Muster.

The expedition against Louisburg first began to be thought of in the month
      of January. From that time the governor’s chair was continually surrounded
      by councillors, representatives, clergymen, captains, pilots, and all
      manner of people, with whom he consulted about this wonderful project.

First of all, it was necessary to provide men and arms. The Legislature
      immediately sent out a huge quantity of paper-money, with which, as if by
      magic spell, the governor hoped to get possession of all the old cannon,
      powder and balls, rusty swords and muskets, and everything else that would
      be serviceable in killing Frenchmen. Drums were beaten in all the villages
      of Massachusetts to enlist soldiers for the service. Messages were sent to
      the other governors of New England, and to New York and Pennsylvania,
      entreating them to unite in this crusade against the French. All these
      provinces agreed to give what assistance they could.

But there was one very important thing to be decided. Who shall be the
      general of this great army? Peace had continued such an unusual length of
      time that there was now less military experience among the colonists than
      at any former period. The old Puritans had always kept their weapons
      bright, and were never destitute of warlike captains who were skilful in
      assault or defence. But the swords of their descendents had grown rusty by
      disuse. There was nobody in New England that knew anything about sieges or
      any other regular fighting. The only persons at all acquainted with
      warlike business were a few elderly men, who had hunted Indians through
      the underbrush of the forest in old Governor Dummer’s War.

In this dilemma Governor Shirley fixed upon a wealthy merchant, named
      William Pepperell, who was pretty well known and liked among the people.
      As to military skill, he had no more of it than his neighbors. But, as the
      governor urged him very pressingly, Mr. Pepperell consented to shut up his
      ledger, gird on a sword, and assume the title of general.

Meantime, what a hubbub was raised by this scheme! Rub-a-dub-dub!
      rub-a-dub-dub! The rattle of drums, beaten out of all manner of time, was
      heard above every other sound.

Nothing now was so valuable as arms, of whatever style and fashion they
      might be. The bellows blew, and the hammer clanged continually upon the
      anvil, while the blacksmiths were repairing the broken weapons of other
      wars. Doubtless some of the soldiers lugged out those enormous, heavy
      muskets which used to be fired, with rests, in the time of the early
      Puritans. Great horse-pistols, too, were found, which would go off with a
      bang like a cannon. Old cannon, with touchholes almost as big as their
      muzzles, were looked upon as inestimable treasures. Pikes which, perhaps,
      had been handled by Miles Standish’s soldiers, now made their appearance
      again. Many a young man ransacked the garret and brought forth his
      great-grandfather’s sword, corroded with rust and stained with the blood
      of King Philip’s War.

Never had there been such an arming as this, when a people, so long
      peaceful, rose to the war with the best weapons that they could lay their
      hands upon. And still the drums were heard—rub-a-dub-dub!
      rub-a-dub-dub!—in all the towns and villages; and louder and more
      numerous grew the trampling footsteps of the recruits that marched behind.

And now the army began to gather into Boston. Tan, lanky, awkward fellows
      came in squads, and companies, and regiments, swaggering along, dressed in
      their brown homespun clothes and blue yarn stockings. They stooped as if
      they still had hold of the plough-handles, and marched without any time or
      tune. Hither they came, from the cornfields, from the clearing in the
      forest, from the blacksmith’s forge, from the carpenter’s workshop, and
      from the shoemaker’s seat. They were an army of rough faces and sturdy
      frames. A trained officer of Europe would have laughed at them till his
      sides had ached. But there was a spirit in their bosoms which is more
      essential to soldiership than to wear red coats and march in stately ranks
      to the sound of regular music.

Still was heard the beat of the drum,—rub-a-dub-dub! And now a host
      of three or four thousand men had found their way to Boston. Little quiet
      was there then! Forth scampered the school-boys, shouting behind the
      drums. The whole town, the whole land, was on fire with war.

After the arrival of the troops, they were probably reviewed upon the
      Common. We may imagine Governor Shirley and General Pepperell riding
      slowly along the line, while the drummers beat strange old tunes, like
      psalm-tunes, and all the officers and soldiers put on their most warlike
      looks. It would have been a terrible sight for the Frenchmen, could they
      but have witnessed it!

At length, on the 24th of March, 1745, the army gave a parting shout, and
      set sail from Boston in ten or twelve vessels which had been hired by the
      governor. A few days afterwards an English fleet, commanded by Commodore
      Peter Warren, sailed also for Louisburg to assist the provincial army. So
      now, after all this bustle of preparation, the town and province were left
      in stillness and repose.

But stillness and repose, at such a time of anxious expectation, are hard
      to bear. The hearts of the old people and women sunk within them when they
      reflected what perils they had sent their sons, and husbands, and brothers
      to encounter. The boys loitered heavily to School, missing the
      rub-a-dub-dub and the trampling march, in the rear of which they had so
      lately run and shouted. All the ministers prayed earnestly in their
      pulpits for a blessing on the army of New England. In every family, when
      the good man lifted up his heart in domestic worship, the burden of his
      petition was for the safety of those dear ones who were fighting under the
      walls of Louisburg.

Governor Shirley all this time was probably in an ecstasy of impatience.
      He could not sit still a moment. He found no quiet, not even in
      Grandfather’s chair; but hurried to and fro, and up and down the staircase
      of the Province House. Now he mounted to the cupola and looked seaward,
      straining his eyes to discover if there were a sail upon the horizon. Now
      he hastened down the stairs, and stood beneath the portal, on the red
      free-stone steps, to receive some mud-bespattered courier, from whom he
      hoped to hear tidings of the army. A few weeks after the departure of the
      troops, Commodore Warren sent a small vessel to Boston with two French
      prisoners. One of them was Monsieur Bouladrie, who had been commander of a
      battery outside the walls of Louisburg. The other was the Marquis de la
      Maison Forte, captain of a French frigate which had been taken by
      Commodore Warren’s fleet. These prisoners assured Governor Shirley that
      the fortifications of Louisburg were far too strong ever to be stormed by
      the provincial army.

Day after day and week after week went on. The people grew almost
      heart-sick with anxiety; for the flower of the country was at peril in
      this adventurous expedition. It was now daybreak on the morning of the 3d
      of July.

But hark! what sound is this? The hurried clang of a bell! There is the
      Old North pealing suddenly out!—there the Old South strikes in!—now
      the peal comes from the church in Brattle Street!—the bells of nine
      or ten steeples are all flinging their iron voices at once upon the
      morning breeze! Is it joy, or alarm? There goes the roar of a cannon too!
      A royal salute is thundered forth. And now we hear the loud exulting shout
      of a multitude assembled in the street. Huzza! huzza! Louisburg has
      surrendered! Huzza!

“O Grandfather, how glad I should have been to live in those times!” cried
      Charley. “And what reward did the king give to General Pepperell and
      Governor Shirley?”

“He made Pepperell a baronet; so that he was now to be called Sir William
      Pepperell,” replied Grandfather. “He likewise appointed both Pepperell and
      Shirley to be colonels in the royal army. These rewards, and higher ones,
      were well deserved; for this was the greatest triumph that the English met
      with in the whole course of that war. General Pepperell became a man of
      great fame. I have seen a full-length portrait of him, representing him in
      a splendid scarlet uniform, standing before the walls of Louisburg, while
      several bombs are falling through the air.”

“But did the country gain any real good by the conquest of Louisburg?”
       asked Laurence. “Or was all the benefit reaped by Pepperell and Shirley?”

“The English Parliament,” replied Grandfather, “agreed to pay the
      colonists for all the expenses of the siege. Accordingly, in 1749, two
      hundred and fifteen chests of Spanish dollars and one hundred casks of
      copper coin were brought from England to Boston. The whole amount was
      about a million of dollars. Twenty-seven carts and trucks carried this
      money from the wharf to the provincial treasury. Was not this a pretty
      liberal reward?”

“The mothers of the young men who were killed at the siege of Louisburg
      would not have thought it so,” said Laurence.

“No; Laurence,” rejoined Grandfather; “and every warlike achievement
      involves an amount of physical and moral evil, for which all the gold in
      the Spanish mines would not be the slightest recompense. But we are to
      consider that this siege was one of the occasions on which the colonists
      tested their ability for war, and thus were prepared for the great contest
      of the Revolution. In that point of view, the valor of our forefathers was
      its own reward.”

Grandfather went on to say that the success of the expedition against
      Louisburg induced Shirley and Pepperell to form a scheme for conquering
      Canada, This plan, however, was not carried into execution.

In the year 1746 great terror was excited by the arrival of a formidable
      French fleet upon the coast It was commanded by the Duke d’Anville, and
      consisted of forty ships of war, besides vessels with soldiers on board.
      With this force the French intended to retake Louisburg, and afterwards to
      ravage the whole of New England. Many people were ready to give up the
      country for lost.

But the hostile fleet met with so many disasters and losses by storm and
      shipwreck, that the Duke d’Anville is said to have poisoned himself in
      despair. The officer next in command threw himself upon his sword and
      perished. Thus deprived of their commanders, the remainder of the ships
      returned to France. This was as great a deliverance for New England as
      that which Old England had experienced in the days of Queen Elizabeth,
      when the Spanish Armada was wrecked upon her coast.

“In 1747,” proceeded Grandfather, “Governor Shirley was driven from the
      Province House, not by a hostile fleet and army, but by a mob of the
      Boston people. They were so incensed at the conduct of the British
      Commodore Knowles, who had impressed some of their fellow-citizens, that
      several thousands of them surrounded the council chamber and threw stones
      and brickbats into the windows. The governor attempted to pacify them; but
      not succeeding, he thought it necessary to leave the town and take refuge
      within the walls of Castle William. Quiet was not restored until Commodore
      Knowles had sent back the impressed men. This affair was a flash of spirit
      that might have warned the English not to venture upon any oppressive
      measures against their colonial brethren.”

Peace being declared between France and England in 1748, the governor had
      now an opportunity to sit at his ease in Grandfather’s chair. Such repose,
      however, appears not to have suited his disposition; for in the following
      year he went to England, and thence was despatched to France on public
      business. Meanwhile, as Shirley had not resigned his office,
      Lieu-tenant-Governor Phips acted as chief magistrate in his stead.

IN the early twilight of Thanksgiving Eve came Laurence, and Clara, and
      Charley, and little Alice, hand in hand, and stood in a semicircle round
      Grandfather’s chair. They had been joyous throughout that day of
      festivity, mingling together in all kinds of play, so that the house had
      echoed with their airy mirth.

Grandfather, too, had been happy though not mirthful. He felt that this
      was to be set down as one of the good Thanksgivings of his life. In truth,
      all his former Thanksgivings had borne their part in the present one; for
      his years of infancy, and youth, and manhood, with their blessings and
      their griefs, had flitted before him while he sat silently in the great
      chair. Vanished scenes had been pictured in the air. The forms of departed
      friends had visited him. Voices to be heard no more on earth had sent an
      echo from the infinite and the eternal. These shadows, if such they were,
      seemed almost as real to him as what was actually present,—as the
      merry shouts and laughter of the children,—as their figures, dancing
      like sunshine before his eyes.

He felt that the past was not taken from him. The happiness of former days
      was a possession forever. And there was something in the mingled sorrow of
      his lifetime that became akin to happiness, after being long treasured in
      the depths of his heart. There it underwent a change, and grew more
      precious than pure gold.

And now came the children, somewhat aweary with their wild play, and
      sought the quiet enjoyment of Grandfather’s talk. The good old gentleman
      rubbed his eyes and smiled round upon them all. He was glad, as most aged
      people are, to find that he was yet of consequence, and could give
      pleasure to the world. After being so merry all day long, did these
      children desire to hear his sober talk? Oh, then, old Grandfather had yet
      a place to fill among living men,—or at least among boys and girls!

And truly our yellow friend, the cat, lay upon the hearth-rug, basking in
      the warmth of the fire, pricking up her ears, and turning her head from
      the children to Grandfather, and from Grandfather to the children as if
      she felt herself very sympathetic with them all. A loud purr, like the
      singing of a tea-kettle or the hum of a spinning-wheel, testified that she
      was as comfortable and happy as a cat could be. For puss had feasted; and
      therefore, like Grandfather and the children, had kept a good
      Thanksgiving.

“Does pussy want to hear me?” said Grandfathers smiling. “Well, we must
      please pussy, if we can.”

And so he took up the history of the chair from the epoch of the peace of
      1748. By one of the provisions of the treaty, Louisburg, which the
      New-Englanders had been at so much pains to take, was restored to the King
      of France.

The French were afraid that, unless their colonies should be better
      defended than heretofore, another war might deprive them of the whole.
      Almost as soon as peace was declared, therefore, they began to build
      strong fortifications in the interior of North America. It was strange to
      behold these warlike castles on the banks of solitary lakes and far in the
      midst of woods. The Indian, paddling his birch canoe on Lake Champlain,
      looked up at the high ramparts of Ticonderoga, stone piled on stone,
      bristling with cannon, and the white flag of France floating above. There
      were similar fortifications on Lake Ontario, and near the great Falls of
      Niagara, and at the sources of the Ohio River. And all around these forts
      and castles lay the eternal forest, and the roll of the drum died away in
      those deep solitudes.

The truth was, that the French intended to build forts all the way from
      Canada to Louisiana. They would then have had a wall of military strength
      at the back of the English settlements so as completely to hem them in.
      The King of England considered the building of these forts as a sufficient
      cause of war, which was accordingly commenced in 1754.

“Governor Shirley,” said Grandfather, “had returned to Boston in 1753.
      While in Paris he had married a second wife, a young French girl, and now
      brought her to the Province House. But when war was breaking out it was
      impossible for such a bustling man to stay quietly at home, sitting in our
      old chair, with his wife and children, round about him. He therefore
      obtained a command in the English forces.”

“He stayed at home,” said Grandfather, “and was general of the militia.
      The veteran regiments of the English army which were now sent across the
      Atlantic would have scorned to fight under the orders of an old American
      merchant. And now began what aged people call the old French War. It would
      be going too far astray from the history of our chair to tell you one half
      of the battles that were fought. I cannot even allow myself to describe
      the bloody defeat of General Braddock, near the sources of the Ohio River,
      in 1755. But I must not omit to mention that, when the English general was
      mortally wounded and his army routed, the remains of it were preserved by
      the skill and valor of George Washington.”

At the mention of this illustrious name the children started as if a
      sudden sunlight had gleamed upon the history of their country, now that
      the great deliverer had arisen above the horizon.

Among all the events of the old French War, Grandfather thought that there
      was none more interesting than the removal of the inhabitants of Acadia.
      From the first settlement of this ancient province of the French, in 1604,
      until the present time, its people could scarcely ever know what kingdom
      held dominion over them. They were a peaceful race, taking no delight in
      warfare, and caring nothing for military renown. And yet, in every war,
      their region was infested with iron-hearted soldiers, both French and
      English, who fought one another for the privilege of ill-treating these
      poor, harmless Acadians. Sometimes the treaty of peace made them subjects
      of one king, sometimes of another.

At the peace of 1748 Acadia had been ceded to England. But the French
      still claimed a large portion of it, and built forts for its defence. In
      1755 these forts were taken, and the whole of Acadia was conquered by
      three thousand men from Massachusetts, under the command of General
      Winslow. The inhabitants were accused of supplying the French with
      provisions, and of doing other things that violated their neutrality.

“These accusations were probably true,” observed Grandfather; “for the
      Acadians were descended from the French, and had the same friendly
      feelings towards them that the people of Massachusetts had for the
      English. But their punishment was severe. The English determined to tear
      these poor people from their native homes and scatter them abroad.”

The Acadians were about seven thousand in number. A considerable part of
      them were made prisoners, and transported to the English colonies. All
      their dwellings and churches were burned, their cattle were killed, and
      the whole country was laid waste, so that none of them might find shelter
      or food in their old homes after the departure of the English. One
      thousand of the prisoners were sent to Massachusetts; and Grandfather
      allowed his fancy to follow them thither, and tried to give his auditors
      an idea of their situation.

A sad day it was for the poor Acadians when the armed soldiers drove them,
      at the point of the bayonet, down to the sea-shore. Very sad were they,
      likewise, while tossing upon the ocean in the crowded transport vessels.
      But methinks it must have been sadder still when they were landed on the
      Long Wharf in Boston, and left to themselves on a foreign strand.

Then, probably, they huddled together and looked into one another’s faces
      for the comfort which was not there. Hitherto they had been confined on
      board of separate vessels, so that they could not tell whether their
      relatives and friends were prisoners along with them. But now, at least,
      they could tell that many had been left behind or transported to other
      regions.

Now a desolate wife might be heard calling for her husband. He, alas! had
      gone, she knew not whither; or perhaps had fled into the woods of Acadia,
      and had now returned to weep over the ashes of their dwelling.

An aged widow was crying out in a querulous, lamentable tone for her son,
      whose affectionate toil had supported her for many a. year. He was not in
      the crowd of exiles; and what could this aged widow do but sink down and
      die? Young men and maidens, whose hearts had been torn asunder by
      separation, had hoped, during the voyage, to meet their beloved ones at
      its close. Now they began to feel that they were separated forever. And
      perhaps a lonesome little girl, a golden-haired child of five years old,
      the very picture of our little Alice, was weeping and wailing for her
      mother, and found not a soul to give her a kind word.

Oh, how many broken bonds of affection were here! Country lost,—friends
      lost,—their rural wealth of cottage, field, and herds all lost
      together! Every tie between these poor exiles and the world seemed to be
      cut off at once. They must have regretted that they had not died before
      their exile; for even the English would not have been so pitiless as to
      deny them graves in their native soil. The dead were happy; for they were
      not exiles!

While they thus stood upon the wharf, the curiosity and inquisitiveness of
      the New England people would naturally lead them into the midst of the
      poor Acadians. Prying busybodies thrust their heads into the circle
      wherever two or three of the exiles were conversing together. How puzzled
      did they look at the outlandish sound of the French tongue! There were
      seen the New England women, too. They had just come out of their warm,
      safe homes, where everything was regular and comfortable, and where their
      husbands and children would be with them at nightfall. Surely they could
      pity the wretched wives and mothers of Acadia! Or aid the sign of the
      cross which the Acadians continually made upon their breasts, and which
      was abhorred by the descendants of the Puritans,—did that sign
      exclude all pity?

Among the spectators, too, was the noisy brood of Boston school-boys, who
      came running, with laughter and shouts, to gaze at this crowd of oddly
      dressed foreigners. At first they danced and capered around them, full of
      merriment and mischief. But the despair of the Acadians soon had its
      effect upon these thoughtless lads, and melted them into tearful sympathy.

At a little distance from the throng might be seen the wealthy and pompous
      merchants whose warehouses stood on Long Wharf. It was difficult to touch
      these rich men’s hearts; for they had all the comforts of the world at
      their command; and when they walked abroad their feelings were seldom
      moved, except by the roughness of the pavement irritating their gouty
      toes. Leaning upon their gold-headed canes, they watched the scene with an
      aspect of composure. But let us hype they distributed some of their
      superfluous coin among these hapless exiles to purchase food and a night’s
      lodging.

After standing a long time at the end of the wharf, gazing seaward, as if
      to catch a glimpse of their lost Acadia, the strangers began to stray into
      the town.

They went, we will suppose, in parties and groups, here a hundred, there a
      score, there ten, there three or four, who possessed some bond of unity
      among themselves. Here and there was one who, utterly desolate, stole away
      by himself, seeking no companionship.

Whither did they go? I imagine them wandering about the streets, telling
      the townspeople, in outlandish, unintelligible words, that no earthly
      affliction ever equalled what had befallen them. Man’s brotherhood with
      man was sufficient to make the New-Englanders understand this language.
      The strangers wanted food. Some of them sought hospitality at the doors of
      the stately mansions which then stood in the vicinity of Hanover Street
      and the North Square. Others were applicants at the humble wooden
      tenements, where dwelt the petty shopkeepers and mechanics. Pray Heaven
      that no family in Boston turned one of these poor exiles from their door!
      It would be a reproach upon New England,—a crime worthy of heavy
      retribution,—if the aged women and children, or even the strong men,
      were allowed to feel the pinch of hunger.

Perhaps some of the Acadians, in their aimless wanderings through the
      town, found themselves near a large brick edifice, which was fenced in
      from the street by an iron railing, wrought with fantastic figures. They
      saw a flight of red freestone steps ascending to a portal, above which was
      a balcony and balustrade. Misery and desolation give men the right of free
      passage everywhere. Let us suppose, then, that they mounted the flight of
      steps and passed into the Province House. Making their way into one of the
      apartments, they beheld a richly-clad gentleman, seated in a stately
      chair, with gilding upon the carved work of its back, and a gilded lion’s
      head at the summit. This was Governor Shirley, meditating upon matters of
      war and state, in Grandfather’s chair!

If such an incident did happen, Shirley, reflecting what a ruin of
      peaceful and humble hopes had been wrought by the cold policy of the
      statesman and the iron band of the warrior, might have drawn a deep moral
      from it. It should have taught him that the poor man’s hearth is sacred,
      and that armies and nations have no right to violate it. It should have
      made him feel that England’s triumph and increased dominion could not
      compensate to mankind nor atone to Heaven for the ashes of a single
      Acadian cottage. But it is not thus that statesmen and warriors moralize.

“Grandfather,” cried Laurence, with emotion trembling in his voice, “did
      iron-hearted War itself ever do so hard and cruel a thing as this before?”

“You have read in history, Laurence, of whole regions wantonly laid
      waste,” said Grandfather. “In the removal of the Acadians, the troops were
      guilty of no cruelty or outrage, except what was inseparable from the
      measure.”

Little Alice, whose eyes had all along been brimming full of tears, now
      burst forth a-sobbing; for Grandfather had touched her sympathies more
      than he intended.

“To think of a whole people homeless in the world!” said Clara, with
      moistened eyes. “There never was anything so sad!”

“It was their own fault!” cried Charley, energetically. “Why did not they
      fight for the country where they were born? Then, if the worst had
      happened to them, they could only have been killed and buried there. They
      would not have been exiles then.”

“Certainly their lot was as hard as death,” said Grandfather. “All that
      could be done for them in the English provinces was, to send them to the
      almshouses, or bind them out to taskmasters. And this was the fate of
      persons who had possessed a comfortable property in their native country.
      Some of them found means to embark for France; but though it was the land
      of their forefathers, it must have been a foreign land to them. Those who
      remained behind always cherished a belief that the King of France would
      never make peace with England till his poor Acadians were restored to
      their country and their homes.”

“Alas! my dear Clara,” said Grandfather, “it is improbable that the
      slightest whisper of the woes of Acadia ever reached the ears of Louis XV.
      The exiles grew old in the British provinces, and never saw Acadia again.
      Their descendants remain among us to this day. They have forgotten the
      language of their ancestors, and probably retain no tradition of their
      misfortunes. But, methinks, if I were an American poet, I would choose
      Acadia for the subject of my song.”

Since Grandfather first spoke these words, the most famous of American
      poets has drawn sweet tears from all of us by his beautiful poem
      Evangeline.

And now, having thrown a gentle gloom around the Thanksgiving fireside by
      a story that made the children feel the blessing of a secure and peaceful
      hearth, Grandfather put off the other events of the old French War till
      the next evening.

IN the twilight of the succeeding eve, when the red beams of the fire were
      dancing upon the wall, the children besought Grandfather to tell them what
      had next happened to the old chair.

“Our chair,” said Grandfather, “stood all this time in the Province House.
      But Governor Shirley had seldom an opportunity to repose within its arms.
      He was leading his troops through the forest, or sailing in a flat-boat on
      Lake Ontario, or sleeping in his tent, while the awful cataract of Niagara
      sent its roar through his dreams. At one period, in the early part of the
      war, Shirley had the chief command of all the king’s forces in America.”

“I rather imagine,” replied Grandfather, “that she remained in Boston.
      This lady, I suppose, had our chair all to herself, and used to sit in it
      during those brief intervals when a young Frenchwoman can be quiet enough
      to sit in a chair. The people of Massachusetts were never fond of Governor
      Shirley’s young French wife. They had a suspicion that she betrayed the
      military plans of the English to the generals of the French armies.”

“Probably not,” said Grandfather. “But the mere suspicion did Shirley a
      great deal of harm. Partly, perhaps, for this reason, but much more on
      account of his inefficiency as a general, he was deprived of his command
      in 1756, and recalled to England. He never afterwards made any figure in
      public life.”

As Grandfather’s chair had no locomotive properties, and did not even run
      on castors, it cannot be supposed to have marched in person to the old
      French War. But Grandfather delayed its momentous history while he touched
      briefly upon some of the bloody battles, sieges, and onslaughts, the
      tidings of which kept continually coming to the ears of the old
      inhabitants of Boston. The woods of the North were populous with fighting
      men. All the Indian tribes uplifted their tomahawks, and took part either
      with the French or English. The rattle of musketry and roar of cannon
      disturbed the ancient quiet of the forest, and actually drove the bears
      and other wild beasts to the more cultivated portion of the country in the
      vicinity of the seaports. The children felt as if they were transported
      back to those forgotten times, and that the couriers from the army, with
      the news of a battle lost or won, might even now be heard galloping
      through the streets. Grandfather told them about the battle of Lake George
      in 1755, when the gallant Colonel Williams, a Massachusetts officer, was
      slain, with many of his countrymen. But General Johnson and General Lyman,
      with their army, drove back the enemy and mortally wounded the French
      leader, who was called the Baron Dieskau. A gold watch, pilfered from the
      poor baron, is still in existence, and still marks each moment of time
      without complaining of weariness, although its hands have been in motion
      ever since the hour of battle.

In the first years of the war there were many disasters on the English
      side. Among these was the loss of Fort Oswego in 1756, and of Fort William
      Henry in the following year. But the greatest misfortune that befell the
      English during the whole war was the repulse of General Abercrombie, with
      his army, from the ramparts of Ticonderoga in 1758. He attempted to storm
      the walls; but a terrible conflict ensued, in which more than two thousand
      Englishmen and New-Englanders were killed or wounded. The slain soldiers
      now lie buried around that ancient fortress. When the plough passes over
      the soil, it turns up here and there a mouldering bone.

Up to this period, none of the English generals had shown any military
      talent. Shirley, the Earl of Loudon, and General Abercrombie had each held
      the chief command at different times; but not one of them had won a single
      important triumph for the British arms. This ill success was not owing to
      the want of means: for, in 1758, General Abercrombie had fifty thousand
      soldiers under his command. But the French general, the famous Marquis de
      Montcalm, possessed a great genius for war, and had something within him
      that taught him how battles were to be won.

At length, in 1759, Sir Jeffrey Amherst was appointed commander-in-chief
      of all the British forces in America. He was a man of ability and a
      skilful soldier. A plan was now formed for accomplishing that object which
      had so long been the darling wish of the New-Englanders, and which their
      fathers had so many times attempted. This was the conquest of Canada.

Three separate armies were to enter Canada from different quarters. One of
      the three, commanded by General Prideaux, was to embark on Lake Ontario
      and proceed to Montreal. The second, at the head of which was Sir Jeffrey
      Amherst himself, was destined to reach the river St. Lawrence by the way
      of Lake Champlain, and then go down the river to meet the third army. This
      last, led by General Wolfe, was to enter the St. Lawrence from the sea and
      ascend the river to Quebec. It is to Wolfe and his army that England owes
      one of the most splendid triumphs ever written in her history.

Grandfather described the siege of Quebec, and told how Wolfe led his
      soldiers up a rugged and lofty precipice, that rose from the shore of the
      river to the plain on which the city stood. This bold adventure was
      achieved in the darkness of night. At daybreak tidings were carried to the
      Marquis de Montcalm that the English army was waiting to give him battle
      on the Plains of Abraham. This brave French general ordered his drums to
      strike up, and immediately marched to encounter Wolfe.

He marched to his own death. The battle was the most fierce and terrible
      that had ever been fought in America. General Wolfe was at the head of his
      soldiers, and, while encouraging them onward, received a mortal wound. He
      reclined against a stone in the agonies of death; but it seemed as if his
      spirit could not pass away while the fight yet raged so doubtfully.
      Suddenly a shout came pealing across the battle-field. “They flee! they
      flee!” and, for a moment, Wolfe lifted his languid head. “Who flee?” he
      inquired.

“The French,” replied an officer. “Then I die satisfied!” said Wolfe, and
      expired in the arms of victory.

“If ever a warrior’s death were glorious, Wolfe’s was so,” said
      Grandfather; and his eye kindled, though he was a man of peaceful thoughts
      and gentle spirit. “His life-blood streamed to baptize the soil which he
      had added to the dominion of Britain. His dying breath was mingled with
      his army’s shout of victory.”

“Oh, it was a good death to die!” cried Charley, with glistening eyes.
      “Was it not a good death, Laurence?”

Laurence made no reply; for his heart burned within him, as the picture of
      Wolfe, dying on the blood-stained field of victory, arose to his
      imagination; and yet he had a deep inward consciousness that, after all,
      there was a truer glory than could thus be won.

“There were other battles in Canada after Wolfe’s victory,” resumed
      Grandfather; “but we may consider the old French War as having terminated
      with this great event. The treaty of peace, however, was not signed until
      1763. The terms of the treaty were very disadvantageous to the French; for
      all Canada, and all Acadia, and the Island of Cape Breton,—in short,
      all the territories that France and England had been fighting about for
      nearly a hundred years,—were surrendered to the English.”

Grandfather mentioned two other important events. The first was the great
      fire of Boston in 1760, when the glare from nearly three hundred
      buildings, all in flames at once, shone through the windows of the
      Province House, and threw a fierce lustre upon the gilded foliage and
      lion’s head of our old chair. The second event was the proclamation, in
      the same year, of George III. as King of Great Britain. The blast of the
      trumpet sounded from the balcony of the Town House, and awoke the echoes
      far and wide, as if to challenge all mankind to dispute King George’s
      title.

Seven times, as the successive monarchs of Britain ascended the throne,
      the trumpet peal of proclamation had been heard by those who sat in our
      venerable chair. But when the next king put on his father’s crown, no
      trumpet peal proclaimed it to New England. Long before that day America
      had shaken off the royal government.

NOW THAT Grandfather had fought through the old French War, in which our
      chair made no very distinguished figure, he thought it high time to tell
      the children some of the more private history of that praiseworthy old
      piece of furniture.

“In 1757,” said Grandfather, “after Shirley had been summoned to England,
      Thomas Pownall was appointed governor of Massachusetts. He was a gay and
      fashionable English gentleman, who had spent much of his life in London,
      but had a considerable acquaintance with America. The new governor appears
      to have taken no active part in the war that was going on; although, at
      one period, he talked of marching against the enemy at the head of his
      company of cadets. But, on the whole, he probably concluded that it was
      more befitting a governor to remain quietly in our chair, reading the
      newspapers and official documents.”

“They found no fault with him,” replied Grandfather. “It was no time to
      quarrel with the governor when the utmost harmony was required in order to
      defend the country against the French. But Pownall did not remain long in
      Massachusetts. In 1759 he was sent to be governor of South Carolina. In
      thus exchanging one government for another, I suppose he felt no regret,
      except at the necessity of leaving Grandfather’s chair behind him.”

“It appears to me,” said Laurence, giving the rein to his fancy, “that the
      fate of this ancient chair was, somehow or other, mysteriously connected
      with the fortunes of old Massachusetts. If Governor Pownall had put it
      aboard the vessel in which he sailed for South Carolina, she would
      probably have lain wind-bound in Boston Harbor. It was ordained that the
      chair should not be taken away. Don’t you think so, Grandfather?”

“It was kept here for Grandfather and me to sit in together,” said little
      Alice, “and for Grandfather to tell stories about.”

“And Grandfather is very glad of such a companion and such a theme,” said
      the old gentleman, with a smile. “Well, Laurence, if our oaken chair, like
      the wooden palladium of Troy, was connected with the country’s fate, yet
      there appears to have been no supernatural obstacle to its removal from
      the Province House. In 1760 Sir Francis Bernard, who had been’ governor of
      New Jersey, was appointed to the same office in Massachusetts. He looked
      at the old chair, and thought it quite too shabby to keep company with a
      new set of mahogany chairs and an aristocratic sofa which had just arrived
      from London. He therefore ordered it to be put away in the garret.”

The children were loud in their exclamations against this irreverent
      conduct of Sir Francis Bernard. But Grandfather defended him as well as he
      could. He observed that it was then thirty years since the chair had been
      beautified by Governor Belcher. Most of the gilding was worn off by the
      frequent scourings which it had undergone beneath the hands of a black
      slave. The damask cushion, once so splendid, was now squeezed out of all
      shape, and absolutely in tatters, so many were the ponderous gentlemen who
      had deposited their weight upon it during these thirty years.

Moreover, at a council held by the Earl of Loudon with the governors of
      New England in 1757, his lordship, in a moment of passion, had kicked over
      the chair with his military boot. By this unprovoked and unjustifiable
      act, our venerable friend had suffered a fracture of one of its rungs.

“But,” said Grandfather, “our chair, after all, was not destined to spend
      the remainder of its days in the inglorious obscurity of a garret. Thomas
      Hutchinson, Lieutenant-governor of the province, was told of Sir Francis
      Bernard’s design. This gentleman was more familiar with the history of New
      England than any other man alive. He knew all the adventures and
      vicissitudes through which the old chair had passed, and could have told
      as accurately as your own Grandfather who were the personages that had
      occupied it. Often, while visiting at the Province House, he had eyed the
      chair with admiration, and felt a longing desire to become the possessor
      of it. He now waited upon Sir Francis Bernard, and easily obtained leave
      to carry it home.”

“No,” answered Grandfather. “What Mr. Hutchinson desired was, to restore
      the chair as much as possible to its original aspect, such as it had
      appeared when it was first made out of the Earl of Lincoln’s oak-tree. For
      this purpose he ordered it to be well scoured with soap and sand and
      polished with wax, and then provided it with a substantial leather
      cush-ion. When all was completed to his mind he sat down in the old chair,
      and began to write his History of Massachusetts.”

“Oh, that was a bright thought in Mr. Hutchinson,” exclaimed Laurence.
      “And no doubt the dim figures of the former possessors of the chair
      flitted around him as he wrote, and inspired him with a knowledge of all
      that they had done and suffered while on earth.”

“Why, my dear Laurence,” replied Grandfather, smiling, “if Mr. Hutchinson
      was favored with ally such extraordinary inspiration, he made but a poor
      use of it in his history; for a duller piece of composition never came
      from any man’s pen. However, he was accurate, at least, though far from
      possessing the brilliancy or philosophy of Mr. Bancroft.”

“But if Hutchinson knew the history of the chair,” rejoined Laurence, “his
      heart must have been stirred by it.”

“It must, indeed,” said Grandfather. “It would be entertaining and
      instructive, at the present day, to imagine what were Mr. Hutchinson’s
      thoughts as he looked back upon the long vista of events with which this
      chair was so remarkably connected.”

And Grandfather allowed his fancy to shape out an image of
      Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson, sitting in an evening reverie by his
      fireside, and meditating on the changes that had slowly passed around the
      chair.

A devoted Monarchist, Hutchinson would heave no sigh for the subversion of
      the original republican government, the purest that the world had seen,
      with which the colony began its existence. While reverencing the grim and
      stern old Puritans as the founders of his native land, he would not wish
      to recall them from their graves, nor to awaken again that king-resisting
      spirit which he imagined to be laid asleep with them forever. Winthrop,
      Dudley, Bellingham, Endicott, Leverett, and Bradstreet,—all these
      had had their day. Ages might come and go, but never again would the
      people’s suffrages place a republican governor in their ancient chair of
      state.

Coming down to the epoch of the second charter, Hutchinson thought of the
      ship-carpenter Phips springing from the lowest of the people and attaining
      to the loftiest station in the land. But he smiled to perceive that this
      governor’s example would awaken no turbulent ambition in the lower orders;
      for it was a king’s gracious boon alone that made the ship-carpenter a
      ruler. Hutchinson rejoiced to mark the gradual growth of an aristocratic
      class, to whom the common people, as in duty bound, were learning humbly
      to resign the honors, emoluments, and authority of state. He saw—or
      else deceived himself—that, throughout this epoch, the people’s
      disposition to self-government had been growing weaker through long
      disuse, and now existed only as a faint traditionary feeling.

The lieutenant-governor’s reverie had now come down to the period at which
      he himself was sitting in the historic chair. He endeavored to throw his
      glance forward over the coming years. There, probably, he saw visions of
      hereditary rank for himself and other aristocratic colonists. He saw the
      fertile fields of New England proportioned out among a few great
      landholders, and descending by entail from generation to generation. He
      saw the people a race of tenantry, dependent on their lords. He saw stars,
      garters, coronets, and castles.

“But,” added Grandfather, turning to Laurence, “the lieutenant-governor’s
      castles were built nowhere but among the red embers of the fire before
      which he was sitting. And, just as he had constructed a baronial residence
      for himself and his posterity, the fire rolled down upon the hearth and
      crumbled it to ashes!”

Grandfather now looked at his watch, which hung within a beautiful little
      ebony temple, supported by four Ionic columns. He then laid his hand on
      the golden locks of little Alice, whose head had sunk down upon the arm of
      our illustrious chair.

“To bed, to bed, dear child!” said he. “Grandfather has put you to sleep
      already by his stories about these FAMOUS OLD PEOPLE.”

AT a consultation, held between Colonel Winslow and Captain Murray, [of
      the New England forces, charged with the duty of exiling the Acadians,] it
      was agreed that a proclamation should be issued at the different
      settlements, requiring the attendance of the people at the respective
      posts on the same day; which proclamation should be so ambiguous in its
      nature that the object for which they were to assemble could not be
      discerned, and so peremptory in its terms as to ensure implicit obedience.
      This instrument, having been drafted and approved, was distributed
      according to the original plan. That which was addressed to the people
      inhabiting the country now comprised within the limits of King’s County,
      was as follows:—

“To the inhabitants of the District of Grand Pre, Minas, River Canard,
      &c.; as well ancient, as young men and lads:

“Whereas, his Excellency the Governor has instructed us of his late
      resolution, respecting the matter proposed to the inhabitants, and has
      ordered us to communicate the same in person, his Excellency being
      desirous that each of them should be fully satisfied of his Majesty’s
      intentions, which he has also ordered us to communicate to you, such as
      they have been given to him. We, therefore, order and strictly enjoin, by
      these presents, all of the inhabitants, as well of the above-named
      district as of all the other Districts, both old men and young men, as
      well as all the lads of ten years of age, to attend at the Church at Grand
      Pre, on Friday, the fifth instant, at three of the clock in the afternoon,
      that we may impart to them what we are ordered to communicate to them;
      declaring that no excuse will be admitted on any pretence whatever, on
      pain of forfeiting goods and chattels, in default of real estate. Given at
      Grand Pre, 2d September, 1755, and 29th year of his Majesty’s Reign.

In obedience to this summons four hundred and eighteen able-bodied men
      assembled. These being shut into the church (for that, too, had become an
      arsenal), Colonel Winslow placed himself, with his officers, in the
      centre, and addressed them thus:—

“I have received from his Excellency Governor Lawrence, the King’s
      Commission, which I have in my hand; and by his orders you are convened
      together to manifest to you, his Majesty’s final resolution to the French
      inhabitants of this his Province of Nova-Scotia; who, for almost half a
      century, have had more indulgence granted them than any of his subjects in
      any part of his dominions; what use you have made of it you yourselves
      best know. The part of duty I am now upon, though necessary, is very
      disagreeable to my natural make and temper, as I know it must be grievous
      to you, who are of the same species; but it is not my business to
      animadvert but to obey such orders as I receive, and therefore, without
      hesitation, shall deliver you his Majesty’s orders and instructions,
      namely—that your lands and tenements, cattle of all kinds and live
      stock of all sorts, are forfeited to the Crown; with all other your
      effects, saving your money and household goods, and you yourselves to be
      removed from this his Province.

“Thus it is peremptorily his Majesty’s orders that the whole French
      inhabitants of these Districts be removed; and I am, through his Majesty’s
      goodness, directed to allow you liberty to carry off your money and
      household goods, as many as you can without discommoding the vessels you
      go in. I shall do everything in my power that all those goods be secured
      to you, and that you are not molested in carrying them off; also, that
      whole families shall go in the same vessel, and make this remove, which I
      am sensible must give you a great deal of trouble, as easy as his
      Majesty’s service will admit; and hope that, in whatever part of the world
      you may fall, you may be faithful subjects, a peaceable and happy people.
      I must also inform you, that it is his Majesty’s pleasure that you remain
      in security under the inspection and direction of the troops that I have
      the honor to command.”

And he then declared them the King’s prisoners. The whole number of
      persons collected at Grand Pre finally amounted to four hundred and
      eighty-three men, and three hundred and thirty-seven women, heads of
      families; and their sons and daughters, to five hundred and twenty-seven
      of the former, and five hundred and seventy-six of the latter; making in
      the whole one thousand nine hundred and twenty-three souls. Their stock
      consisted of one thousand two hundred and sixty-nine oxen, one thousand
      five hundred and fifty-seven cows, five thousand and seven young cattle,
      four hundred and ninety-three horses, eight thousand six hundred and
      ninety sheep, and four thousand one hundred and ninety-seven hogs. As some
      of these wretched inhabitants escaped to the woods, all possible measures
      were adopted to force them back to captivity. The country was laid waste
      to prevent their subsistence. In the District of Minas alone, there were
      destroyed two hundred and fifty-five houses, two hundred and seventy-six
      barns, one hundred and fifty-five outhouses, eleven mills, and one church;
      and the friends of those who refused to surrender were threatened as the
      victims of their obstinacy.

In short, so operative were the terrors that surrounded them, that of
      twenty-four young men, who deserted from a transport, twenty-two were glad
      to return of themselves, the others being shot by sentinels; and one of
      their friends, who was supposed to have been accessory to their escape,
      was carried on shore to behold the destruction of his house and effects,
      which were burned in his presence, as a punishment for his temerity and
      perfidious aid to his comrades. The prisoners expressed the greatest
      concern at having incurred his Majesty’s displeasure, and in a petition
      addressed to Colonel Winslow intreated him to detain a part of them as
      sureties for the appearance of the rest, who were desirous of visiting
      their families, and consoling them in their distress and misfortunes. To
      comply with this request of holding a few as hostages for the surrender of
      the whole body, was deemed inconsistent with his instructions; but, as
      there could be no objection to allow a small number of them to return to
      their homes, permission was given to them to choose ten for the District
      of Minas (Horton) and ten for the District of Canard (Cornwallis) to whom
      leave of absence was given for one day, and on whose return a similar
      number were indulged in the same manner. They bore their confinement, and
      received their sentence with a fortitude and resignation altogether
      unexpected; but when the hour of embarkation arrived, in which they were
      to leave the land of their nativity forever—to part with their
      friends and relatives, without the hope of ever seeing them again, and to
      be dispersed among strangers, whose language, customs and religion were
      opposed to their own, the weakness of human nature prevailed, and they
      were overpowered with the sense of their miseries. The preparations having
      been all completed, the 10th of September was fixed upon as the day of
      departure. The prisoners were drawn up six deep, and the young men, one
      hundred and sixty-one in number, were ordered to go first on board of the
      vessels. This they instantly and peremptorily refused to do, declaring
      that they would not leave their parents; but expressed a willingness to
      comply with the order, provided they were permitted to embark with their
      families. This request was immediately rejected, and the troops were
      ordered to fix bayonets and advance towards the prisoners, a motion which
      had the effect of producing obedience on the part of the young men, who
      forthwith commenced their march. The road from the chapel to the shore,
      just one mile in length, was crowded with women and children; who, on
      their knees, greeted them as they passed with their tears and their
      blessings, while the prisoners advanced with slow and reluctant steps,
      weeping, praying, and singing hymns. This detachment was followed by the
      seniors, who passed through the same scene of sorrow and distress. In this
      manner was the whole male part of the population of the District of Minas
      put on board the five transports, stationed in the river Gaspereaux, each
      vessel being guarded by six non-commissioned officers, and eighty
      privates. As soon as the other vessels arrived, their wives and children
      followed, and the whole were transported from Nova Scotia. The haste with
      which these measures were carried into execution did not admit of those
      preparations for their comfort, which, if unmerited by their disloyalty,
      were at least due in pity to the severity of their punishment. The hurry,
      confusion, and excitement connected with the embarkation had scarcely
      subsided, when the Provincials were appalled by the work of their own
      hands The novelty and peculiarity of their situation could not but force
      itself upon the attention of even the unreflecting soldiery; stationed in
      the midst of a beautiful and fertile country, they suddenly found
      themselves without a foe to subdue, and without a population to protect.
      The volumes of smoke which the half expiring embers emitted, while they
      marked the site of the peasant’s humble cottage, bore testimony to the
      extent of the work of destruction. For several successive evenings the
      cattle assembled round the smouldering ruins, as if in anxious expectation
      of the return of their masters, while all night long the faithful
      watchdogs of the Neutrals howled over the scene of desolation, and mourned
      alike the hand that had fed, and the house that had sheltered them.

ON THE evening of New-Year’s Day Grandfather was walking to and fro across
      the carpet, listening to the rain which beat hard against the curtained
      windows. The riotous blast shook the casement as if a strong man were
      striving to force his entrance into the comfortable room. With every puff
      of the wind the fire leaped upward from the hearth, laughing and rejoicing
      at the shrieks of the wintry storm.

Meanwhile Grandfather’s chair stood in its customary place by the
      fireside. The bright blaze gleamed upon the fantastic figures of its oaken
      back, and shone through the open work, so that a complete pattern was
      thrown upon the opposite side of the room. Sometimes, for a moment or two,
      the shadow remained immovable, as if it were painted on the wall. Then all
      at once it began to quiver, and leap, and dance with a frisky motion.
      Anon, seeming to remember that these antics were unworthy of such a
      dignified and venerable chair, it suddenly stood still. But soon it began
      to dance anew.

And she ran to the wall and tried to catch hold of the flickering shadow;
      for, to children of five years old, a shadow seems almost as real as a
      substance.

If the children had been looking at Grandfather, they would have noticed
      that he paused in his walk across the room when Clara made this remark.
      The kind old gentleman was ready and willing to resume his stories of
      departed times. But he had resolved to wait till his auditors should
      request him to proceed, in order that they might find the instructive
      history of the chair a pleasure, and not a task.

“Grandfather,” said Charley, “I am tired to death of this dismal rain and
      of hearing the wind roar in the chimney. I have had no good time all day.
      It would be better to hear stories about the chair than to sit doing
      nothing and thinking of nothing.”

To say the truth, our friend Charley was very much out of humor with the
      storm, because it had kept him all day within doors, and hindered him from
      making a trial of a splendid sled, which Grandfather had given him for a
      New-Year’s gift. As all sleds, nowadays, must have a name, the one in
      question had been honored with the title of Grandfather’s chair, which was
      painted in golden letters on each of the sides. Charley greatly admired
      the construction of the new vehicle, and felt certain that it would
      outstrip any other sled that ever dashed adown the long slopes of the
      Common.

As for Laurence, he happened to be thinking, just at this moment, about
      the history of the chair. Kind old Grandfather had made him a present of a
      volume of engraved portraits, representing the features of eminent and
      famous people o f all countries. Among them Laurence found several who had
      formerly occupied our chair or been connected with its adventures. While
      Grandfather walked to and fro across the room, the imaginative boy was
      gazing at the historic chair. He endeavored to summon up the por-traits
      which he had seen in his volume, and to place them, like living figures,
      in the empty seat.

“The old chair has begun another year of its existence, to-day,” said
      Laurence. “We must make haste, or it will have a new history to be told
      before we finish the old one.”

“Yes, my children,” replied Grandfather, with a smile and a sigh, “another
      year has been added to those of the two centuries and upward which have
      passed since the Lady Arbella brought this chair over from England. It is
      three times as old as your Grandfather; but a year makes no impression on
      its oaken frame, while it bends the old man nearer and nearer to the
      earth; so let me go on with my stories while I may.”

Accordingly Grandfather came to the fireside and seated himself in the
      venerable chair. The lion’s head looked down with a grimly good-natured
      aspect as the children clustered around the old gentleman’s knees. It
      almost seemed as if a real lion were peeping over the back of the chair,
      and smiling at the group of auditors with a sort of lion-like
      complaisance. Little Alice, whose fancy often inspired her with singular
      ideas, exclaimed that the lion’s head was nodding at her, and that it
      looked as if it were going to open its wide jaws and tell a story.

But as the lion’s head appeared to be in no haste to speak, and as there
      was no record or tradition of its having spoken during the whole existence
      of the chair, Grandfather did not consider it worth while to wait.

“CHARLEY, my boy,” said Grandfather, “do you remember who was the last
      occupant of the chair?”

“It was Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson,” answered Charley. “Sir Francis
      Bernard, the new governor, had given him the chair, instead of putting it
      away in the garret of the Province House. And when we took leave of
      Hutchinson he was sitting by his fireside, and thinking of the past
      adventures of the chair and of what was to come.”

“Very well,” said Grandfather; “and you recollect that this was in 1763,
      or thereabouts, at the close of the old French War. Now, that you may
      fully comprehend the remaining adventures of the chair, I must make some
      brief remarks on the situation and character of the New England colonies
      at this period.”

So Grandfather spoke of the earnest loyalty of our fathers during the old
      French War, and after the conquest of Canada had brought that war to a
      triumphant close.

The people loved and reverenced the King of England even more than if the
      ocean had not rolled its waves between him and them; for, at the distance
      of three thousand miles, they could not discover his bad qualities and
      imperfections. Their love was increased by the dangers which they had
      encountered in order to heighten his glory and extend his dominion.
      Throughout the war the American colonists had fought side by side with the
      soldiers of Old England; and nearly thirty thousand young men had laid
      down their lives for the honor of King George. And the survivors loved him
      the better because they had done and suffered so much for his sake.

But there were some circumstances that caused America to feel more
      independent of England than at an earlier period. Canada and Acadia had
      now become British provinces; and our fathers were no longer afraid of the
      bands of French and Indians who used to assault them in old times. For a
      century and a half this had been the great terror of New England. Now the
      old French soldier was driven from the North forever. And even had it been
      otherwise, the English colonies were growing so populous and powerful that
      they might have felt fully able to protect themselves without any help
      from England.

There were thoughtful and sagacious men, who began to doubt whether a
      great country like America would always be content to remain under the
      government of an island three thousand miles away. This was the more
      doubtful, because the English Parliament had long ago made laws which were
      intended to be very beneficial to England at the expense of America. By
      these laws the colonists were forbidden to manufacture articles for their
      own use, or to carry on trade with any nation but the English.

“Now,” continued Grandfather, “if King George III. and his counsellors had
      considered these things wisely, they would have taken another course than
      they did. But when they saw how rich and populous the colonies had grown,
      their first thought was how they might make more profit out of them than
      heretofore. England was enormously in debt at the close of the old French
      War; and it was pretended that this debt had been contracted for the
      defence of the American colonies, and that, therefore, a part of it ought
      to be paid by them.”

“Why, this was nonsense!” exclaimed Charley. “Did not our fathers spend
      their lives, and their money too, to get Canada for King George?”

“True, they did,” said Grandfather; “and they told the English rulers so.
      But the king and his ministers would not listen to good advice. In 1765
      the British Parliament passed a Stamp Act.”

“The Stamp Act,” replied Grandfather, “was a law by which all deeds,
      bonds, and other papers of the same kind were ordered to be marked with
      the king’s stamp; and without this mark they were declared illegal and
      void. Now, in order to get a blank sheet of paper with the king’s stamp
      upon it, people were obliged to pay threepence more than the actual value
      of the paper. And this extra sum of threepence was a tax, and was to be
      paid into the king’s treasury.”

“It was not for threepence, nor for any amount of money, that America
      quarrelled with England,” replied Grandfather; “it was for a great
      principle. The colonists were determined not to be taxed except by their
      own representatives. They said that neither the king and Parliament, nor
      any other power on earth, had a right to take their money out of their
      pockets unless they freely gave it. And, rather than pay threepence when
      it was unjustly demanded, they resolved to sacrifice all the wealth of the
      country, and their lives along with it. They therefore made a most
      stubborn resistance to the Stamp Act.”

“That was noble!” exclaimed Laurence. “I understand how it was. If they
      had quietly paid the tax of threepence, they would have ceased to be
      freemen, and would have become tributaries of England. And so they
      contended about a great question of right and wrong, and put everything at
      stake for it.”

“You are right, Laurence,” said Grandfather, “and it was really amazing
      and terrible to see what a change came over the aspect of the people the
      moment the English Parliament had passed this oppressive act. The former
      history of our chair, my children, has given you some idea of what a
      harsh, unyielding, stern set of men the old Puritans were. For a good many
      years back, however, it had seemed as if these characteristics were
      disappearing. But no sooner did England offer wrong to the colonies than
      the descendants of the early settlers proved that they had the same kind
      of temper as their forefathers. The moment before, New England appeared
      like a humble and loyal subject of the crown; the next instant, she showed
      the grim, dark features of an old king-resisting Puritan.”

Grandfather spoke briefly of the public measures that were taken in
      opposition to the Stamp Act. As this law affected all the American
      colonies alike, it naturally led them to think of consulting together is
      order to procure its repeal. For this purpose the Legislature of
      Massachusetts proposed that delegates from every colony should meet in
      Congress. Accordingly nine colonies, both Northern and Southern, sent
      delegates to the city of New York.

“No, Charley,” answered Grandfather; “a great deal of talking was yet to
      be done before England and America could come to blows. The Congress
      stated the rights and grievances of the colonists. They sent a humble
      petition to the king, and a memorial to the Parliament, beseeching that
      the Stamp Act might be repealed. This was all that the delegates had it in
      their power to do.”

“By no means,” replied Grandfather. “It was a most important and memorable
      event, this first coming together of the American people by their
      representatives from the North and South. If England had been wise, she
      would have trembled at the first word that was spoken in such an
      assembly.”

These remonstrances and petitions, as Grandfather observed, were the work
      of grave, thoughtful, and prudent men. Meantime the young and hot-headed
      people went to work in their own way. It is probable that the petitions of
      Congress would have had little or no effect on the British statesmen if
      the violent deeds of the American people had not shown how much excited
      the people were. LIBERTY TREE was soon heard of in England.

“It was an old elm-tree,” answered Grandfather, “which stood near the
      corner of Essex Street, opposite the Boylston Market. Under the spreading
      branches of this great tree the people used to assemble whenever they
      wished to express their feelings and opinions. Thus, after a while, it
      seemed as if the liberty of the country was connected with Liberty Tree.”

“It bore strange fruit, sometimes,” said Grandfather. “One morning in
      August, 1765, two figures were found hanging on the sturdy branches of
      Liberty Tree. They were dressed in square-skirted coats and small-clothes;
      and, as their wigs hung down over their faces, they looked like real men.
      One was intended to represent the Earl of Bute, who was supposed to have
      advised the king to tax America. The other was meant for the effigy of
      Andrew Oliver, a gentleman belonging to one of the most respectable
      families in Massachusetts.”

“The king had appointed him to be distributor of the stamps,” answered
      Grandfather. “Mr. Oliver would have made a great deal of money by this
      business. But the people frightened him so much by hanging him in effigy,
      and afterwards by breaking into his house, that he promised to have
      nothing to do with the stamps. And all the king’s friends throughout
      America were compelled to make the same promise.”

“LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR HUTCHINSON,” continued Grandfather, “now began to be
      unquiet in our old chair. He had formerly been much respected and beloved
      by the people, and had often proved himself a friend to their interests.
      But the time was come when he could not be a friend to the people without
      ceasing to be a friend to the king. It was pretty generally understood
      that Hutchinson would act according to the king’s wishes, right or wrong,
      like most of the other gentlemen who held offices under the crown.
      Besides, as he was brother-in-law of Andrew Oliver, the people now felt a
      particular dislike to him.”

“I should think,” said Laurence, “as Mr. Hutchinson had written the
      history of our Puritan forefathers, he would have known what the temper of
      the people was, and so have taken care not to wrong them.”

“He trusted in the might of the King of England,” replied Grandfather,
      “and thought himself safe under the shelter of the throne. If no dispute
      had arisen between the king and the people, Hutchinson would have had the
      character of a wise, good, and patriotic magistrate. But, from the time
      that he took part against the rights of his country, the people’s love and
      respect were turned to scorn and hatred, and he never had another hour of
      peace.”

In order to show what a fierce and dangerous spirit was now aroused among
      the inhabitants, Grandfather related a passage from history which we shall
      call The Hutchinson Mob.

On the evening of the 26th of August, 1765, a bonfire was kindled in King
      Street. It flamed high upward, and threw a ruddy light over the front of
      the Town House, on which was displayed a carved representation of the
      royal arms. The gilded vane of the cupola glittered in the blaze. The
      kindling of this bonfire was the well-known signal for the populace of
      Boston to assemble in the street.

Before the tar-barrels, of which the bonfire was made, were half burned
      out, a great crowd had come together. They were chiefly laborers and
      seafaring men, together with many young apprentices, and all those idle
      people about town who are ready for any kind of mischief. Doubtless some
      school-boys were among them.

While these rough figures stood round the blazing bonfire, you might hear
      them speaking bitter words against the high officers of the province.
      Governor Bernard, Hutchinson, Oliver, Storey, Hallowell, and other men
      whom King George delighted to honor, were reviled as traitors to the
      country. Now and then, perhaps, an officer of the crown passed along the
      street, wearing the gold-laced hat, white wig, and embroidered waistcoat
      which were the fashion of the day. But when the people beheld him they set
      up a wild and angry howl; and their faces had an evil aspect, which was
      made more terrible by the flickering blaze of the bonfire.

“I should like to throw the traitor right into that blaze!” perhaps one
      fierce rioter would say.

“Yes; and all his brethren too!” another might reply; “and the governor
      and old Tommy Hutchinson into the hottest of it!”

“And the Earl of Bute along with them!” muttered a third; “and burn the
      whole pack of them under King George’s nose! No matter if it singed him!”

Some such expressions as these, either shouted aloud or muttered under the
      breath, were doubtless heard in King Street. The mob, meanwhile, were
      growing fiercer and fiercer, and seemed ready even to set the town on fire
      for the sake of burning the king’s friends out of house and home. And yet,
      angry as they were, they sometimes broke into a loud roar of laughter, as
      if mischief and destruction were their sport.

But we must now leave the rioters for a time, and take a peep into the
      lieutenant-governor’s splendid mansion. It was a large brick house,
      decorated with Ionic pilasters, and stood in Garden Court Street, near the
      North Square.

While the angry mob in King Street were shouting his name,
      Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson sat quietly in Grandfather’s chair,
      unsuspicious of the evil that was about to fall upon his head. His beloved
      family were in the room with him. He had thrown off his embroidered coat
      and powdered wig, and had on a loose-flowing gown and purple-velvet cap.
      He had likewise laid aside the cares of state and all the thoughts that
      had wearied and perplexed him throughout the day.

Perhaps, in the enjoyment of his home, he had forgotten all about the
      Stamp Act, and scarcely remembered that there was a king, across the
      ocean, who had resolved to make tributaries of the New-Englanders.
      Possibly, too, he had forgotten his own ambition, and would not have
      exchanged his situation, at that moment, to be governor, or even a lord.

The wax candles were now lighted, and showed a handsome room, well
      provided with rich furniture. On the walls hung the pictures of
      Hutchinson’s ancestors, who had been eminent men in their day, and were
      honorably remembered in the history of the country. Every object served to
      mark the residence of a rich, aristocratic gentleman, who held himself
      high above the common people, and could have nothing to fear from them. In
      a corner of the room, thrown carelessly upon a chair, were the scarlet
      robes of the chief justice. This high office, as well as those of
      lieutenant-governor, councillor, and judge of probate, was filled by
      Hutchinson.

Who or what could disturb the domestic quiet of such a great and powerful
      personage as now sat in Grandfather’s chair?

The lieutenant-governor’s favorite daughter sat by his side. She leaned on
      the arm of our great chair, and looked up affectionately into her father’s
      face, rejoicing to perceive that a quiet smile was on his lips. But
      suddenly a shade came across her countenance. She seemed to listen
      attentively, as if to catch a distant sound.

The lieutenant-governor listened. But his ears were duller than those of
      his daughter; he could hear nothing more terrible than the sound of a
      summer breeze, sighing among the tops of the elm-trees.

“No, foolish child!” he replied, playfully patting her cheek. “There is no
      tumult. Our Boston mobs are satisfied with what mischief they have already
      done. The king’s friends need not tremble.”

So Hutchinson resumed his pleasant and peaceful meditations, and again
      forgot that there were any troubles in the world. But his family were
      alarmed, and could not help straining their ears to catch the slightest
      sound. More and more distinctly they heard shouts, and then the trampling
      of many feet. While they were listening, one of the neighbors rushed
      breathless into the room.

“A mob! a terrible mob’!” cried he. “They have broken into Mr. Storey’s
      house, and into Mr. Hallo-well’s, and have made themselves drunk with the
      liquors in his cellar; and now they are coming hither, as wild as so many
      tigers. Flee, lieutenant-governor, for your life! for your life!”

But Hutchinson would not hearken to them. He was an old lawyer; and he
      could not realize that the people would do anything so utterly lawless as
      to assault him in his peaceful home. He was one of King George’s chief
      officers and it would be an insult and outrage upon the king himself if
      the lieutenant-governor should suffer any wrong.

“Have no fears on my account,” said he, “I am perfectly safe. The king’s
      name shall be my protection.”

Yet he bade his family retire into one of the neighboring houses. His
      daughter would have remained; but he forced her away.

The huzzas and riotous uproar of the mob were now heard, close at hand.
      The sound was terrible, and struck Hutchinson with the same sort of dread
      as if an enraged wild beast had broken loose and were roaring for its
      prey. He crept softly to the window. There he beheld an immense concourse
      of people, filling all the street and rolling onward to his house. It was
      like a tempestuous flood, that had swelled beyond its bounds and would
      sweep everything before it. Hutchinson trembled; he felt, at that moment,
      that the wrath of the people was a thousand-fold more terrible than the
      wrath of a king.

That was a moment when a loyalist and an aristocrat like Hutchinson might
      have learned how powerless are kings, nobles, and great men, when the low
      and humble range themselves against them. King George could do nothing for
      his servant now. Had King George been there he could have done nothing for
      himself. If Hutchinson had understood this lesson, and remembered it, he
      need not, in after years, have been an exile from his native country, nor
      finally have laid his bones in a distant land.

There was now a rush against the doors of the house. The people sent up a
      hoarse cry. At this instant the lieutenant-governor’s daughter, whom he
      had supposed to be in a place of safety, ran into the room and threw her
      arms around him. She had returned by a private entrance.

“Father, are you mad?” cried she. “Will the king’s name protect you now?
      Come with me, or they will have your life.”

“True,” muttered Hutchinson to himself; “what care these roarers for the
      name of king? I must flee, or they will trample me down on the floor of my
      own dwelling.”

Hurrying away, he and his daughter made their escape by the private
      passage at the moment when the rioters broke into the house. The foremost
      of them rushed up the staircase, and entered the room which Hutchinson had
      just quitted. There they beheld our good old chair facing them with quiet
      dignity, while the lion’s head seemed to move its jaws in the unsteady
      light of their torches. Perhaps the stately aspect of our venerable
      friend, which had stood firm through a century and a half of trouble,
      arrested them for an instant. But they were thrust forward by those
      behind, and the chair lay overthrown.

Then began the work of destruction. The carved and polished mahogany
      tables were shattered with heavy clubs and hewn to splinters with axes.
      The marble hearths and mantel-pieces were broken. The volumes of
      Hutchinson’s library, so precious to a studious man, were torn out of
      their covers, and the leaves sent flying out of the windows. Manuscripts,
      containing secrets of our country’s history, which are now lost forever,
      were scattered to the winds.

The old ancestral portraits, whose fixed countenances looked down on the
      wild scene, were rent from the walls. The mob triumphed in their downfall
      and destruction, as if these pictures of Hutchinson’s forefathers had
      committed the same offences as their descendant. A tall looking-glass,
      which had hitherto presented a reflection of the enraged and drunken
      multitude, was now smashed into a thousand fragments. We gladly dismiss
      the scene from the mirror of our fancy.

Before morning dawned the walls of the house were all that remained. The
      interior was a dismal scene of ruin. A shower pattered in at the broken
      windows; and when Hutchinson and his family returned, they stood shivering
      in the same room where the last evening had seen them so peaceful and
      happy.

“Grandfather,” said Laurence, indignantly, “if the people acted in this
      manner, they were not worthy of even so much liberty as the King of
      England was willing to allow them.”

“It was a most unjustifiable act, like many other popular movements at
      that time,” replied Grandfather. “But we must not decide against the
      justice of the people’s cause merely because an excited mob was guilty of
      outrageous violence. Besides, all these things were done in the first fury
      of resentment. Afterwards the people grew more calm, and were more
      influenced by the counsel of those wise and good men who conducted them
      safely and gloriously through the Revolution.”

Little Alice, with tears in her blue eyes, said that she hoped the
      neighbors had not let Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson and his family be
      homeless in the street, but had taken them into their houses and been kind
      to them. Cousin Clara, recollecting the perilous situation of our beloved
      chair, inquired what had become of it.

“Nothing was heard of our chair for some time afterwards,” answered
      Grandfather. “One day in September, the same Andrew Oliver, of whom I
      before told you, was summoned to appear at high noon under Liberty Tree.
      This was the strangest summons that had ever been heard of; for it was
      issued in the name of the whole people, who thus took upon themselves the
      authority of a sovereign power. Mr. Oliver dared not disobey. Accordingly,
      at the appointed hour he went, much against his will, to Liberty Tree.”

Here Charley interposed a remark that poor Mr. Oliver found but little
      liberty under Liberty Tree. Grandfather assented.

“It was a stormy day,” continued he. “The equinoctial gale blew violently,
      and scattered the yellow leaves of Liberty Tree all along the street. Mr.
      Oliver’s wig was dripping with water-drops; and he probably looked
      haggard, disconsolate, and humbled to the earth. Beneath the tree, in
      Grandfather’s chair,—our own venerable chair,—sat Mr. Richard
      Dana, a justice of the peace. He administered an oath to Mr. Oliver that
      he would never have anything to do with distributing the stamps. A vast
      concourse of people heard the oath, and shouted when it was taken.”

“There is something grand in this,” said Laurence. “I like it, because the
      people seem to have acted with thoughtfulness and dignity; and this proud
      gentleman, one of his Majesty’s high officers, was made to feel that King
      George could not protect him in doing wrong.”

“But it was a sad day for poor Mr. Oliver,” observed Grandfather. “From
      his youth upward it had probably been the great principle of his life to
      be faithful and obedient to the king. And now, in his old age, it must
      have puzzled and distracted him to find the sovereign people setting up a
      claim to his faith and obedience.”

Grandfather closed the evening’s conversation by saying that the
      discontent of America was so great, that, in 1766, the British Parliament
      was compelled to repeal the Stamp Act. The people made great rejoicings,
      but took care to keep Liberty Tree well pruned and free from caterpillars
      and canker-worms. They foresaw that there might yet be occasion for them
      to assemble under its far-projecting shadow.

THE NEXT evening, Clara, who remembered that our chair had been left
      standing in the rain under Liberty Tree, earnestly besought Grandfather to
      tell when and where it had next found shelter. Perhaps she was afraid that
      the venerable chair, by being exposed to the inclemency of a September
      gale, might get the rheumatism in its aged joints.

“The chair,” said Grandfather, “after the ceremony of Mr. Oliver’s oath,
      appears to have been quite forgotten by the multitude. Indeed, being much
      bruised and rather rickety, owing to the violent treatment it had suffered
      from the Hutchinson mob, most people would have thought that its days of
      usefulness were over. Nevertheless, it was conveyed away under cover of
      the night and committed to the care of a skilful joiner. He doctored our
      old friend so successfully, that, in the course of a few days, it made its
      appearance in the public room of the British Coffee Houses in King
      Street.”

“I know not,” answered Grandfather, “unless he considered it a dishonor
      and disgrace to the chair to have stood under Liberty Tree. At all events,
      he suffered it to remain at the British Coffee House, which was the
      principal hotel in Boston. It could not possibly have found a situation
      where it would be more in the midst of business and bustle, or would
      witness more important events, or be occupied by a greater variety of
      persons.”

Grandfather went on to tell the proceedings of the despotic king and
      ministry of England after the repeal of the Stamp Act. They could not bear
      to think that their right to tax America should be disputed by the people.
      In the year 1767, therefore, they caused Parliament to pass an act for
      laying a duty on tea and some other articles that were in general use.
      Nobody could now buy a pound of tea without paying a tax to King George.
      This scheme was pretty craftily contrived; for the women of America were
      very fond of tea, and did not like to give up the use of it.

But the people were as much opposed to this new act of Parliament as they
      had been to the Stamp Act. England, however, was determined that they
      should submit. In order to compel their obedience, two regiments,
      consisting of more than seven hundred British soldiers, were sent to
      Boston. They arrived in September, 1768, and were landed on Long Wharf.
      Thence they marched to the Common with loaded muskets, fixed bayonets, and
      great pomp and parade. So now, at last, the free town of Boston was
      guarded and overawed by redcoats as it had been in the days of old Sir
      Edmund Andros.

In the month of November more regiments arrived. There were now four
      thousand troops in Boston. The Common was whitened with their tents. Some
      of the soldiers were lodged in Faneuil Hall, which the inhabitants looked
      upon as a consecrated place, because it had been the scene of a great many
      meetings in favor of liberty. One regiment was placed in the Town House,
      which we now call the Old State House. The lower floor of this edifice had
      hitherto been used by the merchants as an exchange. In the upper stories
      were the chambers of the judges, the representatives, and the governor’s
      council. The venerable councillors could not assemble to consult about the
      welfare of the province without being challenged by sentinels and passing
      among the bayonets of the British soldiers.

Sentinels likewise were posted at the lodgings of the officers in many
      parts of the town. When the inhabitants approached they were greeted by
      the sharp question, “Who goes there?” while the rattle of the soldier’s
      musket was heard as he presented it against their breasts. There was no
      quiet even on the sabbath day. The quiet descendants of the Puritans were
      shocked by the uproar of military music; the drum, fife, and bugle
      drowning the holy organ peal and the voices of the singers. It would
      appear as if the British took every method to insult the feelings of the
      people.

“Grandfather,” cried Charley, impatiently, “the people did not go to
      fighting half soon enough! These British redcoats ought to have been
      driven back to their vessels the very moment they landed on Long Wharf.”

“Many a hot-headed young man said the same as you do, Charley,” answered
      Grandfather. “But the elder and wiser people saw that the time was not yet
      come. Meanwhile, let us take another peep at our old chair.”

“Ah, it drooped its head, I know,” said Charley, “when it saw how the
      province was disgraced. Its old Puritan friends never would have borne
      such doings.”

“The chair,” proceeded Grandfather, “was now continually occupied by some
      of the high tories, as the king’s friends were called, who frequented the
      British Coffee House. Officers of the Custom House, too, which stood on
      the opposite side of King Street, often sat in the chair wagging their
      tongues against John Hancock.”

“Because he was a great merchant and contended against paying duties to
      the king,” said Grandfather.

“Well, frequently, no doubt, the officers of the British regiments, when
      not on duty, used to fling themselves into the arms of our venerable
      chair. Fancy one of them, a red-nosed captain in his scarlet uniform,
      playing with the hilt of his sword, and making a circle of his brother
      officers merry with ridiculous jokes at the expense of the poor Yankees.
      And perhaps he would call for a bottle of wine, or a steaming bowl of
      punch, and drink confusion to all rebels.”

“Our grave old chair must have been scandalized at such scenes,” observed
      Laurence; “the chair that had been the Lady Arbella’s, and which the holy
      apostle Eliot had consecrated.”

“It certainly was little less than sacrilege,” replied Grandfather; “but
      the time was coming when even the churches, where hallowed pastors had
      long preached the word of God, were to be torn down or desecrated by the
      British troops. Some years passed, however, before such things were done.”

Grandfather now told his auditors that, in 1769, Sir Francis Bernard went
      to England after having been governor of Massachusetts ten years. He was a
      gentleman of many good qualities, an excellent scholar, and a friend to
      learning. But he was naturally of an arbitrary disposition; and he had
      been bred at the University of Oxford, where young men were taught that
      the divine right of kings was the only thing to be regarded in matters of
      government. Such ideas were ill adapted to please the people of
      Massachusetts. They rejoiced to get rid of Sir Francis Bernard, but liked
      his successor, Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson, no better than himself.

About this period the people were much incensed at an act committed by a
      person who held an office in the Custom House. Some lads, or young men,
      were snowballing his windows. He fired a musket at them, and killed a poor
      German boy, only eleven years old. This event made a great noise in town
      and country, and much increased the resentment that was already felt
      against the servants of the crown.

“Now, children,” said Grandfather, “I wish to make you comprehend the
      position of the British troops in King Street. This is the same which we
      now call State Street. On the south side of the Town House, or Old State
      House, was what military men call a court of guard, defended by two brass
      cannons, which pointed directly at one of the doors of the above edifice.
      A large party of soldiers were always stationed in the court of guard. The
      Custom House stood at a little distance down King Street, nearly where the
      Suffolk Bank now stands, and a sentinel was continually pacing before its
      front.”

“I shall remember this to-morrow,” said Charley; “and I will go to State
      Street, so as to see exactly where the British troops were stationed.”

“And before long,” observed Grandfather, “I shall have to relate an event
      which made King Street sadly famous on both sides of the Atlantic. The
      history of our chair will soon bring us to this melancholy business.”

Here Grandfather described the state of things which arose from the ill
      will that existed between the inhabitants and the redcoats. The old and
      sober part of the townspeople were very angry at the government for
      sending soldiers to overawe them. But those gray-headed men were cautious,
      and kept their thoughts and feelings in their own breasts, without putting
      themselves in the way of the British bayonets.

The younger people, however, could hardly be kept within such prudent
      limits. They reddened with wrath at the very sight of a soldier, and would
      have been willing to come to blows with them at any moment. For it was
      their opinion that every tap of a British drum, within the peninsula of
      Boston was an insult to the brave old town.

“It was sometimes the case,” continued Grandfather, “that affrays happened
      between such wild young men as these and small parties of the soldiers. No
      weapons had hitherto been used except fists or cudgels. But when men have
      loaded muskets in their hands, it is easy to foretell that they will soon
      be turned against the bosoms of those who provoke their anger.”

“Grandfather,” said little Alice, looking fearfully into his face, “your
      voice sounds as though you were going to tell us something awful!”

LITTLE ALICE, by her last remark, proved herself a good judge of what was
      expressed by the tones of Grandfather’s voice. He had given the above
      description of the enmity between the townspeople and the soldiers in
      order to Prepare the minds of his auditors for a very terrible event. It
      was one that did more to heighten the quarrel between England and America
      than anything that had yet occurred.

It was now the 8d of March, 1770. The sunset music of the British
      regiments was heard as usual throughout the town. The shrill fife and
      rattling drum awoke the echoes in King Street, while the last ray of
      sunshine was lingering on the cupola of the Town House. And now all the
      sentinels were posted. One of them marched up and down before the Custom
      House, treading a short path through the snow, and longing for the time
      when he would be dismissed to the warm fireside of the guard room.
      Meanwhile Captain Preston was, perhaps, sitting in our great chair before
      the hearth of the British Coffee House. In the course of the evening there
      were two or three slight commotions, which seemed to indicate that trouble
      was at hand. Small parties of young men stood at the corners of the
      streets or walked along the narrow pavements. Squads of soldiers who were
      dismissed from duty passed by them, shoulder to shoulder, with the regular
      step which they had learned at the drill. Whenever these encounters took
      place, it appeared to be the object of the young men to treat the soldiers
      with as much incivility as possible.

“Turn out, you lobsterbacks!” one would say. “Crowd them off the
      sidewalks!” another would cry. “A redcoat has no right in Boston streets!”

“O, you rebel rascals!” perhaps the soldiers would reply, glaring fiercely
      at the young men. “Some day or other we’ll make our way through Boston
      streets at the point of the bayonet!”

Once or twice such disputes as these brought on a scuffle; which passed
      off, however, without attracting much notice. About eight o’clock, for
      some unknown cause, an alarm-bell rang loudly and hurriedly.

At the sound many people ran out of their houses, supposing it to be an
      alarm of fire. But there were no flames to be seen, nor was there any
      smell of smoke in the clear, frosty air; so that most of the townsmen went
      back to their own firesides and sat talking with their wives and children
      about the calamities of the times. Others who were younger and less
      prudent remained in the streets; for there seems to have been a
      presentiment that some strange event was on the eve of taking place.

Later in the evening, not far from nine o’clock, several young men passed
      by the Town House and walked down King Street. The sentinel was still on
      his post in front of the Custom House, pacing to and fro; while, as he
      turned, a gleam of light from some neighboring window glittered on the
      barrel of his musket. At no great distance were the barracks and the
      guard-house, where his comrades were probably telling stories of battle
      and bloodshed.

Down towards the Custom House, as I told you, came a party of wild young
      men. When they drew near the sentinel he halted on his post, and took his
      musket from his shoulder, ready to present the bayonet at their breasts.

“Who goes there?” he cried, in the gruff, peremptory tones of a soldier’s
      challenge. The young men, being Boston boys, felt as if they had a right
      to walk their own streets without being accountable to a British redcoat,
      even though he challenged them in King George’s name. They made some rude
      answer to the sentinel. There was a dispute, or perhaps a scuffle. Other
      soldiers heard the noise, and ran hastily from the barracks to assist
      their comrades. At the same time many of the townspeople rushed into King
      Street by various avenues, and gathered in a crowd round about the Custom
      House. It seemed wonderful how such a multitude had started up all of a
      sudden.

The wrongs and insults which the people had been suffering for many months
      now kindled them into a rage. They threw snowballs and lumps of ice at the
      soldiers. As the tumult grew louder it reached the ears of Captain
      Preston, the officer of the day. He immediately ordered eight soldiers of
      the main guard to take their muskets and follow him. They marched across
      the street, forcing their way roughly through the crowd, and pricking the
      townspeople with their bayonets.

A gentleman (it was Henry Knox, afterwards general of the American
      artillery) caught Captain Preston’s arm.

“Stand aside!” answered Captain Preston, haughtily. “Do not interfere,
      sir. Leave me to manage the affair.”

Arriving at the sentinel’s post, Captain Preston drew up his men in a
      semicircle, with their faces to the crowd and their rear to the Custom
      House. When the people saw the officer and beheld the threatening attitude
      with which the soldiers fronted them, their rage became almost
      uncontrollable.

“Rush upon them!” shouted many voices. “Drive the rascals to their
      barracks! Down with them! Down with them! Let them fire if they dare!”

Amid the uproar, the soldiers stood glaring at the people with the
      fierceness of men whose trade was to shed blood.

Oh, what a crisis had now arrived! Up to this very moment, the angry
      feelings between England and America might have been pacified. England had
      but to stretch out the hand of reconciliation, and acknowledge that she
      had hitherto mistaken her rights, but would do so no more. Then the
      ancient bonds of brotherhood would again have been knit together as firmly
      as in old times. The habit of loyalty, which had grown as strong as
      instinct, was not utterly overcome. The perils shared, the victories won,
      in the old French War, when the soldiers of the colonies fought side by
      side with their comrades from beyond the sea, were unforgotten yet.
      England was still that beloved country which the colonists called their
      home. King George, though he had frowned upon America, was still
      reverenced as a father.

But should the king’s soldiers shed one drop of American blood, then it
      was a quarrel to the death. Never, never would America rest satisfied
      until she had torn down the royal authority and trampled it in the dust.

“Fire, if you dare, villains!” hoarsely shouted the people, while the
      muzzles of the muskets were turned upon them. “You dare not fire!”

They appeared ready to rush upon the levelled bayonets. Captain Preston
      waved his sword, and uttered a command which could not be distinctly heard
      amid the uproar of shouts that issued from a hundred throats. But his
      soldiers deemed that he had spoken the fatal mandate, “Fire!” The flash of
      their muskets lighted up the streets, and the report rang loudly between
      the edifices. It was said, too, that the figure of a man, with a cloth
      hanging down over his face, was seen to step into the balcony of the
      Custom House and discharge a musket at the crowd.

A gush of smoke had overspread the scene. It rose heavily, as if it were
      loath to reveal the dreadful spectacle beneath it. Eleven of the sons of
      New England lay stretched upon the street. Some, sorely wounded, were
      struggling to rise again. Others stirred not nor groaned; for they were
      past all pain. Blood was streaming upon the snow; and that purple stain in
      the midst of King Street, though it melted away in the next day’s sun, was
      never forgotten nor forgiven by the people.

Grandfather was interrupted by the violent sobs of little Alice. In his
      earnestness he had neglected to soften clown the narrative so that it
      might not terrify the heart of this unworldly infant. Since Grandfather
      began the history of our chair, little Alice had listened to many tales of
      war. But probably the idea had never really impressed itself upon her mind
      that men have shed the blood of their fellow-creatures. And now that this
      idea was forcibly presented to her, it affected the sweet child with
      bewilderment and horror.

“I ought to have remembered our dear little Alice,” said Grandfather
      reproachfully to himself. “Oh, what a pity! Her heavenly nature has now
      received its first impression of earthly sin and violence. Well, Clara,
      take her to bed and comfort her. Heaven grant that she may dream away the
      recollection of the Boston massacre!”

“Grandfather,” said Charley, when Clara and little Alice had retired, “did
      not the people rush upon the soldiers and take revenge?”

“The town drums beat to arms,” replied Grandfather, “the alarm-bells rang,
      and an immense multitude rushed into King Street. Many of them had weapons
      in their hands. The British prepared to defend themselves. A whole
      regiment was drawn up in the street, expecting an attack; for the townsmen
      appeared ready to throw themselves upon the bayonets.”

“Governor Hutchinson hurried to the spot,” said Grandfather, “and besought
      the people to have patience, promising that strict justice should be done.
      A day or two afterward the British troops were withdrawn from town and
      stationed at Castle William. Captain Preston and the eight soldiers were
      tried for murder. But none of them were found guilty. The judges told the
      jury that the insults and violence which had been offered to the soldiers
      justified them in firing at the mob.”

“The Revolution,” observed Laurence, who had said but little during the
      evening, “was not such a calm, majestic movement as I supposed. I do not
      love to hear of mobs and broils in the street. These things were unworthy
      of the people when they had such a great object to accomplish.”

“Nevertheless, the world has seen no grander movement than that of our
      Revolution from first to last,” said Grandfather. “The people, to a man,
      were full of a great and noble sentiment. True, there may be much fault to
      find with their mode of expressing this sentiment; but they knew no
      better; the necessity was upon them to act out their feelings in the best
      manner they could. We must forgive what was wrong in their actions, and
      look into their hearts and minds for the honorable motives that impelled
      them.”

“And I suppose,” said Laurence, “there were men who knew how to act
      worthily of what they felt.”

Grandfather here made a pause. That night Charley had a dream about the
      Boston massacre, and thought that he himself was in the crowd and struck
      down Captain Preston with a great club. Laurence dreamed that he was
      sitting in our great chair, at the window of the British Coffee House, and
      beheld the whole scene which Grandfather had described. It seemed to him,
      in his dream, that, if the townspeople and the soldiers would but have
      heard him speak a single word, all the slaughter might have been averted.
      But there was such an uproar that it drowned his voice.

The next morning the two boys went together to State Street and stood on
      the very spot where the first blood of the Revolution had been shed. The
      Old State House was still there, presenting almost the same aspect that it
      had worn on that memorable evening, one-and-seventy years ago. It is the
      sole remaining witness of the Boston massacre.

THE NEXT evening the astral lamp was lighted earlier than usual, because
      Laurence was very much engaged in looking over the collection of portraits
      which had been his New-Year’s gift from Grandfather.

Among them he found the features of more than one famous personage who had
      been connected with the adventures of our old chair. Grandfather bade him
      draw the table nearer to the fireside; and they looked over the portraits
      together, while Clara and Charley likewise lent their attention. As for
      little Alice, she sat in Grandfather’s lap, and seemed to see the very men
      alive whose faces were there represented.

Turning over the volume, Laurence came to the portrait of a stern,
      grim-looking man, in plain attire, of much more modern fashion than that
      of the old Puritans. But the face might well have befitted one of those
      iron-hearted men. Beneath the portrait was the name of Samuel Adams.

“He was a man of great note in all the doings that brought about the
      Revolution,” said Grandfather. “His character was such, that it seemed as
      if one of the ancient Puritans had been sent back to earth to animate the
      people’s hearts with the same abhorrence of tyranny that had distinguished
      the earliest settlers. He was as religious as they, as stern and
      inflexible, and as deeply imbued with democratic principles. He, better
      than any one else, may be taken as a representative of the people of New
      England, and of the spirit with which they engaged in the Revolutionary
      struggle. He was a poor man, and earned his bread by a humble occupation;
      but with his tongue and pen he made the King of England tremble on his
      throne. Remember him, my children, as one of the strong men of our
      country.”

“Here is one whose looks show a very different character,” observed
      Laurence, turning to the portrait of John Hancock. “I should think, by his
      splendid dress and courtly aspect, that he was one of the king’s friends.”

“There never was a greater contrast than between Samuel Adams and John
      Hancock,” said Grandfather. “Yet they were of the same side in politics,
      and had an equal agency in the Revolution. Hancock was born to the
      inheritance of the largest fortune in New England. His tastes and habits
      were aristocratic. He loved gorgeous attire, a splendid mansion,
      magnificent furniture, stately festivals, and all that was glittering and
      pompous in external things. His manners were so polished that there stood
      not a nobleman at the footstool of King George’s throne who was a more
      skilful courtier than John Hancock might have been. Nevertheless, he in
      his embroidered clothes, and Samuel Adams in his threadbare coat, wrought
      together in the cause of liberty. Adams acted from pure and rigid
      principle. Hancock, though he loved his country, yet thought quite as much
      of his own popularity as he did of the people’s rights. It is remarkable
      that these two men, so very different as I describe them, were the only
      two exempted from pardon by the king’s proclamation.”

On the next leaf of the book was the portrait of General Joseph Warren.
      Charley recognized the name, and said that here was a greater man than
      either Hancock or Adams.

“Warren was an eloquent and able patriot,” replied Grandfather. “He
      deserves a lasting memory for his zealous efforts in behalf of liberty. No
      man’s voice was more powerful in Faneuil Hall than Joseph Warren’s. If his
      death had not happened so early in the contest, he would probably have
      gained a high name as a soldier.”

The next portrait was a venerable man, who held his thumb under his chin,
      and, through his spectacles, appeared to be attentively reading a
      manuscript.

“Here we see the most illustrious Boston boy that ever lived,” said
      Grandfather. “This is Benjamin Franklin. But I will not try to compress
      into a few sentences the character of the sage, who, as a Frenchman
      expressed it, snatched the lightning from the sky and the sceptre from a
      tyrant. Mr. Sparks must help you to the knowledge of Franklin.”

The book likewise contained portraits of James Otis and Josiah Quincy.
      Both of them, Grandfather observed, were men of wonderful talents and true
      patriotism. Their voices were like the stirring tones of a trumpet
      arousing the country to defend its freedom. Heaven seemed to have provided
      a greater number of eloquent men than had appeared at any other period, in
      order that the people might be fully instructed as to their wrongs and the
      method of resistance.

“It is marvellous,” said Grandfather, “to see how many powerful writers,
      orators, and soldiers started up just at the time when they were wanted.
      There was a man for every kind of work. It is equally wonderful that men
      of such different characters were all made to unite in the one object of
      establishing the freedom and independence of America. There was an
      over-ruling Providence above them.”

“Yes; an earnest, warm-tempered, honest and most able man,” said
      Grandfather. “At the period of which we are now speaking he was a lawyer
      in Boston. He was destined in after years to be ruler over the whole
      American people, whom he contributed so much to form into a nation.”

Grandfather here remarked that many a New-Englander, who had passed his
      boyhood and youth in obscurity, afterward attained to a fortune which he
      never could have foreseen even in his most ambitious dreams. John Adams,
      the second President of the United States and the equal of crowned kings,
      was once a schoolmaster and country lawyer. Hancock, the first signer of
      the Declaration of Independence, served his apprenticeship with a
      merchant. Samuel Adams, afterwards governor of Massachusetts, was a small
      tradesman and a tax-gatherer. General Warren was a physician, General
      Lincoln a farmer, and General Knox a bookbinder. General Nathaniel Greene,
      the best soldier, except Washington, in the Revolutionary army, was a
      Quaker and a blacksmith. All these became illustrious men, and can never
      be forgotten in American history.

“And any boy who is born in America may look forward to the same things,”
       said our ambitious friend Charley.

After these observations, Grandfather drew the book of portraits towards
      him and showed the children several British peers and members of
      Parliament who had exerted themselves either for or against the rights of
      America. There were the Earl of Bute, Mr. Grenville, and Lord North. These
      were looked upon as deadly enemies to our country.

Among the friends of America was Mr. Pitt, afterward Earl of Chatham, who
      spent so much of his wondrous eloquence in endeavoring to warn England of
      the consequences of her injustice. He fell down on the floor of the House
      of Lords after uttering almost his dying words in defence of our
      privileges as freemen. There was Edmund Burke, one of the wisest men and
      greatest orators that ever the world produced. There was Colonel Barry,
      who had been among our fathers, and knew that they had courage enough to
      die for their rights. There was Charles James Fox, who never rested until
      he had silenced our enemies in the House of Commons.

“It is very remarkable to observe how many of the ablest orators in the
      British Parliament were favorable to America,” said Grandfather. “We ought
      to remember these great Englishmen with gratitude; for their speeches
      encouraged our fathers almost as much as those of our own orators in
      Faneuil Hall and under Liberty Tree. Opinions which might have been
      received with doubt, if expressed only by a native American, were set down
      as true, beyond dispute, when they came from the lips of Chatham, Burke,
      Barre, or Fox.”

“But, Grandfather,” asked Lawrence, “were there no able and eloquent men
      in this country who took the part of King George?”

“There were many men of talent who said what they could in defence of the
      king’s tyrannical proceedings,” replied Grandfather. “But they had the
      worst side of the argument, and therefore seldom said anything worth
      remembering. Moreover, their hearts were faint and feeble; for they felt
      that the people scorned and detested them. They had no friends, no
      defence, except in the bayonets of the British troops. A blight fell upon
      all their faculties, because they were contending against the rights of
      their own native land.”

“Governor Hutchinson, Chief Justice Oliver, Judge Auchmuty, the Rev.
      Mather Byles, and several other clergymen, were among the most noted
      loyalists,” answered Grandfather.

“That wish is very wrong, Charley,” said Grandfather. “You must not think
      that there is no integrity and honor except among those who stood up for
      the freedom of America. For aught I know, there was quite as much of these
      qualities on one side as on the other. Do you see nothing admirable in a
      faithful adherence to an unpopular cause? Can you not respect that
      principle of loyalty which made the royalists give up country, friends,
      fortune, everything, rather than be false to their king? It was a mistaken
      principle; but many of them cherished it honorably, and were martyrs to
      it.”

“And I would risk my life rather than one of those good old royalists
      should be tarred and feathered.”

“The time is now come when we may judge fairly of them,” continued
      Grandfather. “Be the good and true men among them honored; for they were
      as much our countrymen as the patriots were. And, thank Heaven, our
      country need not be ashamed of her sons,—of most of them at least,—whatever
      side they took in the Revolutionary contest.”

Among the portraits was one of King George III Little Alice clapped her
      hands, and seemed pleased with the bluff good-nature of his physiognomy.
      But Laurence thought it strange that a man with such a face, indicating
      hardly a common share of intellect, should have had influence enough on
      human affairs to convulse the world with war. Grandfather observed that
      this poor king had always appeared to him one of the most unfortunate
      persons that ever lived. He was so honest and conscientious, that, if he
      had been only a private man, his life would probably have been blameless
      and happy. But his was that worst of fortunes,—to be placed in a
      station far beyond his abilities.

“And so,” said Grandfather, “his life, while he retained what intellect
      Heaven had gifted him with, was one long mortification. At last he grew
      crazed with care and trouble. For nearly twenty years the men arch of
      England was confined as a madman. In his old age, too, God took away his
      eyesight; so that his royal palace was nothing to him but a dark, lonesome
      prison-house.”

“OUR old chair?” resumed Grandfather, “did not now stand in the midst of a
      gay circle of British officers. The troops, as I told you, had been
      removed to Castle William immediately after the Boston massacre. Still,
      however, there were many tories, custom-house officers, and Englishmen who
      used to assemble in the British Coffee House and talk over the affairs of
      the period. Matters grew worse and worse; and in 1773 the people did a
      deed which incensed the king and ministry more than any of their former
      doings.”

Grandfather here described the affair, which is known by the name of the
      Boston Tea Party. The Americans, for some time past, had left off
      importing tea, on account of the oppressive tax. The East India Company,
      in London, had a large stock of tea on hand, which they had expected to
      sell to the Americans, but could find no market for it. But after a while,
      the government persuaded this company of merchants to send the tea to
      America.

“How odd it is,” observed Clara, “that the liberties of America should
      have had anything to do with a cup of tea!”

Grandfather smiled, and proceeded with his narrative. When the people of
      Boston heard that several cargoes of tea were coming across the Atlantic,
      they held a great many meetings at Faneuil Hall, in the Old South Church,
      and under Liberty Tree. In the midst of their debates, three ships arrived
      in the harbor with the tea on board. The people spent more than a
      fortnight in consulting what should be done. At last, on the 16th of
      December, 1773, they demanded of Governor Hutchinson that he should
      immediately send the ships back to England.

The governor replied that the ships must not leave the harbor until the
      custom-house duties upon the tea should be paid. Now, the payment of these
      duties was the very thing against which the people had set their faces;
      because it was a tax unjustly imposed upon America by the English
      government. Therefore, in the dusk of the evening, as soon as Governor
      Hutchinson’s reply was received, an immense crowd hastened to Griffin’s
      Wharf, where the tea-ships lay. The place is now called Liverpool Wharf.

“When the crowd reached the wharf,” said Grandfather, “they saw that a set
      of wild-looking figures were already on board of the ships. You would have
      imagined that the Indian warriors of old times had come back again; for
      they wore the Indian dress, and had their faces covered with red and black
      paint, like the Indians when they go to war. These grim figures hoisted
      the tea-chests on the decks of the vessels; broke them open, and threw all
      the contents into the harbor.”

“Grandfather,” said little Alice, “I suppose Indians don’t love tea; else
      they would never waste it so.”

“They were not real Indians, my child,” answered Grandfather. “They were
      white men in disguise; because a heavy punishment would have been
      inflicted on them if the king’s officers had found who they were. But it
      was never known. From that day to this, though the matter has been talked
      of by all the world, nobody can tell the names of those Indian figures.
      Some people say that there were very famous men among them, who afterwards
      became governors and generals. Whether this be true I cannot tell.”

When tidings of this bold deed were carried to England, King George was
      greatly enraged. Parliament immediately passed an act, by which all
      vessels were forbidden to take in or discharge their cargoes at the port
      of Boston. In this way they expected to ruin all the merchants, and starve
      the poor people, by depriving them of employment. At the same time another
      act was passed, taking away many rights and privileges which had been
      granted in the charter of Massachusetts.

Governor Hutchinson, soon afterward, was summoned to England, in order
      that he might give his advice about the management of American affairs.
      General Gage, an officer of the old French War, and since
      commander-in-chief of the British forces in America, was appointed
      governor in his stead. One of his first acts was to make Salem, instead of
      Boston, the metropolis of Massachusetts, by summoning the General Court to
      meet there.

According to Grandfather’s description, this was the most gloomy time that
      Massachusetts had ever seen. The people groaned under as heavy a tyranny
      as in the days of Sir Edmund Andros. Boston looked as if it were afflicted
      with some dreadful pestilence,—so sad were the inhabitants, and so
      desolate the streets. There was no cheerful hum of business. The merchants
      shut up their warehouses, and the laboring men stood idle about the
      wharves. But all America felt interested in the good town of Boston; and
      contributions were raised, in many places, for the relief of the poor
      inhabitants.

“Oh,” replied Grandfather, “a gay throng of officers had now come back to
      the British Coffee House; so that the old chair had no lack of mirthful
      company. Soon after General Gage became governor a great many troops had
      arrived, and were encamped upon the Common. Boston was now a garrisoned
      and fortified town; for the general had built a battery across the Neck,
      on the road to Roxbury, and placed guards for its defence. Everything
      looked as if a civil war were close at hand.”

“A Continental Congress assembled at Philadelphia,” said Grandfather, “and
      proposed such measures as they thought most conducive to the public good.
      A Provincial Congress was likewise chosen in Massachusetts. They exhorted
      the people to arm and discipline themselves. A great number of minutemen
      were enrolled. The Americans called them minute-men, because they engaged
      to be ready to fight at a minute’s warning. The English officers laughed,
      and said that the name was a very proper one, because the minute-men would
      run away the minute they saw the enemy. Whether they would fight or run
      was soon to be proved.”

Grandfather told the children that the first open resistance offered to
      the British troops, in the province of Massachusetts, was at Salem.
      Colonel Timothy Pickering, with thirty or forty militia-men, prevented the
      English colonel, Leslie, with four times as many regular soldiers, from
      taking possession of some military stores. No blood was shed on this
      occasion; but soon afterward it began to flow.

General Gage sent eight hundred soldiers to Concord, about eighteen miles
      from Boston, to destroy some ammunition and provisions which the colonists
      had collected there. They set out on their march on the evening of the
      18th of April, 1775. The next morning the general sent Lord’ Percy with
      nine hundred men to strengthen the troops that had gone before. All that
      day the inhabitants of Boston heard various rumors. Some said that the
      British were making great slaughter among our countrymen. Others affirmed
      that every man had turned out with his musket, and that not a single
      soldier would ever get back to Boston.

“It was after sunset,” continued Grandfather, “when the troops, who had
      marched forth so proudly, were seen entering Charlestown. They were
      covered with dust, and so hot and weary that their tongues hung out of
      their mouths. Many of them were faint with wounds. They had not all
      returned. Nearly three hundred were strewn, dead or dying, along the road
      from Concord. The yeomanry had risen upon the invaders and driven them
      back.”

“Yes,” replied Grandfather; “it was so called, because the British,
      without provocation, had fired upon a party of minute-men, near Lexington
      meeting-house, and killed eight of them. That fatal volley, which was
      fired by order of Major Pitcairn, began the war of the Revolution.”

About this time, if Grandfather had been correctly informed, our chair
      disappeared from the British Coffee House. The manner of its departure
      cannot be satisfactorily ascertained. Perhaps the keeper of the Coffee
      House turned it out of doors on account of its old-fashioned aspect.
      Perhaps he sold it as a curiosity. Perhaps it was taken, without leave, by
      some person who regarded it as public property because it had once figured
      under Liberty Tree. Or perhaps the old chair, being of a peaceable
      disposition, has made use of its four oaken legs and run away from the
      seat of war.

“Meanwhile,” continued Grandfather, “during the mysterious non-appearance
      of our chair, an army of twenty thousand men had started up and come to
      the siege of Boston. General Gage and his troops were cooped up within the
      narrow precincts of the peninsula. On the 17th of June, 1775, the famous
      battle of Bunker Hill was fought. Here General Warren fell. The British
      got the victory, indeed, but with the loss of more than a thousand
      officers and men.”

“No, Charley,” said Grandfather, “I am not like other historians. Battles
      shall not hold a prominent place in the history of our quiet and
      comfortable old chair. But to-morrow evening, Laurence, Clara, and
      yourself, and dear little Alice too, shall visit the Diorama of Bunker
      Hill. There you shall see the whole business, the burning of Charlestown
      and all, with your own eyes, and hear the cannon and musketry with your
      own ears.”

THE next evening but one, when the children had given Grandfather a full
      account of the Diorama of Bunker Hill, they entreated him not to keep them
      any longer in suspense about the fate of his chair. The reader will
      recollect that, at the last accounts, it had trotted away upon its poor
      old legs nobody knew whither. But, before gratifying their curiosity,
      Grandfather found it necessary to say something about public events.

The Continental Congress, which was assembled at Philadelphia, was
      composed of delegates from all the colonies. They had now appointed George
      Washington, of Virginia, to be commander-in-chief of all the American
      armies. He was, at that time, a member of Congress; but immediately left
      Philadelphia, and began his journey to Massachusetts. On the 3d of July,
      1775, he arrived at Cambridge, and took command of the troops which were
      besieging General Gage.

“O Grandfather,” exclaimed Laurence, “it makes my heart throb to think
      what is coming now. We are to see General Washington himself.”

The children crowded around Grandfather and looked earnestly into his
      face. Even little Alice opened her sweet blue eyes, with her lips apart,
      and almost held her breath to listen; so instinctive is the reverence of
      childhood for the father of his country.

Grandfather paused a moment; for he felt as if it might be irreverent to
      introduce the hallowed shade of Washington into a history where an ancient
      elbow-chair occupied the most prominent place. However, he determined to
      proceed with his narrative, and speak of the hero when it was needful, but
      with an unambitious simplicity.

So Grandfather told his auditors, that, on General Washington’s arrival at
      Cambridge, his first care was to reconnoitre the British troops with his
      spy-glass, and to examine the condition of his own army. He found that the
      American troops amounted to about fourteen thousand men. They were
      extended all round the peninsula of Boston, a space of twelve miles, from
      the high grounds of Roxbury on the right to Mystic River on the left. Some
      were living in tents of sailcloth, some in shanties rudely constructed of
      boards, some in huts of stone or turf with curious windows and doors of
      basket-work.

In order to be near the centre and oversee the whole of this
      wide-stretched army, the commander-in-chief made his headquarters at
      Cambridge, about half a mile from the colleges. A mansion-house, which
      perhaps had been the country seat of some Tory gentle man, was provided
      for his residence.

“When General Washington first entered this mansion,” said Grandfather,
      “he was ushered up the staircase and shown into a handsome apartment. He
      sat down in a large chair, which was the most conspicuous object in the
      room. The noble figure of Washington would have done honor to a throne. As
      he sat there, with his hand resting on the hilt of his sheathed sword,
      which was placed between his knees, his whole aspect well befitted the
      chosen man on whom his country leaned for the defence of her dearest
      rights. America seemed safe under his protection. His face was grander
      than any sculptor had ever wrought in marble; none could behold him
      without awe and reverence. Never before had the lion’s head at the summit
      of the chair looked down upon such a face and form as Washington’s.”

“Why, Grandfather!” cried Clara, clasping her hands in amazement, “was it
      really so? Did General Washington sit in our great chair?”

“I knew how it would be,” said Laurence; “I foresaw it the moment
      Grandfather began to speak.”

Grandfather smiled. But, turning from the personal and domestic life of
      the illustrious leader, he spoke of the methods which Washington adopted
      to win back the metropolis of New England from the British.

The army, when he took command of it, was without any discipline or order.
      The privates considered themselves as good as their officers; and seldom
      thought it necessary to obey their commands, unless they understood the
      why and wherefore. Moreover, they were enlisted for so short a period,
      that, as soon as they began to be respectable soldiers, it was time to
      discharge them. Then came new recruits, who had to be taught their duty
      before they could be of any service. Such was the army with which
      Washington had to contend against more than twenty veteran British
      regiments.

Some of the men had no muskets, and almost all were without bayonets.
      Heavy cannon, for battering the British fortifications, were much wanted.
      There was but a small quantity of powder and ball, few tools to build
      intrenchments with, and a great deficiency of provisions and clothes for
      the soldiers. Yet, in spite of these perplexing difficulties, the eyes of
      the whole people were fixed on General Washington, expecting him to
      undertake some great enterprise against the hostile army.

The first thing that he found necessary was to bring his own men into
      better order and discipline. It is wonderful how soon he transformed this
      rough mob of country people into the semblance of a regular army. One of
      Washington’s most invaluable characteristics was the faculty of bringing
      order out of confusion. All business with which he had any concern seemed
      to regulate itself as if by magic. The influence of his mind was like
      light gleaming through an unshaped world. It was this faculty, more than
      any other, that made him so fit to ride upon the storm of the Revolution
      when everything was unfixed and drifting about in a troubled sea.

“Washington had not been long at the head of the army,” proceeded
      Grandfather, “before his soldiers thought as highly of him as if he had
      led them to a hundred victories. They knew that he was the very man whom
      the country needed, and the only one who could bring them safely through
      the great contest against the might of England. They put entire confidence
      in his courage, wisdom, and integrity.”

“Doubtless they would have gone whithersoever his sword pointed the way,”
       answered Grandfather; “and Washington was anxious to make a decisive
      assault upon the enemy. But as the enterprise was very hazardous, he
      called a council of all the generals in the army. Accordingly they came
      from their different posts, and were ushered into the reception-room. The
      commander-in-chief arose from our great chair to greet them.”

“There was General Artemas Ward,” replied Grandfather, “a lawyer by
      profession. He had commanded the troops before Washington’s arrival
      Another was General Charles Lee, who had been a colonel in the English
      army, and was thought to possess vast military science. He came to the
      council, followed by two or three dogs which were always at his heels.
      There was General Putnam, too, who was known all over New England by the
      name of Old Put.”

“The same,” said Grandfather; “and he had done good service in the old
      French War. His occupation was that of a farmer; but he left his plough in
      the furrow at the news of Lexington battle. Then there was General Gates,
      who afterward gained great renown at Saratoga, and lost it again at
      Camden. General Greene, of Rhode Island, was likewise at the council.
      Washington soon discovered him to be one of the best officers in the
      army.”

When the generals were all assembled, Washington consulted them about a
      plan for storming the English batteries. But it was their unanimous
      opinion that so perilous an enterprise ought not to be attempted. The
      army, therefore, continued to besiege Boston, preventing the enemy from
      obtaining supplies of provisions, but without taking any immediate
      measures to get possession of the town. In ‘this manner the sum met,
      autumn, and winter passed away.

“Many a night, doubtless,” said Grandfather, “after Washington had been
      all day on horseback, galloping from one post of the army to another, he
      used to sit in our great chair, rapt in earnest thought. Had you seen him,
      you might have supposed that his whole mind was fixed on the blue china
      tiles which adorned the old-fashioned fireplace. But, in reality, he was
      meditating how to capture the British army, or drive it out of Boston.
      Once, when there was a hard frost, he formed a scheme to cross the Charles
      River on the ice. But the other generals could not be persuaded that there
      was any prospect of success.”

“They lay idle in the town,” replied Grandfather. “General Gage had been
      recalled to England, and was succeeded by Sir William Howe. The British
      army and the inhabitants of Boston were now in great distress. Being shut
      up in the town so long, they had consumed almost all their provisions and
      burned up all their fuel. The soldiers tore down the Old North Church, and
      used its rotten boards and timbers for firewood. To heighten their
      distress, the small-pox broke out. They probably lost far more men by
      cold, hunger, and sickness than had been slain at Lexington and Bunker
      Hill.”

“At length,” continued Grandfather, “in March, 1776, General Washington,
      who had now a good supply of powder, began a terrible cannonade and
      bombardment from Dorchester Heights. One of the cannon-balls which he
      fired into the town struck the tower of the Brattle Street Church, where
      it may still be seen. Sir William Howe made preparations to cross over in
      boats and drive the Americans from their batteries, but was prevented by a
      violent gale and storm. General Washington next erected a battery on
      Nook’s Hill, so near the enemy that it was impossible for them to remain
      in Boston any longer.”

“Hurrah! Hurrah!” cried Charley, clapping his hands triumphantly. “I wish
      I had been there to see how sheepish the Englishmen looked.”

And as Grandfather thought that Boston had never witnessed a more
      interesting period than this, when the royal power was in its death agony,
      he determined to take a peep into the town and imagine the feelings of
      those who were quitting it forever.

“ALAS for the poor tories!” said Grandfather. “Until the very last morning
      after Washington’s troops had shown themselves on Nook’s Hill, these
      unfortunate persons could not believe that the audacious rebels, as they
      called the Americans, would ever prevail against King George’s army. But
      when they saw the British soldiers preparing to embark on board of the
      ships of war, then they knew that they had lost their country. Could the
      patriots have known how bitter were their regrets, they would have
      forgiven them all their evil deeds, and sent a blessing after them as they
      sailed away from their native shore.”

In order to make the children sensible of the pitiable condition of these
      men, Grandfather singled out Peter Oliver, chief justice of Massachusetts
      under the crown, and imagined him walking through the streets of Boston on
      the morning before he left it forever.

Old Chief Justice Oliver threw on his red cloak, and placed his
      three-cornered hat on the top of his white wig. In this garb he intended
      to go forth and take a parting look at objects that had been familiar to
      him from his youth. Accordingly, he began his walk in the north part of
      the town, and soon came to Faneuil Hall. This edifice, the cradle of
      liberty, had been used by the British officers as a playhouse.

“Would that I could see its walls crumble to dust!” thought the chief
      justice; and, in the bitterness of his heart, he shook his fist at the
      famous hall. “There began the mischief which now threatens to rend asunder
      the British empire. The seditious harangues of demagogues in Faneuil Hall
      have made rebels of a loyal people and deprived me of my country.”

He then passed through a narrow avenue and found himself in King Street,
      almost on the very spot which, six years before, had been reddened by the
      blood of the Boston massacre. The chief justice stepped cautiously, and
      shuddered, as if he were afraid that, even now, the gore of his
      slaughtered countrymen might stain his feet.

Before him rose the Town House, on the front of which were still displayed
      the royal arms. Within that edifice he had dispensed justice to the people
      in the days when his name was never mentioned without honor. There, too,
      was the balcony whence the trumpet had been sounded and the proclamation
      read to an assembled multitude, whenever a new king of England ascended
      the throne.

“I remember—I remember,” said Chief Justice Oliver to himself, “when
      his present most sacred Majesty was proclaimed. Then how the people
      shouted! Each man would have poured out his life-blood to keep a hair of
      King George’s head from harm. But now there is scarcely a tongue in all
      New England that does not imprecate curses on his name. It is ruin and
      disgrace to love him. Can it be possible that a few fleeting years have
      wrought such a change?”

It did not occur to the chief justice that nothing but the most grievous
      tyranny could so soon have changed the people’s hearts. Hurrying from the
      spot, he entered Cornhill, as the lower part of Washington Street was then
      called. Opposite to the Town House was the waste foundation of the Old
      North Church. The sacrilegious hands of the British soldiers had torn it
      down, and kindled their barrack fires with the fragments.

Farther on he passed beneath the tower of the Old South. The threshold of
      this sacred edifice was worn by the iron tramp of horses’ feet; for the
      interior had been used as a riding-school and rendezvous for a regiment of
      dragoons. As the chief justice lingered an instant at the door a trumpet
      sounded within, and the regiment came clattering forth and galloped down
      the street. They were proceeding to the place of embarkation.

“Let them go!” thought the chief justice, with somewhat of an old Puritan
      feeling in his breast. “No good can come of men who desecrate the house of
      God.”

He went on a few steps farther, and paused before the Province House. No
      range of brick stores had then sprung up to hide the mansion of the royal
      governors from public view. It had a spacious courtyard, bordered with
      trees, and enclosed with a wrought-iron fence. On the cupola that
      surmounted the edifice was the gilded figure of an Indian chief, ready to
      let fly an arrow from his bow. Over the wide front door was a balcony, in
      which the chief justice had often stood when the governor and high
      officers of the province showed themselves to the people.

While Chief Justice Oliver gazed sadly at the Province House, before which
      a sentinel was pacing, the double leaves of the door were thrown open, and
      Sir William Howe made his appearance. Behind him came a throng of
      officers, whose steel scabbards clattered against the stones as they
      hastened down the court-yard. Sir William Howe was a dark-complexioned
      man, stern and haughty in his deportment. He stepped as proudly in that
      hour of defeat as if he were going to receive the submission of the rebel
      general.

“Forward! gentlemen,” said Sir William Howe to the officers who attended
      him; “we have no time to hear lamentations now.”

And, coldly bowing, he departed. Thus the chief justice had a foretaste of
      the mortifications which the exiled New-Englanders afterwards suffered
      from the haughty Britons. They were despised even by that country which
      they had served more faithfully than their own.

A still heavier trial awaited Chief Justice Oliver, as he passed onward
      from the Province House. He was recognized by the people in the street.
      They had long known him as the descendant of an ancient and honorable
      family. They had seen him sitting in his scarlet robes upon the
      judgment-seat. All his life long, either for the sake of his ancestors or
      on account of his own dignified station and unspotted character, he had
      been held in high respect. The old gentry of the province were looked upon
      almost as noblemen while Massachusetts was under royal government.

But now all hereditary reverence for birth and rank was gone. The
      inhabitants shouted in derision when they saw the venerable form of the
      old chief justice. They laid the wrongs of the country and their own
      sufferings during the siege—their hunger, cold, and sickness—partly
      to his charge and to that of his brother Andrew and his kinsman
      Hutchinson. It was by their advice that the king had acted in all the
      colonial troubles. But the day of recompense was come.

“See the old tory!” cried the people, with bitter laughter. “He is taking
      his last look at us. Let him show his white wig among us an hour hence,
      and we’ll give him a coat of tar and feathers!”

The chief justice, however, knew that he need fear no violence so long as
      the British troops were in possession of the town. But, alas! it was a
      bitter thought that he should leave no loving memory behind him. His
      forefathers, long after their spirits left the earth, had been honored in
      the affectionate remembrance of the people. But he, who would henceforth
      be dead to his native land, would have no epitaph save scornful and
      vindictive words. The old man wept.

“They curse me, they invoke all kinds of evil on my head!” thought he, in
      the midst of his tears. “But, if they could read my heart, they would know
      that I love New England well. Heaven bless her, and bring her again under
      the rule of our gracious king! A blessing, too, on these poor, misguided
      people!”

The chief justice flung out his hands with a gesture, as if he were
      bestowing a parting benediction on his countrymen. He had now reached the
      southern portion of the town, and was far within the range of cannon-shot
      from the American batteries. Close beside him was the bread stump of a
      tree, which appeared to have been recently cut down. Being weary and heavy
      at heart, he was about to sit down upon the stump.

Suddenly it flashed upon his recollection that this was the stump of
      Liberty Tree! The British soldiers had cut it down, vainly boasting that
      they could as easily overthrow the liberties of America. Under its shadowy
      branches, ten years before, the brother of Chief Justice Oliver had been
      compelled to acknowledge the supremacy of the people by taking the oath
      which they prescribed. This tree was connected with all the events that
      had severed America from England.

“Accursed tree!” cried the chief justice, gnashing his teeth; for anger
      overcame his sorrow. “Would that thou hadst been left standing till
      Hancock, Adams, and every other traitor, were hanged upon thy branches!
      Then fitly mightest thou have been hewn down and cast into the flames.”

He turned back, hurried to Long Wharf without looking behind him, embarked
      with the British troops for Halifax, and never saw his country more.
      Throughout the remainder of his days Chief Justice Oliver was agitated
      with those same conflicting emotions that had tortured him while taking
      his farewell walk through the streets of Boston. Deep love and fierce
      resentment burned in one flame within his breast, Anathemas struggled with
      benedictions. He felt as if one breath of his native air would renew his
      life, yet would have died rather than breathe the same air with rebels.
      And such likewise were the feelings of the other exiles, a thousand in
      number, who departed with the British army. Were they not the most
      unfortunate of men?

“The misfortunes of those exiled tories,” observed Laurence, “must have
      made them think of the poor exiles of Acadia.”

“They had a sad time of it, I suppose,” said Charley. “But I choose to
      rejoice with the patriots, rather than be sorrowful with the tories.
      Grandfather, what did General Washington do now?”

“As the rear of the British army embarked from the wharf,” replied
      Grandfather, “General Washington’s troops marched over the Neck, through
      the fortification gates, and entered Boston in triumph. And now, for the
      first time since the Pilgrims landed, Massachusetts was free from the
      dominion of England. May she never again be subjected to foreign rule,—never
      again feel the rod of oppression!”

“Dear Grandfather,” asked little Alice, “did General Washington bring our
      chair back to Boston?”

“I know not how long the chair remained at Cambridge,” said Grandfather.
      “Had it stayed there till this time, it could not have found a better or
      more appropriate shelter, The mansion which General Washington occupied is
      still standing, and his apartments have since been tenanted by several
      eminent men. Governor Everett, while a professor in the University,
      resided there. So at an after period did Mr. Sparks, whose invaluable
      labors have connected his name with the immortality of Washington. And at
      this very time a venerable friend and contemporary of your Grandfather,
      after long pilgrimages beyond the sea, has set up his staff of rest at
      Washington’s headquarters.”

“You mean Professor Longfellow, Grandfather,” said Laurence. “Oh, how I
      should love to see the author of those beautiful Voices of the Night!”

“We will visit him next summer,” answered Grandfather, “and take Clara and
      little Alice with us,—and Charley, too, if he will be quiet.”

WHEN Grandfather resumed his narrative the next evening, he told the
      children that he had some difficulty in tracing the movements of the chair
      during a short period after General Washington’s departure from Cambridge.

Within a few months, however, it made its appearance at a shop in Boston,
      before the door of which was seen a striped pole. In the interior was
      displayed a stuffed alligator, a rattlesnake’s skin, a bundle of Indian
      arrows, an old-fashioned matchlock gun, a walking-stick of Governor
      Winthrop’s, a wig of old Cotton Mather’s, and a colored print of the
      Boston massacre. In short, it was a barber’s shop, kept by a Mr. Pierce,
      who prided himself on having shaved General Washington, Old Put, and many
      other famous persons.

“This was not a very dignified situation for our venerable chair,”
       continued Grandfather; “but, you know, there is no better place for news
      than a barber’s shop. All the events of the Revolutionary War were heard
      of there sooner than anywhere else. People used to sit in the chair,
      reading the newspaper, or talking, and waiting to be shaved, while Mr.
      Pierce, with his scissors and razor, was at work upon the heads or chins
      of his other customers.”

“I am sorry the chair could not betake itself to some more suitable place
      of refuge,” said Laurence.

“It was old now, and must have longed for quiet. Besides, after it had
      held Washington in its arms, it ought not to have been compelled to
      receive all the world. It should have been put into the pulpit of the Old
      South Church, or some other consecrated place.”

“Perhaps so,” answered Grandfather. “But the chair, in the course of its
      varied existence, had grown so accustomed to general intercourse with
      society, that I doubt whether it would have contented itself in the pulpit
      of the Old South. There it would have stood solitary, or with no livelier
      companion than the silent organ, in the opposite gallery, six days out of
      seven. I incline to think that it had seldom been situated more to its
      mind than on the sanded floor of the snug little barber’s shop.”

Then Grandfather amused his children and himself with fancying all the
      different sorts of people who had occupied our chair while they awaited
      the leisure Of the barber.

There was the old clergyman, such as Dr. Chauncey, wearing a white wig,
      which the barber took from his head and placed upon a wig-block. Half an
      hour, perhaps, was spent in combing and powdering this reverend appendage
      to a clerical skull. There, too, were officers of the Continental army,
      who required their hair to be pomatumed and plastered, so as to give them
      a bold and martial aspect. There, once in a while, was seen the thin,
      care-worn, melancholy visage of an old tory, with a Wig that, in times
      long past, had perhaps figured at a Province House ball. And there, not
      unfrequently, sat the rough captain of a privateer, just returned from a
      successful cruise, in which he had captured half a dozen richly laden
      vessels belonging to King George’s subjects. And sometimes a rosy little
      school-boy climbed into our chair, and sat staring, with wide-open eyes,
      at the alligator, the rattlesnake, and the other curiosities of the
      barber’s shop. His mother had sent him, with sixpence in his hand, to get
      his glossy curls cropped off. The incidents of the Revolution plentifully
      supplied the barber’s customers with topics of conversation. They talked
      sorrowfully of the death of General Montgomery and the failure of our
      troops to take Quebec; for the New-Englanders were now as anxious to get
      Canada from the English as they had formerly been to conquer it from the
      French.

“But very soon,” said Grandfather, “came news from Philadelphia, the most
      important that America had ever heard of. On the 4th of July, 1776,
      Congress had signed the Declaration of Independence. The thirteen colonies
      were now free and independent States. Dark as our prospects were, the
      inhabitants welcomed these glorious tidings, and resolved to perish rather
      than again bear the yoke of England.”

“It was a great day,—a glorious deed!” said Laurence, coloring high
      with enthusiasm. “And, Grandfather, I love to think that the sages in
      Congress showed themselves as bold and true as the soldiers in the field;
      for it must have required more courage to sign the Declaration of
      Independence than to fight the enemy in battle.”

Grandfather acquiesced in Laurence’s view of the matter. He then touched
      briefly and hastily upon the prominent events of the Revolution. The
      thunderstorm of war had now rolled southward, and did not again burst upon
      Massachusetts, where its first fury had been felt. But she contributed her
      full share. So the success of the contest. Wherever a battle was fought,—whether
      at Long Island, White Plains, Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, or
      Germantown,—some of her brave sons were found slain upon the field.

In October, 1777, General Burgoyne surrendered his army, at Saratoga, to
      the American general, Gates. The captured troops were sent to
      Massachusetts. Not long afterwards Dr. Franklin and other American
      commissioners made a treaty at Paris, by which France bound herself to
      assist our countrymen. The gallant Lafayette was already fighting for our
      freedom by the side of Washington. In 1778 a French fleet, commanded by
      Count d’Estaing, spent a considerable time in Boston harbor. It marks the
      vicissitudes of human affairs, that the French, our ancient enemies,
      should come hither as comrades and brethren, and that kindred England
      should be our foe.

“While the war was raging in the Middle and Southern States,” proceeded
      Grandfather, “Massachusetts had leisure to settle a new constitution of
      government instead of the royal charter. This was done in 1780. In the
      same year John Hancock, who had been president of Congress, was chosen
      governor of the State. He was the first whom the people had elected since
      the days of old Simon Bradstreet.”

“But, Grandfather, who had been governor since the British were driven
      away?” inquired Laurence. “General Gage and Sir William Howe were the last
      whom you have told us of.”

“There had been no governor for the last four years,” replied Grandfather.
      “Massachusetts had been ruled by the Legislature, to whom the people paid
      obedience of their own accord. It is one of the most remarkable
      circumstances in our history, that, when the charter government was
      overthrown by the war, no anarchy nor the slightest confusion ensued, This
      was a great honor to the people. But now Hancock was proclaimed governor
      by sound of trumpet; and there was again a settled government.”

Grandfather again adverted to the progress of the war. In 1781 General
      Greene drove the British from the Southern States. In October of the same
      year General Washington compelled Lord Cornwallis to surrender his army,
      at Yorktown, in Virginia. This was the last great event of the
      Revolutionary contest. King George and his ministers perceived that all
      the might of England could not compel America to renew her allegiance to
      the crown. After a great deal of discussion, a treaty of peace was signed
      in September, 1783.

“Now, at last,” said Grandfather, “after weary years of war, the regiments
      of Massachusetts returned in peace to their families. Now the stately and
      dignified leaders, such as General Lincoln and General Knox, with their
      powdered hair and their uniforms of blue and buff, were seen moving about
      the streets.”

“And little boys ran after them, I suppose,” remarked Charley; “and the
      grown people bowed respectfully.”

“They deserved respect; for they were good men as well as brave,” answered
      Grandfather. “Now, too, the inferior officers and privates came home to
      seek some peaceful occupation. Their friends remembered them as slender
      and smooth-checked young men; but they returned with the erect and rigid
      mien of disciplined soldiers. Some hobbled on crutches and wooden legs;
      others had received wounds, which were still rankling in their breasts.
      Many, alas! had fallen in battle, and perhaps were left unburied on the
      bloody field.”

“One would have thought so,” said Grandfather. “Yet only two or three
      years elapsed before the folly of some misguided men caused another
      mustering of soldiers. This affair was called Shays’s war, because a
      Captain Shays was the chief leader of the insurgents.”

Grandfather comforted his dear little girl by assuring her that there was
      no great mischief done. Shays’s war happened in the latter part of 1786
      and the beginning of the following year. Its principal cause was the
      badness of times. The State of Massachusetts, in its public capacity, was
      very much in debt. So likewise were many of the people. An insurrection
      took place, the object of which seems to have been to interrupt the course
      of law and get rid of debts and taxes.

James Bowdoin, a good and able man, was now governor of Massachusetts. He
      sent General Lincoln, at the head of four thousand men, to put down the
      insurrection. This general, who had fought through several hard campaigns
      in the Revolution, managed matters like an old soldier, and totally
      defeated the rebels at the expense of very little blood.

“There is but one more public event to be recorded in the history of our
      chair,” proceeded Grandfather. “In the year 1794 Samuel Adams was elected
      governor of Massachusetts. I have told you what a distinguished patriot he
      was, and how much he resembled the stern old Puritans. Could the ancient
      freemen of Massachusetts who lived in the days of the first charter have
      arisen from their graves, they would probably have voted for Samuel Adams
      to be governor.”

“He did,” replied Grandfather. “He had long been in the habit of visiting
      the barber’s shop, where our venerable chair, philosophically forgetful of
      its former dignities, had now spent nearly eighteen not uncomfortable
      years. Such a remarkable piece of furniture, so evidently a relic of
      long-departed times, could not escape the notice of Samuel Adams. He made
      minute researches into its history, and ascertained what a succession of
      excellent and famous people had occupied it.”

“How did he find it out?” asked Charley; “for I suppose the chair could
      not tell its own history.”

“There used to be a vast collection of ancient letters and other documents
      in the tower of the Old South Church,” answered Grandfather. “Perhaps the
      history of our chair was contained among these. At all events, Samuel
      Adams appears to have been well acquainted with it. When he became
      governor, he felt that he could have no more honorable seat than that
      which had been the ancient chair of state. He therefore purchased it for a
      trifle, and filled it worthily for three years as governor of
      Massachusetts.” “And what next?” asked Charley.

“That is all,” said Grandfather, heaving a sigh; for he could not help
      being a little sad at the thought that his stories must close here.
      “Samuel Adams died in 1803, at the age of above threescore and ten. He was
      a great patriot, but a poor man. At his death he left scarcely property
      enough to pay the expenses of his funeral. This precious chair, among his
      other effects, was sold at auction; and your Grandfather, who was then in
      the strength of his years, became the purchaser.”

Laurence, with a mind full of thoughts that struggled for expression, but
      could find none, looked steadfastly at the chair.

“Oh, how I wish that the chair could speak!” cried he. “After its long
      intercourse with mankind,—after looking upon the world for ages,—what
      lessons of golden wisdom it might utter! It might teach a private person
      how to lead a good and happy life, or a statesman how to make his country
      prosperous.”

GRANDFATHER was struck by Laurence’s idea that the historic chair should
      utter a voice, and thus pour forth the collected wisdom of two centuries.
      The old gentleman had once possessed no inconsiderable share of fancy; and
      even now its fading sunshine occasionally glimmered among his more sombre
      reflections.

As the history of his chair had exhausted all his facts, Grandfather
      determined to have recourse to fable. So, after warning the children that
      they must not mistake this story for a true one, he related what we shall
      call Grandfather’s Dream.

Laurence and Clara, where were you last night? Where were you, Charley,
      and dear little Alice? You had all gone to rest, and left old Grandfather
      to meditate alone in his great chair. The lamp had grown so dim that its
      light hardly illuminated the alabaster shade. The wood-fire had crumbled
      into heavy embers, among which the little flames danced, and quivered, and
      sported about like fairies.

And here sat Grandfather all by himself. He knew that it was bedtime; yet
      he could not help longing to hear your merry voices, or to hold a
      comfortable chat with some old friend; because then his pillow would be
      visited by pleasant dreams. But, as neither children nor friends were at
      hand, Grandfather leaned back in the great chair and closed his eyes, for
      the sake of meditating more profoundly.

And, when Grandfather’s meditations had grown very profound indeed, he
      fancied that he heard a sound over his head, as if somebody were preparing
      to speak.

As Grandfather did not know that any person was in the room, he started up
      in great surprise, and peeped hither and thither, behind the chair, and
      into the recess by the fireside, and at the dark nook yonder near the
      bookcase. Nobody could be seen.

But, just as he was going to resume his seat, Grandfather happened to look
      at the great chair. The rays of firelight were flickering upon it in such
      a manner that it really seemed as if its oaken frame were all alive. What!
      did it not move its elbow? There, too! It certainly lifted one of its
      ponderous fore legs, as if it had a notion of drawing itself a little
      nearer to the fire. Meanwhile the lion’s head nodded at Grandfather with
      as polite and sociable a look as a lion’s visage, carved in oak, could
      possibly be expected to assume. Well, this is strange!

“Good evening, my old friend,” said the dry and husky voice, now a little
      clearer than before. “We have been intimately acquainted so long that I
      think it high time we have a chat together.”

Grandfather was looking straight at the lion’s head, and could not be
      mistaken in supposing that it moved its lips. So here the mystery was all
      explained.

“I was not aware,” said Grandfather, with a civil salutation to his oaken
      companion, “that you possessed the faculty of speech. Otherwise I should
      often have been glad to converse with such a solid, useful, and
      substantial if not brilliant member of society.”

“Oh!” replied the ancient chair, in a quiet and easy tone, for it had now
      cleared its throat of the dust of ages, “I am naturally a silent and
      incommunicative sort of character. Once or twice in the course of a
      century I unclose my lips. When the gentle Lady Arbella departed this life
      I uttered a groan. When the honest mint-master weighed his plump daughter
      against the pine-tree shillings I chuckled audibly at the joke. When old
      Simon Bradstreet took the place of the tyrant Andros I joined in the
      general huzza, and capered on my wooden legs for joy. To be sure, the
      by-standers were so fully occupied with their own feelings that my
      sympathy was quite unnoticed.”

“Not often,” answered the chair. “I once talked with Sir William Phips,
      and communicated my ideas about the witchcraft delusion. Cotton Mather had
      several conversations with me, and derived great benefit from my
      historical reminiscences. In the days of the Stamp Act I whispered in the
      ear of Hutchinson, bidding him to remember what stock his countrymen were
      descended of, and to think whether the spirit of their forefathers had
      utterly departed from them. The last man whom I favored with a colloquy
      was that stout old republican, Samuel Adams.”

“And how happens it,” inquired Grandfather, “that there is no record nor
      tradition of your conversational abilities? It is an uncommon thing to
      meet with a chair that can talk.”

“Why, to tell you the truth,” said the chair, giving itself a hitch nearer
      to the hearth, “I am not apt to choose the most suitable moments for
      unclosing my lips. Sometimes I have inconsiderately begun to speak, when
      my occupant, lolling back in my arms, was inclined to take an after-dinner
      nap. Or perhaps the impulse to talk may be felt at midnight, when the lamp
      burns dim and the fire crumbles into decay, and the studious or thoughtful
      man finds that his brain is in a mist. Oftenest I have unwisely uttered my
      wisdom in the ears of sick persons, when the inquietude of fever made them
      toss about upon my cushion. And so it happens, that though my words make a
      pretty strong impression at the moment, yet my auditors invariably
      remember them only as a dream. I should not wonder if you, my excellent
      friend, were to do the same to-morrow morning.”

“Nor I either,” thought Grandfather to himself. However, he thanked this
      respectable old chair for beginning the conversation, and begged to know
      whether it had anything particular to communicate.

“I have been listening attentively to your narrative of my adventures,”
       replied the chair; “and it must be owned that your correctness entitles
      you to be held up as a pattern to biographers. Nevertheless, there are a
      few omissions which I should be glad to see supplied. For instance, you
      make no mention of the good knight Sir Richard Saltonstall, nor of the
      famous Hugh Peters, nor of those old regicide judges, Whalley, Goffe, and
      Dixwell. Yet I have borne the weight of all those distinguished characters
      at one time or another.”

Grandfather promised amendment if ever he should have an opportunity to
      repeat his narrative. The good old chair, which still seemed to retain a
      due regard for outward appearance, then reminded him how long a time had
      passed since it had been provided with a new cushion. It likewise
      expressed the opinion that the oaken figures on its back would show to
      much better advantage by the aid of a little varnish.

“And I have had a complaint in this joint,” continued the chair,
      endeavoring to lift one of its legs, “ever since Charley trundled his
      wheelbarrow against me.”

“And now, venerable chair, I have a favor to solicit. During an existence
      of more than two centuries you have had a familiar intercourse with men
      who were esteemed the wisest of their day. Doubtless, with your capacious
      understanding, you have treasured up many an invaluable lesson of wisdom.
      You certainly have had time enough to guess the riddle of life. Tell us,
      poor mortals, then, how we may be happy.”

The lion’s head fixed its eyes thoughtfully upon the fire, and the whole
      chair assumed an aspect of deep meditation. Finally it beckoned to
      Grandfather with its elbow, and made a step sideways towards him, as if it
      had a very important secret to communicate.

“As long as I have stood in the midst of human affairs,” said the chair,
      with a very oracular enunciation, “I have constantly observed that
      Justice, Truth, and Love are the chief ingredients of every happy life.”

“Justice, Truth, and Love!” exclaimed Grandfather. “We need not exist two
      centuries to find out that these qualities are essential to our happiness.
      This is no secret. Every human being is born with the instinctive
      knowledge of it.”

“Ah!” cried the chair, drawing back in surprise. “From what I have
      observed of the dealings of man with man, and nation with nation, I never
      should have suspected that they knew this all-important secret. And, with
      this eternal lesson written in your soul, do you ask me to sift new wisdom
      for you out of my petty existence of two or three centuries?”

“Not a word more,” interrupted the chair; “here I close my lips for the
      next hundred years. At the end of that period, if I shall have discovered
      any new precepts of happiness better than what Heaven has already taught
      you, they shall assuredly be given to the world.”

In the energy of its utterance the oaken chair seemed to stamp its foot,
      and trod (we hope unintentionally) upon Grandfather’s toe. The old
      gentleman started, and found that he had been asleep in the great chair,
      and that his heavy walking-stick had fallen down across his foot.

“Grandfather,” cried little Alice, clapping her hand, “you must dream a
      new dream every night about our chair!”

Laurence, and Clara, and Charley said the same. But the good old gentleman
      shook his head, and declared that here ended the history, real or
      fabulous, of GRANDFATHER’S CHAIR.

MY DEAR SIR, I came from my house at Milton, the 26 in the morning. After
      dinner it was whispered in town there would be a mob at night, and that
      Paxton, Hallowell, the custom-house, and admiralty officers’ houses would
      be attacked; but my friends assured me that the rabble were satisfied with
      the insult I had received and that I was become rather popular. In the
      evening, whilst I was at supper and my children round me, somebody ran in
      and said the mob were coming. I directed my children to fly to a secure
      place, and shut up my house as I had done before, intending not to quit
      it; but my eldest daughter repented her leaving me, hastened back, and
      protested she would not quit the house unless I did. I could n’t stand
      against this, and withdrew with her to a neighboring house, where I had
      been but a few minutes before the hellish crew fell upon my house with the
      rage of devils, and in a moment with axes split down the doors and
      entered. My son being in the great entry heard them cry: “Damn him, he is
      upstairs, we’ll have him.” Some ran immediately as high as the top of the
      house, others filled the rooms below and cellars, and others remained
      without the house to be employed there.

Messages soon came one after another to the house where I was, to inform
      me the mob were coming in pursuit of me, and I was obliged to retire
      through yards and gardens to a house more remote, where I remained until 4
      o’clock, by which time one of the best finished houses in the Province had
      nothing remaining but the bare walls and floors. Not contented with
      tearing off all the wainscot and hangings, and splitting the doors to
      pieces, they beat down the partition walls; and although that alone cost
      them near two hours, they cut down the cupola or lanthorn, and they began
      to take the slate and boards from the roof, and were prevented only by the
      approaching daylight from a total demolition of the building. The
      garden-house was laid flat, and all my trees, etc., broke down to the
      ground.

Such ruin was never seen in America. Besides my plate and family pictures,
      household furniture of every kind, my own, my children’s, and servants’ 
      apparel, they carried off about Â£900 sterling in money, and emptied the
      house of everything whatsoever, except a part of the kitchen furniture,
      not leaving a single book or paper in it, and have scattered or destroyed
      all the manuscripts and other papers I had been collecting for thirty
      years together, besides a great number of public papers in my custody. The
      evening being warm, I had undressed me and put on a thin camlet surtout
      over my waistcoat. The next morning, the weather being changed, I had not
      clothes enough in my possession to defend me from the cold, and was
      obliged to borrow from my friends. Many articles of clothing and a good
      part of my plate have since been picked up in different quarters of the
      town, lint the furniture in general was cut to pieces before it was thrown
      out of the house, and most of the beds cut open, and the feathers thrown
      out of the windows. The next evening, I intended with my children to
      Milton, but meeting two or three small parties of the ruffians, who I
      suppose had concealed themselves in the country, and my coachman hearing
      one of them say, “There he is!” my daughters were terrified and said they
      should never be safe, and I was forced to shelter them that night at the
      Castle.

The encouragers of the first mob never intended matters should go this
      length, and the people in general expressed the utter detestation of this
      unparalleled outrage, and I wish they could be convinced what infinite
      hazard there is of the most terrible consequences from such demons, when
      they are let loose in a government where there is not constant authority
      at hand sufficient to suppress them. I am told the government here will
      make me a compensation for my own and my family’s loss, which I think
      cannot be much less than Â£3,000 sterling. I am not sure that they will. If
      they should not, it will be too heavy for me, and I must humbly apply to
      his majesty in whose service I am a sufferer; but this, and a much greater
      sum would be an insufficient compensation for the constant distress and
      anxiety of mind I have felt for some time past, and must feel for months
      to come. You cannot conceive the wretched state we are in. Such is the
      resentment of the people against the Stamp-Duty, that there can be no
      dependence upon the General Court to take any steps to enforce, or rather
      advise, to the payment of it. On the other hand, such will be the effects
      of not submitting to it, that all trade must cease, all courts fall, and
      all authority be at an end. Must not the ministry be excessively
      embarrassed? On the one hand, it will be said, if concessions are made,
      the Parliament endanger the loss of their authority over the Colony: on
      the other hand, if external forces should be used, there seems to be
      danger of a total lasting alienation of affection. Is there no
      alternative? May the infinitely wise God direct you.' WHERE id = 'affcd6f7-8336-4784-9dfe-4231bc1e20f6';
