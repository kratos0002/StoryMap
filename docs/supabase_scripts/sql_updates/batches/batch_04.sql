Alexander Sergueievitch Pushkin came of a noble family, so ancient that
it was traced back to that Alexander Nevsky who, in the thirteenth
century, gained a great victory over the Swedes upon the ice of the
River Neva, in token whereof he was surnamed "Nevsky" of the Neva.

His mother, Nadejda Ossipovna Hannibal, was the grand-daughter of
Abraham Petrovitch Hannibal, Peter the Great''s famous negro. His
father, Surguei Lvovitch Pushkin, was a frivolous man of pleasure.

The poet was born on the 26th of May, 1799, at Moscow. He was an
awkward and a silent child. He was educated by French tutors. A poor
scholar, he read with eagerness whatever he could get in his father''s
library, chiefly the works of French authors. His brother states
that at eleven years old Pushkin knew French literature by heart.
This cannot, of course, be taken[Pg 2] literally; but it shows under what
influence he grew up. In October, 1811, he entered the Lyceum of
Tsarskoe Selo. Among the students a society was soon formed, whose
members were united by friendship and by a taste for literature. They
brought out several periodicals, in which tales and poems formed the
chief features. Of this society (the late Prince Gortchakoff belonged
to it) Pushkin was the leading spirit. His first printed poem appeared
in the Messenger of Europe in 1814. At a public competition in 1815,
at which the veteran poet Derjavin was present, Pushkin read his
"Memories of Tsarskoe Selo." This poem, which contains many beautiful
passages, so delighted Derjavin, that he wished to embrace the young
author; but Pushkin fled in confusion from the hall.

In June, 1817, Pushkin''s free and careless student life ended. After
finishing his course at the Lyceum he went to St. Petersburg, and,
though he entered thoroughly into the dissipated pleasures of its
turbulent youth, he still clung to the intellectual society of such men
as Jukovsky and Karamsin, men occupied in literature, whose friendship
he valued very highly.

At that time society was much disturbed. Political clubs were
everywhere being formed. In every drawing-room new views were freely
and openly advanced; and in these discussions the[Pg 3] satire and brilliant
verse of Pushkin attracted general attention. These at last brought
him into great danger. But Karamsin came to his rescue, and managed
to get him an appointment at Ekaterinoslavl, in the office of the
Chief Inspector of the Southern Settlements. There he remained till
1824, travelling from place to place, first with the Raevskys to the
Caucasus, and thence again with them through the Crimea. This journey
gave him materials for his "Prisoner of the Caucasus," and "Fountain of
Bachtchisarai." Both poems reveal the influence of Byron.

Towards the end of 1820 he went to Bessarabia with his chief, who had
just been appointed viceroy of the province. Once, on account of some
quarrel, this person, Insoff by name, sent Pushkin to Ismail. There the
poet joined a band of gypsies and remained with them for some time in
the Steppes. In 1823 he went to Odessa, having been transferred to the
office of the new governor-general, Count Vorontsoff, who succeeded
Insoff.

Here he wrote part of "Evguenie Onegin," a sort of Russian "Don Juan,"
full of sublime passages and varied by satire and bitter scorn. This
work has lately been formed the subject of a very successful opera
by Tchaikovski, who took from Pushkin''s poems a story now known and
admired by every educated Russian.

The poet, however, did not get on with his new[Pg 4] chief. A scathing
epigram upon Vorontsoff led the count to ask for Pushkin''s removal from
Odessa, "where," he said, "excessive flattery had turned the young
maids head."

Pushkin had to resign; and early in August, 1824, he was sent into
retirement to live under the supervision of the local authorities at
Michailovskoe, a village belonging to his father in the province of
Pskoff. Here the elder Pushkin kept a petty watch over his son, whom he
regarded as a perverted nature and, indeed, a kind of monster.

In October, however, the father left Michailovskoe, and the poet
remained alone with Arina Rodionovna, an old woman who had nursed
him in childhood, and whose tales had first inspired him with a love
of Russian popular poetry. At Michailovskoe, Pushkin continued his
"Evguenie Onegin," finished "The Gypsies," and wrote the drama of
"Boris Godunoff." Here he lived more than two years—years of seclusion
following a long period of town life and dissipation.

These two years spent in the simple, pleasant company of country
neighbours proved a turning point in his career. Now for the first time
he had leisure to look about him, to meditate, and to rest.

He had come into the country with a passionate love for everything
that showed the feeling or fancy of the Russian peasant. His taste
for popular poetry was insatiable. He listened to his[Pg 5] old nurse''s
stories, collected and noted down songs, studied the habits and customs
of Russian villages, and began a serious study of Russian history.
All this helped greatly to develop the popular side of his genius. He
afterwards relinquished his earlier models of the romantic school, and
sought a simpler, truer inspiration in the pages of Shakespeare.

Writing to a friend, Bashkin says that he has brought up from the
country to Moscow the two last cantos of "Evguenie Onegin," ready for
the press, a poem called "The Little House at Kolomna," and several
dramatic scenes, including "The Miser Knight," "Mozart and Salieri,"
"The Beast during the Plague" and "The Commander''s Statue."

"Besides that," he goes on to say, "I have written about thirty short
poems, Nor is that, all, I have also (a great secret) written some
prose—five short tales."

Fortunately for him, Pushkin was living in the country, when, in
December, 1825, the insurrection and military revolt against the
Emperor Nicholas, who had just ascended the throne, broke out at St.
Petersburg.

Pushkin was affiliated to the secret society, with Pestle and Ryleieff
at its head, which had organised the rebellion; and, on receiving
a summons from his confederates, he started for the[Pg 6] capital. So,
at least, says Alexander Herzen in his curious "Development of
Revolutionary Ideas in Russia." On leaving his country house, Pushkin
met three ill omens. First a hare crossed his path, next he saw a
priest, and, finally, he met a funeral. He went on, however, towards
Moscow, and there learned that the insurrection had been crushed. The
five principal leaders were executed, and whole families were exiled to
Siberia.

In September, 1826, the Emperor Nicholas had an interview with Pushkin
at Moscow. Pushkin replied simply and frankly to all the Tsar''s
questions, and the latter at last promised in future to be himself sole
censor of the poet''s works.

Pushkin remained at Moscow till about the end of the winter of 1827,
when he was allowed to go to St. Petersburg. There he afterwards
chiefly resided, returning sometimes to the country to work, usually in
autumn, when his power of production, he said, was strongest.

In the summer of 1829 Pushkin visited the Army of the Caucasus then
operating against the Turks. He describes his experiences in his
"Journey to Erzeroum."

On the 18th of February, 1831, he married Natalia Nikolaevna
Gontcharova, and soon afterwards received a Foreign Office appointment
with a salary of 5,000 roubles.

In August, 1833, meaning to write a novel on[Pg 7] the Pugatcheff
Insurrection, Pushkin paid a short visit to Kazan and Orenburg to
acquaint himself with the locality and collect materials. But his tale,
"The Captain''s Daughter," appeared considerably later.

Pushkin and his wife were invited to the court balls, and the Emperor
was very gracious and attentive to the poet.

This roused the jealousy of the court nobles, though in descent
Pushkin was not inferior to many of them. The studied hauteur of these
personages caused the poet much irritation, and led him to waste much
energy on petty struggles for social precedence. He was, moreover,
constantly in lack of means to meet the expenses attending his
position. Partly on this account he undertook, in 1836, the editorship
of the Contemporary Review, and continued it until his death. In
the four numbers issued under his care, Pushkin published original
articles, besides the translations then so much in vogue.

All the publications of that time were made to serve the personal aims
of their editor. It was useless to seek in them impartiality. Pushkin''s
criticism, however, were independent, and for this reason they made
a deep impression. On starting his Review he had taken great care
to entrust the criticism to a small circle of the most accomplished
writers.

Pushkin''s correspondence throws full light on his character, and
reveals it as frank, sincere, and independent. His letters show that he
had original ideas on literature, on contemporary politics, on social
and domestic relations, and, in short, on every subject. These views
were always clear and independent of party.

During his later years the poet felt a longing for the country. As
early as 1835 he petitioned for some years'' leave in order that he
might retire from the capital. In his last poem, "To my Wife," he says
how weary he is of noisy town existence and how he longs for rest.

At the end of 1836 scandals were circulated at St. Petersburg about
his wife. DantÃ¨s von Heckeeren, an officer in the Horse Guards, began
openly to pay her attention. Pushkin and many of his friends received
anonymous letters maliciously hinting at DantÃ¨s success. DantÃ¨s''s
father, a dissipated old man, threw oil upon the flames. Meeting Madame
Pushkin in society, he did his best to make her quarrel with, and leave
her husband.

All this being repeated to Pushkin, greatly incensed him. He challenged
young Heckeeren, but the latter made an offer to Madame Pushkin''s
sister, and married her. This did little to mend matters. Pushkin
withdrew the challenge, but nursed his hatred for DantÃ¨s, and would not
receive him in his house.

Meanwhile the scandal grew, and the two Heckeerens continued their
persecution of Madame Pushkin. In society, DantÃ¨s was said to have
married the sister-in-law only to pay court to the wife. Pushkin,
always convinced of his wife''s innocence, showed for her the
tenderest consideration. He wrote, however, a very insulting letter
to old Heckeeren after which a duel between Pushkin and the son
became inevitable. It was fought on the banks of the Black Elver,
near the commandant of St. Petersburg''s summer residence. After it
DantÃ¨s Heckeeren, no longer able to remain in Russia, resigned his
commission and went to France, where he took up politics, and, as Baron
d''Heckeeren, was known as a senator in the Second Empire.

Pushkin was already wounded in the body when he fired at DantÃ¨s, and
hit the arm with which DantÃ¨s had guarded his breast.

"At six o''clock in the afternoon," writes Jukovsky, to the poet''s
father, "Alexander was brought home in a hopeless condition by
Lieutenant—Colonel Dansasse, the old schoolfellow who had acted as his
second. The butler carried him from the carriage into the house.

"It grieves you, my friend," said Pushkin, "to see me thus?" Then he
asked for clean linen. While he was undressing, Madame Pushkin, not
knowing what had happened,[Pg 10] wished to come in. But her husband called
out loudly, "N''entrez pas, il y a du monde chez moi." He was afraid
of alarming her. She was not admitted till he was already lying on the
couch.

"How happy I am," were his first words to her; "I am still alive, with
you by my side. Be comforted, you are not to blame. I know it was not
your fault." Meanwhile he did not let her know that his wound was
serious. Doctors were sent for—Scholtz and Sadler came. Pushkin asked
everyone to leave the room.

"I am in a bad way," he said, holding out his hand to Scholtz. After
examining him Sadler went off to fetch the necessary instruments. Left
alone with Scholtz, Pushkin inquired what he thought of his condition.

"It is my duty not to conceal from you even that," replied Scholtz.
"But we shall have the opinion of the other doctors who have been sent
for."

"Je vous remercie; vous avez agi en honnÃªte homme envers moi," said
Pushkin; adding after a pause, "Il faut que j''arrange ma maison."

Whether at that moment he was taking leave of animate or inanimate
friends I know not. After another pause, he said:

He asked for several. When Spaski (another doctor) came near and tried
to give him hope, Pushkin waved his hand in dissent, and from that
moment apparently ceased to think about himself. All his anxiety was
for his wife. By this time Prince and Princess Viasemsky, Turgueneff,
Count Vielgorsky, and myself had come. Princess Viasemsky was with the
wife, who, in terrible distress, glided like a spectre in and out of
the room where her husband lay. He was on a couch with his back to the
window and door, and unable to see her; though every time she entered
or merely stood in the doorway he was conscious of it.

"Is my wife here?" he asked; "take her away." He was afraid to let her
come near him lest she should be pained by his sufferings, though he
bore them with wonderful fortitude.

"What is my wife doing?" he asked once of Spaski. "She, poor thing, is
suffering innocently. Society will devour her!"

"I have been in thirty battles," said Dr. Arendt;[Pg 12] "and I have seen
many men die, but very few like him."

It was strange how in those last hours of his existence he seemed to
have changed. The storm which only a few hours before had raged so
fiercely in him had disappeared, leaving no trace behind. In the midst
of his suffering he recollected that he had the day before received an
invitation to attend the funeral of one of Gretcheff''s sons.

"If you see Gretcheff," he said to Spaski, "give him my kind regards,
and tell him how sincerely I sympathise with him in his affliction."

Asked to confess and to receive the sacrament, Pushkin assented gladly.
It was settled that the priest should be invited to come in the morning.

At midnight, Dr. Arendt came from the palace, where he had been to
inform the Emperor. His Majesty was at the theatre, and Arendt left
instructions that on his return the Emperor should be told what had
occurred. About midnight a mounted messenger arrived for Arendt. The
Emperor desired him to go at once to Pushkin, and read to him an
autograph letter which the messenger brought. He was then to hasten to
the palace and report upon Pushkin''s condition.

"I shall not go to bed; I shall wait up for you," wrote the Emperor
Nicholas. "And bring back my letter."

"If it will be the will of God that we shall not meet again, I send
you my pardon, and advise you to receive the last Christian rites. As
to your wife and children, they need cause you no anxiety. I take them
under my own protection."

The dying man immediately complied with the Emperor''s wish. A priest
was sent for from the nearest church. Pushkin confessed and received
the sacrament with great reverence. When Arendt read the Emperor''s
letter to him, Pushkin took hold of it and kissed it again and again.

"Give me the letter; I wish to die with it. The letter; where is the
letter?" he called out to Arendt, who was unable to leave it with him,
but tried to pacify him by promising to ask the Emperor''s permission to
bring it back again.

At five in the morning the patient''s anguish grew overpowering. The
sufferer began to groan, and Arendt was again sent for. But all efforts
to soothe the pain were futile. Had his wife heard his cries I am
sure she must have gone mad; she could never have borne the agony.
At the first great cry of pain the Princess Viasemsky, who was in
the room, rushed towards her, fearing the effect. But Madame Pushkin
lay motionless on a sofa close to the door which separated her from
her husband''s death-bed.[Pg 14] According to both Spaski and Arendt the
dying man stifled his cries at the moment of supreme anguish, and
only groaned in fear lest his wife might hear him and suffer. To the
last Pushkin''s mind remained clear and his memory fresh. Before the
next great paroxysm he asked for a paper in his own writing and had
it burnt. Then he dictated to Dansasse a list of some debts, but this
exertion prostrated him. When, between the paroxysms, some bread sop
was brought, he said to Spaski:

She entered, dropped on her knees by his side, and after lifting a
couple of spoonfuls to his mouth, leant her cheek against his. He
caressed and patted her head.

His calm expression of face and steady voice deceived the poor wife.
She came out of his room bright with hope. He asked for his children.
They were brought in half asleep: He blessed each one, making the sign
of the cross, and placing his hand on their head; then he motioned to
have them taken away. Afterwards he asked for his friends who were
present. I then approached and took his hand, which was already cold,
and inquired if I should give any message to the Emperor.

On the 29th of January, at three in the afternoon, after two days of
excruciating pain, Pushkin died. His death was regarded throughout
Russia as a public calamity. In St. Petersburg disturbances were
feared. It was thought that the people might lynch Heckeeren and his
son. A secret funeral was arranged. The body was carried into the
church late at night in the presence of some friends and relations;
and in the neighbouring courtyards piquets were stationed. After the
service the corpse was despatched to the province of Pskoff, and
was buried in the monastery of the Assumption at Sviatogorsk, near
Pushkin''s property at Michailovskoe. The Emperor gave about 150,000
roubles to pay his debts and to bring out a complete edition of his
works, besides granting a liberal pension to the widow.

On the 6th of June, 1880, was solemnly unveiled at Moscow a statue of
Pushkin, erected by voluntary subscriptions from all parts of Russia.

Pushkin was slim and of middle height; in childhood his hair was fair
and curly, but afterwards it turned dark brown. His eyes were light
blue, his smile satirical, but good-natured and pleasant; his clever,
expressive face bore evidence of his African descent, as did his quick
and[Pg 16] passionate nature. He was irritable, but kind and full of feeling;
his conversation sparkled with wit and good humour, and his memory was
prodigious. Pushkin, it has already been said, was of ancient lineage,
but no Russian is sufficiently well-born to marry into the Imperial
family, and when quite recently the Grand Duke Michael, grandson of
the Emperor Nicholas, married without permission the granddaughter
of Pushkin, he caused the liveliest dissatisfaction in the highest
quarters. The bride may console herself by the reflection that her
grandfather was, in the words of Gogol, "a rare phenomenon; a writer
who gave to his country poems so admirable that they attracted the
attention of the whole civilised world; a poet who won respect and
love for the language, for the living Russian types, the customs, and
national character of Russia. Such a writer is indeed a rarity."

There was a card party at the rooms of Narumoff, a lieutenant in the
Horse Guards. A long winter night had passed unnoticed, and it was five
o''clock in the morning when supper was served. The winners sat down to
table with an excellent appetite; the losers let their plates remain
empty before them. Little by little, however, with the assistance of
the champagne, the conversation became animated, and was shared by all.

"Oh, I lost, as usual. I really have no luck. I play mirandole. You
know that I keep cool. Nothing moves me; I never change my play, and
yet I always lose."

"Do you mean to say that all the evening you did not once back the red?
Your firmness of character surprises me."

"That fellow never made a bet or touched a card in his life, and yet he
watches us playing until five in the morning."

"It interests me," said Hermann; "but I am not disposed to risk the
necessary in view of the superfluous."

"Hermann is a German, and economical; that is the whole of the secret,"
cried Tomski. "But what is really astonishing is the Countess Anna
Fedotovna!"

"Yes," said Narumoff, "a woman of eighty, who never touches a card;
that is indeed something extraordinary!"

"Just listen. My grandmother, you know, some sixty years ago, went to
Paris, and became the rage there. People ran after her in the streets,
and called her the ''Muscovite Venus.'' Richelieu made love to her, and
my grandmother makes out that, by her rigorous demeanour, she almost
drove him to suicide. In those days women used to play at faro. One
evening at the court she lost, on parole, to the Duke of Orleans,[Pg 19]
a very considerable sum. When she got home, my grandmother removed
her beauty spots, took off her hoops, and in this tragic costume went
to my grandfather, told him of her misfortune, and asked him for the
money she had to pay. My grandfather, now no more, was, so to say, his
wife''s steward. He feared her like fire; but the sum she named made him
leap into the air. He[Pg 20] flew into a rage, made a brief calculation, and
proved to my grandmother that in six months she had got through half a
million rubles. He told her plainly that he had no villages to sell in
Paris, his domains being situated in the neighbourhood of Moscow and
of Saratoff; and finally refused point blank. You may imagine the fury
of my grandmother. She boxed his ears, and passed the night in another
room.

"The next day she returned to the charge. For the first time in her
life, she condescended to arguments and explanations. In vain did she
try to prove to her husband that there were debts and debts, and that
she could not treat a prince of the blood like her coachmaker.

"All this eloquence was lost. My grandfather was inflexible. My
grandmother did not know where to turn. Happily she was acquainted with
a man who was very celebrated at this time. You have heard of the Count
of St. Germain, about whom so many marvellous stories were told. You
know that he passed for a sort of Wandering Jew, and that he was said
to possess an elixir of life and the philosopher''s stone.

"Some people laughed at him as a charlatan. Casanova, in his memoirs,
says that he was a spy. However that may be, in spite of the mystery of
his life, St. Germain was much sought after in good society, and was
really an agreeable man.[Pg 21] Even to this day my grandmother has preserved
a genuine affection for him, and she becomes quite angry when anyone
speaks of him with disrespect.

"It occurred to her that he might be able to advance the sum of which
she was in need, and she wrote a note begging him to call. The old
magician came at once, and found her plunged in the deepest despair.
In two or three words she told him everything; related to him her
misfortune and the cruelty of her husband, adding that she had no hope
except in his friendship and his obliging disposition.

"''Madam,'' said St. Germain, after a few moments'' reflection, ''I could
easily advance you the money you want, but I am sure that you would
have no rest until you had repaid me, and I do not want to get you out
of one trouble in order to place you in another. There is another way
of settling the matter. You must regain the money you have lost.''

"''But, my dear friend,'' answered my grandmother, ''I have already told
you that I have nothing left.''

"He then communicated to her a secret which any of you would, I am
sure, give a good deal to possess."

All the young officers gave their full attention. Tomski stopped to
light his Turkish pipe, swallowed a mouthful of smoke, and then went on.

"That very evening my grandmother went to Versailles to play at the
Queen''s table. The Duke of Orleans held the bank. My grandmother
invented a little story by way of excuse for not having paid her debt,
and then sat down at the table, and began to stake. She took three
cards. She won with the first; doubled her stake on the second, and won
again; doubled on the third, and still won."

"And you mean to say," exclaimed Narumoff, "that you have a grandmother
who knows the names of three winning cards, and you have never made her
tell them to you?"

"That is the very deuce of it," answered Tomski. "She had three sons,
of whom my father was one; all three were determined gamblers, and not
one of them was able to extract her secret from her, though it would
have been of immense advantage to them, and to me also. Listen to what
my uncle told me about it, Count Ivan Ilitch, and he told me on his
word of honour.

"Tchaplitzki—the one you remember who died[Pg 23] in poverty after devouring
millions—lost one day, when he was a young man, to Zoritch about three
hundred thousand roubles. He was in despair. My grandmother, who had no
mercy for the extravagance of young men, made an exception—I do not
know why—in favour of Tchaplitzki. She gave him three cards, telling
him to play them one after the other, and exacting from him at the same
time his word of honour that he would never afterwards touch a card as
long as he lived. Accordingly Tchaplitzki went to Zoritch and asked for
his revenge. On the first card he staked fifty thousands rubles. He
won, doubled the stake, and won again. Continuing his system he ended
by gaining more than he had lost.

The old Countess Anna Fedotovna was in her dressing-room, seated before
her looking-glass. Three maids were in attendance. One held her pot of
rouge, another a box of black pins, a third[Pg 24] an enormous lace cap, with
flaming ribbons. The Countess had no longer the slightest pretence to
beauty, but she preserved all the habits of her[Pg 25] youth. She dressed in
the style of fifty years before, and gave as much time and attention to
her toilet as a fashionable beauty of the last century. Her companion
was working at a frame in a corner of the window.

"Good morning, grandmother," said the young officer, as he entered the
dressing-room. "Good morning, Mademoiselle Lise. Grandmother, I have
come to ask you a favour."

"I want to introduce to you one of my friends, and to ask you to give
him an invitation to your ball."

"Certainly. It was delightful! We danced until five o''clock in the
morning. Mademoiselle Eletzki was charming."

"My dear nephew, you are really not difficult to please. As to beauty,
you should have seen her grandmother, the Princess Daria Petrovna. But
she must be very old the Princess Daria Petrovna!"

The young lady who acted as companion raised her head and made a sign
to the officer, who then remembered that it was an understood thing to
conceal from the Princess the death of any of her contemporaries. He
bit his lips. The Countess,[Pg 26] however, was not in any way disturbed on
hearing that her old friend was no longer in this world.

"Dead!" she said, "and I never knew it! We were maids of honour in
the same year, and when we were presented, the Empress''"—and the
old Countess related for the hundredth time an anecdote of her young
days. "Paul," she said, as she finished her story, "help me to get up.
Lisaveta, where is my snuff-box?"

And, followed by the three maids, she went behind a great screen to
finish her toilet. Tomski was now alone with the companion.

"Paul," cried the Countess from behind the screen, "send me a new
novel; no matter what. Only see that it is not in the style of the
present day."

"A novel in which the hero strangles neither his father nor his mother,
and in which no one[Pg 27][Pg 28] gets drowned. Nothing frightens me so much as the
idea of getting drowned."

"I will not forget, grandmother. I am in a great hurry. Good-bye,
Lisaveta. What made you fancy Narumoff was in the Engineers?" and
Tomski took his departure.

Lisaveta, left alone, took out her embroidery, and sat down close to
the window. Immediately afterwards, in the street, at the corner of a
neighbouring house, appeared a young officer. The sight of him made the
companion blush to her ears. She lowered her head, and almost concealed
it in the canvas. At this moment the Counters returned, fully dressed.

"Louder," said the Countess. "What is the matter with you? Have you a
cold? Wait a moment; bring me that stool. A little closer; that will
do."

"Throw that stupid book away," said the Countess. "What nonsense! Send
it back to Prince Paul, and tell him I am much obliged to him; and the
carriage, is it never coming?

Lisaveta ran to her room. She had scarcely been there two minutes when
the Countess rang with all her might. Her maids rushed in at one door
and her valet at the other.

"You do not seem to hear me when I ring," she cried. "Go and tell
Lisaveta that I am waiting for her."

"At last, miss," cried the Countess. "But what is that you have got on?
and why? For whom are you dressing? What sort of weather is it? Quite
stormy, I believe."

"What do you know about it? Open the ventilator. Just what I told you!
A frightful wind, and as icy as can be. Unharness the horses. Lisaveta,
my child, we will not go out to-day. It was scarcely worth while to
dress so much."

Lisaveta Ivanovna was, in fact, a most unhappy creature. "The bread of
the stranger is bitter," says Dante, "and his staircase hard to climb."
But who can tell the torments of a poor little companion attached to
an old lady of quality? The Countess had all the caprices of a woman
spoilt by the world. She was avaricious and egotistical, and thought
all the more of herself now that she had ceased to play an active part
in society. She never missed a ball, and she dressed and painted in the
style of a bygone age. She remained in a corner of the room, where she
seemed to have been placed expressly[Pg 31] to serve as a scarecrow. Every
one on coming in went to her and made her a low bow, but this ceremony
once at an end no one spoke a word to her. She received the whole city
at her house, observing the strictest etiquette, and never failing to
give to everyone his or her proper name. Her innumerable servants,
growing pale and fat in the ante-chamber, did absolutely as they liked,
so that that the house was pillaged as if its owner were really dead.
Lisaveta passed her life in continual torture. If she made tea she was
reproached with wasting the sugar. If she read a novel to the Countess
she was held responsible for all the absurdities of the author. If she
went out with the noble lady for a walk or drive, it was she who was to
blame if the weather was bad or the pavement muddy. Her salary, more
than modest, was never punctually paid, and she was expected to dress
"like every one else," that is to say, like very few people indeed.
When she went into society her position was sad. Everyone knew her; no
one paid her any attention. At a ball she sometimes danced, but only
when a vis-Ã -vis was wanted. Women would come up to her, take her by
the arm, and lead her out of the room if their dress required attending
to. She had her portion of self-respect, and felt deeply the misery
of her position. She looked with impatience for a liberator to break
her chain. But the young[Pg 32] men, prudent in the midst of their affected
giddiness, took care not to honour her with their attentions, though
Lisaveta Ivanovna was a hundred times prettier than the shameless or
stupid girls whom they surrounded with their homage. More than once
she slunk away from the splendour of the drawing-room to shut herself
up alone in her little bed-room, furnished with an old screen and a
pieced carpet, a chest of drawers, a small looking-glass, and a wooden
bedstead. There she shed tears at her ease by the light of a tallow
candle in a tin candlestick.

One morning—it was two days after the party at Narumoff''s, and a
week before the scene we have just sketched—Lisaveta was sitting at
her embroidery before the window, when, looking carelessly into the
street, she saw an officer, in the uniform of the Engineers, standing
motionless with his eyes fixed upon her. She lowered her head, and
applied herself to her work more attentively than ever. Five minutes
afterwards she locked mechanically into the street, and the officer was
still in the same place. Not being in the habit of exchanging glances
with young men who passed by her window, she remained with her eyes
fixed on her work for nearly two hours, until she was told that lunch
was ready. She got up to put her embroidery away, and[Pg 33] while doing so,
looked into the street, and saw the officer still in the same place.
This seemed to her very strange. After lunch she went to the window
with a certain emotion, but the officer of Engineers was no longer in
the street.

She thought no more of him. But two days afterwards, just as she was
getting into the carriage with the Countess, she saw him once more,
standing straight before the door. His face was half concealed by a fur
collar, but his black eyes sparkled beneath his helmet. Lisaveta was
afraid, without knowing why, and she trembled as she took her seat in
the carriage.

On returning home, she rushed with a beating heart towards the
window. The officer was in his habitual place, with his eyes fixed
ardently upon her. She at once withdrew, burning at the same time with
curiosity, and moved by a strange feeling which she now experienced for
the first time.

No day now passed but the young officer showed himself beneath the
window. Before long a dumb acquaintance was established between them.
Sitting at her work she felt his presence, and when she raised her head
she looked at him for a long time every day. The young man seemed full
of gratitude for these innocent favours.

She observed, with the deep and rapid perceptions of youth, that a
sudden redness covered the officer''s pale cheeks as soon as their eyes
met. After about a week she would smile at seeing him for the first
time.

When Tomski asked his grandmother''s permission to present one of his
friends, the heart of the poor young girl beat strongly, and when she[Pg 35]
heard that it was Narumoff, she bitterly repented having compromised
her secret by letting it out to a giddy young man like Paul.

Hermann was the son of a German settled in Russia, from whom he had
inherited a small sum of money. Firmly resolved to preserve his
independence, he had made it a principle not to touch his private
income. He lived on his pay, and did not allow himself the slightest
luxury. He was not very communicative; and his reserve rendered it
difficult for his comrades to amuse themselves at his expense.

Under an assumed calm he concealed strong passions and a
highly-imaginative disposition. But he was always master of himself,
and kept himself free from the ordinary faults of young men. Thus, a
gambler by temperament, he never touched a card, feeling, as he himself
said, that his position did not allow him to "risk the necessary in
view of the superfluous." Yet he would pass entire nights before a
card-table, watching with feverish anxiety the rapid changes of the
game. The anecdote of Count St. Germaines three cards had struck his
imagination, and he did nothing but think of it all that night.

"If," he said to himself next day as he was walking along the streets
of St. Petersburg, "if she would only tell me her secret—if she would
only name the three winning cards! I must get[Pg 36] presented to her, that I
may pay my court and gain her confidence. Yes! And she is eighty-seven!
She may die this week—to-morrow perhaps. But after all, is there a
word of truth in the story? No! Economy, Temperance, Work; these are
my three winning cards. With them I can double my capital; increase it
tenfold. They alone can ensure my independence and prosperity."

Dreaming in this way as he walked along, his attention was attracted by
a house built in an antiquated style of architecture. The street was
full of carriages, which passed one by one before the old house, now
brilliantly illuminated. As the people stepped out of the carriages
Hermann saw now the little feet of a young woman, now the military boot
of a general. Then came a clocked stocking; then, again, a diplomatic
pump. Fur-lined cloaks and coats passed in procession before a gigantic
porter.

Hermann started. The story of the three cards came once more upon his
imagination. He walked to and fro before the house, thinking of the
woman to whom it belonged, of her wealth and her mysterious power. At
last he returned to his den. But for some time he could not get to
sleep; and[Pg 37] when at last sleep came upon him, he saw, dancing before
his eyes, cards, a green table, and heaps of rubles and bank-notes.
He saw himself doubling stake after stake, always winning, and then
filling his pockets with piles of coin, and stuffing his pocket-book
with countless bank-notes. When he awoke, he sighed to find that his
treasures were but creations of a disordered fancy; and, to drive such
thoughts from him, he went out for a walk. But he had not gone far when
he found himself once more before the house of the Countess. He seemed
to have been attracted there by some irresistible force. He stopped,
and looked up at the windows. There he saw a girl''s head with beautiful
black hair, leaning gracefully over a book or an embroidery-frame. The
head was lifted, and he saw a fresh complexion and black eyes.

Lisaveta was just taking off her shawl and her bonnet, when the
Countess sent for her. She had had the horses put in again.

While two footmen were helping the old lady into the carriage, Lisaveta
saw the young officer[Pg 38] at her side. She felt him take her by the hand,
lost her head, and found, when the young officer had walked away, that
he had left a paper between her fingers. She hastily concealed it in
her glove.

During the whole of the drive she neither saw nor heard. When they were
in the carriage together the Countess was in the habit of questioning
Lisaveta perpetually.

"Who is that man that bowed to us? What is the name of this bridge?
What is there written on that signboard?"

"What is the matter with you, my child?" she asked. "What are you
thinking about? Or do you really not hear me? I speak distinctly
enough, however, and I have not yet lost my head, have I?"

Lisaveta was not listening. When she got back to the house, she ran to
her room, locked the door, and took the scrap of paper from her glove.
It was not sealed, and it was impossible, therefore, not to read it.
The letter contained protestations of love. It was tender, respectful,
and translated word for word from a German novel. But Lisaveta did
not read German, and she was quite delighted. She was, however,
much embarrassed. For the first time in her life she had a secret.[Pg 39]
Correspond with a young man! The idea of such a thing frightened her.
How imprudent she had been! She had reproached herself, but knew not
now what to do.

Cease to do her work at the window, and by persistent coldness try and
disgust the young officer? Send him back his letter? Answer him in
a firm, decided manner? What line of conduct was she to pursue? She
had no friend, no one to advise her. She at last decided to send an
answer. She sat down at her little table, took pen and paper, and began
to think. More than once she wrote a sentence and then tore up the
paper. What she had written seemed too stiff, or else it was wanting in
reserve. At last, after much trouble, she succeeded in composing a few
lines which seemed to meet the case.

"I believe," she wrote, "that your intentions are those of an
honourable man, and that you would not wish to offend me by any
thoughtless conduct. But you must understand that our acquaintance
cannot begin in this way. I return your letter, and trust that you will
not give me cause to regret my imprudence."

Next day, as soon as Hermann made his appearance, Lisaveta left her
embroidery, and went into the drawing-room, opened the ventilator, and
threw her letter into the street, making sure that the young officer
would pick it up.

Hermann, in fact, at once saw it, and picking it up, entered a
confectioner''s shop in order to read it. Finding nothing discouraging
in it, he went home sufficiently pleased with the first step in his
love adventure.

Some days afterwards, a young person with lively eyes called to see
Miss Lisaveta, on the part of a milliner. Lisaveta wondered what she
could want, and suspected, as she received her, some secret intention.
She was much surprised, however, when she recognised, on the letter
that was now handed to her, the writing of Hermann.

"Impossible!" she cried, alarmed both at the boldness of the request,
and at the manner in which it was made. "This letter is not for me,"
she repeated; and she tore it into a hundred pieces.

"If the letter was not for you, why did you tear it up? You should have
given it me back, that I might take it to the person it was meant for."

"But bring me no more letters, and tell the person who gave you this
one that he ought to blush for his conduct."

Hermann, however, was not a man to give up what he had once undertaken.
Every day Lisaveta received a fresh letter from him, sent now in one
way, now in another. They were no longer translated from the German.
Hermann wrote under the influence of a commanding passion, and spoke a
language which was his own. Lisaveta could not hold out against such
torrents of eloquence. She received the letters, kept them, and at last
answered them. Every day her answers were longer and more affectionate,
until at last she threw out of the window a letter couched as follows:—

"This evening there is a ball at the Embassy. The Countess will be
there. We shall remain until two in the morning. You may manage to
see me alone. As soon as the Countess leaves home, that is to say
towards eleven o''clock, the servants are sure to go out, and there
will be no one left but the porter, who will be sure to be asleep in
his box. Enter as soon as it strikes eleven, and go upstairs as fast
as possible. If you find anyone in the ante-chamber, ask whether the
Countess is at home, and you will be told that she is out, and, in
that case, you must resign yourself, and go away. In all probability,
however, you will meet no one. The Countess''s women are together in a
distant room. When you are once in the ante-chamber, turn to the left,
and[Pg 43] walk straight on, until you reach the Countess''s bedroom. There,
behind a large screen, you will see two doors. The one on the right
leads to a dark room. The one on the left leads to a corridor, at the
end of which is a little winding staircase, which leads to my parlour."

At, ten o''clock Hermann was already on duty before the Countess''s door.
It was a frightful night. The winds had been unloosed, and the snow was
falling in large flakes; the lamps gave an uncertain light; the streets
were deserted; from time to time passed a sledge, drawn by a wretched
hack, on the look-out for a fare. Covered by a thick overcoat, Hermann
felt neither the wind nor the snow. At last the Countesses carriage
drew up. He saw two huge footmen come forward and take beneath the arms
a dilapidated spectre, and place it on the cushions well wrapped up in
an enormous fur cloak. Immediately afterwards, in a cloak of lighter
make, her head crowned with natural flowers, came Lisaveta, who sprang
into the carriage like a dart. The door was closed, and the carriage
rolled on softly over the snow.

The porter closed the street door, and soon the windows of the first
floor became dark. Silence reigned throughout the house. Hermann walked
backwards and forwards; then coming to a lamp he looked at his watch.
It was twenty minutes to eleven. Leaning against the lamp-post, his
eyes[Pg 44] fixed on the long hand of his watch, he counted impatiently the
minutes which had yet to pass. At eleven o''clock precisely Hermann
walked up the steps, pushed open the street door, and went into the
vestibule, which was well lighted. As it happened the porter was not
there. With a firm and rapid step he rushed up the staircase and
reached the ante-chamber. There, before a lamp, a footman was sleeping,
stretched out in a dirty greasy dressing-gown. Hermann passed quickly
before him and crossed the dining-room and the drawing-room, where
there was no light. But the lamp of the ante-chamber helped him to see.
At last he reached the Countess''s bedroom. Before a screen covered with
old icons (sacred pictures) a golden lamp was burning. Gilt arm-chairs,
sofas of faded colours, furnished with soft cushions, were arranged
symmetrically along the walls, which were hung with China silk. He
saw two large portraits painted by Madame le Brun. One represented a
man of forty, stout and full coloured, dressed in a light green coat,
with a decoration on his breast. The second portrait was that of an
elegant young woman, with an aquiline nose, powdered hair rolled back
on the temples, and with a rose over her ear. Everywhere might be seen
shepherds and shepherdesses in Dresden china, with vases of all shapes,
clocks by Leroy, work-baskets, fans, and all the thousand playthings[Pg 45]
for the use of ladies of fashion, discovered in the last century, at
the time of Montgolfier''s balloons and Mesmer''s animal magnetism.

Hermann passed behind the screen, which concealed a little iron
bedstead. He saw the two doors; the one on the right leading to the
dark room, the one on the left to the corridor. He opened the latter,
saw the staircase which led to the poor little companion''s parlour, and
then, closing this door, went into the dark room.

The time passed slowly. Everything was quiet in the house. The
drawing-room clock struck midnight, and again there was silence.
Hermann was standing up, leaning against the stove, in which there was
no fire. He was calm; but his heart beat with quick pulsations, like
that of a man determined to brave all dangers he might have to meet,
because he knows them to be inevitable. He heard one o''clock strike;
then two; and soon afterwards the distant roll of a carriage. He now,
in spite of himself, experienced some emotion. The carriage approached
rapidly and stopped. There was at once a great noise of servants
running about the staircases, and a confusion of voices. Suddenly the
rooms were all lit up, and the Countess''s three antiquated maids came
at once into the bed-room. At last appeared the Countess herself.

The walking mummy sank into a large Voltaire arm-chair. Hermann looked
through the crack in the door; he saw Lisaveta pass close to him, and
heard her hurried step as she went up the[Pg 47] little winding staircase.
For a moment he felt something like remorse; but it soon passed off,
and his heart was once more of stone.

The Countess began to undress before a looking-glass. Her head-dress of
roses was taken off, and her powdered wig separated from her own hair,[Pg 48]
which was very short and quite white. Pins fell in showers around
her. At last she was in her dressing-gown and night cap, and in this
costume, more suitable to her age, was less hideous than before.

Like most old people, the Countess was tormented by sleeplessness. She
had her armchair rolled towards one of the windows, and told her maids
to leave her. The lights were put out, and the room was lighted only by
the lamp which burned before the holy images. The Countess, sallow and
wrinkled, balanced herself gently from right to left. In her dull eyes
could be read an utter absence of thought; and as she moved from side
to side, one might have said that she did so not by any action of the
will, but through some secret mechanism.

Suddenly this death''s-head assumed a new expression; the lips ceased to
tremble, and the eyes became alive. A strange man had appeared before
the Countess!

"Do not be alarmed, madam," said Hermann, in a low voice, but very
distinctly. "For the love of Heaven, do not be alarmed. I do not wish
to do you the slightest harm; on the contrary, I come to implore a
favour of you."

The old woman looked at him in silence, as if she did not understand.
Thinking she was deaf,[Pg 49] he leaned towards her ear and repeated what he
had said; but the Countess still remained silent.

"You can ensure the happiness of my whole life, and without its costing
you a farthing. I know that you can name to me three cards——"

"No, madam," replied Hermann in an angry tone. "Remember Tchaplitzki,
and how you enabled him to win."

The Countess was agitated. For a moment her features expressed strong
emotion; but they soon resumed their former dulness.

The Countess remained silent. "Why keep this secret for your
great-grandchildren," he continued. "They are rich enough without;
they do not know the value of money. Of what profit would your three
cards be to them? They are debauchees. The man who cannot keep his
inheritance will die in want, though he had the science of demons at
his command. I am a steady man. I know the value of money. Your three
cards will not be lost upon me. Come!"

He stopped tremblingly, awaiting a reply. The[Pg 50] Countess did not utter a
word. Hermann went upon his knees.

"If your heart has ever known the passion of love; if you can remember
its sweet ecstasies; if you Pave ever been touched by the cry of a
newborn babe; if any human feeling has ever caused your heart to beat,
I entreat you by the love of a husband, a lover, a mother, by all
that is sacred in life, not to reject my prayer. Tell me your secret!
Reflect! You are old; you Pave not long to live! Remember that the
happiness of a man is in your hands; that not only myself, but my
children and my grandchildren will bless your memory as a saint."

At the sight of the pistol the Countess for the second time showed
agitation. Her head shook violently she stretched out her hands as if
to put the weapon aside. Then suddenly she fell back motionless.

"Come, don''t be childish!" said Hermann. "I adjure you for the last
time; will you name the three cards?"

Lisaveta was sitting in her room, still in her ball dress, lost in
the deepest meditation. On her return to the house, she had sent away
her maid, and had gone upstairs to her room, trembling at the idea of
finding Hermann there; desiring, indeed, not to find him. One glance
showed her that he was not there, and she gave thanks to Providence
that he had missed the appointment. She sat down pensively, without
thinking of taking off her cloak, and allowed to pass through her
memory all the circumstances of the intrigue which had begun such a
short time back, and had already advanced so far. Scarcely three weeks
had passed since she had first seen the young officer from her window,
and already she had written to him, and he had succeeded in inducing
her to make an appointment. She knew his name, and that was all. She
had received a quantity of letters from him, but he had never spoken to
her; she did not know the sound of his voice, and until that evening,
strangely enough, she had never heard him spoken of.

But that very evening Tomski, fancying he had noticed that the young
Princess Pauline, to whom he had been paying assiduous court, was
flirting,[Pg 52] contrary to her custom, with, another man, had wished to
revenge himself by making a show of indifference. With this noble
object he had invited Lisaveta to take part in an interminable mazurka;
but he teased her immensely about her partiality for Engineer officers,
and pretending all the time to know much more than he really did,
hazarded purely in fun a few guesses which were so happy that Lisaveta
thought her secret must have been discovered.

"But who tells you all this?" she said with a smile. "A friend of the
very officer you know, a most original man."

"Hermann is a hero of romance," continued Tomski. "He has the profile
of Napoleon, and the soul of Mephistopheles. I believe he has at least
three crimes on his conscience.... But how pale you are!"

"Hermann is very much displeased with his friend, with the Engineer
officer who has made your acquaintance. He says that in his place he
would behave very differently. But I am quite sure that Hermann himself
has designs upon you. At least, he seems to listen with remarkable
interest to all that his friend tells him about you."

At this moment three ladies came forward according to the custom of
the mazurka, and asked Tomski to choose between "forgetfulness and
regret."[1]

The lady who, in virtue of the infidelities permitted by the mazurka,
had just been chosen by Tom ski, was the Princess Pauline. During the
rapid evolutions which the figure obliged them to make, there was a
grand explanation between them, until at last he conducted her to a
chair, and returned to his partner.

But Tomski could now think no more, either of Hermann or Lisaveta, and
he tried in vain to resume the conversation. But the mazurka was coming
to an end, and immediately afterwards the old Countess rose to go.

Tomski''s mysterious phrases were nothing more than the usual platitudes
of the mazurka, but they had made a deep impression upon the heart of
the poor little companion. The portrait sketched by Tomski had struck
her as very exact; and with her romantic ideas, she saw in the rather
ordinary countenance of her adorer something to fear and admire. She
was now sitting down with her cloak off, with bare shoulders; her head,
crowned with flowers, falling forward from fatigue, when suddenly the
door opened and Hermann entered. She shuddered.

Lisaveta looked at him in consternation, and remembered Tomski''s words:
"He has at least three crimes on his conscience."

So those letters so full of passion, those burning expressions, this
daring obstinate pursuit—all this had been inspired by anything but
love! Money alone had inflamed the man''s soul. She, who had nothing
but a heart to offer, how could she make him happy? Poor child! she
had been the blind instrument of a robber, of the murderer of her old
benefactress. She wept bitterly in the agony of her repentance. Hermann
watched her in silence; but neither the tears of the unhappy girl, nor
her beauty, rendered more touching by her grief, could move his heart
of iron. He had no remorse in thinking of the Countess''s death. One
sole thought distressed him—the irreparable loss of the secret which
was to have made his fortune.

They remained for some time without speaking, without looking at one
another. The day was breaking, and Lisaveta put out her candle. She
wiped her eyes, drowned in tears, and raised them towards Hermann. He
was standing close to the window, his arms crossed, with a frown on
his forehead. In this attitude he reminded her involuntarily of the
portrait of Napoleon. The resemblance overwhelmed her.

"How am I to get you away?" she said at last. "I thought you might go
out by the back stairs. But it would be necessary to go through the
Countess''s bedroom, and I am too frightened."

She went to a drawer, took out a key, which she handed to Hermann, and
gave him the necessary instructions. Hermann took her icy hand, kissed
her on the forehead, and departed.

He went down the staircase, and entered the Countess''s bedroom. She was
seated quite stiff in her armchair; but her features were in no way
contracted. He stopped for a moment, and gazed into her face as if to
make sure of the terrible reality. Then he entered the dark room, and,
feeling behind the tapestry, found the little door[Pg 57] which, opened on
to a staircase. As he went down it, strange ideas came into his head.
"Going down this staircase," he said to himself, "some sixty years ago,
at about this time, may have been seen some man in an embroidered coat
with powdered wig, pressing to his breast a cocked hat: some gallant
who has long been buried; and now the heart of his aged mistress has
ceased to beat."

At the end of the staircase he found another door, which his key
opened, and he found himself in the corridor which led to the street.

[1] The figures and fashions of the mazurka are reproduced in
the cotillon of Western Europe.—TRANSLATOR.

Three days after this fatal night, at nine o''clock in the morning,
Hermann entered the convent where the last respects were to be paid
to the mortal remains of the old Countess. He felt no remorse, though
he could not deny to himself that he was the poor woman''s assassin.
Having no religion, he was, as usual in such cases, very superstitious;
believing that the dead Countess might exercise a malignant influence
on his life, he[Pg 58] thought to appease her spirit by attending her funeral.

The church was full of people, and it was difficult to get in. The
body had been placed on a rich catafalque, beneath a canopy of velvet.
The Countess was reposing in an open coffin, her hands joined on her
breast, with a dress of white satin, and head-dress of lace. Around
the catafalque the family was assembled, the servants in black caftans
with a knot of ribbons on the shoulder, exhibiting the colours of
the Countesses coat of arms. Each of them held a wax candle in his
hand. The relations, in deep mourning—children grandchildren, and
great-grandchildren—were all present; but none of them wept.

To have shed tears would have looked like affectation. The Countess was
so old that her death could have taken no one by surprise, and she had
long been looked upon as already out of the world. The funeral sermon
was delivered by a celebrated preacher. In a few simple, touching
phrases he painted the final departure of the just, who had passed
long years of contrite preparation, for a Christian end. The service
concluded in the midst of respectful silence. Then the relations went
towards the defunct to take a last farewell After them, in a long
procession, all who had been, invited to the ceremony bowed, for the
last time, to her who for so many years had been a scarecrow[Pg 59] at their
entertainments. Finally came the Countess''s household; among them was
remarked an old governess, of the same age as the deceased, supported
by two woman. She had not strength enough to kneel down, but tears
flowed from her eyes, as she kissed the hand of her old mistress.

In his turn Hermann advanced towards the coffin. He knelt down for a
moment on the flagstones, which were strewed with branches of yew. Then
he rose, as pale as death, and walked up the steps of the catafalque.
He bowed his head. But suddenly the dead woman seemed to be staring at
him; and with a mocking look she opened and shut one eye. Hermann by
a sudden movement started and fell backwards. Several persons hurried
towards him. At the same moment, close to the church door, Lisaveta
fainted.

Throughout the day Hermann suffered from a strange indisposition. In a
quiet restaurant, where he took his meals, he, contrary to his habit,
drank a great deal of wine, with the object of stupefying himself. But
the wine had no effect but to excite his imagination, and give fresh
activity to the ideas with which he was preoccupied.

He went home earlier than usual, lay down with his clothes on upon
the bed, and fell into a leaden sleep. When he woke up it was night,[Pg 60]
and the room was lighted up by the rays of the moon. He looked at his
watch; it was a quarter to three. He could sleep no more. He sat up on
the bed and thought of the old Countess. At this[Pg 61] moment someone in
the street passed the window, looked into the room, and then went on.
Hermann scarcely noticed it; but in another minute he heard the door of
the ante-chamber open. He thought, that his orderly, drunk as usual,
was returning from some nocturnal excursion; but the step was one to
which he was not accustomed. Somebody seemed to be softly walking over
the floor in slippers.

The door opened, and a woman, dressed entirely in white, entered the
bedroom. Hermann thought it must be his old nurse, and he asked himself
what she could want at that time of night.

But the woman in white, crossing the room with a rapid step, was now at
the foot of his bed, and Hermann recognised the Countess.

"I come to you against my wish," she said in a firm voice. "I am forced
to grant your prayer. Three, seven, ace, will win, if played one after
the other; but you must not play more than one card in twenty-four
hours, and afterwards, as long as you live, you must never touch a
card again. I forgive you my death on condition of your marrying my
companion, Lisaveta Ivanovna."

With these words she walked towards the door, and gliding with her
slippers over the floor, disappeared. Hermann heard the door of the
ante-chamber open, and soon afterwards saw a white figure pass along
the street. It stopped[Pg 62] for a moment before his window, as if to look
at him.

Hermann remained, for some time astounded. Then he got up and went into
the next room. His orderly, drunk as usual, was asleep on the floor. He
had much difficulty in waking him, and then could not obtain from him
the least explanation. The door of the ante-chamber was locked.

Two fixed ideas can no more exist together in the moral world, than in
the physical two bodies can occupy the same place at the same time; and
"Three, seven, ace" soon drove away Hermann''s recollection of the old
Countess''s last moments. "Three, seven, ace" were now in his head to
the exclusion of everything else.

They followed him in his dreams, and appeared to him under strange
forms. Threes seemed to be spread before him like magnolias, sevens
took the form of Gothic doors, and aces became gigantic spiders.

His thoughts concentrated themselves on one single point. How was he
to profit by the secret so dearly purchased? What if he applied for
leave to travel? At Paris, he said to himself, he would find some
gambling-house where, with his three cards, he could at once make his
fortune.

Chance soon came to his assistance. There was at Moscow a society of
rich gamblers, presided over by the celebrated Tchekalinski, who had
passed all his life playing at cards, and had amassed millions. For
while he lost silver only, he gained bank-notes. His magnificent house,
his excellent kitchen, his cordial manners, had brought him numerous
friends and secured for him general esteem.

When he came to St. Petersburg, the young men of the capital filled
his rooms, forsaking balls for his card-parties, and preferring the
emotions of gambling to the fascinations of flirting. Hermann was taken
to Tchekalinski by Narumoff. They passed through a long suite of rooms,
full of the most attentive, obsequious servants. The place was crowded.
Generals and high officials were playing at whist; young men were
stretched out on the sofas, eating ices and smoking long pipes. In the
principal room at the head of a long table, around which were assembled
a score of players, the master of the house held a faro bank.

He was a man of about sixty, with a sweet and noble expression of
face, and hair white as snow. On his full, florid countenance might
be read good humour and benevolence. His eyes shone with a perpetual
smile. Narumoff introduced Hermann. Tchekalinski took him by the hand,
told him that he was glad to see him, that no one stood on ceremony
in his house; and then went on dealing. The deal occupied some time,
and stakes were made on more than thirty cards. Tchekalinski waited
patiently to allow the winners time to double their stakes, paid what
he had lost, listened politely to all observations, and, more politely
still, put straight the corners of cards, when in a fit of absence some
one had taken the liberty of turning them down. At last when the game
was at an end, Tchekalinski collected the cards, shuffled them again,
had them cut, and then dealt anew.

"Will you allow me to take a card?" said Hermann, stretching out his
arm above a fat man who occupied nearly the whole of one side of the
table. Tchekalinski, with a gracious smile, bowed in consent. Naroumoff
complimented Hermann, with a laugh, on the cessation of the austerity
by which his conduct had hitherto been marked, and wished him all kinds
of happiness on the occasion of his first appearance in the character
of a gambler.

"Allow me to point out to you," said Tchekalinski, with his eternal
smile, "that you are playing rather high. We never put down here, as a
first stake, more than a hundred and seventy-five rubles."

Tchekalinski bowed in token of acceptation. "I only wish to point out
to you," he said, "that although I am perfectly sure of my friends,
I can only play against ready money. I am quite convinced that your
word is as good as gold; but to keep up the rules of the game, and to
facilitate calculations, I should be obliged to you if you would put
the money on your card."

Hermann took a bank-note from his pocket and handed it to Tchekalinski,
who, after examining it with a glance, placed it on Hermann''s card.

A murmur of astonishment ran through the assembly. The banker knitted
his eyebrows, but speedily his face resumed its everlasting smile.

Tchekalinski took a bundle of bank-notes from his pocket-book, and
paid. Hermann pocketed His winnings and left the table.

The next evening he returned to the house. Tchekalinski again held the
bank. Hermann went to the table, and this time the players hastened to
make room for him. Tchekalinski received him with a most gracious bow.
Hermann waited, took a card, and staked on it his forty-seven thousand
roubles, together with the like sum which he had gained the evening
before.

There was a general exclamation. Tchekalinski was evidently ill at
ease, but he counted out the ninety-four thousand roubles to Hermann,
who took them in the calmest manner, rose from, the table, and went
away.

The next evening, at the accustomed hour, he[Pg 67][Pg 68] again appeared. Everyone
was expecting him. Generals and high officials had left their whist to
watch this extraordinary play. The young officers had quitted their
sofas, and even the servants of the house pressed round the table.

When Hermann took his seat, the other players ceased to stake, so
impatient were they to see him have it out with the banker, who, still
smiling, watched the approach of his antagonist and prepared to meet
him. Each of them untied at the same time a pack of cards. Tchekalinski
shuffled, and Hermann cut. Then the latter took up a card and covered
it with a heap of banknotes. It was like the preliminaries of a duel. A
deep silence reigned through the room.

Tchekalinski took up the cards with trembling hands and dealt. On one
side he put down a queen and on the other side an ace.

Hermann looked. Instead of ace, he saw a queen of spades before him. He
could not trust his eyes! And now as he gazed, in fascination, on the
fatal card, he fancied that he saw the queen of spades open and then
close her eye, while at the same time she gave a mocking smile. He felt
a thrill of nameless horror. The queen of spades resembled the dead
Countess!

Hermann is now at the Obukhoff Asylum, room No. 17 a hopeless madman!
He answers no questions which we put to him. Only he mumbles to himself
without cessation, "Three, seven, ace; three, seven, queen!"

We were stationed at the little village of Z. The life of an officer
in the army is well known. Drill and the riding school in the morning;
dinner with the colonel or at the Jewish restaurant; and in the evening
punch and cards.

At Z. nobody kept open house, and there was no girl that anyone could
think of marrying. We used to meet at each other''s rooms, where we
never saw anything but one another''s uniforms. There was only one man
among us who did not belong to the regiment. He was about thirty-five,
and, of course, we looked upon him as an old fellow. He had the
advantage of experience, and his habitual gloom, stern features, and
his sharp tongue gave him great influence over his juniors. He was
surrounded by a certain mystery. His looks were Russian, but his name
was foreign. He had served in the Hussars, and with credit.[Pg 71] No one
knew what had induced him to retire and settle in this out of the way
little village, where he lived in mingled poverty and extravagance. He
always went on foot, and wore a shabby black coat. But he was always
ready to receive any of our officers; and though his dinners, cooked by
a retired soldier, never consisted of more than two or three dishes,
champagne flowed at them like water. His income, or how he got it, no
one knew, and no one ventured to ask. He had a few books on military
subjects and a few novels, which he willingly lent and never asked to
have returned. But, on the other hand, he never returned the books he
himself borrowed.

His principal recreation was pistol-shooting. The walls of his room
were riddled with bullets-a perfect honeycomb. A rich collection of
pistols was the only thing luxurious in his modestly furnished villa.
His skill as a shot was quite prodigious. If he had undertaken to
shoot a pear off some one''s cap not a man in our regiment would have
hesitated to act as target. Our conversation often turned on duelling;
Silvio, so I will call him, never joined in it. When asked if he had
ever fought, he answered curtly, "Yes." But he gave no particulars, and
it was evident that he disliked such questions. We concluded that the
memory of some unhappy victim of his terrible skill preyed heavily upon
his conscience.[Pg 72] None of us could ever have suspected him of cowardice.
There are men whose look alone is enough to repel such a suspicion.

An unexpected incident fairly astonished us. One afternoon about ten
officers were dining with Silvio. They drank as usual, that is to say,
a great deal. After dinner we asked our host to make a pool. For a long
time he refused on the ground that he seldom played. At last he ordered
cards to be brought in. With half a hundred gold pieces on the table we
sat round him, and the game began. It was Silvio''s habit not to speak
when playing. He never disputed or explained. If an adversary made a
mistake Silvio without a word chalked it down against him. Knowing his
way we always let him have it.

But among us on this occasion was an officer who had but lately joined.
While playing he absent-mindedly scored a point too much. Silvio took
the chalk and corrected the score in his own fashion. The officer,
supposing him to have made a mistake, began to explain. Silvio went
on dealing in silence. The officer, losing patience, took the brush
and rubbed out what he thought was wrong. Silvio took the chalk and
recorrected it. The officer, heated with wine and play, and irritated
by the laughter of the company, thought himself aggrieved, and, in a
fit of passion, seized[Pg 73] a brass candlestick and threw it at Silvio, who
only just managed to avoid the missile. Great was our confusion. Silvio
got up, white with rage, and said, with sparkling eyes—

"Sir! have the goodness to withdraw, and you[Pg 74] may thank God that this
has happened in my own house."

We could have no doubt as to the consequences, and we already looked
upon our new comrade as a dead man. He withdrew saying that he was
ready to give satisfaction for his offence in any way desired.

The game went on for a few minutes; but feeling that our host was upset
we gradually left off playing and dispersed, each to his own quarters.
At the riding school next day we were already asking one another
whether the young lieutenant was still alive, when he appeared among
us. We asked him the same question, and were told that he had not yet
heard from Silvio. We were astonished. We went to Silvio''s and found
him in the court-yard popping bullet after bullet into an ace which he
had gummed to the gate. He received us as usual, but made no allusion
to what had happened on the previous evening.

Three days passed and the lieutenant was still alive. "Can it be
possible," we asked one another in astonishment, "that Silvio will not
fight?"

Silvio did not fight. He accepted a flimsy apology, and became
reconciled to the man who had insulted him. This lowered him greatly
in the opinion of the young men, who, placing[Pg 75] bravery above all the
other human virtues and regarding it as an excuse for every imaginable
vice, were ready to overlook anything sooner than a lack of courage.
However, little by little, all was forgotten, and Silvio regained his
former influence. I alone could not renew my friendship with him.
Being naturally romantic I had surpassed the rest in my attachment
to the man whose life was an enigma, and who seemed to me a hero of
some mysterious story. He liked me, and with me alone did he drop his
sarcastic tone and converse simply and most agreeably on many subjects.
But after this unlucky evening the thought that his honour was
tarnished, and that it remained so by his own choice, never left me;
and this prevented any renewal of our former intimacy. I was ashamed to
look at him. Silvio was too sharp and experienced not to notice this
and guess the reason. It seemed to vex him, for I observed that once or
twice he hinted at an explanation; but I wanted none, and Silvio gave
me up. Thenceforth I only met him in the presence of other friends, and
our confidential talks were at an end.

The busy occupants of the capital have no idea of the emotions so
frequently experienced by residents in the country and in country
towns; as, for instance, in awaiting the arrival of the post. On
Tuesdays and Fridays the bureau of the[Pg 76] regimental staff was crammed
with officers. Some were expecting money, others letters or newspapers.
The letters were mostly opened on the spot, and the news freely
interchanged, the office meanwhile presenting a most lively appearance.

Silvio''s letters used to be addressed to our regiment, and he usually
called for them himself. On one occasion, a letter having been handed
to him, I saw him break the seal and, with a look of great impatience,
read the contents. His eyes sparkled. The other officers, each engaged
with his own letters, did not notice anything.

"Gentlemen," said Silvio, "circumstances demand my immediate departure.
I leave tonight, and I hope you will not refuse to dine with me for the
last time. I shall expect you, too," he added, "turning towards me,
without fail." With these words he hurriedly left, and we agreed to
meet at Silvio''s.

I went to Silvio''s at the appointed time and found nearly the whole
regiment with him. His things were already packed. Nothing remained
but the bare shot-marked walls. We sat down to table. The host was in
excellent spirits, and his liveliness communicated itself to the rest
of the company. Corks popped every moment. Bottles fizzed and tumblers
foamed incessantly, and we, with much warmth, wished our departing
friend a pleasant journey and every happiness. The[Pg 77] evening was far
advanced when we rose from table. During the search for hats, Silvio
wished everybody goodbye. Then, taking me by the hand, as I was on the
point of leaving, he said in a low voice:

Sitting down opposite one another we lighted our pipes. Silvio was much
agitated, no traces of his former gaiety remained. Deadly pale, with
sparkling eyes, and a thick smoke issuing from his mouth, he looked
like a demon. Several minutes passed before he broke silence.

"Perhaps we shall never meet again," he said. "Before saying goodbye I
want to have a few words with you. You may have remarked that I care
little for the opinion of others. But I like you, and should be sorry
to leave you under a wrong impression."

"You thought it odd," he continued, "that I did not require
satisfaction from that drunken maniac. You will grant, however, that
being entitled to the choice of weapons I had his life more or less in
my hands. I might attribute my tolerance to generosity, but I will not
deceive you; if I could have chastised him without the[Pg 78] least risk to
myself, without the slightest danger to my own life, then I would on no
account have forgiven him."

"Precisely so, I had no right to endanger my life. Six years ago I
received a slap in the face and my enemy still lives."

"My disposition is well known to you. I have been accustomed to be
first in everything. Prom my youth this has been my passion. In my
time dissipation was the fashion, and I was the most dissipated man
in the army. We used to boast of our drunkenness. I beat at drinking
the celebrated Burtsoff, of whom Davidoff has sung in his poems. Duels
in our regiment were of daily occurrence. I took part in all of them,
either as second or as principal. My comrades adored me, while the
commanders of the regiment, who were constantly being changed, looked
upon me as an incurable evil.

"I was calmly, or rather boisterously, enjoying my reputation when
a certain young man joined our regiment. He was rich, and came of
a distinguished family—I will not name him. Never in my life did
I meet with so brilliant, so fortunate a fellow!—young, clever,
handsome, with the wildest spirits, the most reckless bravery, bearing
a celebrated name, possessing funds of which he[Pg 80][Pg 81] did not know the
amount, but which were inexhaustible. You may imagine the effect he
was sure to produce among us. My leadership was shaken. Dazzled by
my reputation he began by seeking my friendship. But I received him
coldly; at which, without the least sign of regret, he kept aloof from
me.

"I took a dislike to him. His success in the regiment and in the
society of women brought me to despair. I tried to pick a quarrel with
him. To my epigrams he replied with epigrams which always seemed to me
more pointed and more piercing than my own, and which were certainly
much livelier; for while he joked I was raving.

"Finally, at a ball at the house of a Polish landed proprietor, seeing
him receive marked attention from all the ladies, and especially from
the lady of the house, who had formerly been on very friendly terms
with me, I whispered some low insult in his ear. He flew into a passion
and gave me a slap on the cheek. We clutched our swords, the ladies
fainted, we were separated, and the same night we drove out to fight.

"It was nearly daybreak. I was standing at the appointed spot with my
three seconds. How impatiently I awaited my opponent! The spring sun
had risen and it was growing hot. At last I saw him in the distance. He
was on foot, accompanied by only one second. We advanced[Pg 82] to meet him.
He approached, holding in his hand his regimental cap filled full of
black cherries.

"The seconds measured twelve paces. It was for me to fire first. But
my excitement was so great that I could not depend upon the certainty
of my hand, and, in order to give myself time to get calm, I ceded the
first shot to my adversary. He would not accept it, and we decided to
cast lots.

"The number fell to him; constant favourite of fortune that he was! He
aimed and put a bullet through my cap.

"It was now my turn. His life at last was in my hands. I looked at him
eagerly, trying to detect if only some faint shadow of uneasiness. But
he stood beneath my pistol picking out ripe cherries from his cap and
spitting out the stones, some of which fell near me. His indifference
enraged me. ''What is the use,'' thought I, ''of depriving him of life,
when he sets no value upon it.'' As this savage thought flitted through
my brain I lowered the pistol.

"''You don''t seem to be ready for death,'' I said, ''you are eating your
breakfast, and I don''t want to interfere with you.''

"''You don''t interfere with me in the least,'' he replied. ''Be good
enough to fire; or don''t fire if you prefer it; the shot remains with
you, and I shall be at your service at any moment.''

"I turned to the seconds, informing them that I had no intention of
firing that day, and with this the duel ended. I resigned my commission
and retired to this little place. Since then not a[Pg 84] single day has
passed that I have not thought of my revenge; and now the hour has
arrived."

Silvio took from his pocket the letter he had received that morning,
and handed it to me to read. Someone (it seemed to be his business
agent) wrote to him from Moscow, that a certain individual was soon to
be married to a young and beautiful girl.

"You guess," said Silvio, "who the certain individual is. I am starting
for Moscow. Me shall see whether he will be as indifferent now as he
was some time ago, when in presence of death he ate cherries!"

With these words Silvio rose, threw his cap upon the floor, and began
pacing up and down the room like a tiger in his cage. I remained
silent. Strange contending feelings agitated me.

The servant entered and announced that the horses were ready. Silvio
grasped my hand tightly. He got into the telega, in which lay two
trunks—one containing his pistols, the other some personal effects. We
wished good-bye a second time, and the horses galloped off.

Many years passed, and family circumstances obliged me to settle in the
poor little village of H. Engaged in farming, I sighed in secret for my
former merry, careless existence. Most difficult of all I found it to
pass in solitude the spring and winter evenings. Until the dinner hour
I somehow occupied the time, talking to the starosta, driving round
to see how the work went on, or visiting the new buildings. But as soon
as evening began to draw in, I was at a loss what to do with myself. My
books in various bookcases, cupboards, and storerooms I knew by heart.
The housekeeper, Kurilovna, related to me all the stories she could
remember. The songs of the peasant women made me melancholy. I tried
cherry brandy, but that gave me the headache. I must confess, however,
that I had some fear of becoming a drunkard from ennui, the saddest
kind of drunkenness imaginable, of which I had seen many examples in
our district.

I had no near neighbours with the exception of two or three melancholy
ones, whose conversation consisted mostly of hiccups and sighs.
Solitude was preferable to that. Finally I decided to go to bed as
early as possible, and to dine as late as possible, thus shortening the
evening and[Pg 86] lengthening the day; and I found this plan a good one.

Pour versts from my place was a large estate belonging to Count B.;
but the steward alone lived there. The Countess had visited her domain
once only, just after her marriage, and she then only lived there about
a month. However, in the second spring of my retirement, there was a
report that the Countess, with her husband, would come to spend the
summer on her estate; and they arrived at the beginning of June.

The advent of a rich neighbour is an important event for residents in
the country. The landowners and the people of their household talk of
it for a couple of months beforehand, and for three years afterwards.
As far as I was concerned, I must confess, the expected arrival of
a young and beautiful neighbour affected me strongly. I burned with
impatience to see her; and the first Sunday after her arrival I started
for the village, in order to present myself to the Count and Countess
as their near neighbour and humble servant.

The footman showed me into the Count''s study, while he went to
inform him of my arrival. The spacious room was furnished in a most
luxurious manner. Against the walls stood enclosed bookshelves well
furnished with books, and surmounted by bronze busts. Over the marble
mantelpiece[Pg 87] was a large mirror. The floor was covered with green
cloth, over which were spread rugs and carpets.

Having got unaccustomed to luxury in my own poor little corner, and not
having beheld the wealth of other people for a long while, I was awed;
and I awaited the Count with a sort of fear, just as a petitioner from
the provinces awaits in an ante-room the arrival of the minister. The
doors opened, and a man about thirty-two, and very handsome, entered
the apartment. The Count approached me with a frank and friendly look.
I tried to be self-possessed, and began to introduce myself, but he
forestalled me.

We sat down. His easy and agreeable, conversation soon dissipated my
nervous timidity. I was already passing into my usual manner, when
suddenly the Countess entered, and I became more confused than ever.
She was, indeed, beautiful. The Count presented me. I was anxious to
appear at ease, but the more I tried to assume an air of unrestraint,
the more awkward I felt myself becoming. They, in order to give me time
to recover myself and get accustomed to my new acquaintances, conversed
with one another, treating me in good neighbourly fashion without
ceremony. Meanwhile, I walked about the room, examining the books and
pictures. In pictures I am no connoisseur; but one of the[Pg 88] Count''s
attracted my particular notice. It represented a view in Switzerland
was not, however, struck by the painting, but by the fact that it was
shot through by two bullets, one planted just on the top of the other.

"Tolerably," I answered, rejoicing that the conversation had turned
at last on a subject which interested me.'' "At a distance of thirty
paces I do not miss a card; I mean, of course, with a pistol that I am
accustomed to."

"Really?" said the Countess, with a look of great interest. "''And you,
my dear, could you hit a card at thirty paces?"

"Some day," replied the Count, "we will try. In my own time I did not
shoot badly. But it is four years now since I held a pistol in my hand."

"Oh," I replied, "in that case, I bet, Count, that you will not hit a
card even at twenty paces. The pistol demands daily practice. I know
that from experience. In our regiment I was reckoned one of the bests
shots. Once I happened not to take a pistol in hand for a whole month;
I had sent my own to the gunsmith''s. Well, what do you think, Count?
The first time I began again[Pg 89][Pg 90] to shoot I four times running missed
a bottle at twenty paces. The captain of our company, who was a wit,
happened to be present, and he said to me: ''Your hand, my friend,
refuses to raise itself against the bottle! No, Count, you must not
neglect to practise, or you will soon lose all skill. The best shot I
ever knew used to shoot every day, and at least three times every day,
before dinner. This was as much his habit as the preliminary glass of
vodka."

"This sort, Count. If he saw a fly settle on the wall—you smile,
Countess, but I assure you it is a fact. When he saw the fly, he would
call out, ''Kuska, my pistol!'' Kuska brought him the loaded pistol. A
crack, and the fly was crushed into the wall!"

"How could I fail to know him? We were comrades; he was received at our
mess like a brother officer. It is now about five years since I last
had tidings of him. Then you, Count, also knew him?"

"Do you mean the slap in the face, Count, that he received from
a blackguard at a ball?" "He did not tell you the name of this
blackguard?"

"No, Count, he did not. Forgive me," I added, guessing the truth,
"forgive me—I did not—could it really have been you?"

"It was myself," replied the Count, greatly agitated. "And the shots in
the picture are a memento of our last meeting."

"Oh, my dear," said the Countess, "for God''s sake do not relate it! It
frightens me to think of it."

"No," replied the Count; "I must tell him all. He knows how I insulted
his friend. He shall also know how Silvio revenged himself."

The Count pushed a chair towards me, and with the liveliest interest I
listened to the following story:—

"Five years ago," began the Count, "I got married. The honeymoon I
spent here, in this village. To this house I am indebted for the
happiest moments of my life, and for one of its saddest remembrances.

"One afternoon we went out riding together. My wife''s horse became
restive. She was frightened, got off the horse, handed the reins over
to[Pg 92] me; and walked home. I rode on before her. In the yard I saw a
travelling carriage, and I was told that in my study sat a man who
would not give his name, but simply said that he wanted to see me on
business. I entered the study, and saw in the darkness a man, dusty and
unshaven. He stood there, by the fireplace. I approached him, trying to
recollect his face.

"I measured twelve paces, and stood there in that corner, begging him
to fire quickly, before my wife came in.

"He hesitated, and asked for a light. Candles were brought in. I locked
the doors, gave orders that no one should enter, and again called upon
him to fire. He took out his pistol and aimed.

"I counted the seconds.... I thought of her ... A terrible moment
passed! Then Silvio lowered his hand.

"''I only regret,'' he said, that the pistol is not loaded with
cherry-stones. My bullet is heavy; and it always seems to me that an
affair of this kind is net a duel, but a murder. I am not accustomed[Pg 93]
to aim at unarmed men. Let us begin again from the beginning. Let us
cast lots as to who shall fire first.''

"My head went round. I think I objected. Finally, however, we loaded
another pistol and rolled up two pieces of paper. These he placed
inside his cap; the one through which, at our first meeting, I had put
the bullet. I again drew the lucky number.

"I don''t know what I was about, or how it happened that he succeeded in
inducing me. But I fired and hit that picture."

The Count pointed with his finger to the picture with the shot-marks
His face had become red with agitation. The Countess was whiter than
her own handkerchief; and I could not restrain an exclamation.

"I fired," continued the Count, "and, thank Heaven, missed. Then
Silvio—at this moment he was really terrible—then Silvio raised his
pistol to take aim at me.

"Suddenly the door flew open, Masha rushed into the room. She threw
herself upon my neck with a loud shriek. Her presence restored to
me-all my courage.

"''My dear,'' I said to her, ''don''t you see that we are only joking? How
frightened you look![Pg 94] Go and drink a glass of water and then come back;
I will introduce you to an old friend and comrade.''

"''Tell me; is my husband speaking the truth?'' she asked, turning to the
terrible Silvio. ''Is it true that you are only joking?''

"''He is always joking. Countess,'' Silvio replied. ''He once in a joke
gave me a slap in the face; in joke he put a bullet through this cap
while I was wearing it; and in joke, too, he missed me when he fired
just now. And now I have a fancy for a joke.''

''Rise, Masha! For shame!'' I cried, in my passion. ''And you, sir, cease
to amuse yourself at the expense of an unhappy woman. Will you fire or
not?''

"''I will not,'' replied Silvio. ''I am satisfied. I have witnessed your
agitation—your terror. I forced you to fire at me. That is enough; you
will remember me. I leave you to your conscience.''

"He was now about to go; but he stopped at the door, looked round
at the picture which my shot had passed through, fired at it almost
without taking aim, and disappeared.

"My wife had sunk down fainting. The servants had not ventured to stop
Silvio, whom they looked upon with terror. He passed out to the steps,
called his coachman, and before I could collect myself drove off."

The Count was silent. I had now heard the end of the story of which
the beginning had long before surprised me. The hero of it I never saw
again. I heard, however, that Silvio, during the rising of Alexander
Ipsilanti, commanded a detach of insurgents and was killed in action.

Towards the end of 1811, at a memorable period for Russians, lived
on his own domain of Nenaradova the kind-hearted Gravril R. He was
celebrated in the whole district for his hospitality and his genial
character. Neighbours constantly visited him to have something to eat
and drink, and to play at five-copeck boston with his wife, Praskovia.
Some, too, went to have a look at their daughter, Maria; a tall pale
girl of seventeen. She was an heiress, and they desired her either for
themselves or for their sons.

Maria had been brought up on French novels, and consequently was in
love. The object of her affection was a poor ensign in the army, who
was now at home in his small village on leave of absence. As a matter
of course, the young man reciprocated Maria''s passion. But the parents
of his beloved, noticing their mutual attachment, forbade their
daughter even to think of him, while they received him worse than an
ex-assize judge.

Our lovers corresponded, and met alone daily in[Pg 98][Pg 99] the pine wood or by
the old roadway chapel. There they vowed everlasting love, inveighed
against fate, and exchanged various suggestions. Writing and talking in
this way, they quite naturally reached the following conclusion:—

If we cannot exist apart from each other, and if the tyranny of
hard-hearted parents throws obstacles in the way of our happiness, then
can we not manage without them?

Of course, this happy idea originated in the mind of the young man; but
it pleased the romantic imagination of Maria immensely.

Winter set in and put a stop to their meetings. But their
correspondence became all the more active. Vladimir begged Maria in
every letter to give herself up to him that they might get married
secretly, hide for a while, and then throw themselves at the feet of
the parents, who would of course in the end be touched by their heroic
constancy and say to them, "Children, come to our arms!"

Maria hesitated a long while, and out of many different plans proposed,
that of flight was for a time rejected. At last, however, she
consented. On the appointed day she was to decline supper, and retire
to her room under the plea of a headache. She and her maid, who was in
the secret, were then to go out into the garden by the back stairs,
and beyond the garden they would find a[Pg 100] sledge ready for them, would
get into it and drive a distance of five miles from Nenaradova, to the
village of Jadrino, straight to the church, where Vladimir would be
waiting for them.

On the eve of the decisive day, Maria did not sleep all night; she was
packing and tying up linen and dresses. She wrote, moreover, a long
letter to a friend of hers, a sentimental young lady; and another to
her parents. Of the latter, she took leave in the most touching terms.
She excused the step she was taking by reason of the unconquerable
power of love, and wound up by declaring that she should consider it
the happiest moment of her life when she was allowed to throw herself
at the feet of her dearest parents. Sealing both letters with a Toula
seal, on which were engraven two flaming hearts with an appropriate
inscription, she at last threw herself upon her bed before daybreak
and dozed off, though even then she was awake tied from one moment
to another by terrible thoughts. First it seemed to her that at the
moment of entering the sledge in order to go and get married her father
stopped her, and with cruel rapidity dragged her over the snow and
threw her into a dark bottomless cellar, down which she fell headlong
with an indescribable sinking of the heart. Then she saw Vladimir,
lying on the grass, pale and bleeding; with his dying breath he
implored her to make haste and marry him.[Pg 101] Other hideous and senseless
visions floated before her one after another. Finally she rose paler
than usual, and with, a real headache.

Both her father and her mother remarked her indisposition. Their
tender anxiety and constant inquiries, "What is the matter with you,
Masha—are you ill?" cut her to the heart. She tried to pacify them and
to appear cheerful; but she could not. Evening set in. The idea that
she was passing the day for the last time in the midst of her family
oppressed her. In her secret heart she took leave of everybody, of
everything which surrounded her.

Supper was served; her heart beat violently. In a trembling voice she
declared that she did not want any supper, and wished her father and
mother good-night. They kissed her, and as usual blessed her; and she
nearly wept.

Reaching her own room she threw herself into an easy chair and burst
into tears. Her maid begged her to be calm and take courage. Everything
was ready. In half-an-hour Masha would leave for ever her parents''
house, her own room, her peaceful life as a young girl.

Out of doors the snow was falling, the wind howling. The shutters
rattled and shook. In everything she seemed to recognise omens and
threats.

Soon the whole home was quiet and asleep. Masha wrapped herself in a
shawl, put on a warm cloak, and with a box in her hand passed out on
to the back staircase. The maid carried two[Pg 103] bundles after her. They
descended into the garden. The snowstorm raged: a strong wind blew
against them as if trying to stop the young culprit. With difficulty
they reached the end of the garden. In the road a sledge awaited them.

The horses from cold would not stand still. Vladimir''s coachman was
walking to and fro in front of them, trying to quiet them. He helped
the young lady and her maid to their seats, and packing away the
bundles and the dressing-case took up the reins, and the horses flew
forward into the darkness of the night.

Having entrusted the young lady to the care of fate and of Tereshka the
coachman, let us return to the young lover.

Vladimir had spent the whole day in driving. In the morning he had
called on the Jadrino priest, and, with difficulty, came to terms with
him. Then he went to seek for witnesses from amongst the neighbouring
gentry. The first on whom he called was a former cornet of horse,
Dravin by name, a man in his forties, who consented at once. The
adventure, he declared, reminded him of old times and of his larks
when he was in the Hussars. He persuaded Vladimir to stop to dinner
with him, assuring him that there would be no difficulty in getting
the other two witnesses. Indeed, immediately after dinner[Pg 104] in came
the surveyor Schmidt, with a moustache and spurs, and the son of a
captain-magistrate, a boy of sixteen, who had recently entered the
Uhlans. They not only accepted Vladimir''s proposal, but even swore that
they were ready to sacrifice their lives for him. Vladimir embraced
them with delight, and drove off to get everything ready.

It had long been dark. Vladimir despatched his trustworthy Tereshka
to Nenaradova with his two-horsed sledge, and with appropriate
instructions for the occasion. For himself he ordered the small sledge
with one horse, and started alone without a coachman for Jadrino, where
Maria ought to arrive in a couple of hours. He knew the road, and the
drive would only occupy twenty minutes.

But Vladimir had scarcely passed from the enclosure into the open field
when the wind rose, and soon there was a driving snowstorm so heavy and
so severe that he could not see. In a moment the road was covered with
snow. All landmarks disappeared in the murky yellow darkness, through
which fell white flakes of snow. Sky and earth became merged into one.
Vladimir, in the midst of the field, tried in vain to get to the road.
The horse walked on at random, and every moment stepped either into
deep snow or into a rut, so that the sledge was constantly upsetting.[Pg 105]
Vladimir tried at least not to lose the right direction; but it seemed
to him that more than half an hour had passed, and he had not yet
reached the Jadrino wood. Another ten minutes passed, and still the
wood was invisible. Vladimir drove across fields intersected by deep
ditches. The snowstorm did not abate, and the sky did not clear. The
horse was getting tired and the perspiration rolled from him like hail,
in spite of the fact that every moment his legs were disappearing in
the snow.

At last Vladimir found that he was going in the wrong direction. He
stopped; began to reflect, recollect, and consider; till at last he
became convinced that he ought to have turned to the right. He did so
now. His horse could scarcely drag along. But he had been more than
an hour on the road, and Jadrino could not now be far. He drove and
drove, but there was no getting out of the field. Still snow-drifts and
ditches. Every moment the sledge was upset, and every moment Vladimir
had to raise it up.

Time was slipping by, and Vladimir grew seriously anxious. At last in
the distance some dark object could be seen.

He drove by the side of the wood, hoping to come at once upon the
familiar road, or, if not, to pass round the wood. Jadrino was situated
immediately behind it.

He soon found the road, and passed into the darkness of the wood, now
stripped by the winter. The wind could not rage here; the road was
smooth, the horse picked up courage, and Vladimir was comforted.

He drove and drove, but still Jadrino was not to be seen; there was no
end to the wood. Then to his horror he discovered that he had got into
a strange wood. He was in despair. He whipped his horse, and the poor
animal started off at a trot. But it soon got tired, and in a quarter
of an hour, in spite of all poor Vladimir''s efforts, could only crawl.

Gradually the trees became thinner, and Vladimir drove out of the wood,
but Jadrino was not to be seen. It must have been about midnight.
Tears gushed from the young man''s eyes. He drove on at random; and now
the weather abated, the clouds dispersed, and before him was a wide
stretch of plain, covered with a white billowy carpet. The night was
comparatively clear, and he could see a small village a short distance
off, which consisted of four or five cottages. Vladimir drove towards
it. At the first door he jumped out of the sledge, ran up to the
window, and tapped.[Pg 107] After a few minutes a wooden, shutter was raised,
and an old man stuck out his grey beard.

At this answer Vladimir clutched hold of his hair, and stood
motionless, like a man condemned to death.

"Stop!" said the old man, dropping the shutter; "I will send my son out
to you; he will conduct you."

Vladimir waited. Scarcely a minute had passed when he again knocked.
The shutter was lifted and a beard was seen.

The gate creaked; a youth came out with a cudgel, and walked on in
front, at one time pointing out the road, at another looking for it in
a mass of drifted snow.

The cocks were crowing, and it was light when they reached Jadrino. The
church was closed. Vladimir paid the guide, and drove into the yard of
the priest''s house. In the yard his two-horsed sledge was not to be
seen. What news awaited him?

The old people awoke, and went into the sitting-room, Gavril in a
night-cap and flannel jacket, Praskovia in a wadded dressing-gown. The
samovar was brought in, and, Gavril sent the little maid to ask Maria
how she was and how she had slept. The little maid returned, saying
that her young lady had slept badly, but that she was better now, and
that she would come into the sitting-room in a moment. And indeed the
door opened, and Maria came in and wished her papa and mamma good
morning.

The day passed well enough, but in the night Masha was taken ill. A
doctor was sent for from town. He came towards evening and found the
patient delirious. Soon she was in a severe fever, and in a fortnight
the poor patient was on the brink of the grave.

No member of the family knew anything of the flight from home. The
letters written by Masha the evening before had been burnt; and the
maid, fearing the wrath of the master and mistress, had not breathed
a word. The priest, the ex-cornet, the big moustached surveyor,
and the little lancer were equally discreet, and with good reason.
Tereshka, the coachman, never said too much, not even in his drink.
Thus the secret was kept better than it might have been by half a dozen
conspirators.

But Maria herself, in the course of her long fever, let out her secret,
nevertheless, her words were so disconnected that her mother, who never
left her bedside, could only make out from them that her daughter
was desperately in love with Vladimir, and that probably love was
the cause[Pg 110] of her illness. She consulted her husband and some of her
neighbours, and at last it was decided unanimously that the fate of
Maria ought not to be interfered with, that a woman must not ride away
from the man she is destined to marry, that poverty is no crime, that
a woman has to live not with money but with a man, and so on. Moral
proverbs are wonderfully useful on such occasions, when we can invent
little or nothing in our own justification.

Meanwhile the young lady began to recover. Vladimir had not been seen
for a long time in the house of Gravril, so frightened had he been by
his previous reception. It was now resolved to send and announce to
him the good news which he could scarcely expect: the consent of her
parents to his marriage with Maria.

But what was the astonishment of the proprietors of Nenaradova when,
in answer to their invitation, they received an insane reply. Vladimir
informed them he could never set foot in their house, and begged them
to forget an unhappy man whose only hope now was in death. A few days
afterwards they heard that Vladimir had left the place and joined the
army.

A long time passed before they ventured to tell Masha, who was now
recovering. She never mentioned Vladimir. Some months later, however,
finding his name in the list of those who had[Pg 111] distinguished themselves
and been severely wounded at Borodino, she fainted, and it was feared
that the fever might return. But, Heaven be thanked! the fainting fit
had no bad results.

Maria experienced yet another sorrow. Her father died, leaving her the
heiress of all his property. But the inheritance could not console her.
She shared sincerely the affliction of her mother, and vowed she would
never leave her.

Suitors clustered round the charming heiress; but she gave no one the
slightest hope. Her mother sometimes tried to persuade her to choose a
companion in life; but Maria shook her head, and grew pensive.

Vladimir no longer existed. He had died at Moscow on the eve of the
arrival of the French. His memory was held sacred by Maria, and she
treasured up everything that would remind her of him; books he had
read, drawings which he had made; songs he had sung, and the pieces of
poetry which he had copied out for her.

The neighbours, hearing all this, wondered at her fidelity, and awaited
with curiosity the arrival of the hero who must in the end triumph over
the melancholy constancy of this virgin Artemis.

Meanwhile, the war had been brought to a glorious conclusion, and our
armies were returning[Pg 112] from abroad. The people ran to meet them. The
music played, by the regimental bands consisted of war songs, "Vive
Henri-Quatre," Tirolese waltzes and airs from Joconde. Nourished on
the atmosphere of winter, officers who had started on the campaign
mere striplings returned grown men, and covered with decorations. The
soldiers conversed gaily among themselves, mingling German and French
words every moment in their speech. A time never to be forgotten—a
time of glory and delight! How quickly beat the Russian heart at
the words, "Native land!" How sweet the tears of meeting! With what
unanimity did we combine feelings of national pride with love for the
Tsar! And for him, what a moment!

The women—our Russian women—were splendid then. Their usual coldness
disappeared. Their delight was really intoxicating when, meeting the
conquerors, they cried, "Hurrah!" And they threw up their caps in the
air.

Who of the officers of that period does not own that to the Russian
women he was indebted for his best and most valued reward? During this
brilliant period Maria was living with her mother in retirement, and
neither of them saw how, in both the capitals, the returning troops
were welcomed. But in the districts and villages the general enthusiasm
was, perhaps, even greater.

In these places the appearance of an officer became for him a veritable
triumph. The accepted lover in plain clothes fared badly by his side.

We have already said that, in spite of her coldness, Maria was
still, as before, surrounded by suitors. But all had to fall in the
rear when there arrived at her castle the wounded young colonel
of Hussars—Burmin by name—with the order of St. George in his
button-hole, and an interesting pallor on his face. He was about
twenty-six. He had come home on leave to his estates, which were close
to Maria''s villa. Maria paid him such attention as none of the others
received. In his presence her habitual gloom disappeared. It could not
be said that she flirted with him. But a poet, observing her behaviour,
might have asked, "S'' amor non Ã¨, che dunque?"

Burmin was really a very agreeable young man. He possessed just the
kind of sense that pleased women: a sense of what is suitable and
becoming. He had no affectation, and was carelessly satirical. His
manner towards Maria was simple and easy. He seemed to be of a quiet
and modest disposition; but rumour said that he had at one time been
terribly wild. This, however, did not harm him in the opinion of Maria,
who (like all other young ladies) excused, with pleasure, vagaries
which were the result of impulsiveness and daring.

But above all—more than his love-making, more than his pleasant talk,
more than his interesting pallor, more even than his bandaged arm—the
silence of the young Hussar excited her curiosity and her imagination.
She could not help confessing to herself that he pleased her very much.
Probably he too, with his acuteness and his experience, had seen that
he interested her. How was it, then, that up to this moment she had
not seen him at her feet; had not received from him any declaration
whatever? And wherefore did she not encourage him with more attention,
and, according to circumstances, even with tenderness? Had she a secret
of her own which would account for her behaviour?

At last, Burmin fell into such deep meditation, and his black eyes
rested with such fire upon Maria, that the decisive moment seemed very
near. The neighbours spoke of the marriage as an accomplished fact, and
kind Praskovia rejoiced that her daughter had at last found for herself
a worthy mate.

The lady was sitting alone once in the drawing-room, laying out
grande-patience, when Burmin entered the room, and at once inquired for
Maria.

"She is in the garden," replied the old lady: "go to her, and I will
wait for you here." Burmin went, and the old lady made the sign of the
cross[Pg 116] and thought, "Perhaps the affair will be settled to-day!"

Burmin found Maria in the ivy-bower beside the pond, with a book in
her hands, and wearing a white dress—a veritable heroine of romance.
After the first inquiries, Maria purposely let the conversation drop;
increasing by these means the mutual embarrassment, from which it was
only possible to escape by means of a sudden and positive declaration.

It happened thus. Burmin, feeling the awkwardness of his position,
informed Maria that he had long sought an opportunity of opening his
heart to her, and that he begged for a moment''s attention. Maria closed
the book and lowered her eyes, as a sign that she was listening.

"I have behaved imprudently, yielding as I have done to the seductive
pleasure of seeing and hearing you daily." Maria recollected the first
letter of St. Preux in ''La Nouvelle HÃ©loÃ¯se.''

"It is too late now to resist my fate. The remembrance of you, your
dear incomparable image, must from to-day be at once the torment and
the consolation of my existence. I have now a grave duty to perform,
a terrible secret to[Pg 117][Pg 118] disclose, which will place between us an
insurmountable barrier."

"I know," he replied quickly; "I know that you once loved. But death
and three years of mourning may have worked some change. Dear, kind
Maria, do not try to deprive me of my last consolation; the idea that
you might have consented to make me happy if——. Don''t speak, for
God''s sake don''t speak—you torture me. Yes, I know, I feel that you
could have been mine, but—I am the most miserable of beings—I am
already married!"

"I am married," continued Burmin; "I have been married more than three
years, and do not know who my wife is, or where she is, or whether I
shall ever see her again."

"In the beginning of 1812," said Burmin, "I was hurrying on to
Wilna, where my regiment was stationed. Arriving one evening late
at a station, I ordered, the horses to be got ready quickly, when
suddenly a fearful snowstorm broke out. Both station master and drivers
advised me to wait till it was over. I listened to their advice, but
an unaccountable restlessness took possession[Pg 119] of me, just as though
someone was pushing me on. Meanwhile, the snowstorm did not abate. I
could bear it no longer, and again ordered the horses, and started in
the midst of the storm. The driver took it into his head to drive along
the river, which would shorten the distance by three miles. The banks
were covered with snowdrifts; the driver missed the turning which would
have brought us out on to the road, and we turned up in an unknown
place. The storm never ceased. I could discern a light, and told the
driver to make for it. We entered a village, and found that the light
proceeded from a wooden church. The church was open. Outside the
railings stood several sledges, and people passing in and out through
the porch."

"''Where have you dawdled?'' said someone to me. ''The bride has fainted;
the priest does not know what to do: we were on the point of going
back. Make haste and get out!''"

"I got out of the sledge in silence, and stepped into the church,
which was dimly lighted with two or three tapers. A girl was sitting
in a dark corner on a bench; and another girl was rubbing her temples.
''Thank God,'' said the latter, ''you have come at last! You have nearly
been the death of the young lady.''"

"The young lady was raised up. I thought her rather pretty. Oh, wild,
unpardonable frivolity! I placed myself by her side at the altar. The
priest hurried on."

"Three men and the maid supported the bride, and occupied themselves
with her alone. We were married!"

"My wife turned her pale face towards me. I was going to kiss her, when
she exclaimed, ''Oh! it is not he—not he!'' and fell back insensible."

"The witnesses stared at me. I turned round and left the church without
any attempt being made to stop me, threw myself into the sledge, and
cried, ''Away!''"

"I do not," replied Burmin; "neither do I know the name of the village
where I was married, nor that of the station from which I started.
At that time I thought so little of my wicked joke that, on driving
away from the church, I fell asleep, and never woke till early the
next morning, after reaching the third station. The servant who was
with me died during the campaign, so that I have[Pg 121] now no hope of ever
discovering the unhappy woman on whom I played such a cruel trick, and
who is now so cruelly avenged."

"Great heavens!" cried Maria, seizing his hand. "Then it was you, and
you do not recognise me?" Burmin turned pale—and threw himself at her
feet.

The last remaining goods of the undertaker, Adrian Prohoroff, were
piled on the hearse, and the gaunt pair, for the fourth time, dragged
the vehicle along from the Basmannaia to the Nikitskaia, whither the
undertaker had flitted with all his household. Closing the shop, he
nailed to the gates an announcement that the house was to be sold or
let, and then started on foot for his new abode. Approaching the small
yellow house which had long attracted his fancy and which he at last
bought at a high price, the old undertaker was surprised to find that
his heart did not rejoice. Crossing the strange threshold, he found
disorder inside his new abode, and sighed for the decrepit hovel, where
for eighteen years everything had been kept in the most perfect order.
He began scolding both his daughters and the servant for being so slow,
and proceeded to help them himself. Order was speedily established.
The case with the holy pictures, the cupboard with the crockery, the
table, sofa, and bedstead, took up[Pg 123] their appropriate corners in the
back room. In the kitchen and parlour was placed the master''s stock
in trade, that is to say, coffins of every colour and of all sizes;
likewise wardrobes containing mourning hats, mantles, and funeral
torches. Over the gate hung a signboard representing a corpulent cupid
holding a reversed torch in his hand, with the following inscription:
"Here coffins are sold, covered, plain, or painted. They are also let
out on hire, and old ones are repaired."

The daughters had retired to their own room, Adrian went over his
residence, sat down by the window, and ordered the samovar to be got
ready.

The enlightened reader is aware that both Shakespeare and Walter Scott
have represented their gravediggers as lively jocular people, for the
sake, no doubt, of a strong contrast. But respect for truth prevents me
from following their example; and I must confess that the disposition
of our undertaker corresponded closely with his melancholy trade.
Adrian Prohoroff: was usually pensive and gloomy. He only broke silence
to scold his daughters when he found them idle, looking out of window
at the passers by, or asking too exorbitant prices for his products
from those who had the misfortune (sometimes the pleasure) to require
them. Sitting by the window drinking his seventh cup of tea, according
to his[Pg 124] custom, Adrian was wrapped in the saddest thoughts. He was
thinking of the pouring rain, which a week before had met the funeral
of a retired brigadier at the turnpike gate, causing many mantles to
shrink and many hats to contract. He foresaw inevitable outlay, his
existing supply of funeral apparel being in such a sad condition. But
he hoped to make good the loss from the funeral of the old shopwoman,
Tiruhina, who had been at the point of death for the last year.
Tiruhina, however, was dying at Basgulai, and Prohoroff was afraid that
her heirs, in spite of their promise to him, might be too lazy to send
so far, preferring to strike a bargain with the nearest contractor.

These reflections were interrupted unexpectedly by three freemason
knocks at the door. "Who is there?" enquired the undertaker. The door
opened and a man, in whom at a glance might be recognised a German
artisan, entered the room, and with a cheery look approached the
undertaker.

"Pardon me, my dear neighbour," he said, with the accent which even now
we Russians never hear without a smile; "Pardon me for disturbing you;
I wanted to make your acquaintance at once. I am a bootmaker, my name
is Gottlieb Schultz, I live in the next street—in that little house
opposite your windows. To morrow I celebrate[Pg 125] my silver wedding, and I
want you and your daughters to dine with me in a friendly way."

The invitation was accepted. The undertaker asked the bootmaker to sit
down and have a cup of tea, and thanks to Gottlieb Schultz''s frank
disposition, they were soon talking in a friendly way.

"Oh, oh," replied Schultz, "one way and another I have no reason to
complain. Though, of course, my goods are not like yours. A living man
can do without boots, but a corpse cannot do without a coffin."

"Perfectly true," said Adrian, "still, if a living man has nothing to
buy boots with he goes barefooted, whereas the destitute corpse gets
his coffin sometimes for nothing."

Their conversation continued in this style for some time, until at last
the bootmaker rose and took leave of the undertaker, repeating his
invitation.

Next day, punctually at twelve o''clock, the undertaker and his
daughters passed out at the gate of their newly-bought house, and
proceeded to their neighbours. I do not intend to describe Adrian''s
Russian caftan nor the European dress of Akulina or Daria, contrary
though this be to the[Pg 126] custom of fiction-writers of the present day.
I don''t, however, think it superfluous to mention that both, maidens
wore yellow bonnets and scarlet shoes, which they only did on great
occasions.

The bootmaker''s small lodging was filled with guests, principally
German artisans, their wives, and assistants. Of Russian officials
there was only one watchman, the Finn Yurko, who had managed, in spite
of his humble position, to gain the special favour of his chief. He had
also performed the functions of postman for about twenty-five years,
serving truly and faithfully the people of Pogorelsk. The fire which,
in the year 1812, consumed the capital, burnt at the same time his
humble sentry box. But no sooner had the enemy fled, when in its place
appeared a small, new, grey sentry box, with tiny white columns of
Doric architecture, and Yurko resumed his patrol in front of it with
battle-axe on shoulder, and in the civic armour of the police uniform.

He was well known to the greater portion of the German residents near
the Nikitski Gates, some of whom had occasionally even passed the night
from Sunday until Monday in Yurko''s box.

Adrian promptly made friends with a man of whom, sooner or later, he
might have need, and as the guests were just then going in to dinner
they sat down together.

Mr. and Mrs. Schultz and their daughter, the[Pg 127] seventeen-year-old
Lotchen, while dining with their guests, attended to their wants and
assisted the cook to wait upon them. Beer flowed. Yurko ate for four,
and Adrian did not fall short of him, though his daughters stood upon
ceremony.

Suddenly the host called for the attention of the company, and opening
a pitch-covered bottle, exclaimed loudly in Russian:

The imitation champagne frothed. The host kissed tenderly the fresh
face of his forty-year old spouse and the guests drank vociferously the
health of good Louisa.

"The health of my dear guests!" cried the host opening the second
bottle. The guests thanked him and emptied their glasses. Then
one toast followed another. The health of each guest was proposed
separately; then the health of Moscow and of about a dozen German
towns. They drank the health of the guilds in general, and afterwards
of each one separately; The health of the foremen and of the workmen.
Adrian drank with a will and became so lively, that he himself proposed
some jocular toast.

This toast like all the others was drunk joyfully and unanimously. The
guests nodded to each other; the tailor to the bootmaker, the bootmaker
to the tailor; the baker to them both and all to the baker.

Everybody laughed except the undertaker, who felt himself affronted and
frowned. No one noticed this; and the guests went on drinking till the
bells began to ring for evening service, when they all rose from the
table.

The party had broken up late and most of the guests were very
hilarious. The stout baker, with the bookbinder, whose face looked as
if it were bound in red morocco, led Yurko by the arms to his sentry
box, thus putting in practice the proverb, "One good turns deserves
another."

"How, indeed," he exclaimed aloud. "Is my trade worse than any other?
Is an undertaker own brother to the executioner? What have the infidels
to laugh at? Is an undertaker a hypocritical buffoon? I should have
liked to invite them to a housewarming; to give them a grand spread.
But no; that shall not be! I will ask my customers instead; my orthodox
corpses."

"What!" exclaimed the servant, who at that moment was taking off the
undertaker''s boots. "What is that, sir, you are saying? Make the sign
of the cross! Invite corpses to your housewarming! How awful!"

"I will certainly invite them," persisted Adrian, "and not later than
for to-morrow. Honour me, my benefactors, with your company to-morrow
evening at a feast; I will offer you what God has given me."

It was still dark when Adrian awoke. The shopkeeper, Triuhina, had died
in the night, and her steward had sent a special messenger on horseback
to inform Adrian of the fact. The undertaker gave him a grivenik [a
silver fourpenny bit] for his trouble, to buy vodka with; dressed
hurriedly, took an isvoshchik, and drove off to Rasgulai. At the gate
of the dead woman''s house the police were already standing, and dealers
in mourning goods were hovering around, like ravens who have scented
a corpse. The defunct was lying in state on the table, yellow like
wax, but not yet disfigured by decomposition. Hear her, in a crowd,
were relations, friends, and domestics. All the windows were open;
wax tapers were burning; and the clergy were reading prayers. Adrian
went up to the nephew, a young shopman in a fashionable[Pg 130] surtout,
and informed him that the coffin, tapers, pall, and the funeral
paraphernalia in general would promptly arrive. The heir thanked him in
an absent manner, saying that he would not bargain about the price, but
leave it all to his conscience. The undertaker, as usual, vowed that
his charges should be moderate, exchanged significant glances with the
steward, and left to make the necessary preparations.

The whole day was spent in travelling from Rasgulai to the Nikitski
Grates and back again. Towards evening everything was settled, and
he started home on foot after discharging his hired isvoshchik. It
was a moonlight night, and the undertaker got safely to the Nikitski
Grates. At Yosnessenia he met our acquaintance, Yurko, who, recognising
the undertaker, wished him good-night. It was late. The undertaker was
close to his house when he thought he saw some one approach the gates,
open the wicket, and go in.

"What does it mean?" thought Adrian. "Who can be wanting me again? Is
it a burglar, or can my foolish girls have lovers coming after them?
There is no telling," and the undertaker was on the point of calling
his friend Yurko to his assistance, when some one else came up to the
wicket and was about to enter, but seeing the master of the house run
towards him, he stopped, and took off his three cornered hat. His face
seemed[Pg 131] familiar to Adrian, but in his hurry he had not been able to
see it properly.

"Don''t stand on ceremony, my friend," replied the other, in a hollow
voice, "go first, and show your guest the way."

Adrian had no time to waste on formality. The gate was open, and he
went up to the steps followed by the other. Adrian heard people walking
about in his rooms.

"What the devil is this?" he wondered, and he hastened to see. But
now his legs seemed to be giving way. The room was full of corpses.
The moon, shining through the windows, lit up their yellow and blue
faces, sunken mouths, dim, half-closed eyes, and protruding noses. To
his horror, Adrian recognised in them people he had buried, and in
the guest who came in with him, the brigadier who had been interred
during a pouring rain. They all, ladies and gentlemen, surrounded the
undertaker, bowing and greeting him affably, except one poor fellow
lately buried gratis, who, ashamed of his rags, kept at a distance in
a corner of the room. The others were all decently clad; the female
corpses in caps and ribbons, the soldiers and officials in their
uniforms, but with unshaven beards; and the tradespeople in their best
caftans.

"Prohoroff," said the brigadier, speaking on[Pg 132] behalf of all the
company, "we have all risen to profit by your invitation. Only those
have stopped at home who were quite unable to do otherwise; who have
crumbled away and have nothing left but bare bones. Even among those
there was one who could not resist—he wanted so much to come."

At this moment a diminutive skeleton pushed his way through the
crowd and approached Adrian. His death''s head grinned affably at the
undertaker. Shreds of green and red cloth and of rotten linen hung on
him as on a pole; while the bones of his feet clattered inside his
heavy boots like pestles in mortars.

"You do not recognise me, Prohoroff?" said the skeleton. "Don''t
you remember the retired, sergeant in the guards, Peter Petrovitch
Kurilkin, him to whom you in the year 1799 sold your first coffin, and
of deal instead of oak?" With these words the corpse stretched out his
long arms to embrace him. But Adrian collecting his strength, shrieked,
and pushed him away. Peter Petrovitch staggered, fell over, and
crumbled to pieces. There was a murmur of indignation among the company
of corpses. All stood up for the honour of their companion, threatening
and abusing Adrian till the poor man, deafened by their shrieks and
quite overcome, lost his senses and fell unconscious among the bones of
the retired sergeant of the guard.

The sun had been shining for sometime upon the bed on which the
undertaker lay, when he at last opened his eyes and saw the servant
lighting the samovar. With horror he recalled all the incidents of
the previous day. Triuchin, the brigadier, and the sergeant, Kurilkin,
passed dimly before his imagination. He waited in silence for the
servant to speak and tell him what had occurred during the night.

"How you have slept, Adrian Prohorovitch!" said Aksima, handing him his
dressing-gown. "Your neighbour the tailor called, also the watchman, to
say that to-day was Turko''s namesday; but you were so fast asleep that
we did not disturb you."

"Oh, my batiushka! [little father] are you mad, or are you still
suffering from last night''s drink? You were feasting all day at the
German''s. You came home drunk, threw yourself on the bed, and and have
slept till now, when the bells have stopped ringing for Mass."

Who has not cursed the Postmaster; who has not quarrelled with him?
Who, in a moment of anger, has not demanded the fatal hook to write his
ineffectual complaint against extortion, rudeness, and unpunctuality?
Who does not consider him a human monster, equal only to our extinct
attorney, or, at least, to the brigands of the Murom Woods? Let us,
however, be just and place ourselves in his position, and, perhaps,
we shall judge him less severely. What is a Postmaster? A real martyr
of the 14th class (i.e., of nobility), only protected by his tchin
(rank) from personal violence; and that not always. I appeal to the
conscience of my readers. What is the position of this dictator, as
Prince Yiasemsky jokingly calls him? Is it not really that of a galley
slave? No rest for him day or night. All the irritation accumulated
in the course of a dull journey by the traveller is vented upon the
Postmaster. If the weather is intolerable, the road wretched, the[Pg 135]
driver obstinate, or the horses intractable—the Postmaster is to
blame. Entering his humble abode, the traveller looks upon him as his
enemy, and the Postmaster is lucky if he gets rid of his uninvited
guest soon. But should there happen to be no horses! Heavens! what
abuse, what threats are showered upon his head! Through rain and mud
he is obliged to seek them, so that during a storm, or in the winter
frosts, he is often glad to take refuge in the cold passage in order
to snatch a few moments of repose and to escape from the shrieking and
pushing of irritated guests.

If a general arrives, the trembling Postmaster supplies him with
the two last remaining troiki (team of three horses abreast), of
which one troika ought, perhaps, to have been reserved for the
diligence. The general drives on without even a word of thanks. Five
minutes later the Postmaster hears—a bell! and the guard throws down
his travelling certificate on the table before him! Let us realize
all this, and, instead of anger, we shall feel sincere pity for the
Postmaster. A few words more. In the course of twenty years I have
travelled all over Russia, and know nearly all the mail routes. I have
made the acquaintance of several generations of drivers. There are few
postmasters whom I do not know personally, and few with whom I have
not had dealings. My curious collection of travelling experiences I
hope[Pg 136] shortly to publish. At present I will only say that, as a class,
the Postmaster is presented to the public in a false light. This
much-libelled personage is generally a peaceful, obliging, sociable,
modest man, and not too fond of money. From his conversation (which
the travelling gentry very wrongly despise) much interesting and
instructive information may be acquired. As far as I am concerned, I
profess that I prefer his talk to that of some tchinovnik (official)
of the 6th class, travelling for the Government.

It may easily be guessed that I have some friends among the honourable
class of postmasters. Indeed, the memory of one of them is very dear
to me. Circumstances at one time brought us together, and it is of him
that I now intend to tell my dear readers.

In the May of 1816 I chanced to be passing through the Government of
----, along a road now no longer existing. I held a small rank, and
was travelling with relays of three horses while paying only for two.
Consequently the Postmaster stood upon no ceremony with me, but I
had often to take from him by force what I considered to be mine by
right. Being young and passionate, I was indignant at the meanness and,
cowardice of the Postmaster when he handed over the troika prepared
for me to some official gentleman of higher rank.

It also took me a long time to get over the offence, when a servant,
fond of making distinctions, missed me when waiting at the governor''s
table. Now the one and the other appear to me to be quite in the
natural course of things. Indeed, what would become of us, if, instead
of the convenient rule that rank gives precedence to rank, the rule
were to be reversed, and mind made to give precedence to mind? What
disputes would arise! Besides, to whom would the attendants first hand
the dishes? But to return to my story.

The day was hot. About three versts from the station it began to spit,
and a minute afterwards there was a pouring rain, and I was soon
drenched to the skin. Arriving at the station, my first care was to
change my clothes, and then I asked for a cup of tea.

In obedience to this command, a girl of fourteen appeared from behind
the partition, and ran out into the passage. I was struck by her beauty.

"Yes," he answered, with a look of gratified pride, "and such a good,
clever girl, just like her late mother." Then, while he took note of my
travelling certificate, I occupied the time in examining[Pg 138] the pictures
which decorated the walls of his humble abode. They were illustrations
of the story of the Prodigal Son. In the firsts a venerable old man
in a skull cap and dressing gown, is wishing good-bye to the restless
youth who naturally receives his blessing and a bag of money. In
another, the dissipated life of the young man is painted in glaring
colours; he is sitting at a table surrounded by false friends and
shameless women. In the next picture, the ruined youth in his shirt
sleeves and a three-corned hat, is taking care of some swine while
sharing their food. His face expresses deep sorrow and contrition.
Finally, there was the representation of his return to his father.
The kind old man, in the same cap and dressing gown, runs out to meet
him; the prodigal son falls on his knees before him; in the distance,
the cook is killing the fatted calf, and the eldest son is asking the
servants the reason of all this rejoicing. At the foot of each picture
I read some appropriate German verses. I remember them all distinctly,
as well as some pots of balsams, the bed with the speckled curtains,
and many other characteristic surroundings. I can see the stationmaster
at this moment; a man about fifty years of age, fresh and strong, in a
long green coat, with three medals on faded ribbons.

I had scarcely time to settle with my old driver when Dunia returned
with the samovar. The[Pg 139] little coquette saw at a second glance the
impression she had produced upon me. She lowered her large, blue eyes.
I spoke to her, and she replied confidently, like a girl accustomed to
society. I offered a glass of punch to her father, to Dunia I handed a
cup of tea. Then we all three fell into easy conversation, as if we had
known each other all our lives.

The horses had been waiting a long while, but I was loth to part from
the Postmaster and his daughter. At last I took leave of them, the
father wishing me a pleasant journey, while the daughter saw me to the
telega. In the corridor I stopped and asked permission to kiss her.
Dunia consented. I can remember a great many kisses since then, but
none which left such a lasting, such a delightful impression.

Several years passed, when circumstances brought me back to the same
tract, to the very same places. I recollected the old Postmasters
daughter, and rejoiced at the prospect of seeing her again.

"But," I thought, "perhaps the old Postmaster has been changed, and
Dunia may be already married." The idea that one or the other might
be dead also passed through my mind, and I approached the station of
---- with sad presentiments. The horses drew up at the small station
house. I entered the waiting-room, and[Pg 140] instantly recognised the
pictures representing the story of the Prodigal Son. The table and the
bed stood in their old places, but the flowers on the window sills had
disappeared, while all the surroundings showed neglect and decay.

The Postmaster was asleep under his great-coat, but my arrival awoke
him and he rose. It was certainly Simeon Virin, but how aged! While he
was preparing to make a copy of my travelling certificate, I looked at
his grey hairs, and the deep wrinkles in his long, unshaven face, his
bent back, and I was amazed to see how three or four years had managed
to change a strong, middle-aged man into a frail, old one.

The old man pretended not to hear my question, and in a low voice went
on reading my travelling certificate. I ceased my inquiries and ordered
hot water.

My curiosity was becoming painful, and I hoped that the punch would
loosen the tongue of my old[Pg 141] friend. I was not mistaken; the old man
did not refuse the proffered tumbler. I noticed that the rum dispelled
his gloom. At the second glass he became talkative, remembered, or at
any rate looked as if he remembered, me, and I heard the story, which
at the time interested me and even affected me much.

"So you knew my Dunia?" he began. "But, then, who did not? Oh, Dunia,
Dunia! What a beautiful girl you were! You were admired and praised
by every traveller. No one had a word to say against her. The ladies
gave her presents—one a handkerchief, another a pair of earrings. The
gentlemen stopped on purpose, as if to dine or to take supper, but
really only to take a longer look at her. However rough a man might be,
he became subdued in her presence and spoke graciously to me. Will you
believe me, sir? Couriers and special messengers would talk to her for
half-an-hour at the time. She was the support of the house. She kept
everything in order, did everything and looked after everything. While
I, the old fool that I was, could not see enough of her, or pet her
sufficiently. How I loved her! How I indulged my child! Surely her life
was a happy one? But, no! fate is not to be avoided."

Then he began to tell me his sorrow in detail. Three years before,
one winter evening, while the[Pg 142] Postmaster was ruling a new book, his
daughter in the next partition was busy making herself a dress, when
a troika drove up and a traveller, wearing a Circassian hat and a
long military overcoat, and muffled in a shawl, entered the room and
demanded horses.

The horses were all out. Hearing this, the traveller had raised his
voice and his whip, when Dunia, accustomed to such scenes, rushed out
from behind the partition and inquired pleasantly whether he would not
like something to eat? Her appearance produced the usual effect. The
passenger''s rage subsided, he agreed to wait for horses, and ordered
some supper. He took off his wet hat, unloosed the shawl, and divested
himself of his long overcoat.

The traveller was a tall, young hussar with a small black moustache.
He settled down comfortably at the Postmaster''s and began a lively,
conversation with him and his daughter. Supper was served. Meanwhile,
the horses returned and the Postmaster ordered them instantly, without
being fed, to be harnessed to the traveller''s kibitka. But returning
to the room, he found the young man senseless on the bench where he lay
in a faint. Such a headache had attacked him that it was impossible for
him to continue his journey. What was to be done? The Postmaster gave
up his own bed to him; and it was arranged that if[Pg 143] the patient was not
better the next morning to send to C——— for the doctor.

Next day the hussar was worse. His servant rode to the town to fetch
the doctor. Dunia bound up his head with a handkerchief moistened
in vinegar, and sat down with her needlework by his bedside. In the
presence of the Postmaster the invalid groaned and scarcely said a word.

Nevertheless, he drank two cups of coffee and, still groaning, ordered
a good dinner. Dunia never left him. Every time he asked for a drink
Dunia handed him the jug of lemonade prepared by herself. After
moistening his lips, the patient each time he returned the jug gave her
hand a gentle pressure in token of gratitude.

Towards dinner time the doctor arrived. He felt the patient''s pulse,
spoke to him in German and in Russian, declared that all he required
was rest, and said that in a couple of days he would be able to start
on his journey. The hussar handed him twenty-five rubles for his visit,
and gave him an invitation to dinner, which the doctor accepted. They
both ate with a good appetite, and drank a bottle of wine between them.
Then, very pleased with one another, they separated.

Another day passed, and the hussar had quite recovered. He became very
lively, incessantly joking, first with Dunia, then with the Postmaster,
whistling tunes, conversing with the[Pg 144] passengers, copying their
travelling certificates into the station book, and so ingratiating
himself that on the third day the good Postmaster regretted parting
with his dear lodger.

It was Sunday, and Dunia was getting ready to attend mass. The hussar''s
kibitka was at the door. He took leave of the Postmaster, after
recompensing him handsomely for his board and lodging, wished Dunia
good-bye, and proposed to drop her at the church, which was situated at
the other end of the village. Dunia hesitated.

"What are you afraid of?" asked her father. "His nobility is not a
wolf. He won''t eat you. Drive with him as far as the church."

Dunia got into the carriage by the side of the hussar. The servant
jumped on the coach box, the coachman gave a whistle, and the horses
went off at a gallop.

The poor Postmaster could not understand how he came to allow his Dunia
to drive off with the hussar; how he could have been so blind, and what
had become of his senses. Before half-an-hour had passed his heart
misgave him. It ached, and he became so uneasy that he could bear the
situation no longer, and started for the church himself. Approaching
the church, he saw that the people were already dispersing. But Dunia
was neither in the churchyard nor at the entrance. He hurried into
the church; the priest was just[Pg 145] leaving the altar, the clerk was
extinguishing the tapers, two old women were still praying in a corner;
but Dunia was nowhere to be seen. The poor father could scarcely summon
courage to ask the clerk if she had been to mass. The clerk replied
that she had not. The Postmaster returned home neither dead nor alive.
He had only one hope left; that Dunia in the flightiness of her youth
had, perhaps, resolved to drive as far as the next station, where her
godmother lived. In patient agitation he awaited the return of the
troika with which he had allowed her to drive off, but the driver did
not come back. At last, towards night, he arrived alone and tipsy, with
the fatal news that Dunia had gone on with the hussar.

The old man succumbed to his misfortune, and took to his bed, the same
bed where, the day before, the young impostor had lain. Recalling all
the circumstances, the Postmaster understood now that the hussar''s
illness had been shammed. The poor fellow sickened with severe fever,
he was removed to C———, and in his place another man was temporarily
appointed. The same doctor who had visited the hussar attended him. He
assured the Postmaster that the young man had been perfectly well, that
he had from the first had suspicions of his evil intentions, but that
he had kept silent for fear of his whip.

Whether the German doctor spoke the truth, or was anxious only to prove
his great penetration, his assurance brought no consolation to the poor
patient. As soon as he was beginning to recover from his illness, the
old Postmaster asked his superior postmaster of the town of C——— for
two months'' leave of absence, and without saying a word to anyone, he
started off on foot to look for his daughter.

From the station book he discovered that Captain Minsky had left
Smolensk for Petersburg. The coachman who drove him said that Dunia had
wept all the way, though she seemed to be going of her own free will.

"Perhaps," thought the station master, "I shall bring back my strayed
lamb." With this idea he reached St. Petersburg, and stopped with the
Ismailovsky regiment, in the quarters of a non-commissioned officer,
his old comrade in arms. Beginning his search he soon found out that
Captain Minsky was in Petersburg, living at Demuth''s Hotel. The
Postmaster determined to see him.

Early in the morning he went to Minsky''s antechamber, and asked to
have his nobility informed that an old soldier wished to see him. The
military attendant, in the act of cleaning a boot on a boot-tree,
informed him that his master was asleep, and never received anyone
before eleven o''clock. The Postmaster left to return at the appointed
time.[Pg 147] Minsky came out to him in his dressing gown and red skull cap.

The old maids heart boiled, tears started to his eyes, and in a
trembling voice he could only say, "Your nobility; be divinely
merciful!"

Minsky glanced quickly at him, flushed, and seizing him by the hand,
led him into his study and locked the door.

"Your nobility!" continued the old man, "what has fallen from the cart
is lost; give me back, at any rate, my Dunia. Let her go. Do not ruin
her entirely."

"What is done cannot be undone," replied the young man, in extreme
confusion. "I am guilty before you, and ready to ask your pardon. But
do not imagine that I could neglect Dunia. She shall be happy, I give
you my word of honour. Why do you want her? She loves me; she has
forsaken her former existence. Neither you nor she can forget what has
happened." Then, pushing something up his sleeve, he opened the door,
and the Postmaster found himself, he knew not how, in the street.

He stood long motionless, at last catching sight of a roll of papers
inside his cuff, he pulled them out and unrolled several crumpled-up
fifty ruble notes. His eyes again filled with tears, tears of[Pg 148]
indignation! He crushed the notes into a ball, threw them on the
ground, and, stamping on them with his heel, walked away. After a few
steps he stopped, reflected a moment, and turned back.

But the notes were gone. A well-dressed young man, who had observed
him, ran towards an isvoshtchick, got in hurriedly, and called to the
driver to be "off."

The Postmaster did not pursue him. He had resolved to return home to
his post-house; but before doing so he wished to see his poor Dunia
once more. With this view, a couple of days afterwards he returned to
Minsky''s lodgings. But the military servant told him roughly that his
master received nobody, pushed him out of the antechamber, and slammed
the door in his face. The Postmaster stood and stood, and at last went
away.

That same day, in the evening, he was walking along the Leteinaia,
having been to service at the Church of the All Saints, when a smart
drojki flew past him, and in it the Postmaster recognised Minsky.
The drojki stopped in front of a three-storeyed house at the very
entrance, and the hussar ran up the steps. A happy thought occurred to
the Postmaster. He retraced his steps.

"Why! your master told me to deliver a note for him to his Dunia, and I
have forgotten where his Dunia lives."

"She lives here on the second floor; but you are too late, my friend,
with your note; he is there himself now."

"No matter," answered the Postmaster, who had an undefinable sensation
at his heart. "Thanks for your information; I shall be able to manage
my business." With these words he ascended the steps.

The door was locked; he rang. There were several seconds of painful
delay. Then the key jingled, and the door opened.

"You must not, must not," she called after him; "Avdotia Simeonovna has
visitors." But the Postmaster, without listening, went on. The first
two rooms were dark. In the third there was a light. He approached the
open door and stopped. In the room, which was beautifully furnished,
sat Minsky in deep thought. Dunia, dressed in all the splendour of
the latest fashion, sat on the arm[Pg 150] of his easy chair, like a rider
on an English side saddle. She was looking tenderly at Minsky, while
twisting his black locks round her glittering fingers. Poor Postmaster!
His daughter had never before seemed so beautiful to him. In spite of
himself, he stood admiring her.

Minsky, in alarm, rushed to pick her up, when suddenly seeing the old
Postmaster in the doorway, he left Dunia and approached him, trembling
with rage.

"What do you want?" he inquired, clenching his teeth. "Why do you steal
after me everywhere, like a burglar? Or do you want to murder me?
Begone!" and with a strong hand he seized the old man by the scruff of
the neck and pushed him down the stairs.

The old man went back to his rooms. His friend advised him to take
proceedings, but the Postmaster reflected, waved his hand, and decided
to give the matter up. Two days afterwards he left Petersburg for his
station and resumed his duties.

"This is the third year," he concluded, "that I am living without my
Dunia; and I have had no tidings whatever of her. Whether she is alive
or[Pg 151] not God knows. Many tilings happen. She is not the first, nor the
last, whom a wandering blackguard has enticed away, kept for a time,
and then dropped. There are many such young fools in Petersburg to-day,
in satins and velvets, and to-morrow you see them sweeping the streets
in the company of drunkards in rags. When I think sometimes that Dunia,
too, may end in the same way, then, in spite of myself, I sin, and wish
her in her grave."

Such was the story of my friend, the old Postmaster, the story more
than once interrupted by tears, which he wiped away picturesquely
with the flap of his coat like the faithful Terentieff in Dmitrieff''s
beautiful ballad. The tears were partly caused by punch, of which he
had consumed five tumblers in the course of his narrative. But whatever
their origin, I was deeply affected by them. After parting with him, it
was long before I could forget the old Postmaster, and I thought long
of poor Dunia.

Lately, again passing through the small place of ———, I remembered
my friend. I heard that the station over which he ruled had been done
away with. To my inquiry, "Is the Postmaster alive?" no one could give
a satisfactory answer. Having resolved to pay a visit to the familiar
place, I hired horses of my own, and started for the village of N——.

It was autumn. Grey clouds covered the sky; a cold wind blew from the
close reaped fields, carrying with it the brown and yellow leaves
of the trees which it met. I arrived in the village at sunset, and
stopped at the station house. In the passage (where once Dunia had
kissed me) a stout woman met me; and to my inquiries, replied that the
old Postmaster had died about a year before; that a brewer occupied
his house; and that she was the wife of that brewer. I regretted my
fruitless journey, and my seven roubles of useless expense.

"Certainly! Hi, Vanka! cease playing with the cat and take this
gentleman to the cemetery, and show him the Postmaster''s grave."

"How should I not know him? He taught me to make whistles. When (may
he be in heaven!) we met him coming from the tavern, we used to run
after him calling, ''Daddy! daddy! some[Pg 153] nuts,'' and he gave us nuts. He
idled most of his time away with, us."

"There are few travellers now-a-days, unless the assize judge turns up;
and he is too busy to think of the dead. But a lady, passing through
last summer, did ask after the old Postmaster, and she went to his
grave."

"A beautiful lady," answered the boy. "She travelled in a coach with
six horses, three beautiful little children, a nurse, and a little
black dog; and when she heard that the old Postmaster was dead, she
wept, and told the children to keep quiet while she went to the
cemetery. I offered to show her the way, but the lady said, ''I know
the way,'' and she gave me a silver piatak (twopence) ... such a kind
lady!"

We reached the cemetery. It was a bare place unenclosed, marked with
wooden crosses and unshaded by a single tree. Never before had I seen
such a melancholy cemetery.

"Here is the grave of the old Postmaster," said the boy to me, as he
pointed to a heap of sand into which had been stuck a black cross with
a brass icon (image).

"She did," replied Vanka. "I saw her from a distance. She lay down
here, and remained[Pg 154] lying down for a long while. Then she went into the
village and saw the priest. She gave him some money and drove off. To
me she gave a silver piatak. She was a splendid lady!"

And I also gave the boy a silver piatak, regretting neither the
journey nor the seven roubles that it had cost me.

In one of our distant provinces was the estate of Ivan Petrovitch
Berestoff. As a youth he served in the guards, but having left the
army early in 1797 he retired to his country seat and there remained.
He married a wife from among the poor nobility, and when she died in
childbed he happened to be detained on farming business in one of his
distant fields. His daily occupations soon brought him consolation. He
built a house on his own plan, set up his own cloth factory, became his
own auditor and accountant, and began to think himself the cleverest
fellow in the whole district. The neighbours who used to come to him
upon a visit and bring their families and dogs took good care not to
contradict him. His work-a-day dress was a short coat of velveteen;
on holidays he wore a frock-coat of cloth from his own factory. His
accounts took most of his time, and he read nothing but the Senatorial
News. On the whole, though he was considered proud, he was[Pg 156] not
disliked. The only person who could never get on with him was his
nearest neighbour, Grigori Ivanovitch Muromsky. A true Russian barin,
he had squandered in Moscow a large part of his estate, and having lost
his wife as well as his money he had retired to his sole remaining
property, and there continued his extragavance but in a different way.
He set up an English garden on which he spent nearly all the income he
had left. His grooms wore English liveries. An English governess taught
his daughter. He farmed his land upon the English system. But foreign
farming grows no Russian corn.

So, in spite of his retirement, the income of Grigori Ivanovitch did
not increase. Even in the country he had a faculty for making new
debts. But he was no fool, people said, for was he not the first
landowner in all that province to mortgage his property to the
government—a process then generally believed to be one of great
complexity and risk? Among his detractors Berestoff, a thorough hater
of innovation, was the most severe. In speaking of his neighbour''s
Anglo-mania he could scarcely keep his feelings under control, and
missed no opportunity for criticism. To some compliment from a visitor
to his estate he would answer, with a knowing smile:

"Yes, my farming is not like that of Grigori Ivanovitch. I can''t afford
to ruin my land on the[Pg 157] English system, but I am satisfied to escape
starvation on the Russian."

Obliging neighbours reported these and other jokes to Grigori, with
additions and commentaries of their own. The Anglo-maniac was as
irritable as a journalist under this criticism, and wrathfully referred
to his critic as a bumpkin and a bear.

Relations were thus strained when Berestoff''s son came home. Having
finished his university career, he wanted to go into the army; but his
father objected. For the civil service young Berestoff had no taste.
Neither would yield, so young Alexis took up the life of a country
gentleman, and to be ready for emergencies cultivated a moustache. He
was really a handsome fellow, and it would indeed have been a pity
never to pinch his fine figure into a military uniform, and instead
of displaying his broad shoulders on horseback to round them over an
office desk. Ever foremost in the hunting-field, and a straight rider,
it was quite clear, declared the neighbours, that he could never make
a good official. The shy young ladies glanced and the bold stared at
him in admiration; but he took no notice of them, and each could only
attribute his indifference to some prior attachment. In fact, there was
in private circulation, copied from an envelope in his handwriting,
this address:

Those readers who have not seen our country life can hardly realize the
charm of these provincial girls. Breathing pure air under the shadow
of their apple trees, their only knowledge of the world is drawn from
books. In solitude and unrestrained, their feelings and their passions
develop early to a degree unknown to the busier beauties of our towns.
For them the tinkling of a bell is an event, a drive into the nearest
town an epoch, and a chance visit a long, sometimes an everlasting
remembrance. At their oddities he may laugh who will, but superficial
sneers cannot impair their real merits—their individuality, which, so
says Jean Paul, is a necessary element of greatness. The women in large
towns may be better educated, but the levelling influence of the world
soon makes all women as much alike as their own head-dresses.

It may be imagined what an impression Alexis made on our country
misses. He was the first gloomy and disenchanted hero they had ever
beheld; the first who ever spoke to them of vanished joys and blighted
past. Besides, he wore a black ring with a death''s head on it. All this
was[Pg 159] quite a new thing in that province, and the young ladies all went
crazy.

But she in whose thoughts he dwelt most deeply was Lisa, or, as the old
Anglo-maniac called her, Betty, the daughter of Grigori Ivanovitch.
Their fathers did not visit, so she had never seen Alexis, who was
the sole topic of conversation among her young neighbours. She was
just seventeen, with dark eyes lighting up her pretty face. An only,
and consequently a spoilt child, full of life and mischief, she was
the delight of her father, and the distraction of her governess, Miss
Jackson, a prim spinster in the forties, who powdered her face and
blackened her eyebrows, read Pamela twice a year, drew a salary of
2,000 rubles, and was nearly bored to death in barbarous Russia.

Lisa''s maid Nastia was older, but quite as flighty as her mistress, who
was very fond of her, and had her as confidante in all her secrets and
as fellow-conspirator in her mischief.

In fact, no leading lady played half such an important part in French
tragedy as was played by Nastia in the village.

"And what does that matter to us?" said Nastia. "I belong to you and
not to your father. You have not quarrelled with young Berestoff yet.
Let the old people fight if they please."

"I would rather tell you in proper order. We were just in time for
dinner; the room was quite full. There were the Zaharievskys, the
steward''s wife and daughters, the Shlupinskys——"

"Wait a bit. We sat down to dinner. The steward''s wife had the seat of
honour; I sat next to her, and her daughters were huffy; but what do I
care!"

"How impatient you are! Well, then we rose from table—we had been
sitting for about three hours and it was a splendid dinner-party,
blue, red and striped creams—then we went into the garden to play at
kiss-in-the-ring when the young gentleman appeared."

"Really! I thought his face was pale. Well, how did he strike you—Was
he melancholy and thoughtful?"

"Oh, no! I never saw such a mad fellow. He took it into his head to
join us at kiss-in-the-ring." "He played at kiss-in-the-ring! It is
impossible."

"No, it''s very possible; and what more do you think? When he caught any
one he kissed her." "Of course you may tell lies if you like, Nastia."

"As you please, miss, only I am not lying. I could scarcely get away
from him. Indeed he spent the whole day with us."

"I am sure I don''t know, miss. He looked too much at me and Tania too,
the steward''s daughter, and at Pasha too. In fact, he neglected nobody.
He is such a wild fellow!"

"They say he is a splendid gentleman—so kind, so lively! He has only
one fault: he is too fond of the girls. But I don''t think that is such
a great fault. He will get steadier in time."

"And why can''t you? Tugilovo is only a mile off. Take a walk in that
direction, or a ride, and you are sure to meet him. He shoulders his
gun and goes shooting every morning."

"No, it would never do. He would think I was running after him.
Besides, our fathers have quarrelled, so he and I could hardly set up
a friendship. Oh, Nastia! I know what I''ll do. I will dress up like a
peasant."

"That will do. Put on a coarse chemise and a sarafan, and set out
boldly for Tugilovo. Berestoff will never miss you I promise you."

"I can talk like a peasant splendidly. Oh, Nastia, dear Nastia, what
a happy thought!" and Lisa went to bed resolved to carry out her
plan. Next day she made her preparations. She went to the market for
some coarse linen, some dark blue stuff, and some brass buttons, and
out of these Nastia and she cut a chemise and a sarafan. All the
maid-servants were set down to sew, and by evening everything was
ready.

As she tried on her new costume before the glass, Lisa said to herself
that she had never looked so nice. Then she began to rehearse her
meeting with Alexis. First she gave him a low bow as she passed along,
then she continued to nod her head like a mandarin. Next she addressed
him in a peasant patois, simpering and shyly hiding her face behind
her sleeve. Nastia gave the performance her full approval. But there
was one difficulty. She tried to cross the yard barefooted, but the
grass stalks pricked her tender feet and the gravel caused intolerable
pain. Nastia again came to the rescue.

She took the measure of Lisa''s foot and hurried across the fields to
the herdsman Trophim, of whom she ordered a pair of bark shoes.

The next morning before daylight Lisa awoke. The whole household was
still asleep. Nastia was at the gate waiting for the herdsman; soon
the sound of his horn drew near, and the village herd straggled past
the Manor gates. After them came Trophim, who, as he passed, handed to
Nastia a little pair of speckled bark shoes, and received a ruble.

Lisa, who had quietly donned her peasant dress, whispered to Nastia
her last instructions about Miss Jackson; then she went through the
kitchen, out of the back door, into the open field, then she began to
run.

Dawn was breaking, and the rows of golden clouds stood like courtiers
waiting for their monarch. The clear sky, the fresh morning air, the
dew, the breeze and singing of the birds filled Lisa''s heart with
child-like joy.

Fearing to meet with some acquaintance, she did nor walk but flew. As
she drew near the wood where lay the boundary of her father''s property
she slackened her pace. It was here she was to meet Alexis. Her heart
beat violently, she knew not why. The terrors of our youthful escapades
are their chief charm.

Lisa stepped forward into the darkness of the wood; its hollow
echoes bade her welcome. Her buoyant spirits gradually gave place to
meditation. She thought—but who shall truly tell the thoughts of sweet
seventeen in a wood, alone, at six o''clock on a spring morning?

And as she walked in meditation under the shade of lofty trees,
suddenly a beautiful pointer began to bark at her. Lisa cried out with
fear, and at the same moment a voice exclaimed, "Tout beau Shogar,
ici," and a young sportsman stepped from behind the bushes. "Don''t be
afraid, my dear, he won''t bite."

"It''s all very well, sir," she said, with assumed timidity and shyness,
"I am afraid of him, he[Pg 165] seems such a savage creature, and may fly at
me again."

Alexis, whom the reader has already recognised, looked steadily at the
young peasant. "I will escort you, if you are afraid; will you allow me
to walk by your side?"

"From Prilutchina; I am the daughter of Yassili, the blacksmith, and I
am looking for mushrooms." She was carrying a basket suspended from her
shoulders by a cord.

"Exactly, I am the young gentleman''s valet" (he wished to equalize
their ranks). But Lisa looked at him and laughed.

"How can one help it. You are not dressed like a servant. You speak
differently. You even call your dog in a foreign tongue."

Lisa charmed him more and more every moment. Accustomed to be
unceremonious with pretty country girls, he tried to kiss her, but
Lisa[Pg 166] jumped aside, and suddenly assumed so distant and severe an air
that though it amused him he did not attempt any further familiarities.

"Who has taught you this wisdom?" asked Alexis, with a laugh. "Can
it be my little friend Nastia, your mistress''s maid? So this is how
civilization spreads."

Lisa felt she had almost betrayed herself, and said, "Do you think I
have never been up to the Manor House? I have seen and heard more than
you think. Still, chattering here with you won''t get me mushrooms. You
go that way, barin; I''ll go the other, begging your pardon;" and Lisa
made as if to depart, but Alexis held her by the hand.

"Akulina," she said, struggling to get her fingers free. "Let me go,
barin, it is time for me to be home."

"For the Lord''s sake don''t do that. If they knew at home I had been
talking here alone with the young barin, I should catch it. My father
would beat me within an inch of my life."

"My dear Akulina, I would kiss you if I dared. To-morrow, then, at the
same time; that is a bargain."

The young couple parted. Lisa ran out of the wood across the fields,
stole into the garden, and rushed headlong into the farmyard, where
Nastia was waiting for her. Then she changed her dress, answering at
random the impatient questions of her confidante, and went into the
dining-room to find the cloth laid and breakfast ready. Miss Jackson,
freshly powdered and Jaced, until she looked like a wine glass, was
cutting thin slices of bread and butter. Her father complimented Lisa
on her early walk.

"There is no healthier habit," he remarked, "than to rise at daybreak."
He quoted from the English papers several cases of longevity, adding
that all centenarians had abstained from spirits, and made it a
practice to rise at daybreak winter and summer. Lisa did not prove
an attentive listener. She was repeating in her mind the details of
her morning''s interview, and as she recalled[Pg 168] Akulina''s conversation
with the young sportsman her conscience smote her. In vain she assured
herself that the bounds of decorum had not been passed. This joke, she
argued, could have no evil consequences, but conscience would not be
quieted. What most disturbed her was her promise to repeat the meeting.
She half decided not to keep her word, but then Alexis, tired of
waiting, might go to seek the blacksmiths daughter in the village and
find the real Akulina—a stout, pockmarked girl—and so discover the
hoax. Alarmed at this she determined to re-enact the part of Akulina.
Alexis was enchanted. All day he thought about his new acquaintance
and at night he dreamt of her. It was scarcely dawn when he was up and
dressed. Without waiting even to load his gun he set out followed by
the faithful Shogar, and ran to the meeting place. Half an hour passed
in undeniable delay. At last he caught a glimpse of a blue sarafan
among the bushes and rushed to meet dear Akulina. She smiled to see his
eagerness; but he saw traces of anxiety and melancholy on her face. He
asked her the cause, and she at last confessed. She had been flighty
and was very sorry for it. She had meant not to keep her promise, and
this meeting at any rate must be the last. She begged him not to seek
to continue an acquaintance which could have no good end. All this,
of course, was said[Pg 169] in peasant dialect; but the thought and feeling
struck Alexis as unusual in a peasant. In eloquent words he urged
her to abandon this cruel resolution. She should have no reason for
repentance; he would obey her in everything, if only she would not rob
him of his one happiness and let him see her alone three times or even
only twice a week. He spoke with passion, and at the moment he was
really in love. Lisa listened to him in silence.

They parted; and Alexis was left to wonder how in two meetings a simple
rustic had gained such influence over him. There was a freshness and
novelty about it all that charmed him, and though the conditions
she imposed were irksome, the thought of breaking his promise never
even entered his mind. After all, in spite of his fatal ring and the
mysterious correspondence, Alexis was a kind and affectionate youth,
with a pure heart still capable of innocent enjoyment. Did I[Pg 170] consult
only my own wishes I should dwell at length on the meetings of these
young people, their growing love, their mutual trust, and all they did
and all they said. But my pleasure I know would not be shared by the
majority of my readers; so for their sake I will omit them. I will
only say that in a brief two months Alexis was already madly in love,
and Lisa, though more reticent than he was, not indifferent. Happy
in the present they took little thought for the future. Visions of
indissoluble ties flitted not seldom through the minds of both. But
neither mentioned them. For Alexis, however strong his attachment to
Akulina, could not forget the social distance that was between them,
while Lisa, knowing the enmity between their fathers, dared not count
on their becoming reconciled. Besides, her vanity was stimulated by the
vague romantic hope of at last seeing the lord of Tugilovo at the feet
of the daughter of a village blacksmith. Suddenly something happened
which came near to change the course of their true love. One of those
cold bright mornings so common in our Russian autumns Ivan Berestoff
came a-riding. For all emergencies he brought with him six pointers
and a dozen beaters. That same morning Grigori Muromsky, tempted by
the fine weather, saddled his English mare and came trotting through
his agricultural estates. Nearing the[Pg 171] wood he came upon his neighbour
proudly seated in the saddle wearing his fur-lined overcoat. Ivan
Berestoff was waiting for the hare which the beaters were driving with
discordant noises out of the brushwood. If Muromsky could have foreseen
this meeting he would have avoided it. But finding himself suddenly
within pistol-shot there was no escape. Like a cultivated European
gentleman, Muromsky rode up to and addressed his enemy politely.
Berestoff answered with the grace of a chained bear dancing to the
order of his keeper. At this moment out shot the hare and scudded
across the field. Berestoff and his groom shouted to loose the dogs,
and started after them full speed. Muromsky''s mare took fright and
bolted. Her rider, who often boasted of his horsemanship, gave her
her head and chuckled inwardly over this opportunity of escaping a
disagreeable companion. But the mare coming at a gallop to an unseen
ditch swerved. Muromsky lost his seat, fell rather heavily on the
frozen ground, and lay there cursing the animal, which, sobered by the
loss of her master, stopped at once. Berestoff galloped to the rescue,
asking if Muromsky was hurt. Meanwhile the groom led up the culprit by
the bridle. Berestoff helped Muromsky into the saddle and then invited
him to his house. Peeling himself under an obligation Muromsky could
not refuse, and so Berestoff returned in[Pg 172] glory, having killed the hare
and bringing home with him his adversary wounded and almost a prisoner
of war.

At breakfast the neighbours fell into rather friendly conversation;
Muromsky asked Berestoff to lend him a droshky, confessing that his
fall made it too painful for him to ride back. Berestoff accompanied
him to the outer gate, and before the leavetaking was over Muromsky
Pad obtained from him a promise to come and bring Alexis to a friendly
dinner at Prelutchina next day. So this old enmity which seemed before
so deeply rooted was on the point of ending because the little mare had
taken fright.

"What has happened, papa?" she asked in astonishment. "Why are you
limping? Where is the mare? Whose droshki is this?"

Lisa could not believe Per ears. Before she Pad time to collect herself
she heard that to-morrow both the Berestoffs would come to dinner.

"What do you say?" she exclaimed, turning pale. "The Berestoffs, father
and son! Dine with us to-morrow! No, papa, you can do as you please, I
certainly do not appear."

"Why? Are you mad? Since when have you[Pg 173] become so shy? Have you imbibed
hereditary hatred like a heroine of romance? Come, don''t be afoot."

Her father shrugged his shoulders, and left off arguing. He knew he
could not prevail with her by opposition, so he went to bed after his
memorable ride. Lisa, too, went to her room, and summoned Nastia.
Long did they discuss the coming visit. What will Alexis think on
recognising in the cultivated young lady his Akulina? What opinion will
he form as to her behaviour and her sense? On the other hand, Lisa was
very curious to see how such an unexpected meeting would affect him.
Then an idea struck her. She told it to Nastia, and with rejoicing they
determined to carry it into effect.

Next morning at breakfast Muromsky asked his daughter whether she still
meant to hide from the Berestoffs.

"Papa," she answered, "I will receive them if you wish it, on one
condition. However I may appear before them, whatever I may do, you
must promise me not to be angry, and you must show no surprise or
disapproval."

"At your tricks again!" exclaimed Muromsky, laughing. "Well, well, I
consent; do as you please, my black-eyed mischief."[Pg 174] With these words
he kissed her forehead, and Lisa ran off to make her preparations.

Punctually at two, six horses, drawing the home-made carriage, drove
into the courtyard, and skirted the circle of green turf that formed
its centre.

Old Berestoff, helped by two of Muromsky''s servants in livery, mounted
the steps. His son followed immediately on horseback, and the two
together entered the dining-room, where the table was already laid.

Muromsky gave his guests a cordial welcome, and proposing a tour of
inspection of the garden and live stock before dinner, led them along
his well-swept gravel paths.

Old Berestoff secretly deplored the time and trouble wasted on such a
useless whim as this Anglo-mania, but politeness forbade him to express
his feelings.

His son shared neither the disapproval of the careful farmer, nor the
enthusiasm of the complacent Anglo-maniac. He impatiently awaited the
appearance of his hosts daughter, of whom he had often heard; for,
though his heart as we know was no longer free, a young and unknown
beauty might still claim his interest.

When they had come back and were all seated in the drawing-room,
the old men talked over bygone days, re-telling the stories of the
mess-room,[Pg 175] while Alexis considered what attitude he should assume
towards Lisa. He decided upon a cold preoccupation as most suitable,
and arranged accordingly.

The door opened, he turned his head round with indifference—with such
proud indifference—that the heart of the most hardened coquette must
have quivered. Unfortunately there came in not Lisa but elderly Miss
Jackson, whitened, laced in, with downcast eyes and her little curtsey,
and Alexis'' magnificent military movement failed. Before he could
reassemble his scattered forces the door opened again and this time
entered Lisa. All rose, Muromsky began the introductions, but suddenly
stopped and bit his lip. Lisa, his dark Lisa, was painted white up
to her ears, and pencilled worse than Miss Jackson herself. She wore
false fair ringlets, puffed out like a Louis XIV. wig; her sleeves Ã 
l''imbÃ©cille extended like the hoops of Madame de Pompadour. Her figure
was laced in like a letter X, and all those of her mother''s diamonds
which had escaped the pawnbroker sparkled on her fingers, neck, and
ears. Alexis could not discover in this ridiculous young lady his
Akulina. His father kissed her hand, and he, much to his annoyance,
had to do the same. As he touched her little white fingers they seemed
to tremble. He noticed, too, a tiny foot intentionally displayed and
shod in the most coquettish of[Pg 176] shoes. This reconciled him a little to
the rest of her attire. The white paint and black pencilling—to tell
the truth—in his simplicity he did not notice at first, nor indeed
afterwards.

Grigori Muromsky, remembering his promise, tried not to show surprise;
for the rest, he was so much amused at his daughter''s mischief, that
he could scarcely keep his countenance. For the prim Englishwoman,
however, it was no laughing matter. She guessed that the white and
black paint had been abstracted from her drawer, and a red patch of
indignation shone through the artificial whiteness of her face. Flaming
glances shot from her eyes at the young rogue, who, reserving all
explanation for the future, pretended not to notice them. They sat down
to table, Alexis continuing his performance as an absent-minded pensive
man. Lisa was all affectation. She minced her words, drawled, and would
speak only in French. Her father glanced at her from time to time,
unable to divine her object, but he thought it all a great joke. The
Englishwoman fumed, but said nothing. Ivan Berestoff alone felt at his
ease. He ate for two, drank his fill, and as the meal went on became
more and more friendly, and laughed louder and louder.

At last they rose from the table. The guests departed and Muromsky gave
vent to his mirth and curiosity.

"What made you play such tricks upon them?" he inquired. "Do you know,
Lisa, that white paint really becomes you? I do not wish to pry into
the secrets of a lady''s toilet, but if I were you I should always
paint, not too much, of course, but a little."

Lisa was delighted with her success. She kissed her father, promised
to consider his suggestion, and ran off to propitiate the enraged Miss
Jackson, whom she could scarcely prevail upon to open the door and hear
her excuses.

Lisa was ashamed, she said, to show herself before the visitors—such a
blackamoor. She had not dared to ask; she knew dear kind Miss Jackson
would forgive her.

Miss Jackson, persuaded that her pupil had not meant to ridicule her,
became pacified, kissed Lisa, and in token of forgiveness presented her
with a little pot of English white, which the latter, with expressions
of deep gratitude, accepted.

"You were yesterday at our master''s, sir?" she began to Alexis. "What
did you think of our young lady?"

"Oh! barin, it is a sin of you to say so. Our young lady is so fair,
so elegant! How can I vie with her?"

Alexis vowed that she was prettier than all imaginable fair young
ladies, and to appease her thoroughly, began describing her young lady
so funnily that Lisa burst into a hearty laugh.

"Still," she said, with a sigh, "though she may be ridiculous, yet by
her side I am an illiterate fool."

They sat down. Alexis produced a pencil and note-book, and Akulina
proved astonishingly quick in learning the alphabet. Alexis wondered at
her intelligence. At their next meeting she wished to learn to write.
The pencil at first would not obey her, but in a few minutes she could
trace the letters pretty well.

Indeed, at the third lesson Akulina could read words of even three
syllables, and the intelligent remarks with which she interrupted the
lessons fairly astonished Alexis. As for writing she covered a whole
page with aphorisms, taken from the story she had been reading. A week
passed and they had begun a correspondence. Their post-office was the
trunk of an old oak, and Nastia secretly played the part of postman.
Thither Alexis would bring his letters, written in a large round hand,
and there he found the letters of his beloved scrawled on coarse blue
paper. Akulina''s style was evidently improving, and her mind clearly
was developing under cultivation.

Meanwhile the new-made acquaintance between Berestoff and Muromsky
grew stronger, soon it became friendship. Muromsky often reflected
that on the death of old Berestoff his property would come to Alexis,
who would then be one of the richest landowners in that province. Why
should he not marry Lisa? Old Berestoff, on the other hand, though he
looked on his neighbour as a lunatic, did not deny that he possessed
many excellent qualities, among them a certain cleverness. Muromsky
was related to Count Pronsky, a distinguished and influential man.
The count might be very useful to Alexis, and Muromsky[Pg 180] (so thought
Berestoff) would probably be glad to marry his daughter so well. Both
the old men pondered all this so thoroughly that at last they broached
the subject, confabulated, embraced, and severally began a plan of
campaign. Muromsky foresaw one difficulty—how to persuade his Betty to
make the better acquaintance of Alexis, whom she had never seen since
the memorable dinner. They hardly seemed to suit each other well. At
any rate Alexis had not renewed his visit to Prelutchina. Whenever old
Berestoff called Lisa made a point of retreating to her own room.

"But," thought Muromsky, "if Alexis called every day Betty could not
help falling in love with him. That is the way to manage it. Time will
settle everything."

Berestoff troubled himself less about his plans. That same evening
he called his son into his study, lit his pipe, and, after a short
silence, began:

"You have not spoken about the army lately, Alexis. Has the Hussar
uniform lost its attraction for you?"

"No, father," he replied respectfully. "I know you do not wish me to
join the Hussars. It is my duty to consult your wishes."

"I am pleased to find you such an obedient son, still I do not wish
to force your inclinations.[Pg 181] I will not insist upon your entering the
Civil Service at once; and in the meantime I mean to marry you."

"You need not trouble yourself about that. All you have to do is to
respect the wishes of your father."

"You shall marry or I will curse you; and, by Heaven, I will sell and
squander my property, and not leave you a farthing! I will give you
three days for reflection, and, in the meanwhile, do not dare to show
your face in my presence."

Alexis knew that when his father took a thing into his head nothing
could knock it out again; but then Alexis was as obstinate as his
father.[Pg 182] He went to his room and there reflected upon the limits of
parental authority, on Lisa Muromskaia, his father''s threat to make him
a beggar, and finally he thought of Akulina.

For the first time he clearly saw how much he loved her. The romantic
idea of marrying a peasant girl and working for a living came into his
mind; and the more he thought of it, the more he approved it. Their
meetings in the wood had been stopped of late by the wet weather.

He wrote to Akulina in the roundest hand and the maddest style, telling
her of his impending ruin, and asking her to be his wife. He took
the letter at once to the tree trunk, dropped it in, and went much
satisfied with himself to bed.

Next morning, firm in resolution, he started early to call on Muromsky
and explain the situation. He meant to win him over by appealing to his
generosity.

"It will soon be over," he thought, going towards the drawing-room.
"I will explain to Miss Muromsky herself." He entered ... and was
transfixed. Lisa!... no, Akulina, dear, dark Akulina, wearing no
sarafan but a white morning frock, sat by the window reading his
letter. So intent was she upon it that she did not hear him enter.
Alexis could not repress a cry of delight. Lisa started, raised her
hand, cried out, and attempted to run away. He rushed to stop her.
"Akulina! Akulina!" Lisa tried to free herself.

Miss Jackson, who was an eye-witness of this scene, knew not what to
think. The door opened and Grigori Muromsky entered.

Kirdjali with his depredations brought terror upon the whole of
Moldavia. To give some idea of him I will relate one of his exploits.
One night he and the Arnout Michailaki fell together upon a Bulgarian
village. They set fire to it from both ends and went from hut to hut,
Kirdjali killing, while Michailaki carried off the plunder. Both cried,
"Kirdjali! Kirdjali!" and the whole village ran.

When Alexander Ipsilanti proclaimed the insurrection and began raising
his army, Kirdjali brought him several of his old followers. They
knew little of the real object of the hetairi. But war presented an
opportunity for getting rich at the expense of the Turks, and perhaps
of the Moldavians too.

Alexander Ipsilanti was personally brave, but[Pg 185] he was wanting in
the qualities necessary for playing the part he had with such eager
recklessness assumed. He did not know how to manage the people under
his command. They had neither respect for him nor confidence.

After the unfortunate battle, when the flower of Greek youth fell,
Jordaki Olimbisti advised him to retire, and himself took his place.
Ipsilanti escaped to the frontiers of Austria, whence he sent his
curse to the people whom he now stigmatised as mutineers, cowards, and
blackguards. These cowards and blackguards mostly perished within the
walls of the monastery of Seke, or on the banks of the Pruth, defending
themselves desperately against a foe ten times their number.

Kirdjali belonged to the detachment commanded by George CantacuzÃ¨ne, of
whom might be repeated what has already been said of Ipsilanti.

On the eve of the battle near Skuliana, CantacuzÃ¨ne asked permission
of the Russian authorities to enter their quarters. The band was left
without a commander. But Kirdjali, Sophianos, Cantagoni, and others had
no need of a commander.

The battle of Skuliana seems not to have been described by any one in
all its pathetic truth. Just imagine seven hundred Arnouts, Albanians,
Greeks, Bulgarians, and every kind of rabble, with no notion of
military art, retreating within[Pg 186] sight of fifteen thousand Turkish
cavalry. The band kept close to the banks of the Pruth, placing in
front two tiny cannons, found at Jassy, in the courtyard of the
Hospodar, and which had formerly been used for firing salutes on
festive occasions.

The Turks would have been glad to use their cartridges, but dared not
without permission from the Russian authorities; for the shots would
have been sure to fly over to our banks. The commander of the Russian
military post (now dead), though he had been forty years in the army,
had never heard the whistle of a bullet; but he was fated to hear it
now. Several bullets buzzed passed his ears. The old man got very angry
and began to swear at Ohotsky, major of one of the infantry battalions.
The major, not knowing what to do, ran towards the river, on the other
side of which some insurgent cavalry were capering about. He shook his
finger at them, on which they turned round and galloped along, with
the whole Turkish army after them. The major who had shaken his finger
was called Hortchevsky. I don''t know what became of him. The next day,
however, the Turks attacked the Arnouts. Hot daring to use cartridges
or cannon balls, they resolved, contrary to their custom, to employ
cold steel. The battle was fierce. The combatants slashed and stabbed
one another.

The Turks were seen with lances, which, hitherto they had never
possessed, and these lances were Russian. Our Nekrassoff refugees were
fighting in their ranks. The hetairi, thanks to the permission of our
Emperor, were allowed to cross the Pruth and seek the protection of our
garrison. They began to cross the river, Cantagoni and Sophianos being
the last to quit the Turkish bank; Kirdjali, wounded the day before,
was already lying in Russian quarters. Sophianos was killed. Cantagoni,
a very stout man, was wounded with a spear in his stomach. With one
hand he raised his sword, with the other he seized the enemy''s spear,
pushed it deeper into himself, and by that means was able to reach his
murderer with his own sword, when they fell together.

All was over. The Turks remained victorious, Moldavia was cleared of
insurgents. About six hundred Arnouts were scattered over Bessarabia.
Unable to obtain the means of subsistence, they still felt grateful
to Russia for her protection. They led an idle though not a dissolute
life. They could be seen in coffee-houses of half Turkish Bessarabia,
with long pipes in their mouths sipping thick coffee out of small cups.
Their figured Zouave jackets and red slippers with pointed toes were
beginning to look shabby. But they still wore their tufted scull-cap
on one side of the head; and daggers and pistols still[Pg 188] protruded
from beneath, their broad girdles. No one complained of them. It
was impossible to imagine that these poor, peaceable fellows were
the celebrated pikemen of Moldavia, the followers of the ferocious
Kirdjali, and that he himself had been one of them.

The Pasha governing Jassy heard of all this, and, on the basis of
treaty rights, requested the Russian authorities to deliver up the
brigand. The police made inquiries, and found that Kirdjali really was
at Kishineff. They captured him in the house of a runaway monk in the
evening, while he was at supper, sitting in the twilight with seven
comrades.

"But," he added, "since I crossed the Pruth, I have not touched a
hair of property that did not belong to me, nor have I cheated the
meanest gipsy. To the Turks, the Moldavians, and the Walachians I am
certainly a brigand, but to the Russians a guest. When Sophianos, after
exhausting all his cartridges, came over here, he collected buttons
from the uniforms, nails, watch-chains, and nobs from the daggers for
the final discharge, and I myself handed him twenty beshlÃ©ks to fire
off, leaving myself without money. God is my witness that I, Kirdjali,
lived by[Pg 189] charity. Why then do the Russians now hand me over to my
enemies?"

After that Kirdjali was silent, and quietly awaited his fate. It was
soon announced to him. The authorities, not thinking themselves hound
to look upon brigandage from its romantic side, and admitting the
justice of the Turkish demand, ordered Kirdjali to be given up that he
might be sent to Jassy.

A man of brains and feeling, at that time young and unknown, but
now occupying an important post, gave me a graphic description of
Kirdjali''s departure.

"At the gates of the prison," he said, "stood a hired karutsa.
Perhaps you don''t know what a karutsa is? It is a low
basket-carriage, to which quite recently used to be harnessed six or
eight miserable screws. A Moldavian, with a moustache and a sheepskin
hat, sitting astride one of the horses, cried out and cracked his whip
every moment, and his wretched little beasts went on at a sharp trot.
If one of them began to lag, then he unharnessed it with terrific
cursing and left it on the road, not caring what became of it. On the
return journey he was sure to find them in the same place, calmly
grazing on the steppes. Frequently a traveller starting from a station
with eight horses would arrive at the next with a pair only. It was
so about fifteen years ago. Now in[Pg 190] Russianized Bessarabia, Russian
harness and Russian telegas (carts) have been adopted.

"Such a karutsa as I have described stood at the gate of the jail in
1821, towards the end of September. Jewesses with their sleeves hanging
down and with flapping slippers, Arnouts in ragged but picturesque
costumes, stately Moldavian women with black-eyed children in their
arms, surrounded the harutsa. The men maintained silence. The women
were excited, as if expecting something to happen.

"The gates opened, and several police officers stepped into the street,
followed by two soldiers leading Kirdjali in chains.

"He looked about thirty. The features of his dark face were regular and
austere. He was tall, broad-shouldered, and seemed to possess great
physical strength. He wore a variegated turban on the side of his head,
and a broad sash round his slender waist. A dolman of thick, dark blue
cloth, the wide plaits of his over-shirt falling just above the knees,
and a pair of handsome slippers completed his dress. His bearing was
calm and haughty.

"One of the officials, a red-faced old man in a faded uniform, with
three buttons hanging loose, a pair of lead spectacles which pinched
a crimson knob doing duty for a nose, unrolled a paper, and stooping,
began to read in the Moldavian tongue.[Pg 191] From time to time he glanced
haughtily at the handcuffed Kirdjali, to whom apparently the document
referred. Kirdjali listened attentively. The official finished his
reading, folded the paper, and called out sternly to the people,
ordering them to make way for the karutsa to drive up. Then Kirdjali,
turning towards him, said a few words in Moldavian; his voice trembled,
his countenance changed, he burst into tears, and fell at the feet of
the police officer, with a clanking of his chains. The police officer,
in alarm, started back; the soldiers were going to raise Kirdjali, but
he got up of his own accord, gathered up his chains, and stepping into
the harutsa, cried egaida!''

"He asked me," replied the officer, smiling, "to take care of his
wife and child, who live a short distance from Kilia, in a Bulgarian
village; he is afraid they might suffer through him. The rabble are so
ignorant!''"

The young official''s story affected me greatly. I was sorry for poor
Kirdjali. For a long while I knew nothing of his fate. Many years
afterwards I met the young official. We began talking of old times.

After being brought to Jassy, Kirdjali was taken before the Pasha,
who condemned him to be impaled. The execution was postponed till
some feast day. Meanwhile he was put in confinement. The prisoner was
guarded by seven Turks—common people, and at the bottom of their
hearts brigands like himself. They respected him and listened with
the eagerness of true orientals to his wonderful stories. Between the
guards and their prisoner a close friendship sprang up. On one occasion
Kirdjali said to them:

"Brothers! My hour is near. No one can escape his doom. I shall soon
part from you, and I should like to leave you something in remembrance
of me." The Turks opened their ears.

"Brothers;" added Kirdjali, "three years back, when I was engaged in
brigandage with the late Mihailaki, we buried in the Steppes, not far
from Jassy, a kettle with some coins in it. Seemingly, neither he nor
I will ever possess that treasure. So be it; take it to yourselves and
divide it amicably."

The Turks nearly went crazy. They began considering how they could find
the spot so vaguely[Pg 193] indicated. They thought and thought, and at last
decided that Kirdjali must himself show them.

Night set in. The Turks took off the fetters that weighed upon the
prisoner''s feet, hound his hands with a rope, and taking him with them,
started for the Steppes. Kirdjali led them, going in a straight line
from one mound to another. They walked about for some time. At last
Kirdjali stopped close to a broad stone, measured a dozen steps to the
south, stamped, and said, "Here."

The Turks arranged themselves for work. Four took out their daggers and
began digging the earth, while three remained on guard. Kirdjali sat
down on the stone, and looked on.

"Not yet," replied the Turks, and they worked away till the
perspiration rolled like hail from them.

"What people!" he exclaimed; "they can''t even dig decently. Why, I
should have found it in two minutes. Children! Untie my hands, and give
me a dagger."

"Why not?" they concluded. "We will release his hands, and give him a
dagger. What can it matter? He is only one, while we are seven."

At last Kirdjali was free and armed. What must have been his
sensations. He began digging rapidly, the guard assisting. Suddenly he
thrust his dagger into one of them, leaving the blade sticking in the
man''s breast; he snatched from his girdle a couple of pistols.

Kirdjali is now carrying on his brigandage near Jassy. Not long ago
he wrote to the Hospodar, demanding from him five thousand louis, and
threatening, in the event of the money not being paid, to set fire to
Jassy, and to reach the Hospodar himself. The five thousand louis were
forwarded to him.

My parents, respectable but humble folk, had been brought up in the old
fashion. They never read anything; and beyond an alphabet (bought for
me), an almanack, and the latest letter-writer, they had no books in
the house.

The letter-writer had long provided me with entertainment. I knew it by
heart, yet daily found in it fresh beauties; and next to General N——,
to whom my father had been aide-de-camp, Kurganoff, its author, was,
in my estimation, one of the greatest men. I questioned everyone about
him; but unhappily no one could gratify my curiosity. Nobody knew him
personally. To all my questioning the reply was that Kurganoff was the
author of the latest letter-writer, but that I[Pg 196] knew already. He was
wrapped in darkness and mystery like some ancient demi-god. At times
I doubted even his existence. His name was perhaps an invention, the
legend about him an empty myth awaiting the investigation of some
new Niebuhr. Nevertheless he dogged my imagination. I tried to give
some form to this very personage, and finally decided that he must be
like the land-judge, Koriuchkin, a little old man with a red nose and
glittering eyes.

In 1812 I was taken to Moscow and placed at a boarding school belonging
to Karl Ivanovitch Meyer. There I stayed only some three months,
because the school broke up in anticipation of the enemy''s coming. I
returned to the country.

This epoch of my life was to me so important that I shall dilate upon
it, apologizing beforehand if I trespass upon the good nature of the
reader.

It was a dull autumn day. On reaching the station whence I must turn
off to Gorohina (that was the name of our village) I engaged horses,
and drove off by the country road. Though naturally calm, so impatient
was I to revisit the scenes where I had passed the best years of my
life, that I kept urging the driver to quicken speed with alternate
promises of vodka and threats of chastisement. How much easier it was
to belabour him than to unloose my purse.[Pg 197] I own I struck him twice or
thrice, a thing I had never done in my life before. I don''t know why,
but I had a great liking for drivers as a class.

The driver urged his troika to a quicker pace, but to me it seemed that
public-driver-like he coaxed the horses and waved his whip but at the
same time tightened the reins. At last I caught sight of Gorohina wood,
and in ten minutes more we drove into the courtyard of the manor house.

My heart beat violently. I looked round with unwonted emotion. For
eight years I had not seen Gorohina. The little birches which I had
seen planted near the palings had now grown into tall branching trees.
The courtyard, once adorned with three regular flower beds divided by
broad gravel paths, was now an unmown meadow, the grazing land of a red
cow.

My britchka stopped at the front door. My servant went to open it, but
it was fastened; yet the shutters were open, and the house seemed to be
inhabited. A woman emerging from a servant''s hut asked what I wanted.
Hearing the master had arrived, she ran back into the hut, and soon
I had all the inhabitants of the courtyard around me. I was deeply
touched to see the known and unknown faces, and I greeted each with a
friendly kiss.

The boys my playmates had grown to men. The girls who used to squat
upon the floor and run with such alacrity on errands were married
women. The men wept. To the women I said unceremoniously:

They led me towards the back entrance; I was met by my old
wet-nurse, by whom I was welcomed back with sobs and tears, like the
much-suffering Ulysses. They hastened to heat the bath. The cook, who
in his long holiday had grown a beard, offered to cook my dinner or
supper, for it was growing dark. The rooms hitherto occupied by my
nurse and my late mother''s maids were at once got ready for me. Thus I
found myself in the humble home of my parents, and fell asleep in that
room where three-and-twenty years before I had been born.

Some three weeks passed in business of various kinds. I was engaged
with land judges, presidents, and every imaginable official of the
province. Finally I got possession of my inheritance. I was contented:
but soon the dulness of inaction began to torment me. I was not
yet acquainted with my kind and venerable neighbour N—— Domestic
occupations were altogether[Pg 199] strange to me. The conversation of my
nurse, whom I promoted to the rank of housekeeper, consisted of fifteen
family anecdotes. I found them very interesting, but as she always
related them in the same way she soon became for me another Niebuhr
letter-writer, in which I knew precisely on what page every particular
line occurred. That worthy book I found in the storeroom among a
quantity of rubbish sadly dilapidated. I brought it out into the light
and began to read it; but Kurganoff had lost his charm. I read him
through once more and never after opened him again.

"Why not write myself?" The reader has been already told that I was
educated on copper money. Besides, to become an author seemed so
difficult, so unattainable, that the idea of writing quite frightened
me at first. Dare I hope ever to be numbered amongst writers, when my
ardent wish even to meet one had not yet been gratified? This reminds
me of something which I shall tell to show my unbounded enthusiasm for
my native literature.

In 1820, while yet an ensign, I chanced to be on government business at
Petersburg. I stayed a week; and although I had not one acquaintance
in he place, I passed the time very pleasantly. I went daily to the
theatre, modestly to the fourth[Pg 200] row in the gallery. I learnt the
names of all the actors and fell passionately in love with B——. She
had played one Sunday with great artistic feeling as Eulalie in Hass
und Reue (in English The Stranger.) In the morning, on my way from
headquarters, I would call at a small confectioner''s, drink a cup of
chocolate, and read a literary journal. One day, while thus deep in an
article "by Goodintention, some one in a pea-green greatcoat suddenly
approached and gently withdrew the Hamburg Gazette from under my
newspaper. I was so occupied that I did not look up. The stranger
ordered a steak and sat down facing me. I went on reading without
noticing him.

Meanwhile he finished his luncheon, scolded the waiter for some
carelessness, drank half a bottle of wine, and left. Two young men were
also lunching.

"The writer!" I exclaimed involuntarily, and leaving the article unread
and the cup of chocolate undrunk, I hastily paid my reckoning, and
without waiting for the change rushed into the street. Looking round I
descried in the distance the pea-green coat and dashed along the Nevsky
Prospect almost at a run. When I had gone several steps I[Pg 201] felt myself
stopped by some one, and looking back I found I had been noticed by an
officer of the guards. I; ought not to have knocked against him on the
pavement, but rather to have stopped and saluted. After this reprimand
I was more careful. Unluckily I met an officer every moment, and every
moment I had to stop, while the author got farther and farther away.
Never before had my soldier''s overcoat proved so irksome, never had
epaulettes appeared so enviable. At last near the Annitchkin Bridge I
came up with the pea-green greatcoat.

"May I inquire," I said, saluting, "are you Mr. Goodintention, whose
excellent article I have had the pleasure of reading in the Zealous
Enlightener?"

"Not at all," he replied. "I am not a writer but a lawyer. But I know
Goodintention very well. A quarter of an hour ago I passed him at the
Police Bridge." In this way my respect for Russian letters cost me
80 kopecks of change, an official reprimand, and a narrow escape of
arrest, and all in vain.

In spite of all the protest of my reason, the audacious thought of
becoming a writer kept recurring. At last, unable longer to resist it,
I made a thick copy book and resolved to fill it somehow. All kinds
of poems (humble prose did not yet enter into my reckoning) were in
turn[Pg 202] considered and approved. I decided to write an epic furnished on
Russian history. I was not long in finding a hero. I chose Rurik, and I
set to work.

I had acquired a certain aptitude for rhymes, by copying those in
manuscript which used to circulate among our officers, such as the
criticism on the Moscow Boulevards, the Presnensky Ponds, and the
Dangerous Neighbour. In spite of that my poem progressed slowly,
and at the third verse I dropped it. I concluded that the epic was
not my style, and began Rurik, a Tragedy. The tragedy halted. I
turned it into a ballad, but the ballad hardly seemed to do. At last
I had a happy thought. I began and succeeded in finishing an ode to a
portrait of Rurik. Despite the inauspicious character of such a title,
particularly for a young bard''s first work, I yet felt that I had not
been born a poet, and after this first attempt desisted. These essays
in authorship gave me so great a taste for writing that I could now no
longer abstain from paper and ink. I could descend to prose. But at
first I wished to avoid the preliminary construction of a plot and the
connection of parts. I resolved to write detached thoughts without any
connection or order, just as they struck me. Unfortunately the thoughts
would not come, and in the course of two whole days the only thought
that struck me was the following:

He who disobeys reason and yields to the inclination of his passions
often goes wrong and ends by repenting when it is too late.

Abandoning aphorism I took to tales; but being too unpractised in
arranging incidents I selected such remarkable occurrences as I had
heard of at various times and tried to ornament the truth by a lively
style and the flowers of my own imagination. Composing these tales
little by little, I formed my style and learnt to express myself
correctly, pleasantly, and freely. My stock was soon exhausted, and I
again began to seek a subject.

To abandon these childish anecdotes of doubtful authenticity, and
narrate real and great events instead, was an idea by which I had long
been haunted.

To be the judge, the observer, and the prophet of ages and of peoples
seemed to me a most attainable object of ambition to a writer. What
history could I write—I with my pitiable education? Where was I not
forestalled by highly cultivated and conscientious men? What history
had they left unexhausted. Should I write a universal history? But was
there not already the immortal work of AbbÃ© Millot. A national history
of Russia, what could I say after Tatishtcheff Bolitin and Golikoff?
And was it for me to burrow amongst records and[Pg 204] to penetrate the
occult meaning of a dead language—for me who could never master the
Slavonian alphabet? Why not try a history on a smaller scale?—for
instance, the history of our town! But even here how very numerous
and insuperable seemed the obstacles—a journey to the town, a visit
to the governor and the bishop, permission to examine the archives,
the monastery, the cellars, and so on. The history of our town would
have been easier; but it could interest neither the philosopher nor
the artist, and afford but little opening for eloquence. The only
noteworthy record in its annals relates to a terrible fire ten years
ago which burnt the bazaar and the courts of justice. An accident
settled my doubts. A woman hanging linen in a loft found an old
basket full of shavings, dust, and books. The whole household knew my
passion for reading. My housekeeper while I sat over my paper gnawing
my pen and meditating on the experience of country prophets entered
triumphantly dragging a basket into my room, and bringing joyfully
"books! books!"

Books! I repeated in delight as I rushed to the basket. Actually a pile
of them with covers of green and of blue paper. It was a collection of
old almanacks. My ardour was cooled by the discovery, still they were
books, and I generously rewarded her pains with half a silver ruble.

When she had gone I began to examine my[Pg 205] almanacks; I soon became
absorbed. They formed a complete series from 1744 to 1799 including
exactly 55 years. The blue sheets of paper usually bound in the
almanacks were covered with old-fashioned handwriting. Skimming these
lines I noticed with surprise that besides remarks on the weather
and accounts they contained scraps of historical information about
the village of Gorohina. Among these valuable documents I began my
researches, and soon found that they presented a full history of my
native place for nearly a century, in chronological order, besides an
exhaustive store of economical, statistical, meteorological, and other
learned information. Thenceforth the study of these documents took up
my time, for I perceived that from them a stately, instructive, and
interesting history could be made. As I became sufficiently acquainted
with these valuable notes, I began to search for new sources of
information about the village of Gorohina, and I soon became astonished
at the wealth of material. After devoting six months to a preliminary
study of them, I at last began the long wished for work; and by God''s
grace completed the same on the 3rd of November, 1827. To-day, like a
fellow-historian, whose name I do not recollect, having finished my
hard task, I lay down my pen and sadly walk into my garden to meditate
upon my performance. It seems even to me that now the[Pg 206] history of
Gorohina is finished I am no longer wanted in the world. My task is
ended; and it is time for me to die.

I. A collection of ancient almanacks in fifty fifty—five parts. Of
these the first twenty are covered with an old-fashioned writing;
much abbreviated. The manuscript is that of my grandfather; Andrei
Stepanovitch Belkin; and is remarkably clear and concise. For example:
4th of May. Snow.

Trishka for his impertinence beaten. 6th. The red cow died. Senka for
drunkenness beaten. 8th. A fine day. 9th. Rain and snow. Trishka for
drunkenness beaten.... and so on without comment. 11th. The weather
fine, first snow; hunted three hares. The remaining thirty-five parts
were in various hands mostly commercial with or without abbreviations,
usually profuse; disjointed; and incorrectly written. Here and there a
feminine handwriting appeared. In these years occurred my grandfather''s
notes about his wife Bupraxic Aleksevna; others written by her and
others by the steward Grobovitsky.

II. The notes of the Gorohina church clerk. This curious manuscript
was discovered by me at the house of my priest; who has married the
daughter of the writer. The first earlier sheets[Pg 207] had been torn out and
used by the priests children for making kites. One of these had fallen
in the middle of my yard. I picked it up? and was about to restore it
to the children when I noticed that it was written on. From the first
lines I saw that the kite was made out of some one''s journal. Luckily I
was in time to save the rest. These journals, which I got for a measure
of oats, are remarkable for depth of thought and dignity of expression.

III. Oral legends. I despised no source of information, but I am
specially indebted for much of this to Agrafena Tryphonovna, the mother
of Avdei the starosta and reputed mistress of the steward Grobovitsky.

IV. Registry reports with remarks by the former starosta on the
morality and condition of the peasants.

The foundation of Gorohina and the history of its original inhabitants
are lost in obscurity. Dark legend tells how that Gorohina was once a
large and wealthy village, that all its inhabitants were rich, that
the obrok (the land proprietor''s tithes) was collected once a year and
carted off in loads no one knew to whom. At that time everything was
bought cheap and sold dear. There were no stewards, and the elders
dealt fairly by[Pg 208] all. The inhabitants worked little and lived merrily.
The shepherds as they watched their flocks wore boots. We must not be
deceived by this charming picture. The notion of a golden age is common
to all nations, and only proves that as people are never contented with
the present, and derive from experience small hope for the future,
they adorn the irrevocable past with all the hues of fancy. What is
certain, however, is that the village of Gorohina from ancient times
has belonged to the distinguished race of Belkins. But these ancestors
of mine had many other estates, and paid but little attention to this
remote village. Gorohina paid small tithe and was managed by elders
elected by the people in common council.

At that early period the inheritance of the Belkins was broken up, and
fell in value. The impoverished grandchildren of the rich grandsire,
unable to give up their luxurious habits, required from an estate now
only producing one tenth of its former revenue the full income of
former times. Threats followed threats. The starosta read them out in
common council. The elders declaimed, the commune agitated, and the
masters, instead of the double tithes, received tiresome excuses and
humble complaints written on dirty paper and sealed with a polushka
(less than a farthing).

A sombre cloud hung over Gorohina; but no[Pg 209] one heeded it. In the last
year of Tryphon''s power, the last of the starostas chosen by the
people, the day of the church festival, when the whole population
either crowded noisily round the house of entertainment (the
public-house) or wandered through the streets embracing one another
or loudly singing the songs of Arhip the Bald, there drove into the
courtyard a covered hired britchka drawn by a couple of half-dead
screws, with a ragged Jew upon the box. From the britchka a head in a
cap looked out and seemed to peer curiously at the merry-making crowd.
The inhabitants greeted the carriage with laughter and rude jokes.
With the flaps of their coats turned up the madmen mocked the Jewish
driver, shouting in doggrell rhyme, "Jew, Jew, eat a pig''s ear." But
how great was their astonishment (wrote the clerk) when the carriage
stopped in the middle of the village and the occupant jumped out, and
in an authoritative voice called for the starosta Tryphon. This officer
was in the house of pleasure, whence two elders led him forth holding
him under the arms. The stranger looked at him sternly, handed him a
letter, and told him to read it at once. The starostas of Gorohina
were in the habit of never reading anything themselves. The rural
clerk Avdei was sent for. He was found asleep under a hedge and was
brought before the stranger. But either from the sudden fright or from
a sad[Pg 210] fore-boding, the words distinctly written in the letter appeared
to him in a mist, and he could not read them. The stranger sent the
starosta Tryphon and the rural clerk Avdei with terrible curses to
bed, postponing the reading of the letter till the morrow and entered
the office hut, whither the Jew carried his small trunk. The people
of Gorohina looked in amazement at this unusual incident, but the
carriage, the stranger, and the Jew were quickly forgotten. They ended
their day with noise and merriment, and Gorohina went to sleep without
presentiments of the future.

At sunrise the inhabitants were awakened with knockings at the windows
and a call to a meeting of the commune. The citizens one after the
other appeared in the courtyard round the office hut, which served as
a council ground. Their eyes were dim and red, their faces swollen;
yawning and scratching their heads, they stared at the man with the
cap, in an old blue caftan, standing pompously on the steps of the
office hut, while they tried to recollect his features, which they
seemed to have seen some time or another.

The starosta and his clerk Avdei stood by his side, bareheaded, with
the same expression of dejection and sorrow.

"The whole hundred," replied the citizens,[Pg 211] when, the starosta informed
them that he had received a letter from the master, and, directed the
clerk to read it aloud to the commune. Avdei stepped forward and read
as follows:

N.B. This alarming document, which he kept carefully shut up in the
icon-case, together with other memorandum of his authority over the
people of Gorohina, I copied at the house of Tryphon, our starosta.

"The bearer of this letter, my agent.... is going to my patrimony,
the village of Gorohina, to assume the management of it. Directly he
arrives assemble the peasants and make known to them their master''s
wishes; namely, that they are to obey my agent as they would myself,
and attend to his orders without demur; otherwise he is empowered to
treat them with great severity. I have been forced to take this step
by their shameless disobedience and your, Tryphon Ivanoff, roguish
indulgence.

Then the agent, with his legs extended like an X and his arms akimbo
like a phitab, addressed to them the following pithy speech: "See that
you are not too troublesome, or I will certainly beat the folly out
of your heads quicker than the fumes of[Pg 212] yesterday''s drink." There
were no longer any fumes left in the head of any man of Gorohina. All
were dumbfounded, hung their noses, and dispersed in fear to their own
houses. The agent seized the reins of government, called for the list
of peasants, divided them into rich and poor, and began to carry into
effect his political system, which deserves particular description. It
was founded upon the following maxims: That the richer a peasant, the
more fractious he grows, and the poorer, the quieter.

First, the deficits were distributed among the rich peasants, and were
exacted from them with the greatest severity. Second, the defaulting
or idle hands were forthwith set to plough, and if their labour proved
insufficient according to his standard, he assigned them as workmen
to the other peasants, who paid him for this a voluntary tax. The men
given as bondsmen, on the other hand, possessed the right of redeeming
themselves by paying, besides their deficit, a double annual tithe. All
the communal obligations were thrown upon the rich peasants. But the
recruiting arrangements were the masterpiece of the avaricious ruler,
for by turns all the rich peasants bought themselves off, till at last
the choice fell upon either the blackguard or the ruined one.

Communal assemblies were abolished. The tithes were collected in small
sums and all the year round. The peasants, it seems, did not pay very
much more than before, but they could not earn or save enough to pay.
In three years Gorohina was quite pauperised. Gorohina quieted down;
the bazaar was empty, the songs of Arhip the Bald were unsung, one
half the men were ploughing in the fields, the other half serving
them as bond labourers. The children went begging, and the day of the
church fÃªte became, according to the historian, not a day of joy and
exultation, but an annual mourning and commemoration of sorrow.

The accursed steward put Anton Timofeieff into irons, but the old man
Timofei bought his son''s freedom for one hundred rubles. The steward
then put the irons on Petrusha Gremeieff, who likewise was ransomed
by his father for sixty-eight rubles. The accursed one then wanted to
handcuff Lech Tarassoff, but he escaped into the woods, to the regret
of the steward, who vented his rage in words; but sent to town in place
of Lech Tarassoff Vanka the drunkard, and gave him for a soldier as a
substitute.

Amongst the young men sent abroad by Peter the Great to acquire the
information necessary for a civilised country was his godson Ibrahim
the negro. He was educated in a Parisian military school, passed out
as a captain of the artillery, distinguished himself in the Spanish
war, and when seriously wounded returned to Paris. In the midst of his
enormous labours the emperor never ceased to ask after his favourite,
of whose progress and good conduct the accounts were always favourable.
Peter was exceedingly pleased with him, and frequently invited him to
Russia; but Ibrahim was in no hurry. He excused himself; either his
wound, or his wish to complete his education, or want of money, served
as the pretext; and Peter complied with his wishes,[Pg 215] begged him to take
care of his health, thanked him for his assiduity in study, and though
exceedingly economical himself was lavish to his protÃ©gÃ©, and sent
together with gold pieces fatherly advice and warning.

Judging by all historical accounts, the flightiness, madness, and
luxury of the French of that period were unequalled. The latter years
of Louis XIV.''s reign, memorable for the strict piety, dignity,
and propriety of the court, have left no traces behind. The Duke
of Orleans, in whom many brilliant qualities united with vice of
every kind, unfortunately did not possess an atom of hypocrisy. The
orgies of the Palais Royal were no secret in Paris; the example was
infectious. At that time Law made his appearance. To the love of money
was united the thirst for pleasure and amusement. Estates dwindled,
morals perished, Frenchmen laughed and discussed, while the kingdom
crumbled to the jovial tunes of satirical vaudevilles. Meanwhile
society presented a most uninteresting picture. Culture and the
craving for amusement united all classes. Riches, amiability, renown,
accomplishments, even eccentricity, whatever nourished curiosity or
promised entertainment, was received with equal pleasure. Literature,
learning, and philosophy left the seclusion of the study to appear in
the great world and minister to fashion, the ruler of opinions. Women
reigned,[Pg 216] but no longer exacted adoration. Superficial politeness took
the place of profound respect. The escapades of the Duke de Richelieu,
the Alcibiades of modern Athens, belong to history and display the
morals of that period:

"Temps Fortune, marquÃ© par la licence,
Ou la folie, agitant son grelot,
D''un pied leger parcourt toute la France,
Ou nul mortel ne daigne Ãªtre dÃ©vot,
Ou l''on fait tout exceptÃ© pÃ©nitence."

Ibrahim''s arrival, his appearance, culture, and native wit, attracted
general attention in Paris. All the ladies fought for a visit from
the Tsar''s negro. More than once was he invited to the Regent''s merry
evenings; he was present at the suppers enlivened by the youth of
Voltaire and the age of Shollier, the conversations of Montesquieu
and Fontenelle. Not a ball, not a fÃªte, not one first representation
did he miss; and he gave himself up to the general whirl with all the
passion of his youth and nature. But the idea of exchanging these
entertainments, these brilliant pleasures for the simplicity of the St.
Petersburg Court was not all that Ibrahim dreaded. Other and stronger
ties bound him to Paris. The young African was in love. No longer in
the first bloom of youth, the Countess L. was still celebrated for
her beauty. At seventeen, on leaving the[Pg 217] convent, she was married to
a man for whom she had not learnt to feel the love which ultimately
he showed no care to win. Rumour assigned her lovers, but through
the leniency of society she still enjoyed a good repute; for nothing
ridiculous or scandalous could be brought against her. Her house was
the most fashionable, a centre of the best society in Paris. Ibrahim
was introduced by young G. de Merville, who was regarded generally
as her latest lover; an impression which he tried by every means to
strengthen. The Countess received Ibrahim with civility, but without
particular attention. He was flattered. Usually the young negro was
regarded with wonder, surrounded and overwhelmed with attention
and questions; and this curiosity, though veiled by a display of
friendliness, offended his vanity.

The delightful attention of women, almost the sole aim of our
exertions, not only gave him no pleas are, but even ailed him with
bitterness and wrath. He felt that he was for them a species of rare
animal, a strange peculiar creature, accidentally brought into a
world with which he had naught in common. He even envied those whom
no one noticed, and deemed their insignificance a blessing. The idea
that nature had not formed him for tender passion robbed him of all
self-assertion and conceit, and added a rare charm to his manner
towards women. His conversation was[Pg 218] simple and dignified. He pleased
the Countess L., who was tired of the formal pleasantries and pointed
innuendoes of French, wit.

Ibrahim visited her often. Little by little she grew used to the young
negro''s looks, and even began to find something agreeable in that early
head, so black amid the powdered wigs that thronged her drawing-room
(Ibrahim had been wounded in the head and wore a bandage in the place
of a wig). He was twenty-seven, tall and well built, and more than one
beauty glanced at him with feelings more flattering to him than mere
curiosity. But Ibraham either did not observe them or thought their
notice merely coquetry. But when his gaze met that of the Countess his
mistrust vanished. Her eyes expressed so much kindness, her manner to
him was so simple, so easy, that it was impossible to suspect her of
the least coquetry or insincerity.

Though no thought of love entered his mind, to see the Countess daily
had become a necessity. He tried to meet her everywhere, and every
meeting seemed a godsend. The Countess guessed his feelings before he
did so himself. There is no doubt that a love which hopes nothing and
asks nothing touches the female heart more surely than all the arts of
the experienced. When Ibrahim was near, the Countess followed all his
movements,[Pg 219] listened to all his words. Without him she became pensive,
and fell into her usual abstraction. Merville was first to notice their
mutual attraction, and congratulated Ibrahim. Nothing inflames love
like approving comments of outsiders. Love is blind, and putting no
trust in itself clings eagerly to every support.

Merville''s words roused Ibrahim. Hope suddenly dawned upon his soul;
he fell madly in love. In vain the Countess, alarmed by the vehemence
of his passion, wished to meet him with friendly warnings and sage
counsels; but she herself was growing weak.

Nothing escapes the eye of the vigilant world. The Countess''s new
attachment soon became known. Some ladies wondered at her choice;
many found him very ordinary. Some laughed; others considered her
inexcusably imprudent. In the first intoxication of their passion
Ibrahim and the Countess noticed nothing, but soon the jokes of the
men, the sarcasms of the women, began to reach them. Ibrahim''s formal
and cold manner had hitherto guarded him from such attacks; he bore
them with impatience, and knew not how to retaliate. The Countess,
accustomed to the respect of society, could not calmly endure to see
herself an object of ridicule and scandal. She complained to Ibrahim
either with tears or bitter reproaches; then she begged him not to
take[Pg 220] her part, nor ruin her completely by useless disturbance.

Fresh circumstances complicated her position still more: results of her
imprudent love began to show themselves. The Countess in distress told
Ibrahim. Consolation, advice, suggestions were in turn exhausted and
rejected. She foresaw her inevitable ruin, and in despair awaited it.
Immediately the Countesses condition became known, reports circulated
with renewed vigour. Sensitive women exclaimed in horror; the men made
bets whether she would bear a white or a black child. Epigrams poured
in about her husband, who alone in all Paris suspected nothing. The
fatal moment approached, the Countess was in a terrible state. Ibrahim
called every day. He saw her strength of mind and body gradually
failing. Her tears and terror increased momentarily. At last she felt
the first throes. Measures were taken hurriedly. Means were found to
get the Count out of the way. The doctor arrived. Two days previous
to this a poor woman had been persuaded to resign into the hands of
strangers her new-born infant, for which a messenger was sent.

Ibrahim remained in the study next the bedroom where the unhappy
Countess lay, scarcely daring to breathe; he heard muffled groans, the
maidservants whispers, and the doctor''s[Pg 221] directions. She suffered long.
Each groan lacerated Ibrahim''s heart, and every silent pause filled
him with dread; suddenly he heard the weak cry of a child, and unable
to control his delight rushed into the Countess''s room. A black infant
lay on the bed at her feet. Ibrahim approached it. His heart throbbed
violently. He blessed his son with a trembling hand. The Countess with
a faint smile stretched towards him a feeble hand, but the doctor,
fearing too much excitement for his patient, dragged Ibrahim away from
her bedside. The new-born babe was laid in a covered basket and carried
out by a secret staircase. The other child was brought in, and its
cradle placed in the bedroom. Ibrahim left feeling a trifle calmer. The
Count was expected. He returned late, heard of the happy confinement
of his wife, and was much pleased. Thus the public, which expected
a great scandal, was disappointed, and forced to be satisfied with
backbiting. Everything fell back into its usual routine. But Ibrahim
felt that his life must undergo a change, and that his intimacy must
sooner or later become known to Count L. In which case, whatever might
ensue, the Countess''s ruin was inevitable. Ibrahim loved and was loved
with passion; but the Countess was wilful and flighty; and this was
not her first love. Disgust and hatred might in her heart replace[Pg 222]
the tenderest feelings. Ibrahim already foresaw the time of her
indifference. Hitherto he had not known jealousy, but now with horror
he anticipated, it. Convinced that the anguish of a separation would be
less painful, he resolved to break off this luckless connection, quit
Paris, and return to Russia, whither Peter and a dull sense of duty had
long been calling him.

Days and months passed, and love-sick Ibrahim could not resolve to
leave the woman he had wronged. The Countess from hour to hour grew
more attached to him. Their son was being brought up in a distant
province; social scandal was subsiding, and the lovers began to enjoy
greater tranquillity, in silence remembering the past storm and trying
not to think of the future.

One day Ibrahim was standing at the Duke of Orleans'' door. The Duke
passing him, stopped, handed him a letter, and bade him read it at his
leisure. It was a letter from Peter I. The Tsar, guessing the real
cause of his absence, wrote to the Hake that he in no way desired to
compel Ibrahim, and left it to his free will to[Pg 223] return to Russia or
not; but that in any case he should never forsake his foster-child.
This letter touched Ibrahim to the heart. From that moment his decision
was made. Next day he announced to the Regent his intention to start
immediately for Russia.

"Consider the step you are about to take," replied the Duke. "Russia is
not your home. I don''t think you will ever have a chance of seeing your
torrid Africa, and your long residence in France has made you equally
a stranger to the climate and the semi-barbarous life of Russia. You
were not born one of Peter''s subjects. Take my advice, profit by his
generous permission, stay in France, for which you have already shed
your blood, and be convinced that here your services and talents will
not be left without their due reward."

Ibrahim was soon ready for the journey. On the eve of his departure
he passed the evening as usual at the Countess L''s. She knew nothing.
Ibrahim had not the courage to tell her. The Countess was calm and
cheerful. She several[Pg 224] times called him to her and joked about
his pensiveness. After supper everybody had gone, leaving in the
drawing-room only the Countess, her husband, and Ibrahim. The unhappy
man would have given the world to be left alone with her; but Count L.
seemed to be settled so comfortably near the grate that it appeared
hopeless to wait to see him out of the room. All three remained silent.

Still he did not move. At last his eyes became dim, his head went
round, and he could scarcely get out of the room.

"I am going, dearest Leonora, to leave you for ever. I write because I
have not the strength to tell you otherwise. Our happiness could not
continue; I have enjoyed it against the will of destiny and nature.
You must in time have ceased to love me. The enchantment must have
vanished. This idea has always haunted me, even when I seemed to
forget all, when at your feet I was intoxicated by your[Pg 225] passionate
self-abnegation, by your boundless tenderness. The thoughtless world
mercilessly persecute that which in theory it permits. Sooner or later
its cold irony would have vanquished you, and cowed your passionate
soul, till finally you would have been ashamed of your love.

"Better to die; better to leave you before that terrible moment. Your
happiness to me is more precious than all; you could not enjoy it,
while the gaze of society was fixed upon us. Remember all you have
endured, your wounded pride, the torture of fear; the terrible birth
of our son. Think; ought I any longer to subject you to such fears and
dangers? Why should I endeavour to unite the fate of so tender, so
beautiful a creature with the miserable life of a negro, a pitiable
object scarce worthy of the name of man?

"Forgive me, Leonora; dear and only friend. In leaving you, I leave
the first and last joy of my heart. I have no fatherland nor kin. I go
to Russia, where my utter solitude will be my joy. Serious pursuits
to which from henceforth I devote myself, if they do not silence must
at any rate distract painful recollections of the days of rapture.
Farewell, Leonora! I tear myself away from this letter, as if from your
embrace. Farewell, be happy, and think sometimes[Pg 226] of the poor negro, of
your faithful Ibrahim."

The same night he started for Russia. The journey did not seem as
terrible as he had expected. His imagination triumphed over fact. The
further he got from Paris the nearer and more vivid seemed to him all
the objects he was leaving for ever.

Imperceptibly he reached the Russian frontier. Autumn had already set
in, but the hired relays, notwithstanding the badness of the roads,
brought him with the swiftness of the wind, and on the seventeenth
morning he arrived at Krasnoe Selo, through which at that time passed
the high road.

There remained twenty-eight versts'' journey to St. Petersburg. While
the horses were being changed Ibrahim entered the posting-house. In a
corner a tall man, in a green caftan and a clay pipe in his mouth, sat
leaning against the table reading the Hamburg Gazette. Hearing some
one enter he raised his head.

Ibrahim recognised Peter, and in his delight rushed at him, but stopped
respectfully. The monarch approached, put his arms round him, and
kissed him on the forehead.

"I was told of your coming," said Peter, "and drove off to meet you. I
Pave been waiting for you here since yesterday."

"Tell them," added the Tsar, "to let your carriage follow us, while you
get in by my side and drive to my place."

The Tsar''s calÃ¨che was announced; he and Ibrahim got in and started at
a gallop. In an hour and a half they reached St. Petersburg. Ibrahim
looked with interest at the new-born city, which had sprung up by the
will of the Tsar. The bare banks, the canals without quays, the wooden
bridges, everywhere bore witness to the recent triumph of human will
over the elements. The houses seemed to have been hurriedly built.
The whole town contained nothing magnificent but the Neva, not yet
decorated with its granite framework, but already covered with ships
of war and merchantmen. The Tsar''s calÃ¨che drew up at the palace,
i.e. at the Tsaritsa''s garden. On the door-steps Peter was met by a
woman about thirty-five, handsome, and dressed in the latest Parisian
fashion. Peter kissed her, and, taking Ibrahim by the hand, said:

Catherine turned on him her black searching[Pg 228] eyes, and graciously held
out her hand. Two young beauties, tall and shapely, and fresh as roses,
stood behind her and respectfully approached Peter.

"Lisa," he said to one, "do you remember the little negro who stole
apples from me at Oranienburgh to give to you? Here he is, I introduce
him to you."

The grand duchess laughed and blushed. They went into the dining-room.
In expectation of the Tsar the table had been laid. Peter, having
invited Ibrahim, sat down with all his family to dinner. During dinner
the Tsar talked to him on different topics, inquiring about the Spanish
war, the internal affairs of Prance and the Regent, whom he liked,
though he found in his conduct much to blame. Ibrahim displayed an
accurate and observant mind. Peter was much pleased with his answers;
remembering some incidents of Ibrahim''s childhood, he related them with
such good-humoured merriment that no one could have suspected this kind
and hospitable host to be the hero of Poltava, the mighty and terrible
reformer of Russia.

After dinner the Tsar, according to the Russian custom, retired to
rest. Ibrahim remained with the empress and the grand duchesses. He
tried to satisfy their curiosity, described Parisian life, their fÃªtes
and capricious fashions. In the[Pg 229] mean-while, some of the emperor''s
suite assembled in the palace. Ibrahim recognised the magnificent
Prince Menshikoff, who, seeing the negro conversing with Catherine,
cast him a scornful glance; Prince Jacob Dolgoruki, Peter''s stern
counsellor; the learned Bruce, known among the people as the Russian
Paustus; young Bagusinski, his former companion, and others who had
come to the Tsar to bring reports and receive instructions. In a couple
of hours the Tsar came out.

"Let us see," he said to Ibrahim, "if you remember your old duties.
Get a slate and follow me." Peter locked himself in the carpenter''s
room and was engaged with state affairs. He worked alternately with
Bruce, Prince Dolgoruki, General Police-master DeviÃ¨re, and dictated
to Ibrahim several ukases and decisions. Ibrahim was struck by the
rapidity and firmness of his decision, the strength and the pliability
of his intellect, and the variety of his occupations. When his work
was ended Peter took out a pocket book to compare the notes and see if
he had got through all he had meant to do that day. Then quitting the
carpenter''s workroom he said to Ibrahim:

"It is late; I dare say you are tired, sleep the night here, as in the
old time; to-morrow I will wake you."

Ibrahim, left alone, could hardly realise that he was again at St.
Petersburg, in the[Pg 230] presence of the great man; near whom, not yet
aware of his great worth, he had spent his childhood. It was almost
with regret that he confessed to himself that the Countess L. for the
first time since they parted had not been his sole thought throughout
the day. He saw that in the new mode of life awaiting him, work and
continual activity might revive his soul, exhausted by passion,
indolence, and secret sorrow. The idea of being the great man''s
assistant, and with him influencing the fate of a mighty people, awoke
in him for the first time the noble feeling of ambition. In this humour
he lay down upon the camp bed prepared for him,—and then the usual
dreams carried him back to distant Paris, to the arms of his dear
countess.

Next morning, according to his promise, Peter woke Ibrahim and greeted
him as lieutenant-captain of the Preobrajensky regiment, in which he
himself was captain. The courtiers flocked round Ibrahim, each one in
his own way trying to welcome the new favourite.

The haughty Prince Menshikoff gave him a friendly grasp of the hand.
Sheremetieff inquired[Pg 231] after his own Parisian friend, and Golovin asked
him to dinner. Others followed his example, so that Ibrahim received
invitations for at least a whole month.

His life was now passed in regular but active occupation; consequently
he was not dull. Prom day to day he became more attached to the Tsar,
and grew better able to appreciate his lofty character. The thoughts
of a great man are a most interesting study. Ibrahim saw Peter in the
Senate debating with Buturlin and Dolgoruki, discussing important
questions in the Admiralty, fostering the Russian navy,—in his
leisure, with Theophan, Gavril, Bujinski, and Kopievitch, examining
translations from foreign publications, or visiting a factory, an
artizan''s workshop, or the study of some learned man. Russia became
to Ibrahim one vast workshop, where machinery alone moved, where each
workman under ordered rules is occupied with his own task.

He felt that he too must work at his own bench, and tried to regret
as little as possible the amusements of his Parisian life. But if
was hander to forget a dearer memory. Often he thought of Countess
L., her just indignation, her tears, and grief. At times a terrible
thought oppressed him: the distractions of society: new ties: another
favourite. He shuddered; jealousy began to rage in his African blood,
and burning[Pg 232] tears were ready to flow down his swarthy face.

One morning he was sitting in his study amid official documents, when
he heard himself loudly greeted in French. Turning quickly round he was
embraced with joyous exclamations by young Korsakoff, whom he had left
in Paris in the whirl of the great world.

"I have only just arrived," said Korsakoff "and came straight to you.
All our Parisian friends desire to be remembered to you, and regret
your absence. The Countess L. requested me to invite you without fail,
and here is her letter for you."

Ibrahim seized it eagerly, and was looking at the familiar writing on
the envelope, scarcely believing his own eyes.

"How glad I am," added Korsakoff, "that you have not been bored to
death in this barbarous Petersburg. How do they manage here? What do
they do? Who is your tailor? Have they started an opera?"

"I see," he said, "you are preoccupied, and don''t want me just now.
Another time we will have a good talk; I am off to present my respects[Pg 233]
to his Majesty." With these words he turned on his heel, and hurried
out of the room.

Left alone Ibrahim quickly opened the letter. The countess complained
tenderly, reproached him with falseness and inconstancy.

"You used to say," she wrote, "that my happiness was more to you than
all the world. Ibrahim, if this were true, could you have left me in
the state to which the sudden news of your departure brought me. You
were afraid I might detain you. Be assured that, in spite of my love,
I should have known how to sacrifice it for your good and to what you
deem your duty."

The countess ended with passionate assurances of love, begging him to
write, if only occasionally, and even if there were no hope that they
would ever meet again.

Ibrahim read and re-read this letter twenty times, rapturously kissing
those precious lines. Burning with impatience for news about the
countess, he set out for the Admiralty, hoping to find his friend still
there, when the door opened, and Korsakoff re-entered. He had seen the
Tsar, and he seemed as usual perfectly self-satisfied.

"Between ourselves," he said to Ibrahim, "the Tsar is a most
extraordinary man. Fancy! I found him in a sort of linen vest on the
mast of a new ship, whither I had to scramble with my dispatches.[Pg 234] I
stood on a rope ladder, and had not room enough to make a proper bow.
I lost my presence of mind for the first time in all my life. However,
the Tsar, when he had read my papers, looked at me from head to foot.
Ho doubt he was agreeably impressed by my good taste and splendid
attire. At any rate he smiled, and invited me to the assembly today.
But I am a perfect stranger in Petersburg. For my six years'' absence I
have quite forgotten the local customs. Please be my mentor; call for
me on your way, and introduce me."

"The countess? At first she was naturally most unhappy at your
departure; then, of course by degrees, she grew reconciled, and took
to herself another lover—who do you think? The lanky Marquis R. Why
do you open those African eyes of yours? Does this appear to you so
strange? Don''t you know that enduring grief is not in human nature,
particularly in a woman. Meditate duly upon that while I go and rest
after my journey, and don''t forget to call for me on your way."

What terrible thoughts crowded Ibrahim''s soul? Jealousy? Rage?
Despair?—Ho!—but a deep, crushing sorrow.

He murmured to himself. I foresaw it, it was bound to happen. Then he
opened the countess''s letter, read it over again, hung his head, and
wept bitterly. Long did he weep. Those tears relieved him. He looked
at his watch and found that it was time to start. Gladly would he have
stayed away, but the party was an affair of duty, and the Tsar was
strict in exacting the attendance of those attached to him.

He dressed and started to fetch Korsakoff. Korsakoff was sitting in his
dressing gown, reading a French book.

"Excuse me," the other replied, "it''s already half-past five, we shall
be late; make haste and dress, and let us go."

Korsakoff hurriedly rang the bell with all his might; the servants
hurried in, and he began hastily to dress. His French valet handed him
slippers with red heels, light blue velvet breeches, a pink kaftan
embroidered with spangles. In the antechamber his wig was hurriedly
powdered and brought in; Korsakoff pushed into it his closely cropped
head, asked for his sword and gloves, turned ten times before the
glass, and announced to Ibrahim that he was ready. The footmen handed
them their bearskin overcoats, and they drove off to the Winter Palace.

Who was the belle of St. Petersburg. Which man was considered the
best dancer? and which dance was the most fashionable? Ibrahim very
reluctantly gratified his curiosity. Meanwhile they reached the
palace. A number of long sledges, old carriages, and gilded coaches
stood on the lawn. Near the steps were crowded coachmen in livery and
moustaches, outriders glittering with tinsel, with feathers and maces,
hussars, pages and awkward footmen carrying their masters'' furcoats
and muffs, a following indispensable according to the notions of the
gentry of that period. At sight of Ibrahim a general murmur ran. "The
negro, the negro, the Tzar''s negro!" He hurriedly led Korsakoff through
this motley crowd. The Court footman opened wide the doors; and they
entered a large room. Korsakoff was dumb with astonishment. In this big
hall, lighted up with tallow candles dimly burning amidst clouds of
tobacco smoke, sat magnates with blue ribbons across their shoulders,
ambassadors, foreign merchants, officers of the guards in their green
uniform, shipbuilders in jackets and striped trousers, all moving to
and fro in crowds to the unceasing sound of sacred music. The ladies
sat near to the walls;—the young attired in all the splendour of
fashion. Gold and silver shone upon their gowns; from the midst of wide
crinolines their slender figures rose like flower stalks. Diamonds
glittered in their[Pg 237] ears, in their long curls, and round their neck.
They turned gaily to the right and left awaiting the gentlemen and the
dancing.

Elderly ladies tried cunningly to combine the new style of dress with
the vanished past; caps were modelled on the small sable hat of the
Tsaritsa Natalia Kirilovna, and gowns and mantles somehow recalled the
sarafan and dushegreika (short jacket without sleeves). They seemed
to share rather with wonder than enjoyment in these new imported
amusements, and glanced angrily at the wives and daughters of the Dutch
skippers, who in cotton skirts and red jackets knitted their stockings
and sat laughing and talking quite at ease amongst themselves. Seeing
the fresh arrivals, a servant approached with beer and tumblers on a
tray. Korsakoff in bewilderment whispered to Ibrahim.

"Que diable est ce que tout cela?" Ibrahim could not repress a smile.
The empress and the grand duchess, radiant in their own beauty and
their attire, walked through the rows of guests, talking affably to
them. The emperor was in another room, Korsakoff, wishing to show
himself to him, with difficulty pushed his way through the ever-moving
crowd. Sitting in that room were mostly foreigners solemnly smoking
their clay pipes and drinking from their earthen jugs. On the tables
were bottles of beer and[Pg 238] wine, leather pouches with tobacco, tumblers
of punch, and a few draught-boards. At one of these was Peter playing
draughts with a broad-shouldered English skipper. They solemnly saluted
one another with gulps of tobacco smoke, and the Tsar was so engrossed
by an unexpected move of his opponent that he did not notice Korsakoff,
in spite of the latter''s contortions. At that moment a stout gentleman
with a large bouquet on his breast rushed in, announced in a loud voice
that dancing had begun, and instantly retired. He was followed by a
large number of the guests, including Korsakoff among the rest.

The unexpected sight surprised him. Along the whole length of the
hall, to the sound of the most doleful music, the ladies and gentlemen
stood in two rows face to face. The gentlemen bowed low; the ladies
curtsied lower still, first to their vis-Ã -vis, then to the right,
then to the left; again to their vis-Ã -vis, then to the right, and
so on. Korsakoff, gazing at this fantastic pastime, opened his eyes
and bit his lips. The curtsying and bowing went on for about half an
hour. At last they ended, and the stout gentleman with the bouquet
announced that the dances of ceremony were ended, and ordered the band
to play a minuet. Korsakoff was delighted, and made ready to show
off. Among the young ladies was one whom he particularly admired. She
was about sixteen,[Pg 239] dressed richly but with taste, and sat next an
elderly gentleman of dignified and stern appearance. Korsakoff rushed
up to her and begged the honour of a dance. The young beauty was
disconcerted, and seemed to be at a loss what to say. The man sitting
next her frowned more than before. Korsakoff awaited her reply, when
the gentleman with the bouquet approached, led him to the middle of the
hall, and said pompously:

"Dear sip, you have done wrong. In the first place, you approached this
young person without first rendering her the three requisite salutes,
and secondly, you took upon yourself the right of choosing her, whereas
in the minuet that privilege is hers and not the gentleman''s. For this
you must undergo severe punishment, that is you must drain the goblet
of the Great Eagle."

Korsakoff from hour to hour grew more astonished. In a moment the
guests surrounded him, loudly demanding instant compliance with the
law. Peter, hearing the laughter and loud talk, came from the next
room, being very fond of witnessing such punishments. The crowd divided
before him and he stepped into the centre, where stood the accused with
the master of the ceremonies before him holding an enormous cup full
of malmsey wine. He was earnestly persuading the culprit to submit
willingly to the law.

"Aha!" said Peter, seeing Korsakoff, "you[Pg 240] are caught, brother. Drink,
monsieur, and no wry faces."

There was nothing for it. The poor dandy, without stopping, drained the
goblet and returned it to the master of the ceremonies.

"Hark, Korsakoff," said Peter, "your breeches are of velvet, the like
even I don''t wear, who am much richer than you. That is extravagance,
take care I do not quarrel with you."

After this rebuke Korsakoff wished to leave the circle, but staggered
and nearly fell, to the great delight of the emperor and the merry
company. This incident not only did not mar the harmony nor interest of
the principal entertainment, but on the contrary enlivened it.

The gentlemen began to scrape and bow, and the ladies to curtsy and
knock their little heels together with great diligence, no longer
keeping time to the music. Korsakoff could not share in the general
merriment. By her father Gavril Afanassievitch Rjevski''s orders, the
lady whom Korsakoff had chosen approached Ibrahim, and, dropping her
eyes, timidly held out her hand to him. Ibrahim danced the minuet with
her and led her back to her seat, then went in search of Korsakoff,
led him out of the hall, placed him in the carriage, and drove him
home. At the beginning of the journey Korsakoff mumbled, "Curses upon
the soiree and the goblet of the Great Eagle," but[Pg 241] he soon fell into
a deep sleep. He knew not how he got home, undressed, and was put to
bed, and he awoke next day with a headache, and a dim remembrance of
the scraping, curtseying, and tobacco smoke, the gentleman with the
enormous bouquet, and the mighty goblet of the Great Eagle.

(Verse from "Ruslan and Ludmila.")

"Our forefathers were leisurely souls,
Right leisurely did they dine,
And they ladled slow from their silver bowls
The foaming beer and wine."

I must introduce you, gracious reader, to Gavril Afanassievitch
Rjevski. He came of an ancient noble race, owned vast estates, was
hospitable, loved falconry, had an enormous retinue, and was, in a
word, a good old Russian gentleman. In his own words he could not bear
anything foreign, and in his home he tried to maintain the customs of
the good old days he loved so well. His daughter was seventeen. In
childhood she had lost her mother, and she had been brought up in the
old-fashioned way, amid a crowd of governesses, nurses, companions, and
children from the servants'' hall. She could embroider in gold and was[Pg 242]
illiterate. Her father, in spite of his dislike to all things foreign,
could not oppose her wish to learn German dances from a captive Swedish
officer living in their house. This worthy dancing master was about
fifty; his right foot had been shot through at the battle of Narva,
and therefore it was not very active at minuets and courantes; but
the left was very dexterous and agile in the more difficult steps.
His young pupil did credit to his teaching. Natalia Gavrilovna was
celebrated at these soirees for her dancing, which was partly the cause
of Korsakoff''s proceedings. He came next morning to apologise to Gavril
Afanassievitch. But the young dandy''s manner and fine dress displeased
the proud barin who nicknamed him the French monkey.

It was a holiday. Gavril Afanassievitch expected a number of friends
and relations. In the ancient hall a long table was being laid. The
guests were arriving with their wives and daughters, who had at last
been released from their domestic prison by the order and by the
example of the Tsar. Natalia Gavrilovna handed round a silver tray
laden with golden cups, and each guest, as he drained one, regretted
that the kiss which accompanied it on such occasions in olden times was
out of fashion.

They sat down to table. In the place of honour next the host sat his
father-in-law, Prince[Pg 243] Boris Alexeievitch Lykoff, a boyar in his
seventieth year. The other guests were placed in order of descent, and
thus recalling the happy times of precedence by office, sat down, men
on one side, women on the other. At the end of the table, the companion
in the old-fashioned dress, a dwarf,—a thirty-year-old infant,
affected and wrinkled,—and the captive dancing master in a shabby dark
blue uniform, took their accustomed seats. The table, covered with a
great number of dishes, was surrounded by numerous and busy servants,
distinguishable among whom was the butler, with severe mien, big
stomach, and pompous immobility. The first few moments of dinner were
devoted entirely to the dishes of our time-honoured Russian cookery.
The rattle of plates and the activity of spoons produced a general
taciturnity.

At last the host, perceiving that the time had come for entertaining
the guests with agreeable conversation, turned and asked:

Several attendants were about to rush off in different directions,
when an old woman, painted white and pink, decorated with flowers and
tinsel, in a silk damask gown with a low neck, entered, singing and
dancing. Her advent occasioned general delight.

"Dressing, gossip, to receive the dear guests, on the Lord''s festival,
by order of the Tsar, by command of the master, to the derision of the
world in the German style."

At these words there was a loud burst of laughter, and the jester took
her place behind the host''s chair.

"And folly talks foolishly, and sometimes tells the truth in her
folly," said Tatiana Afanassievna, eldest sister of the host, and much
respected by him. "Naturally the present style of dress must seem
ridiculous to everybody. When you, my friends, have shaved your beards
and put on a short coat, it is of course no use talking of women''s
rags; but really it is a pity the sarafan, the maiden''s ribbons, and
the povoinik [a head-dress] should be discarded. It is really sad and
comic to see the beauties of to-day, their hair frizzed like flax,
greased and covered with French powder, the waist laced in so tight
that it seems on the point of snapping—their bodies encased in hoops,
so that they have to go sideways through a carriage door.[Pg 245] They stoop;
they can neither stand, sit, nor breathe—real martyrs, my poor dears."

"Dear mother Tatiana Afanassievna!" said Kirila Petrovitch, formerly a
voievod at Riasan, where he acquired 3,000 serfs and a young wife,
neither by strictly honourable means. "But my wife may dress as she
likes as long as she does not order new gowns every month and throw
away the previous ones, while still quite perfectly new. Formerly the
granddaughter included in her dowry the grandmother''s sarafan; but
now you see the mistress in a gown to-day and to-morrow it is on the
maid. What is to be done? Nothing but ruin confronts the Russian noble.
Very sad!" he said, with a sigh, looking at his Maria Ilienitchna, who
seemed to like neither his praise of olden times nor his disparagement
of the latest fashions. The rest of the ladies shared her displeasure,
but they said nothing, for modesty was in those days still deemed
essential in young women.

"And who is to blame?" asked Gravril Afanassievitch, frothing a mug of
kissli shtchi (sort of lemonade). "Is it not our own fault? The young
women play the fool and we encourage them."

"What can we do? We cannot help ourselves," replied Kirila Petrovitch.
"A man would gladly shut his wife up in the house, but she is summoned
with beating of drums to[Pg 246] attend the assemblies. The husband follows
the whip, but the wife runs after dress. Oh, those assemblies! The Lord
has sent them upon us to punish us for our sins."

Maria Ilienitchna sat on needles; her tongue itched. At last she could
bear it no longer, and turning to her husband inquired with a little
acid smile what he found to object to in the assemblies.

"This is what I find to object to," replied the irritated husband.
Since they began, husbands cannot manage their wives; wives have
forgotten the teaching of the apostles—that a wife shall reverence her
husband. They trouble themselves not about their domestic affairs, but
about new apparel. They consider not how to please the husband, but
how to attract the officers. And is it becoming, madam, for a Russian
lady—wife or maid—to hobnob with German tobacconists and with their
workmen? Who ever heard of dancing till night and talking with young
men? If they were relatives, all well and good—but with strangers and
with men they do not know."

"I would say a word, but there is a wolf near," said Gavril
Afanassievitch, with a frown. "I confess these assemblies are not to my
taste; at any moment you may jostle against a drunken man, or perhaps
be made drunk yourself to amuse others. Then there is the danger
that some blackguard may be up to mischief with[Pg 247] your daughter; the
modern young men are so spoilt, it is disgraceful. Take for instance
the son of the late Evgraff Sergueievitch Korsakoff; who at the last
assembly made such a fuss about Natasha, that he brought the blood into
my cheeks. Next day he coolly drives up to my gate. I was wondering
whether it could be Prince Alexander Danilovitch. No such luck. Ivan
Evgrafovitch! He would not stop at the gate and take the trouble to
walk up to the door, it is not likely! Korsakoff rushed in, bowing
and scraping, and chattered at such a rate, the Lord preserve us! The
fool Ekimovna mimics him most comically; by-the-bye, fool, give us the
foreign monkey."

Foolish Ekimovna seized the cover off a dish, tucked it under her arm
like a hat, and began wriggling, scraping with her feet, and bowing
in all directions, saying monsieur, mademoiselle, assemblÃ©e,
pardon. General and prolonged laughter again showed the delight of
the guests.

"Exactly like Korsakoff," said old Prince Lykoff, wiping away his tears
of laughter when the noise had gradually subsided. "It must be owned,
however, he is not the first nor the last who has come from foreign
parts to holy Russia a buffoon. What do our children learn abroad? To
scrape their feet, to chatter the Lord knows what lingo, not to respect
their elders, and to dangle after other men''s wives. Of all the young
people[Pg 248] who have been educated abroad (the Lord forgive me) the Tzar''s
negro most resembles a man."

"Oh, prince!" said Tatiana Afanassievna. I have—I have seen him close.
What a frightful muzzle he has. I was quite frightened of him."

"Certainly," added Gavril Afanassievitch. "He is a steady, decent man,
not a brother of the whirlwind. Who is it that has just driven through
the gate into the courtyard? Surely it is never that foreign monkey
again? What are you animals doing?" he exclaimed, turning towards the
servants. "Run and keep him out, and never let him in again."

"Old beard, are you dreaming?" foolish Ekimovna interrupted. "Are you
blind? It is the royal sledge. The Tsar has come."

Gavril Afanassievitch rose hurriedly from the table. Everybody rushed
to the windows; and positively saw the emperor ascending the steps
leaning on the arm of his orderly. There was a great commotion. The
host rushed to meet Peter; the servants flew hither and thither as if
mad; the guests were alarmed, and some wondered how they might escape.
Suddenly the thunder voice of Peter resounded in the hall. All was
silence as the Tsar entered, accompanied by his host, in a flutter of
joy.

All made obeisance. The Tsar''s sharp eyes sought in this crowd
the host''s young daughter. He beckoned to her. Natalia Gavrilovna
approached rather boldly, but blushed not only to her ears but to her
shoulders.

"You grow prettier every hour," said the Tsar, and according to his
custom kissed her on the head. Then turning to the guests he exclaimed:

"Why, I have interrupted you! You were dining? I beg you will sit down
again, and to me, Gavril Afanassievitch, give some aniseed vodka."

The host rushed at the stately butler, snatched from him a tray,
and himself filling a small golden goblet, handed it to the Tsar.
Peter drank it, ate a piece of bread, and again invited the guests
to continue their dinner. All resumed their seats but the dwarf and
the companion, who did not dare to remain at the table honoured by
the presence of the monarch. Peter sat down beside the host and asked
for some shtchee (a cabbage soup). The Tsar''s orderly handed him a
wooden spoon inlaid with ivory, a knife and fork with green bone
handles—Peter never used any others but his own. The dinner table
conversation, which a moment before had been boisterously merry,
ended by being forced and scanty. The host from respect and delight
ate nothing; the guests, too, became ceremonious and listened with[Pg 250]
reverence to the Tsar as he discussed in German the campaign of 1701
with the captive Swede.

The fool, Ekimovna, several times interrogated by the monarch, replied
with a sort of cold timidity, which, by-the-bye, did not in the least
prove her natural folly.

"Gavril Afanassievitch!" he said, addressing the host. "I want a word
with you alone." Taking his arm, he led him into the drawing-room and
locked the door. The guests remaining in the dining-room whispered
about the unexpected visit, and fearing to intrude, dispersed speedily
without expressing to their host the usual after-dinner thanks. His
father-in-law, daughter, and sister accompanied each in silence to the
door, and remained alone in the dining-room awaiting his Majesty''s
departure.

Half an hour later the door opened and Peter came out. With a solemn
bow to the treble salute from Prince Lykoff, Tatiana Afanassievna, and
Natasha, he passed out into the lobby. The host[Pg 251] handed him his long
red overcoat, conducted him to the sledge, and on the door steps again
thanked him for the honour he had done him.

Returning to the dining-room, Gavril Afanassievitch seemed much
troubled; angrily bade the servants clear the table, sent Natasha to
her apartments, and informed his sister and father-in-law that he must
talk with them. He led them into the bedroom, where he usually took his
after-dinner nap. The old Prince lay down upon the oak bed; Tatiana
Afanassievna sat down upon the ancient damask easy chair, and drew the
footstool towards her; Gavril Afanassievitch locked all the doors and
sat down at Prince Lykoffs feet. In a low voice he began:

"Has he commanded you to a voievod?" asked his father-in-law. It is
time he did so long ago. Or he has proposed a mission to you? Why not?
Not always clerks. Important people are sometimes sent to foreign
monarchs.

"No," replied his son-in-law, scowling. "I am a man of the old pattern;
our services are not required in the present day, though perhaps an
Orthodox Russian nobleman is superior to modern[Pg 252] upstarts, pancake
hawkers, and Mussulmen. But that is a different matter."

"The maiden is ready for marriage, the bridegroom must be in keeping
with the proposer. God grant them love and discretion; of honour there
is plenty."

"Dear brother," replied the old lady, "how can we guess? There are many
gentlemen at court. Any one of them would be delighted to marry your
Natasha. Is it Dolgoruki?"

"God be with him, he is rich and stupid. Who then? Is it Eletsky, Lvof?
It cannot be Ragusinski? Well, I cannot imagine. Then whom does the
Tzar wish Natasha to marry?"

The old lady exclaimed and threw up her arms. Prince Lykoff raised
his head from the pillows, and in astonishment repeated: "The negro
Ibrahim?"

"Dear brother!" said the old lady in a voice full of tears. "Do not
destroy your darling daughter, do not deliver Natashinka into the claws
of the black devil."

"But how then?" replied Gavril Afanassievitch, "refuse the Tzar, who in
return promises us his protection to me and all our house."

"What!" exclaimed the old Prince, who was wide awake now. "Natasha, my
granddaughter, to be married to a bought negro?"

"He''s of good birth," said Gavril Afanassievitch, "he is the son of a
negro Sultan. He was not taken prisoner by the Mussulmen but sold at
Constantinople. Our ambassador bought him and presented him to Peter.
The negro''s eldest brother came to Russia with a handsome ransom
and——"

"Gavril Afanassievitch," added the old lady, "tell us rather how you
replied to the Tzar''s proposal."

At that moment a noise was heard behind the door. Gavril Afanassievitch
went to open it, but something obstructed; he gave a hard push,
the door opened, and he beheld Natasha unconscious lying on the
blood-smeared floor.

Her heart misgave her when the Tzar was closeted with her father. A
sort of presentiment whispered to her that the matter concerned her;
and when Gavril Afanassievitch bade her to retire, while he conferred
with her aunt and grandfather, she could not resist feminine curiosity,
crawled quietly through the back rooms to the bedroom door, and missed
no word of their terrible conversation. When she heard her father''s
last sentence, the poor girl fainted, and falling, struck her head
against the metal-bound chest which held her dowry.

The servants rushed in, lifted Natasha, carried her to her own suite
of apartments, and laid her upon her bed. After a little she came to
and opened her eyes, but recognised neither father nor aunt. Fever
set in; in her delirium she spoke of marriage and the Tzar''s negro,
and suddenly cried in a plaintive and piercing voice: "Valerian, dear
Valerian, my life, save me: There they are, there they are."

Tatiana Afanassievna glanced anxiously at her brother, who turned
white, bit his lip, and left the room in silence. He returned to the
old Prince,[Pg 255] who, unable to mount the stairs, had remained below.

"Who is this Valerian?" inquired the anxious old man. "Can it be the
orphan son of the musketeer whom you brought up in your house?"

"The same, to my sorrow!" replied Gavril Afanassievitch. "His father
saved my life during the insurrection, and the devil induced me to take
home the accursed young wolf. Two years ago, at his own request, he
was drafted into the army. Natasha cried at parting with him, while he
stood as if turned to stone. I thought it suspicious, and spoke to my
sister about it. But Natasha has never mentioned him since; and nothing
has been heard of him. I hoped she had forgotten him, but it seems not.
I have decided; she shall marry the negro."

Prince Lykoff did not contradict him; it would have been useless. He
returned home. Tatiana Afanassievna remained by Natasha''s bedside.
Gavril Afanassievitch, after sending for the doctor, locked himself in
his own room, and in his house all was still and sad. This unexpected
proposal of marriage surprised Ibrahim, at any rate, quite as much as
it surprised Gavril Afanassievitch. It happened thus.

"Listen, Ibrahim; you are a lonely man, without birth or clan, a
stranger to everybody but myself. If I were to die to-day what would
become of you to-morrow, my poor negro? You must get settled while
there is yet time, find support in new ties, connect yourself with the
Russian nobility."

"Sire, I am contented with you; the protection and favour of your
Majesty. God grant I may not survive my Tsar and benefactor. I desire
nothing[Pg 257] more, and even if I had any views of matrimony, would the
young girl or her relations consent? My personal appearance——"

"Your personal appearance? What nonsense! How, are you not a fine
fellow? A young girl must obey her parent''s wishes; but we will see
what old Gavril Rjevski will say when I go myself as your matchmaker."

"Marry," thought the African; "and why not? Surely I am not destined to
pass my life alone, and never know the greatest happiness and the most
sacred duties of manhood, simply because I was born in the torrid zone?
I cannot hope to be loved; what a childish thought! Is it possible to
believe in love? Can it exist in the frivolous heart of woman? The Tsar
is right; I must assure my own future. Marriage with young Rjevski will
unite me to the haughty Russian nobility, and I shall cease to be a
stranger in my new country. From my wife I shall not require love; I
shall content myself with her fidelity and friendship."

Ibrahim wished to work according to his custom, but his imagination was
too excited. He left the papers, and went out to stroll along the banks
of the Neva. Suddenly he heard Peter''s voice, looked round, and saw
the Tsar, who had dismissed his[Pg 258] sledge and was following "him with a
lively countenance.

"It is all settled, my friend," said Peter, taking him by the arm; "I
have betrothed you. Tomorrow, call upon your father-in-law, but be
careful to honour the pride of the boyar; leave your sledge at the
gates, and go across the yard on foot, talk to him of his honours and
distinction, and he will be delighted with you. And now," he added,
shaking his cudgel, "take me to the rogue Danileitch, with whom I must
have an interview about his latest pranks."

Ibrahim thanked Peter most sincerely for his fatherly care, accompanied
him as far as the magnificent mansion of Prince Menshikoff, and
returned home.

Gently burnt the hanging lamp before the glass case, wherein glittered
the gold and silver frames of the ancestral icons. The flickering
light lit faintly the curtained bed, and the table strewn with labelled
phials. Near the fireplace sat a servant at her spinning wheel, and
only the light sound of her distaff broke the silence.

"Who is there?" asked a weak voice. The maid rose instantly, approached
the bed, and quietly raised the curtain.

Natasha was silent; she tried to collect her scattered thoughts.
Something had happened to her, what it was she could not remember. The
maid stood before her, awaiting her orders. At that moment a muffled
sound was heard below.

"The masters have finished dinner," answered the attendant; "they are
rising from table. Tatiana Afanassievna will be here directly."

Natasha seemed pleased, she waved her feeble hand. The maid dropped the
curtain and resumed her seat at the spinning wheel.

A few minutes after, a head, covered with a broad white cap with dark
ribbons, peeped through the door and asked in a low voice:

"The young lady is conscious," said the maid, cautiously moving up
an easy chair. With tears in her eyes the old lady kissed the pale
languid face of her niece, and sat down beside her. Immediately after
her came the German doctor in a black caftan and learned wig. He
counted Natalia''s pulse, and told them first in Latin, then in Russian,
that the crisis was over. He asked for paper and ink, wrote a new
prescription, and departed. The old lady rose, kissed Natalia again,
and at once went down with the good news to Gavril Afanassievitch.

In the drawing-room in full uniform, with sword and hat in hand, sat
the royal negro, talking respectfully with Gavril Afanassievitch.
Korsakoff, stretched full length upon a downy couch, reclined,
listening to their conversation while he teased the greyhound. Tired of
this occupation, he approached a mirror, the usual refuge of the idle,
and in it saw Tatiana Afanassievna behind the door making unperceived
signs to her brother.

"I am astonished at your patience," said Korsakoff to Ibrahim. "A whole
hour have you been listening to ravings about the ancient descent
of the Lykoffs and the Rjevskis, and have even added your own moral
observations. In your place j''aurais plantÃ© la the old liar and
all his race, including Natalia Gavrilovna, who is only affected and
shamming illness, une petite santÃ©. Tell me truly, is it possible
that you are in love with that little mijaurÃ©e?"

"No," replied Ibrahim, "I am of course marrying, not from love, but
from consideration, and that only if she has no actual dislike for me."
"Listen, Ibrahim," said Korsakoff, "for once take my advice; really I
am wiser than I look. Give up this silly idea—don''t marry. It seems
to me that your chosen bride has no particular liking for you. Don''t
many things happen in this world? For instance: of course I am not bad
looking, but it has happened to me to deceive husbands who were really
not a whit my inferior. Yourself too.... you remember our Parisian
friend Count L.? A woman''s fidelity cannot be counted on. Happy is
he who can bear the change with equanimity. But you! with "your
passionate, brooding, and suspicious nature, with your flat nose, thick
lips, is it with these that you propose to rush into all the dangers of
matrimony?"

"Thank you for your friendly advice," said[Pg 262] Ibrahim, coldly; "you know
the proverb: ''it is not your duty to rock other folk''s children.''"

"Take care, Ibrahim," replied Korsakoff, smiling, "that it does not
fall to your lot to illustrate that proverb literally later on."

"But just consider," replied her obstinate brother. "For a fortnight
now he has been calling as her accepted bridegroom, and hitherto has
not seen his bride. He might think at last that her illness is simply
an invention, and that we are seeking only to gain time in order to get
rid of him. Besides, what will the Tsar say? He has already sent three
times to ask after Natasha. Do as you please, but I do not intend to
fall out with him."

"My God!" exclaimed Tatiana Afanassievna; "how will she bear it? At any
rate, let me prepare her for this."

"Thank God!" he said to Ibrahim; "the crisis is over. Natalia is much
better. I do not like to leave our dear guest, Mr. Korsakoff, here
alone> or I would take you upstairs to get a glimpse of your bride."

Korsakoff congratulated Gavril Afanassievitch,[Pg 263] begged them not to put
themselves out on his account, assured them that he was obliged to go,
and rushed into the lobby, whither be refused to allow his host to
follow him.

Meanwhile, Tatiana Afanassievna hastened to prepare the invalid for the
arrival of her terrible visitor. Entering the apartments, she sat down
breathless by the bedside and took Natalia by the hand. But before she
had time to say a word, the door opened.

The old lady felt faint, Gavril Afanassievitch drew back the curtain,
looked coldly at the patient, and inquired how she was. The sick girl
tried to smile but could not. Her father''s stern gaze startled her, and
fear overcame her. She fancied some one stood at the head of her bed.
With an effort she raised her head and instantly recognised the Tsar''s
negro. At that moment she remembered all, and all the horror of the
future presented itself before her. But exhausted nature could receive
no further perceptible shock. Natasha dropped her head back on the
pillow and closed her eyes, her heart within her gave sickly throbs.
Tatiana Afanassievna signed to her brother that the patient wanted to
go to sleep, and everybody left the apartments quietly. The maid alone
remained and resumed her seat.

The unhappy beauty opened her eyes, and seeing[Pg 264] no one by her bedside,
called the maid and sent her for the dwarf. But at that moment an old,
round creature, like a ball, rolled up to her bed. Tie Swallow (so
the dwarf was nicknamed) had rushed as fast as her short legs would
carry her up the stairs after Gavril Afanassievitch and Ibrahim, and
hid behind the door. Natasha saw her and sent the maid away. The dwarf
sat down on a stool by the bedside Never had so small a body contained
so active a soul. She interfered in everything, knew everything, and
exerted herself about everything. With cunning penetration she knew how
to gain the affection of her masters, and the envy of all the household
over which she wielded autocratic sway. Gavril Afanassievitch listened
to her tales, complaints, and petty requests. Tatiana Afanassievna
asked her opinion every moment and took her advice, while Natasha''s
affection for her was unbounded. She confided to her all the thoughts,
all the impulses of her sixteen-year-old heart.

"Do you know, Swallow," she said, "my father is going to marry me to
the negro." The dwarf sighed deeply, and her wrinkled face became more
wrinkled.

"No, miss, the negro during your illness managed to bewitch everybody.
Master is mad about him, the prince dreams of him alone, and Tatiana
Afanassievna says it is a pity he is a negro, otherwise we could not
wish for a better bridegroom."

"Don''t grieve, dear beauty," said the dwarf, kissing her feeble
hand. "If you must marry the negro, at any rate you will be your own
mistress. Now it is not as it was in olden times; husbands no longer
imprison their wives; the negro is said to be rich, the house will be
like a full cup—you''ll live merrily."

"That is just it, miss," she said mysteriously, lowering her voice; "if
you thought less of the sharpshooter''s orphan you would not rave of him
in your delirium, and your father would not be angry."

"That is the misfortune," replied the dwarf. "Now, if you ask him not
to marry you to the[Pg 266] negro, he will think Valerian is the cause. There
is nothing to be done, you had better submit, and what is to be will
be."

Natasha made no reply. The notion that the secret of her heart was
known to her father had a powerful effect upon her mind. One hope only
was left to her—that she might die before the completion of this
hateful marriage. This idea comforted her. With a weak and sad heart
she resigned herself to her fate.

In Gavril Afanassievitch''s house opening from the hall on the right was
a a narrow room with one window. In it stood a simple bed covered with
a blanket. Before the bed stood a small table of pine wood, on which a
tallow candle burnt, and a book of music lay open. On the wall hung an
old blue uniform and its contemporary, a three-cornered hat; above it
nailed to the wall with three nails hung a picture representing Charles
XII. on horseback. The notes of a flute sounded through this humble
abode. The captive dancing-master, its solitary occupant, in a skull
cap and cotton[Pg 267] dressing-gown, was enlivening the dulness of a winter''s
evening practising some strange Swedish, marches. After devoting two
whole hours to this exercise the Swede took his flute to pieces, packed
it in a box, and began to undress.

A noisy band of gypsies are wandering through. Bessarabia. To-day they
will pitch their ragged tents on the banks of the river. Sweet as
freedom is their nights rest, peaceful their slumber.

Between the cart wheels, half screened by rugs, burns a fire around
which the family is preparing supper. In the open fields graze the
horses, and behind the tents a tame bears lies free. In the heart of
the desert all is movement with the preparations for the morning''s
march, with the songs of the women, the cries of the children, and the
sound of the itinerant anvil. But soon upon the wandering band falls
the silence of sleep, and the stillness of the desert is broken only by
the barking of the dogs and the neighing of the horses.

The fires are everywhere extinguished, all is calm; the moon shines
solitary in the sky, shedding its light over the silent camp.

In one of the tents is an old man who does not sleep, but remains
seated by the embers, warming[Pg 269] himself by their last glow. He gazes
into the distant steppes, which are now wrapped in the mists of night.
His youthful daughter has wandered into the distant plains. She is
accustomed to her wild freedom; she will return. But night wears on,
and the moon in the distant clouds is about to set. Zemphira tarries,
and the old man''s supper is getting cold. But here she comes, and,
following on her footsteps, a youth, a stranger to the old gypsy.

"Father," says the maiden, "I bring a guest; I found him beyond the
tombs in the steppes, and I have invited him to the camp for the night.
He wishes to become a gypsy like us. He is a fugitive from the law. But
I will be his companion. He is ready to follow wherever I lead."

The Old Gypsy: "I am glad. Stay in the shelter of our camp till
morning, or longer it thou wilt. I am-ready to share with thee both
bread and roof. Be one of us. Make trial of our life; of our wandering,
poverty, and freedom. To-morrow, at daybreak, in one van, we will go
together. Choose thy trade: forge iron, or sing songs, leading the bear
from village to village."

Zemphira: "He is mine; who shall take him from me? But it is late....
the young moon has set, the fields are hidden in darkness, and sleep
overpowers me."

"Wake, Zemphira, the sun is rising; awake, my guest. ''Tis time, tis
time! Leave, my children, the couch of slothfulness."

Noisily the clustering crowd expands; the tents are struck; the vans
are ready to start. All is movement, and the horde advances over the
desert.

Asses with paniers full of sportive children lead the way; husbands,
brothers, wives, daughters, young and old, follow in their wake. What
shouting and confusion! Gypsy songs are mingled with the growling
of the bear, impatiently gnawing at his chain. What a motley of
bright-coloured rags! The naked children! The aged men! Dogs bark and
howl, the bagpipes drone, the carts creak. All is so poor, so wild,
so disorderly, but full of the life and movement ever absent from our
dead, slothful, idle life, monotonous as the songs of slaves.

The youth gazes disheartened over the desert plain. The secret cause of
his sadness he admits not even to himself. By his side is the dark-eyed
Zemphira. Now he is a free inhabitant of the world, and radiant above
him shines the sun in midday glory. Why, then, does the youth''s heart
tremble—what secret sorrow preys upon him?

God''s little bird knows neither care nor labour,[Pg 271] Why should it strive
to build a lasting nest? The night is long, but a branch suffices for
its sleeping place. When the sun comes in his glory, birdie hears the
voice of God, flutters his plumage, and sings his song. After spring,
Nature''s fairest time, comes hot summer. Late autumn follows, bringing
mist and cold. Poor men and women are sad and dismal. To distant lands,
to warmer climes beyond the blue sea, flies birdie to the spring. Like
a little careless bird is the wandering exile. For him there is no
abiding nest, no home! Every road is his; at each stopping-place is his
night''s lodging. Waking at dawn, he leaves his day at God''s disposal,
and the toil of life disturbs not his calm, indolent heart. At times,
glory''s enchantment, like a distant star, attracts his gaze; or sudden
visions of luxury and pleasure float before him. Sometimes above his
solitary head growls the thunder, and beneath the thunder, as beneath a
peaceful sky, he sleeps serene. And thus he lives, ignoring the power
of blind treacherous Fate. But once, oh God! how passion played with
his obedient soul! How it raged in his tormented breast! Is it long,
and for how long, that it has left him calm? It will rage again; let
him but wait!

Aleko: "Regret? If thou knewest, if thou could''st imagine the
confinement of our stifling towns! There people crowded behind walls
never breathe the cool breeze of the morning, nor the breath of
spring-scented meadows. They are ashamed to love, and chase away the
thought. They traffic with liberty, bow their heads to idols, and beg
for money and chains. What have I left? The excitement of treason, the
prejudged sentence, the mob''s mad persecution or splendid infamy."

Zemphira: "But there thou hadst magnificent palaces, many coloured
carpets, entertainments, and loud revels; and the maiden''s dresses are
so rich!"

Aleko: "What is there to please in our noisy towns? The genuine
love, no veritable joy. The maidens. How much dost thou surpass them,
without their rich apparel, their pearls, or their necklaces! Be true,
my gentle friend! My sole wish is to share with thee love, leisure, and
this self-sought exile."

The Old Gypsy: "Thou lovest us, though born amongst the rich.. But
freedom is not always agreeable to those used to luxury. We have a
legend:—

"Once a king banished a man from the South to live amongst us—I once
knew but have forgotten[Pg 273] his difficult name—though old in years he was
youthful, passionate, and simple-hearted. He had a wondrous gift of
song, with a voice like running waters. Everyone liked him. He dwelt
on the banks of the Danube, harming no one, but pleasing many with his
stories. He was helpless, weak, and timid as a child. Strangers brought
him game and fish caught in nets. When the rapid river froze and
winter storms raged high, they clad the saintly old man in soft warm
furs. But he could never be inured to the hardships of a poor man''s
life. He wandered about pale and thin, declaring that an offended God
was chastening him for some crime. He waited, hoping for deliverance,
and full of sad regret. The wretched man wandered on the banks of the
Danube shedding bitter tears, as he remembered his distant home, and,
dying, he desired that his unhappy bones should be carried to the
South. Even in death the stranger to these parts could find no rest."

Aleko: "Such is thy children''s fate, O Borne, O world-famed Empire!
Singer of love, singer of the gods, say what is glory? The echo from
the tomb, the voice of praise continued from generation to generation,
or a tale told by a gypsy in his smoky tent?"

Two years passed. The peaceful gypsy band[Pg 274] still wanders, finding
everywhere rest and hospitality. Scorning the fetters of civilisation,
Aleko is free, like them; without regret or care he leads a wandering
life. He is unchanged, unchanged the gypsy band. Forgetful of his past,
he has grown used to a gypsy life. He loves sleeping under their tents,
the delight of perpetual idleness, and their poor but sonorous tongue.
The bear, a deserter from his native haunts, is now a shaggy guest
within his tent. In the villages along the deserted route that passes
in front of some Moldavian dwelling, the bear dances clumsily before
a timid crowd and growls and gnaws his tiresome chain. Leaning on his
staff the old man lazily strikes the tambourine; Aleko, singing, leads
the bear; Zemphira makes the round of the villagers, collecting their
voluntary gifts; when night sets in all three prepare the corn they
have not reaped, the old man sleeps, and all is still.... The tent is
quiet and dark.

In the spring the old man is warming his numbed blood; at a cradle his
daughter sings of love. Aleko listens, and turns pale.

Zemphira: "Old husband, cruel husband, cut me, burn me, I am firm,
and fear neither knife nor fire. I hate thee, despise thee; I love
another, and loving him will die."

Zemphira: "Dislike them? And what do I care! I am singing for myself.
Cut me, burn me, I will not complain. Old husband, cruel husband, thou
shalt not discover him. He is fresher than the spring, warmer than
the summer-day. How young and bold he is! How much he loves me! How I
caressed him in the stillness of the night! How we laughed together at
thy white hair."

Zemphira: "Be angry if thou wilt.... the song is about thee." (She
retires singing, "Old husband, &c.")

The Old Gypsy: "Yes, I remember; that song was made in my time, and
has long been sung for folk''s amusement. Marioula used; as we wandered
over the Kagula Steppes, to sing it in the winter nights. The memory of
past years grows fainter hourly, but that song impressed me deeply."
. . . . . . . . . . . All is still. It is night, and the moon casts a
sheen over the blue of the southern sky. Zemphira has awakened the old
man.

The Old Gypsy: "Do not disturb him, keep[Pg 276] quiet. I have heard a
Russian saying that at this time, at midnight, the house spirit often
oppresses a sleeper''s breathing, and before dawn quits him again. Stay
with me."

Zemphira: "I care no longer for his love; I am weary, my heart wants
freedom. I have already—But hush! dost thou hear? He repeats another
name."

Zemphira: "Dost thou not hear? The hoarse groan, the savage grinding
of his teeth! How terrible! I will rouse him."

Zemphira: "He has turned, and raised himself; he calls me, he is
awake. I will go to him. Good night, and sleep."

Zemphira: "With my father. Some spirit has oppressed thee. In sleep
thy soul has suffered tortures. Thou didst frighten me; grinding thy
teeth and calling out to me."

The Old Gypsy: "Young madman. Why dost thou sigh so often? We here
are free. The sky is clean, the women famous for their beauty. Weep
not. Grief will destroy thee."

The Old Gypsy: "Be comforted, friend. She is but a child. Thy sadness
is unreasonable. Thou lovest anxiously and earnestly, but a woman''s
heart loves playfully. Behold, through the distant vault the full moon
wanders free, throwing her light equally over all the world. First
she peeps into one cloud, lights it brilliantly, and then glides to
another, making to each a rapid visit. Who shall point out to her one
spot in the heavens and say, ''There shalt thou stay''? Who to the young
girl''s heart shall say, ''Love only once and change not''? Be pacified."

Aleko: "How she loved me! How tenderly she leant upon me in the
silent desert when we were together in the hours of night! Full of
child-like gaiety, how often, with her pleasant prattle or intoxicating
caress, has she in an instant chased away my gloom! And now, Zemphira
is false! My Zemphira is cold!"

The Old Gypsy: "Listen, and I will tell thee a[Pg 278] story about myself.
Long, long ago, before the Danube was threatened by the Muscovite (thou
seest, Aleko, I speak of an ancient sorrow), at a time when we feared
the Sultan who, through Boodjak Pasha, ruled the country from the lofty
towers of Ackerman. I was young then, and my bosom throbbed with the
passion of youth. My curly locks were not streaked with white. Among
the young beauties there was one.... To whom I turned as to the sun,
till at last I called her mine. Alas! like a falling star, my youth
swiftly sped. Still briefer was our love. Marioula loved me but one
year."

"One day, by the waters of Kagula, we encountered a strange band of
gypsies, who pitched their tents near ours at the foot of the hill.
Two nights we passed together. On the third, they left, and Marioula
forsook her little daughter and followed them. I slept peacefully.
Day broke, and I awoke; my companion was not there. I searched, I
called—no trace remained. Zemphira cried, I wept too! From that moment
I became indifferent to all womankind. Never since has my gaze sought
amongst them a new companion. My dreary hours I have spent alone."

Aleko: "What! Didst thou not instantly pursue the ingrate and her
paramour, to plunge thy dagger in their false hearts?"

The Old Gypsy: "Why should I? Youth is[Pg 279] freer than the birds. Who can
restrain love? Everyone has his turn of happiness. Once fled, it will
never return."

Aleko: "No, I am different. Without a struggle never would I yield
my rights. At least, I would enjoy revenge. Ah, no! Even if I were to
find my enemy lying asleep over the abyss of the sea, I declare that
even then my foot should not spare him, but should unflinchingly kick
the helpless villain into the depths of the ocean, and mock his sudden
terrible awakening with a savage laugh of exultation. Long would his
fall resound a sweet and merry echo in my ears." . . . . . . . A Young
Gypsy: "One kiss, just one more embrace."

Aleko sleeps, and in his mind dim visions play. With a cry he wakes in
the dark, and, stretching out his jealous arm, clutches with a startled
hand the cold bed. His companion is far away..... Trembling he sits up
and listens.... All is quiet! Fear comes upon him. He shivers, then
grows hot. Rising from his bed, he leaves the tent, and, terribly
pale, wanders round the vans. All is silent, the fields are still,
and it is dark. The moon has risen in a mist, and the twinkling stars
are scarcely seen. But on the dewy grass slight footprints can be
discovered, leading to the tombs. With hurried tread he follows on the
path made by the ill-omened footmarks.

In the distance, on the road side, a tomb shines white before him.
Carried along by his hesitating feet, full of dread presentiment,
his lips quivering, his knees trembling ... he proceeds ... when
suddenly ... can it be a dream? Suddenly he perceives two shadows close
together, and hears two voices whispering over the desecrated grave.

The First Voice: "''Tis time."
The Second Voice: "Wait."
The First Voice: "''Tis time, my love."
The Second Voice: "No, no! We will wait till morning."
[Pg 281]The First Voice: "''Tis late already."
The Second Voice "How timidly thou lovest! One moment more."
The First Voice: "Thou wilt destroy me!"
The Second Voice: "One moment!"
The First Voice: "If my husband wakes and I am not——"

Zemphira: "Aleko, thou wouldst kill him! Look, thou art covered with
blood! Oh, what hast thou done?"

Zemphira: "I die, loving him." . . . . . . . From the east the
light of day is shining. Beyond the hill Aleko, besmeared with blood,
sits on the grave-stone, knife in hand. Two corpses lie before him.
The murderer''s face is terrible. An excited crowd of timid gypsies
surrounds him. A grave is being dug. A procession of sorrowing women
approaches, and each in turn kisses the eyes of the dead. The old
father sits apart, staring at his dead daughter in dumb despair. The
corpses are then raised, and into the cold bosom of the earth the young
couple are lowered. From a distance Aleko looks on. When they are
buried, and the last handful of earth thrown over them, without a word
he slowly rolls from off the stone on to the grass. Then the old man
approaches him, and says:

"Leave us, proud man. We area wild people and have no laws. We neither
torture nor execute. We exact neither tears nor blood, but with a
murderer we cannot live. Thou art not born to our wild life. Thou
wouldst have freedom for thyself alone. The sight of thee would be
intolerable to us; we are a timid, gentle folk. Thou art fierce and
bold. Depart, then; forgive us, and peace be with thee!"

He ended, and with great clamour all the wandering band arose, and at
once quitted the ill-fated camp and quickly vanished into the distant
desert tract. But one van, covered with old rugs, remained in the fatal
plain standing alone.

So, at the coming of winter and its morning mists, a flock of belated
cranes rise from a field loudly shrieking and flying to the distant
South, while one sad bird, struck by a fatal shot, with wounded
drooping wing, remains behind. Evening came. By the melancholy van no
fire was lighted; and no one slept beneath its covering of rugs that
night.' WHERE id = 'ddfa649e-934c-4cf8-91c4-1e05cdc4d2f0';

“Gogol, Nikolai Vassilievitch. Born
in the government of Pultowa, March
31 (N.S.), 1809, died at Moscow, March
4 (N.S.), 1852. A Russian novelist
and dramatist. He was educated in a
public gymnasium at Pultowa, and
subsequently in the lyceum, then newly
established, at Niejinsk. In 1831 he
was appointed teacher of history at the
Patriotic Institution, a place which he
exchanged in 1834 for the professorship
of history in the University of St
Petersburg. This he resigned at the end
of a year and devoted himself entirely
to literature. In 1836 Gogol left
Russia. He lived most of the time in
Rome. In 1837 he wrote ‘Dead
Souls.’ In 1840 he went to Russia for
a short period in order to superintend
the publication of the first volume of
‘Dead Souls,’ and then returned to
Italy. In 1846 he returned to Russia
and fell into a state of fanatical mysticism.
One of his last acts was to
burn the manuscript of the concluding
portion of ‘Dead Souls,’ which he
considered harmful. He also wrote
‘The Mantle,’ ‘Evenings at the
Farm,’ ‘St Petersburg Stories,’ ‘Taras
Bulba,’ a tale of the Cossacks, ‘The
Revizor,’ a comedy, etc.”—From The
Century CyclopÃ¦dia of Names.

As a novel-writer and a dramatist, Gogol appears
to me to deserve a minute study, and if the
knowledge of Russian were more widely spread,
he could not fail to obtain in Europe a reputation
equal to that of the best English humorists.

A delicate and close observer, quick to detect
the absurd, bold in exposing, but inclined to
push his fun too far, Gogol is in the first place
a very lively satirist. He is merciless towards
fools and rascals, but he has only one weapon at
his disposal—irony. This is a weapon which is
too severe to use against the merely absurd, and
on the other hand it is not sharp enough for
the punishment of crime; and it is against crime
that Gogol too often uses it. His comic vein
is always too near the farcical, and his mirth is
hardly contagious. If sometimes he makes his
reader laugh, he still leaves in his mind a feeling
of bitterness and indignation; his satires do not
avenge society, they only make it angry.

As a painter of manners, Gogol excels in
familiar scenes. He is akin to Teniers and
 
Callot. We feel as though we had seen and lived
with his characters, for he shows us their eccentricities,
their nervous habits, their slightest
gestures. One lisps, another mispronounces his
words, and a third hisses because he has lost
a front tooth. Unfortunately Gogol is so absorbed
in this minute study of details that he too
often forgets to subordinate them to the main
action of the story. To tell the truth, there is
no ordered plan in his works, and—a strange
trait in an author who sets up as a realist—he
takes no care to preserve an atmosphere of
probability. His most carefully painted scenes
are clumsily connected—they begin and end
abruptly; often the author''s great carelessness
in construction destroys, as though wantonly, the
illusion produced by the truth of his descriptions
and the naturalness of his conversations.

The immortal master of this school of desultory
but ingenious and attractive story-tellers,
among whom Gogol is entitled to a high place,
is Rabelais, who cannot be too much admired
and studied, but to imitate whom nowadays
would, I think, be dangerous and difficult. In
spite of the indefinable grace of his obsolete
language, one can hardly read twenty pages of
Rabelais in succession. One soon wearies of
this eloquence, so original and so eloquent, but
the drift of which escapes every reader except
some Œdipuses like Le Duchat or Ãloi Johanneau.
 
Just as the observation of animalculÃ¦
under the microscope fatigues the eye, so does
the perusal of these brilliant pages tire the mind.
Possibly not a word of them is superfluous, but
possibly also they might be entirely eliminated
from the work of which they form part, without
sensibly detracting from its merit. The art of
choosing among the innumerable details which
nature offers us is, after all, much more difficult
than that of observing them with attention and
recording them with exactitude.

The Russian language, which is, as far as I
can judge, the richest of all the European family,
seems admirably adapted to express the most
delicate shades of thought. Possessed of a
marvellous conciseness and clearness, it can with
a single word call up several ideas, to express
which in another tongue whole phrases would
be necessary. French, assisted by Greek and
Latin, calling to its aid all its northern and
southern dialects—the language of Rabelais, in
fact, is the only one which can convey any idea
of this suppleness and this energy. One can
imagine that such an admirable instrument may
exercise a considerable influence on the mind of
a writer who is capable of handling it. He
naturally takes delight in the picturesqueness of
its expressions, just as a draughtsman with skill
and a good pencil will trace delicate contours.
An excellent gift, no doubt, but there are
 
few things which have not their disadvantages.
Elaborate execution is a considerable merit if it
is reserved for the chief parts of a work; but if it
is uniformly lavished on all the accessory parts
also, the whole produces, I fear, a monotonous
effect.

I have said that satire is, in my opinion, the
special characteristic of Gogol''s talent: he does
not see men or things in a bright light. That
does not mean that he is an unfaithful observer,
but his descriptions betray a certain preference
for the ugly and the sad elements in life.
Doubtless these two disagreeable elements are
only too easily found, and it is precisely for that
reason that they should not be investigated with
insatiable curiosity. We would form a terrible
idea of Russia—of “Holy Russia,” as her children
call her—if we only judged her by the pictures
which Gogol draws. His characters are
almost entirely confined to idiots, or scoundrels
who deserve to be hung. It is a well-known
defect of satirists to see everywhere the game
which they are hunting, and they should not be
taken too literally. Aristophanes vainly employed
his brilliant genius in blackening his contemporaries;
he cannot prevent us loving the
Athens of Pericles.

Gogol generally goes to the country districts
for his characters, imitating in this respect
Balzac, whose writings have undoubtedly influenced
 
him. The modern facility of communication
in Europe has brought about, among the
higher classes of all countries and the inhabitants
of the great cities, a conventional uniformity
of manners and customs, e.g. the dress-coat
and round hat. It is among the middle classes
remote from great towns that we must look
to-day for national characteristics and for original
characters. In the country, people still
maintain primitive habits and prejudices—things
which become rarer from day to day. The
Russian country gentlemen, who only journey to
St Petersburg once in a lifetime, and who, living
on their estates all the year round, eat much,
read little and hardly think at all—these are the
types to which Gogol is partial, or rather which
he pursues with his jests and sarcasms. Some
critics, I am told, reproach him for displaying
a kind of provincial patriotism. As a Little
Russian, he is said to have a predilection for
Little Russia over the rest of the Empire. For
my own part, I find him impartial enough or even
too general in his criticisms, and on the other
hand too severe on anyone whom he places under
the microscope of his observation. Pushkin was
accused, quite wrongly in my opinion, of scepticism,
immorality, and of belonging to the Satanic
school; however he discovered in an old country
manor his admirable Tatiana. One regrets that
Gogol has not been equally fortunate.

I do not know the dates of Gogol''s different
works, but I should be inclined to believe that his
short stories were the first in order of publication.
They seem to me to witness to a certain
vagueness in the author''s mind, as though he
were making experiments in order to ascertain
to what style of work his genius was best adapted.
He has produced an historical romance inspired
by the perusal of Sir Walter Scott, fantastic
legends, psychological studies, marked by a mixture
of sentimentality and grotesqueness. If my
conjecture is correct, he has been obliged to ask
himself for some time whether he should take as
his model Sterne, Walter Scott, Chamisso, or
Hoffmann. Later on he has done better in following
the path which he has himself traced out.
“Taras Bulba,” his historical romance, is an
animated and, as far as I know, correct picture
of the Zaporogues, that singular people whom
Voltaire briefly mentions in his “Life of Charles XII.”
In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
the Zaporogues played a great part in the
annals of Russia and of Poland; they then formed
a republic of soldiers, or rather of filibusters,
established on the islands of the Don, nominal
subjects sometimes of the Kings of Poland, sometimes
of the Grand Dukes of Moscow, sometimes
even of the Ottoman Porte. At bottom they
were extremely independent bandits, and ravaged
their neighbours'' territory with great impartiality.
 
They did not allow women to live in
their towns, which were a kind of nomad encampments;
it was there that the Cossack aspirants
to military glory went to be trained as
irregular troops. The most absolute equality
prevailed among the Zaporogues while at peace
in the marshes of the Don. Then the chiefs, or
atamans, when speaking to their subordinates
always took their caps off. But during an expedition,
on the contrary, their power was unlimited,
and disobedience to the captain of the
company (Ataman KotchevoÃ¯) was considered the
greatest of crimes.

Our filibusters of the seventeenth century have
many traits of resemblance to the Zaporogues,
and the histories of both preserve the remembrance
of prodigies of audacity and of horrible
cruelties. Taras Bulba is one of those heroes
with whom, as the student of Schiller said, one
can only have relations when holding a well-loaded
gun in one''s hand. I am one of those
who have a strong liking for bandits; not because
I like to meet them on my road, but because, in
spite of myself, the energy these men display in
struggling against the whole of society, extorts
from me an admiration of which I am ashamed.
Formerly I read with delight the lives of Morgan,
of Donnais, and of Mombars the destroyer, and
I would not be bored if I read them again.
However, there are bandits and bandits. Their
 
glory is greatly enhanced if they are of a recent
date. Actual bandits always cast into the shade
those of the melodrama, and the one who has
been more recently hung infallibly effaces the
fame of his predecessors. Nowadays neither
Mombars nor Taras Bulba can excite so much
interest as Mussoni, who last month sustained a
regular siege in a wolf''s den against five hundred
men, who had to attack him by sapping and
mining.

Gogol has made brilliantly coloured pictures
of his Zaporogues, which please by their very
grotesqueness; but sometimes it is too evident
that he has not drawn them from nature. Moreover,
these character-pictures are framed in such
a trivial and romantic setting that one regrets to
see them so ill-placed. The most prosaic story
would have suited them better than these melodramatic
scenes in which are accumulated tragic
incidents of famine, torture, etc. In short, one
feels that the author is not at ease on the ground
which he has chosen; his gait is awkward, and
the invariable irony of his style makes the
perusal of these melancholy incidents more painful.
This style which, in my opinion, is quite out
of place in some parts of “Taras Bulba,” is
much more appropriate in the “Viy,” or “King
of the Gnomes,” a tale of witchcraft, which
amuses and alarms at the same time. The
grotesque easily blends with the marvellous.
 
Recognising to the full the poetic side of his
subject, the author, while describing the savage
and strange customs of the old-time Cossacks
with his usual precision and exactitude, has easily
prepared the way for the introduction of an
element of uncanniness.

The receipt for a good, fantastic tale is well
known: begin with well-defined portraits of
eccentric characters, but such as to be within
the bounds of possibility, described with minute
realism. From the grotesque to the marvellous
the transition is imperceptible, and the reader
will find himself in the world of fantasy before
he perceives that he has left the real world far
behind him. I purposely avoid any attempt to
analyse “The King of the Gnomes”; the proper
time and place to read it is in the country, by the
fireside on a stormy autumn night. After the
dÃ©nouement, it will require a certain amount of
resolution to traverse long corridors to reach
one''s room, while the wind and the rain shake
the casements. Now that the fantastic style of
the Germans is a little threadbare, that of the
Cossacks will have novel charms, and in the first
place the merit of resembling nothing else—no
slight praise, I think.

The “Memoirs of a Madman” is simultaneously
a social satire, a sentimental story, and a
medico-legal study of the phenomena presented
by a brain which is becoming deranged. The
 
study, I believe, is carefully made and the process
carefully depicted, but I do not like this
class of writing; madness is one of those misfortunes
which arouse pity but which disgust at the
same time. Doubtless, by introducing a madman
in his story an author is sure of producing
an effect. It causes to vibrate a cord which is
always susceptible; but it is a cheap method, and
Gogol''s gifts are such as to be able to dispense
with having resort to such. The portrayal of
lunatics and dogs—both of whom can produce
an irresistible effect—should be left to tyros. It
is easy to extract tears from a reader by breaking
a poodle''s paw. Homer''s only excuse, in my
opinion, for making us weep at the mutual recognition
of the dog Argus and Ulysses, is because
he was, I think, the first to discover the resources
which the canine race offers to an author at a loss
for expedients.

I hasten to go on to a small masterpiece, “An
Old-time Household.” In a few pages Gogol
sketches for us the life of two honest old folk
living in the country. There is not a grain of
malice in their composition; they are cheated
and adored by their servants, and naÃ¯ve egoists
as they are, believe everyone is as happy as
themselves. The wife dies. The husband, who
only seemed born for merry-making, falls ill and
dies some months after his wife. We discover
that there was a heart in this mass of flesh. We
 
laugh and weep in turns while reading this
charming story, in which the art of the narrator
is disguised by simplicity. All is true and
natural; every detail is attractive and adds to the
general effect.

Translator''s Note.—The rest of MerimÃ©e''s
essay is occupied with analyses of Gogol''s “Dead
Souls” and “The Revisor,” and therefore is
not given here.

But it is perhaps better that I do not mention
which department it was. There are in the
whole of Russia no persons more sensitive than
Government officials. Each of them believes if
he is annoyed in any way, that the whole official
class is insulted in his person.

Recently an Isprawnik (country magistrate)—I
do not know of which town—is said to have
drawn up a report with the object of showing
that, ignoring Government orders, people were
speaking of Isprawniks in terms of contempt. In
order to prove his assertions, he forwarded with
his report a bulky work of fiction, in which on
about every tenth page an Isprawnik appeared
generally in a drunken condition.

In order therefore to avoid any unpleasantness,
I will not definitely indicate the department
in which the scene of my story is laid, and
will rather say “in a certain chancellery.”

Well, in a certain chancellery there was a
certain man who, as I cannot deny, was not of
an attractive appearance. He was short, had a
 
face marked with smallpox, was rather bald in
front, and his forehead and cheeks were deeply
lined with furrows—to say nothing of other
physical imperfections. Such was the outer
aspect of our hero, as produced by the St Petersburg
climate.

As regards his official rank—for with us
Russians the official rank must always be given—he
was what is usually known as a permanent
titular councillor, one of those unfortunate beings
who, as is well known, are made a butt of by
various authors who have the bad habit of
attacking people who cannot defend themselves.

Our hero''s family name was Bashmatchkin;
his baptismal name Akaki Akakievitch. Perhaps
the reader may think this name somewhat
strange and far-fetched, but he can be assured
that it is not so, and that circumstances so
arranged it that it was quite impossible to give
him any other name.

This happened in the following way. Akaki
Akakievitch was born, if I am not mistaken, on
the night of the 23rd of March. His deceased
mother, the wife of an official and a very good
woman, immediately made proper arrangements
for his baptism. When the time came,
she was lying on the bed before the door. At
her right hand stood the godfather, Ivan Ivanovitch
Jeroshkin, a very important person, who
was registrar of the senate; at her left, the godmother
 
Anna Semenovna Byelobrushkova, the
wife of a police inspector, a woman of rare
virtues.

Three names were suggested to the mother
from which to choose one for the child—Mokuja,
Sossuja, or Khozdazat.

In order to meet her wishes, the church calendar
was opened in another place, and the names
Triphiliy, Dula, and Varakhasiy were found.

“This is a punishment from heaven,” said the
mother. “What sort of names are these! I
never heard the like! If it had been Varadat
or Varukh, but Triphiliy and Varakhasiy!”

“Now I see,” said the mother, “this is
plainly fate. If there is no help for it, then he
had better take his father''s name, which was
Akaki.”

So the child was called Akaki Akakievitch.
It was baptised, although it wept and cried and
made all kinds of grimaces, as though it had a
presentiment that it would one day be a titular
councillor.

We have related all this so conscientiously that
the reader himself might be convinced that it
was impossible for the little Akaki to receive any
other name. When and how he entered the
chancellery and who appointed him, no one
 
could remember. However many of his superiors
might come and go, he was always seen in the
same spot, in the same attitude, busy with the
same work, and bearing the same title; so that
people began to believe he had come into the
world just as he was, with his bald forehead and
official uniform.

In the chancellery where he worked, no kind
of notice was taken of him. Even the office
attendants did not rise from their seats when he
entered, nor look at him; they took no more
notice than if a fly had flown through the room.
His superiors treated him in a coldly despotic
manner. The assistant of the head of the
department, when he pushed a pile of papers
under his nose, did not even say “Please copy
those,” or “There is something interesting for
you,” or make any other polite remark such as
well-educated officials are in the habit of doing.
But Akaki took the documents, without worrying
himself whether they had the right to hand them
over to him or not, and straightway set to work
to copy them.

His young colleagues made him the butt of
their ridicule and their elegant wit, so far as
officials can be said to possess any wit. They
did not scruple to relate in his presence various
tales of their own invention regarding his manner
of life and his landlady, who was seventy years
old. They declared that she beat him, and
 
inquired of him when he would lead her to the
marriage altar. Sometimes they let a shower
of scraps of paper fall on his head, and told him
they were snowflakes.

But Akaki Akakievitch made no answer to
all these attacks; he seemed oblivious of their
presence. His work was not affected in the
slightest degree; during all these interruptions
he did not make a single error in copying. Only
when the horse-play grew intolerable, when he
was held by the arm and prevented writing, he
would say “Do leave me alone! Why do you
always want to disturb me at work?” There
was something peculiarly pathetic in these words
and the way in which he uttered them.

One day it happened that when a young clerk,
who had been recently appointed to the chancellery,
prompted by the example of the others,
was playing him some trick, he suddenly seemed
arrested by something in the tone of Akaki''s
voice, and from that moment regarded the old
official with quite different eyes. He felt as though
some supernatural power drew him away from
the colleagues whose acquaintance he had made
here, and whom he had hitherto regarded as
well-educated, respectable men, and alienated
him from them. Long afterwards, when surrounded
by gay companions, he would see the
figure of the poor little councillor and hear the
words “Do leave me alone! Why will you
 
always disturb me at work?” Along with these
words, he also heard others: “Am I not your
brother?” On such occasions the young man
would hide his face in his hands, and think how
little humane feeling after all was to be found in
men''s hearts; how much coarseness and cruelty
was to be found even in the educated and those
who were everywhere regarded as good and
honourable men.

Never was there an official who did his
work so zealously as Akaki Akakievitch. “Zealously,”
do I say? He worked with a passionate
love of his task. While he copied official documents,
a world of varied beauty rose before
his eyes. His delight in copying was legible in
his face. To form certain letters afforded him
special satisfaction, and when he came to them
he was quite another man; he began to smile,
his eyes sparkled, and he pursed up his lips, so
that those who knew him could see by his face
which letters he was working at.

Had he been rewarded according to his zeal,
he would perhaps—to his own astonishment—have
been raised to the rank of civic councillor.
However, he was not destined, as his colleagues
expressed it, to wear a cross at his buttonhole,
but only to get hÃ¦morrhoids by leading a too
sedentary life.

For the rest, I must mention that on one
occasion he attracted a certain amount of attention.
 
A director, who was a kindly man and
wished to reward him for his long service,
ordered that he should be entrusted with a task
more important than the documents which he
usually had to copy. This consisted in preparing
a report for a court, altering the headings of
various documents, and here and there changing
the first personal pronoun into the third.

Akaki undertook the work; but it confused
and exhausted him to such a degree that the
sweat ran from his forehead and he at last
exclaimed: “No! Please give me again something
to copy.” From that time he was allowed
to continue copying to his life''s end.

Outside this copying nothing appeared to exist
for him. He did not even think of his clothes.
His uniform, which was originally green, had
acquired a reddish tint. The collar was so
narrow and so tight that his neck, although of
average length, stretched far out of it, and
appeared extraordinarily long, just like those of
the cats with movable heads, which are carried
about on trays and sold to the peasants in Russian
villages.

Something was always sticking to his clothes—a
piece of thread, a fragment of straw which had
been flying about, etc. Moreover he seemed
to have a special predilection for passing under
windows just when something not very clean was
being thrown out of them, and therefore he
 
constantly carried about on his hat pieces of
orange-peel and such refuse. He never took
any notice of what was going on in the streets,
in contrast to his colleagues who were always
watching people closely and whom nothing delighted
more than to see someone walking along
on the opposite pavement with a rent in his
trousers.

But Akaki Akakievitch saw nothing but the
clean, regular lines of his copies before him;
and only when he collided suddenly with a
horse''s nose, which blew its breath noisily in his
face, did the good man observe that he was not
sitting at his writing-table among his neat duplicates,
but walking in the middle of the street.

When he arrived home, he sat down at once
to supper, ate his cabbage-soup hurriedly, and
then, without taking any notice how it tasted, a
slice of beef with garlic, together with the flies
and any other trifles which happened to be
lying on it. As soon as his hunger was satisfied,
he set himself to write, and began to copy
the documents which he had brought home with
him. If he happened to have no official documents
to copy, he copied for his own satisfaction
political letters, not for their more or less grand
style but because they were directed to some
high personage.

When the grey St Petersburg sky is darkened
by the veil of night, and the whole of officialdom
 
has finished its dinner according to its gastronomical
inclinations or the depth of its purse—when
all recover themselves from the perpetual
scratching of bureaucratic pens, and all the cares
and business with which men so often needlessly
burden themselves, they devote the evening to
recreation. One goes to the theatre; another
roams about the streets, inspecting toilettes;
another whispers flattering words to some young
girl who has risen like a star in his modest official
circle. Here and there one visits a colleague in
his third or fourth story flat, consisting of two
rooms with an entrance-hall and kitchen, fitted
with some pretentious articles of furniture purchased
by many abstinences.

In short, at this time every official betakes himself
to some form of recreation—playing whist,
drinking tea, and eating cheap pastry or smoking
tobacco in long pipes. Some relate scandals
about great people, for in whatever situation of
life the Russian may be, he always likes to hear
about the aristocracy; others recount well-worn
but popular anecdotes, as for example that of the
commandant to whom it was reported that a
rogue had cut off the horse''s tail on the monument
of Peter the Great.

But even at this time of rest and recreation,
Akaki Akakievitch remained faithful to his habits.
No one could say that he had ever seen him in
any evening social circle. After he had written
 
as much as he wanted, he went to bed, and
thought of the joys of the coming day, and the
fine copies which God would give him to do.

So flowed on the peaceful existence of a man
who was quite content with his post and his income
of four hundred roubles a year. He might
perhaps have reached an extreme old age if one
of those unfortunate events had not befallen him,
which not only happen to titular but to actual
privy, court, and other councillors, and also to
persons who never give advice nor receive it.

In St Petersburg all those who draw a salary
of four hundred roubles or thereabouts have a
terrible enemy in our northern cold, although
some assert that it is very good for the health.
About nine o''clock in the morning, when the
clerks of the various departments betake themselves
to their offices, the cold nips their noses
so vigorously that most of them are quite bewildered.
If at this time even high officials so
suffer from the severity of the cold in their own
persons that the tears come into their eyes, what
must be the sufferings of the titular councillors,
whose means do not allow of their protecting
themselves against the rigour of winter? When
they have put on their light cloaks, they must
hurry through five or six streets as rapidly as
possible, and then in the porter''s lodge warm
themselves and wait till their frozen official
faculties have thawed.

For some time Akaki had been feeling on his
back and shoulders very sharp twinges of pain,
although he ran as fast as possible from his
dwelling to the office. After well considering the
matter, he came to the conclusion that these
were due to the imperfections of his cloak. In his
room he examined it carefully, and discovered
that in two or three places it had become so thin
as to be quite transparent, and that the lining
was much torn.

This cloak had been for a long time the standing
object of jests on the part of Akaki''s merciless
colleagues. They had even robbed it of the
noble name of “cloak,” and called it a cowl.
It certainly presented a remarkable appearance.
Every year the collar had grown smaller, for
every year the poor titular councillor had taken
a piece of it away in order to repair some other
part of the cloak; and these repairs did not look
as if they had been done by the skilled hand
of a tailor. They had been executed in a very
clumsy way and looked remarkably ugly.

After Akaki Akakievitch had ended his
melancholy examination, he said to himself that
he must certainly take his cloak to Petrovitch the
tailor, who lived high up in a dark den on the
fourth floor.

With his squinting eyes and pock-marked face,
Petrovitch certainly did not look as if he had the
honour to make frock-coats and trousers for
 
high officials—that is to say, when he was sober,
and not absorbed in more pleasant diversions.

I might dispense here with dwelling on this
tailor; but since it is the custom to portray the
physiognomy of every separate personage in a
tale, I must give a better or worse description
of Petrovitch. Formerly when he was a simple
serf in his master''s house, he was merely called
Gregor. When he became free, he thought he
ought to adorn himself with a new name, and
dubbed himself Petrovitch; at the same time he
began to drink lustily, not only on the high festivals
but on all those which are marked with a
cross in the calendar. By thus solemnly celebrating
the days consecrated by the Church, he
considered that he was remaining faithful to the
traditions of his childhood; and when he quarrelled
with his wife, he shouted that she was an
earthly minded creature and a German. Of this
lady we have nothing more to relate than that she
was the wife of Petrovitch, and that she did not
wear a kerchief but a cap on her head. For the
rest, she was not pretty; only the soldiers looked
at her as they passed, then they twirled their
moustaches and walked on, laughing.

Akaki Akakievitch accordingly betook himself
to the tailor''s attic. He reached it by a dark,
dirty, damp staircase, from which, as in all the
inhabited houses of the poorer class in St Petersburg,
exhaled an effluvia of spirits vexatious to
 
nose and eyes alike. As the titular councillor
climbed these slippery stairs, he calculated what
sum Petrovitch could reasonably ask for repairing
his cloak, and determined only to give him
a rouble.

The door of the tailor''s flat stood open in order
to provide an outlet for the clouds of smoke which
rolled from the kitchen, where Petrovitch''s wife
was just then cooking fish. Akaki, his eyes
smarting, passed through the kitchen without her
seeing him, and entered the room where the
tailor sat on a large, roughly made, wooden table,
his legs crossed like those of a Turkish pasha,
and, as is the custom of tailors, with bare feet.
What first arrested attention, when one approached
him, was his thumb nail, which was a
little misshapen but as hard and strong as the
shell of a tortoise. Round his neck were hung
several skeins of thread, and on his knees lay a
tattered coat. For some minutes he had been
trying in vain to thread his needle. He was first
of all angry with the gathering darkness, then
with the thread.

Akaki saw at once that he had come at an
inopportune moment. He wished he had found
Petrovitch at a more favourable time, when he
was enjoying himself—when, as his wife expressed
it, he was having a substantial ration of
 
brandy. At such times the tailor was extraordinarily
ready to meet his customer''s proposals
with bows and gratitude to boot. Sometimes
indeed his wife interfered in the transaction, and
declared that he was drunk and promised to do
the work at much too low a price; but if the
customer paid a trifle more, the matter was
settled.

Unfortunately for the titular councillor,
Petrovitch had just now not yet touched the
brandy flask. At such moments he was hard,
obstinate, and ready to demand an exorbitant
price.

Akaki foresaw this danger, and would gladly
have turned back again, but it was already too
late. The tailor''s single eye—for he was one-eyed—had
already noticed him, and Akaki
Akakievitch murmured involuntarily “Good
day, Petrovitch.”

“Welcome, sir,” answered the tailor, and
fastened his glance on the titular councillor''s
hand to see what he had in it.

We must here remark that the modest titular
councillor was in the habit of expressing his
thoughts only by prepositions, adverbs, or particles,
which never yielded a distinct meaning.
If the matter of which he spoke was a difficult
one, he could never finish the sentence he had
begun. So that when transacting business, he
 
generally entangled himself in the formula “Yes—it
is indeed true that——” Then he would
remain standing and forget what he wished to
say, or believe that he had said it.

“What do you want, sir?” asked Petrovitch,
scrutinising him from top to toe with a searching
look, and contemplating his collar, sleeves, coat,
buttons—in short his whole uniform, although
he knew them all very well, having made them
himself. That is the way of tailors whenever
they meet an acquaintance.

Then Akaki answered, stammering as usual,
“I want—Petrovitch—this cloak—you see—it is
still quite good, only a little dusty—and therefore
it looks a little old. It is, however, still quite
new, only that it is worn a little—there in the
back and here in the shoulder—and there are
three quite little splits. You see it is hardly
worth talking about; it can be thoroughly repaired
in a few minutes.”

Petrovitch took the unfortunate cloak, spread
it on the table, contemplated it in silence, and
shook his head. Then he stretched his hand
towards the window-sill for his snuff-box, a round
one with the portrait of a general on the lid. I
do not know whose portrait it was, for it had been
accidentally injured, and the ingenious tailor had
gummed a piece of paper over it.

After Petrovitch had taken a pinch of snuff, he
examined the cloak again, held it to the light, and
 
once more shook his head. Then he examined
the lining, took a second pinch of snuff, and at
last exclaimed, “No! that is a wretched rag!
It is beyond repair!”

“What!” he cried in the querulous tone of a
child. “Can this hole really not be repaired?
Look! Petrovitch; there are only two rents, and
you have enough pieces of cloth to mend them
with.”

“Yes, I have enough pieces of cloth; but how
should I sew them on? The stuff is quite worn
out; it won''t bear another stitch.”

“No, it won''t bear anything more; cloth after
all is only cloth, and in its present condition a
gust of wind might blow the wretched mantle into
tatters.”

“No!” answered Petrovitch decidedly.
“There is nothing more to be done with it; it is
completely worn out. It would be better if you
made yourself foot bandages out of it for the
winter; they are warmer than stockings. It was
the Germans who invented stockings for their
own profit.” Petrovitch never lost an opportunity
of having a hit at the Germans. “You
must certainly buy a new cloak,” he added.

“A new cloak?” exclaimed Akaki Akakievitch,
and it grew dark before his eyes. The
tailor''s work-room seemed to go round with him,
and the only object he could clearly distinguish
was the paper-patched general''s portrait on the
tailor''s snuff-box. “A new cloak!” he murmured,
as though half asleep. “But I have no
money.”

“About a hundred and fifty roubles,”
answered the tailor, pursing his lips. This
diabolical tailor took a special pleasure in
embarrassing his customers and watching the
expression of their faces with his squinting
single eye.

“A hundred and fifty roubles for a cloak!”
exclaimed Akaki Akakievitch in a tone which
sounded like an outcry—possibly the first he had
uttered since his birth.

“Yes,” replied Petrovitch. “And then the
marten-fur collar and silk lining for the hood
would make it up to two hundred roubles.”

“Petrovitch, I adjure you!” said Akaki
Akakievitch in an imploring tone, no longer
hearing nor wishing to hear the tailor''s words,
 
“try to make this cloak last me a little
longer.”

After this answer, Akaki departed, feeling
quite crushed; while Petrovitch, with his lips
firmly pursed up, feeling pleased with himself for
his firmness and brave defence of the art of
tailoring, remained sitting on the table.

Meanwhile Akaki wandered about the streets
like a somnambulist, at random and without an
object. “What a terrible business!” he said
to himself. “Really, I could never have believed
that it would come to that. No,” he
continued after a short pause, “I could not
have guessed that it would come to that. Now
I find myself in a completely unexpected situation—in
a difficulty that——”

As he thus continued his monologue, instead
of approaching his dwelling, he went, without
noticing it, in quite a wrong direction. A
chimney-sweep brushed against him and blackened
his back as he passed by. From a house
where building was going on, a bucket of plaster
of Paris was emptied on his head. But he saw
and heard nothing. Only when he collided with
a sentry, who, after he had planted his halberd
beside him, was shaking out some snuff from his
snuff-box with a bony hand, was he startled out
of his reverie.

“What do you want?” the rough guardian
of civic order exclaimed. “Can''t you walk on
the pavement properly?”

This sudden address at last completely roused
Akaki from his torpid condition. He collected
his thoughts, considered his situation clearly, and
began to take counsel with himself seriously and
frankly, as with a friend to whom one entrusts
the most intimate secrets.

“No!” he said at last. “To-day I will get
nothing from Petrovitch—to-day he is in a bad
humour—perhaps his wife has beaten him—I
will look him up again next Sunday. On Saturday
evenings he gets intoxicated; then the next
day he wants a pick-me-up—his wife gives him
no money—I squeeze a ten-kopeck piece into
his hand; then he will be more reasonable and
we can discuss the cloak further.”

Encouraged by these reflections, Akaki waited
patiently till Sunday. On that day, having seen
Petrovitch''s wife leave the house, he betook
himself to the tailor''s and found him, as he had
expected, in a very depressed state as the result
of his Saturday''s dissipation. But hardly had
Akaki let a word fall about the mantle than the
diabolical tailor awoke from his torpor and
exclaimed, “No, nothing can be done; you must
certainly buy a new cloak.”

“Thanks, my dear friend,” said Petrovitch;
“that will get me a pick-me-up, and I will
drink your health with it. But as for your old
mantle, what is the use of talking about it? It
isn''t worth a farthing. Let me only get to
work; I will make you a splendid one, I
promise!”

“No, and again no,” answered Petrovitch.
“It is quite impossible. Trust me; I won''t take
you in. I will even put silver hooks and eyes
on the collar, as is now the fashion.”

This time Akaki saw that he must follow the
tailor''s advice, and again all his courage sank.
He must have a new mantle made. But how
should he pay for it? He certainly expected a
Christmas bonus at the office; but that money had
been allotted beforehand. He must buy a pair
of trousers, and pay his shoemaker for repairing
two pairs of boots, and buy some fresh linen.
Even if, by an unexpected stroke of good luck,
the director raised the usual bonus from forty to
fifty roubles, what was such a small amount in
comparison with the immense sum which Petrovitch
demanded? A mere drop of water in the
sea.

At any rate, he might expect that Petrovitch,
if he were in a good humour, would lower the
price of the cloak to eighty roubles; but where
 
were these eighty roubles to be found? Perhaps
he might succeed if he left no stone unturned,
in raising half the sum; but he saw no means of
procuring the other half. As regards the first
half, he had been in the habit, as often as he
received a rouble, of placing a kopeck in a
money-box. At the end of each half-year he
changed these copper coins for silver. He had
been doing this for some time, and his savings
just now amounted to forty roubles. Thus he
already had half the required sum. But the
other half!

Akaki made long calculations, and at last
determined that he must, at least for a whole
year, reduce some of his daily expenses. He
would have to give up his tea in the evening, and
copy his documents in his landlady''s room, in
order to economise the fuel in his own. He also
resolved to avoid rough pavements as much as
possible, in order to spare his shoes; and finally
to give out less washing to the laundress.

At first he found these deprivations rather
trying; but gradually he got accustomed to them,
and at last took to going to bed without any
supper at all. Although his body suffered from
this abstinence, his spirit derived all the richer
nutriment from perpetually thinking about his
new cloak. From that time it seemed as though
his nature had completed itself; as though he had
married and possessed a companion on his life
 
journey. This companion was the thought of his
new cloak, properly wadded and lined.

From that time he became more lively, and
his character grew stronger, like that of a man
who has set a goal before himself which he will
reach at all costs. All that was indecisive and
vague in his gait and gestures had disappeared.
A new fire began to gleam in his eyes, and in
his bold dreams he sometimes even proposed to
himself the question whether he should not have
a marten-fur collar made for his coat.

These and similar thoughts sometimes caused
him to be absent-minded. As he was copying
his documents one day he suddenly noticed that
he had made a slip. “Ugh!” he exclaimed,
and crossed himself.

At least once a month he went to Petrovitch to
discuss the precious cloak with him, and to settle
many important questions, e.g. where and at
what price he should buy the cloth, and what
colour he should choose.

Each of these visits gave rise to new discussions,
but he always returned home in a happier
mood, feeling that at last the day must come
when all the materials would have been bought
and the cloak would be lying ready to put on.

This great event happened sooner than he had
hoped. The director gave him a bonus, not of
forty or fifty, but of five-and-sixty roubles. Had
the worthy official noticed that Akaki needed a
 
new mantle, or was the exceptional amount of
the gift only due to chance?

However that might be, Akaki was now richer
by twenty roubles. Such an access of wealth
necessarily hastened his important undertaking.
After two or three more months of enduring
hunger, he had collected his eighty roubles.
His heart, generally so quiet, began to beat
violently; he hastened to Petrovitch, who accompanied
him to a draper''s shop. There, without
hesitating, they bought a very fine piece of cloth.
For more than half a year they had discussed the
matter incessantly, and gone round the shops
inquiring prices. Petrovitch examined the cloth,
and said they would not find anything better.
For the lining they chose a piece of such firm and
thickly woven linen that the tailor declared it was
better than silk; it also had a splendid gloss on
it. They did not buy marten fur, for it was too
dear, but chose the best catskin in the shop,
which was a very good imitation of the former.

It took Petrovitch quite fourteen days to make
the mantle, for he put an extra number of
stitches into it. He charged twelve roubles for
his work, and said he could not ask less; it was
all sewn with silk, and the tailor smoothed the
sutures with his teeth.

At last the day came—I cannot name it
certainly, but it assuredly was the most solemn
in Akaki''s life—when the tailor brought the
 
cloak. He brought it early in the morning,
before the titular councillor started for his office.
He could not have come at a more suitable
moment, for the cold had again begun to be
very severe.

Petrovitch entered the room with the dignified
mien of an important tailor. His face wore
a peculiarly serious expression, such as Akaki
had never seen on it. He was fully conscious
of his dignity, and of the gulf which separates
the tailor who only repairs old clothes from the
artist who makes new ones.

The cloak had been brought wrapped up in a
large, new, freshly washed handkerchief, which
the tailor carefully opened, folded, and placed
in his pocket. Then he proudly took the cloak
in both hands and laid it on Akaki Akakievitch''s
shoulders. He pulled it straight behind to see
how it hung majestically in its whole length.
Finally he wished to see the effect it made when
unbuttoned. Akaki, however, wished to try
the sleeves, which fitted wonderfully well. In
brief, the cloak was irreproachable, and its fit
and cut left nothing to be desired.

While the tailor was contemplating his work,
he did not forget to say that the only reason he
had charged so little for making it, was that he
had only a low rent to pay and had known Akaki
Akakievitch for a long time; he declared that
any tailor who lived on the Nevski Prospect
 
would have charged at least five-and-sixty
roubles for making up such a cloak.

The titular councillor did not let himself be
involved in a discussion on the subject. He
thanked him, paid him, and then sallied forth on
his way to the office.

Petrovitch went out with him, and remained
standing in the street to watch Akaki as long as
possible wearing the mantle; then he hurried
through a cross-alley and came into the main
street again to catch another glimpse of him.

Akaki went on his way in high spirits. Every
moment he was acutely conscious of having
a new cloak on, and smiled with sheer self-complacency.
His head was filled with only
two ideas: first that the cloak was warm, and
secondly that it was beautiful. Without noticing
anything on the road, he marched straight to
the chancellery, took off his treasure in the hall,
and solemnly entrusted it to the porter''s care.

I do not know how the report spread in the
office that Akaki''s old cloak had ceased to exist.
All his colleagues hastened to see his splendid
new one, and then began to congratulate him
so warmly that he at first had to smile with
self-satisfaction, but finally began to feel embarrassed.

But how great was his surprise when his cruel
colleagues remarked that he should formally
“handsel” his cloak by giving them a feast!
 
Poor Akaki was so disconcerted and taken aback,
that he did not know what to answer nor how to
excuse himself. He stammered out, blushing,
that the cloak was not so new as it appeared; it
was really second-hand.

One of his superiors, who probably wished to
show that he was not too proud of his rank and
title, and did not disdain social intercourse with
his subordinates, broke in and said, “Gentlemen!
Instead of Akaki Akakievitch, I will invite
you to a little meal. Come to tea with
me this evening. To-day happens to be my
birthday.”

All the others thanked him for his kind
proposal, and joyfully accepted his invitation.
Akaki at first wished to decline, but was told
that to do so would be grossly impolite and
unpardonable, so he reconciled himself to the
inevitable. Moreover, he felt a certain satisfaction
at the thought that the occasion would give
him a new opportunity of displaying his cloak in
the streets. This whole day for him was like a
festival day. In the cheerfullest possible mood
he returned home, took off his cloak, and hung
it up on the wall after once more examining the
cloth and the lining. Then he took out his old
one in order to compare it with Petrovitch''s
masterpiece. His looks passed from one to
the other, and he thought to himself, smiling,
“What a difference!”

He ate his supper cheerfully, and after he
had finished, did not sit down as usual to copy
documents. No; he lay down, like a Sybarite,
on the sofa and waited. When the time came,
he made his toilette, took his cloak, and went
out.

I cannot say where was the house of the
superior official who so graciously invited his
subordinates to tea. My memory begins to grow
weak, and the innumerable streets and houses
of St Petersburg go round so confusedly in my
head that I have difficulty in finding my way
about them. So much, however, is certain:
that the honourable official lived in a very fine
quarter of the city, and therefore very far from
Akaki Akakievitch''s dwelling.

At first the titular councillor traversed several
badly lit streets which seemed quite empty; but
the nearer he approached his superior''s house,
the more brilliant and lively the streets became.
He met many people, among whom were
elegantly dressed ladies, and men with beaverskin
collars. The peasants'' sledges, with their
wooden seats and brass studs, became rarer;
while now every moment appeared skilled coachmen
with velvet caps, driving lacquered sleighs
covered with bearskins, and fine carriages.

At last he reached the house whither he had
been invited. His host lived in a first-rate style;
a lamp hung before his door, and he occupied
 
the whole of the second story. As Akaki
entered the vestibule, he saw a long row of
galoshes; on a table a samovar was smoking and
hissing; many cloaks, some of them adorned
with velvet and fur collars, hung on the wall.
In the adjoining room he heard a confused noise,
which assumed a more decided character when
a servant opened the door and came out bearing
a tray full of empty cups, a milk-jug, and a
basket of biscuits. Evidently the guests had
been there some time and had already drunk
their first cup of tea.

After hanging his cloak on a peg, Akaki
approached the room in which his colleagues,
smoking long pipes, were sitting round the card-table
and making a good deal of noise. He
entered the room, but remained standing by the
door, not knowing what to do; but his colleagues
greeted him with loud applause, and all hastened
into the vestibule to take another look at his
cloak. This excitement quite robbed the good
titular councillor of his composure; but in his
simplicity of heart he rejoiced at the praises
which were lavished on his precious cloak.
Soon afterwards his colleagues left him to himself
and resumed their whist parties.

Akaki felt much embarrassed, and did not
know what to do with his feet and hands.
Finally he sat down by the players; looked now
at their faces and now at the cards; then he
 
yawned and remembered that it was long past
his usual bedtime. He made an attempt to go,
but they held him back and told him that he
could not do so without drinking a glass of
champagne on what was for him such a memorable
day.

Soon supper was brought. It consisted of
cold veal, cakes, and pastry of various kinds,
accompanied by several bottles of champagne.
Akaki was obliged to drink two glasses of it, and
found everything round him take on a more
cheerful aspect. But he could not forget that it
was already midnight and that he ought to have
been in bed long ago. From fear of being kept
back again, he slipped furtively into the vestibule,
where he was pained to find his cloak lying
on the ground. He carefully shook it, brushed
it, put it on, and went out.

The street-lamps were still alight. Some of
the small ale-houses frequented by servants and
the lower classes were still open, and some had
just been shut; but by the beams of light which
shone through the chinks of the doors, it was
easy to see that there were still people inside,
probably male and female domestics, who were
quite indifferent to their employers'' interests.

Akaki Akakievitch turned homewards in a
cheerful mood. Suddenly he found himself in
a long street where it was very quiet by day and
still more so at night. The surroundings were
 
very dismal. Only here and there hung a lamp
which threatened to go out for want of oil; there
were long rows of wooden houses with wooden
fences, but no sign of a living soul. Only the
snow in the street glimmered faintly in the dim
light of the half-extinguished lanterns, and the
little houses looked melancholy in the darkness.

Akaki went on till the street opened into an
enormous square, on the other side of which the
houses were scarcely visible, and which looked
like a terrible desert. At a great distance—God
knows where!—glimmered the light in a sentry-box,
which seemed to stand at the end of the
world. At the same moment Akaki''s cheerful
mood vanished. He went in the direction of the
light with a vague sense of depression, as though
some mischief threatened him. On the way he
kept looking round him with alarm. The huge,
melancholy expanse looked to him like a sea.
“No,” he thought to himself, “I had better not
look at it”; and he continued his way with his
eyes fixed on the ground. When he raised them
again he suddenly saw just in front of him several
men with long moustaches, whose faces he could
not distinguish. Everything grew dark before
his eyes, and his heart seemed to be constricted.

“That is my cloak!” shouted one of the men,
and seized him by the collar. Akaki tried to
call for help. Another man pressed a great
bony fist on his mouth, and said to him, “Just
 
try to scream again!” At the same moment
the unhappy titular councillor felt the cloak
snatched away from him, and simultaneously
received a kick which stretched him senseless
in the snow. A few minutes later he came to
himself and stood up; but there was no longer
anyone in sight. Robbed of his cloak, and feeling
frozen to the marrow, he began to shout with
all his might; but his voice did not reach the end
of the huge square. Continuing to shout, he
ran with the rage of despair to the sentinel in the
sentry-box, who, leaning on his halberd, asked
him why the deuce he was making such a hellish
noise and running so violently.

When Akaki reached the sentinel, he accused
him of being drunk because he did not see that
passers-by were robbed a short distance from his
sentry-box.

“I saw you quite well,” answered the sentinel,
“in the middle of the square with two
men; I thought you were friends. It is no good
getting so excited. Go to-morrow to the police
inspector; he will take up the matter, have the
thieves searched for, and make an examination.”

Akaki saw there was nothing to be done but
to go home. He reached his dwelling in a state
of dreadful disorder, his hair hanging wildly
over his forehead, and his clothes covered
with snow. When his old landlady heard him
 
knocking violently at the door, she sprang up
and hastened thither, only half-dressed; but at
the sight of Akaki started back in alarm. When
he told her what had happened, she clasped her
hands together and said, “You should not go to
the police inspector, but to the municipal Superintendent
of the district. The inspector will put
you off with fine words, and do nothing; but I
have known the Superintendent for a long time.
My former cook, Anna, is now in his service,
and I often see him pass by under our windows.
He goes to church on all the festival-days, and
one sees at once by his looks that he is an honest
man.”

After hearing this eloquent recommendation,
Akaki retired sadly to his room. Those who can
picture to themselves such a situation will understand
what sort of a night he passed. As early
as possible the next morning he went to the
Superintendent''s house. The servants told him
that he was still asleep. At ten o''clock he
returned, only to receive the same reply. At
twelve o''clock the Superintendent had gone out.

About dinner-time the titular councillor called
again, but the clerks asked him in a severe tone
what was his business with their superior. Then
for the first time in his life Akaki displayed an
energetic character. He declared that it was
absolutely necessary for him to speak with the
Superintendent on an official matter, and that
 
anyone who ventured to put difficulties in his
way would have to pay dearly for it.

This left them without reply. One of the
clerks departed, in order to deliver his message.
When Akaki was admitted to the Superintendent''s
presence, the latter''s way of receiving his
story was somewhat singular. Instead of confining
himself to the principal matter—the theft,
he asked the titular councillor how he came to
be out so late, and whether he had not been in
suspicious company.

Taken aback by such a question, Akaki did
not know what to answer, and went away without
knowing whether any steps would be taken
in the matter or not.

The whole day he had not been in his office—a
perfectly new event in his life. The next day
he appeared there again with a pale face and
restless aspect, in his old cloak, which looked
more wretched than ever. When his colleagues
heard of his misfortune, some were cruel enough
to laugh; most of them, however, felt a sincere
sympathy with him, and started a subscription
for his benefit; but this praiseworthy undertaking
had only a very insignificant result, because
these same officials had been lately called upon
to contribute to two other subscriptions—in the
first case to purchase a portrait of their director,
and in the second to buy a work which a friend
of his had published.

One of them, who felt sincerely sorry for
Akaki, gave him some good advice for want of
something better. He told him it was a waste
of time to go again to the Superintendent,
because even in case that this official succeeded
in recovering the cloak, the police would keep it
till the titular councillor had indisputably proved
that he was the real owner of it. Akaki''s friend
suggested to him to go to a certain important
personage, who because of his connection with
the authorities could expedite the matter.

In his bewilderment, Akaki resolved to follow
this advice. It was not known what position
this personage occupied, nor how high it really
was; the only facts known were that he had
only recently been placed in it, and that there
must be still higher personages than himself, as
he was leaving no stone unturned in order to get
promotion. When he entered his private room,
he made his subordinates wait for him on the
stairs below, and no one had direct access to
him. If anyone called with a request to see him,
the secretary of the board informed the Government
secretary, who in his turn passed it on to
a higher official, and the latter informed the
important personage himself.

That is the way business is carried on in our
Holy Russia. In the endeavour to resemble the
higher officials, everyone imitates the manners
of his superiors. Not long ago a titular councillor,
 
who was appointed to the headship of a
little office, immediately placed over the door
of one of his two tiny rooms the inscription
“Council-chamber.” Outside it were placed
servants with red collars and lace-work on their
coats, in order to announce petitioners, and to
conduct them into the chamber which was hardly
large enough to contain a chair.

But let us return to the important personage
in question. His way of carrying things on was
dignified and imposing, but a trifle complicated.
His system might be summed up in a single
word—“severity.” This word he would repeat
in a sonorous tone three times in succession, and
the last time turn a piercing look on the person
with whom he happened to be speaking. He
might have spared himself the trouble of displaying
so much disciplinary energy; the ten
officials who were under his command feared
him quite sufficiently without it. As soon as
they were aware of his approach, they would lay
down their pens, and hasten to station themselves
in a respectful attitude as he passed by.
In converse with his subordinates, he preserved
a stiff, unbending attitude, and generally confined
himself to such expressions as “What do
you want? Do you know with whom you are
speaking? Do you consider who is in front of
you?”

For the rest, he was a good-natured man,
 
friendly and amiable with his acquaintances.
But the title of “District-Superintendent” had
turned his head. Since the time when it had
been bestowed upon him, he lived for a great
part of the day in a kind of dizzy self-intoxication.
Among his equals, however, he recovered
his equilibrium, and then showed his real
amiability in more than one direction; but as
soon as he found himself in the society of anyone
of less rank than himself, he entrenched himself
in a severe taciturnity. This situation was all
the more painful for him as he was quite aware
that he might have passed his time more agreeably.

All who watched him at such moments perceived
clearly that he longed to take part in an
interesting conversation, but that the fear of
displaying some unguarded courtesy, of appearing
too confidential, and thereby doing a deadly
injury to his dignity, held him back. In order
to avoid such a risk, he maintained an unnatural
reserve, and only spoke from time to time in
monosyllables. He had driven this habit to such
a pitch that people called him “The Tedious,”
and the title was well deserved.

Such was the person to whose aid Akaki
wished to appeal. The moment at which he
came seemed expressly calculated to flatter the
Superintendent''s vanity, and accordingly to help
forward the titular councillor''s cause.

The high personage was seated in his office,
talking cheerfully with an old friend whom he
had not seen for several years, when he was told
that a gentleman named Akakievitch begged for
the honour of an interview.

The high personage lied; there was nothing
in the way of his granting the desired audience.
His friend and himself had already quite exhausted
various topics of conversation. Many
long, embarrassing pauses had occurred, during
which they had lightly tapped each other on the
shoulder, saying, “So it was, you see.”

But the Superintendent refused to receive the
petitioner, in order to show his friend, who had
quitted the public service and lived in the
country, his own importance, and how officials
must wait in the vestibule till he chose to receive
them.

At last, after they had discussed various other
subjects with other intervals of silence, during
which the two friends leaned back in their chairs
and blew cigarette smoke in the air, the Superintendent
seemed suddenly to remember that
someone had sought an interview with him. He
 
called the secretary, who stood with a roll of
papers in his hand at the door, and told him to
admit the petitioner.

When he saw Akaki approaching with his
humble expression, wearing his shabby old
uniform, he turned round suddenly towards him
and said “What do you want?” in a severe
voice, accompanied by a vibrating intonation
which at the time of receiving his promotion he
had practised before the looking-glass for eight
days.

The modest Akaki was quite taken aback by
his harsh manner; however, he made an effort
to recover his composure, and to relate how his
cloak had been stolen, but did not do so without
encumbering his narrative with a mass of superfluous
detail. He added that he had applied to
His Excellence in the hope that through his
making a representation to the police inspector,
or some other high personage, the cloak might
be traced.

The Superintendent found Akaki''s method of
procedure somewhat unofficial. “Ah, sir,” he
said, “don''t you know what steps you ought to
take in such a case? Don''t you know the proper
procedure? You should have handed in your
petition at the chancellery. This in due course
would have passed through the hands of the chief
clerk and director of the bureau. It would
then have been brought before my secretary,
 
who would have made a communication to
you.”

“Allow me,” replied Akaki, making a strenuous
effort to preserve the remnants of his
presence of mind, for he felt that the perspiration
stood on his forehead, “allow me to remark
to Your Excellence that I ventured to trouble
you personally in this matter because secretaries—secretaries
are a hopeless kind of people.”

“What! How! Is it possible?” exclaimed
the Superintendent. “How could you say such
a thing? Where have you got your ideas from?
It is disgraceful to see young people so rebellious
towards their superiors.” In his official zeal
the Superintendent overlooked the fact that the
titular councillor was well on in the fifties, and
that the word “young” could only apply to him
conditionally, i.e. in comparison with a man of
seventy. “Do you also know,” he continued,
“with whom you are speaking? Do you consider
before whom you are standing? Do you
consider, I ask you, do you consider?” As he
spoke, he stamped his foot, and his voice grew
deeper.

Akaki was quite upset—nay, thoroughly
frightened; he trembled and shook and could
hardly remain standing upright. Unless one of
the office servants had hurried to help him, he
would have fallen to the ground. As it was, he
was dragged out almost unconscious.

But the Superintendent was quite delighted at
the effect he had produced. It exceeded all his
expectations, and filled with satisfaction at the
fact that his words made such an impression on a
middle-aged man that he lost consciousness, he
cast a side-glance at his friend to see what effect
the scene had produced on him. His self-satisfaction
was further increased when he observed
that his friend also was moved, and looked
at him half-timidly.

Akaki had no idea how he got down the stairs
and crossed the street, for he felt more dead than
alive. In his whole life he had never been so
scolded by a superior official, let alone one whom
he had never seen before.

He wandered in the storm which raged without
taking the least care of himself, nor sheltering
himself on the side-walk against its fury. The
wind, which blew from all sides and out of all the
narrow streets, caused him to contract inflammation
of the throat. When he reached home he
was unable to speak a word, and went straight
to bed.

The next day Akaki had a violent fever.
Thanks to the St Petersburg climate, his illness
developed with terrible rapidity. When the
doctor came, he saw that the case was already
hopeless; he felt his pulse and ordered him some
 
poultices, merely in order that he should not die
without some medical help, and declared at once
that he had only two days to live. After giving
this opinion, he said to Akaki''s landlady, “There
is no time to be lost; order a pine coffin, for an
oak one would be too expensive for this poor
man.”

Whether the titular councillor heard these
words, whether they excited him and made him
lament his tragic lot, no one ever knew, for he
was delirious all the time. Strange pictures
passed incessantly through his weakened brain.
At one time he saw Petrovitch the tailor and
asked him to make a cloak with nooses attached
for the thieves who persecuted him in bed, and
begged his old landlady to chase away the
robbers who were hidden under his coverlet.
At another time he seemed to be listening to the
Superintendent''s severe reprimand, and asking
his forgiveness. Then he uttered such strange
and confused remarks that the old woman
crossed herself in alarm. She had never heard
anything of the kind in her life, and these ravings
astonished her all the more because the expression
“Your Excellency” constantly occurred
in them. Later on he murmured wild disconnected
words, from which it could only be
gathered that his thoughts were continually
revolving round a cloak.

At last Akaki breathed his last. Neither his
 
room nor his cupboard were officially sealed up,
for the simple reason that he had no heir and left
nothing behind him but a bundle of goose-quills,
a notebook of white paper, three pairs of socks,
some trouser buttons, and his old coat.

Into whose possession did these relics pass?
Heaven only knows! The writer of this narrative
has never inquired.

Akaki was wrapped in his shroud, and laid
to rest in the churchyard. The great city of
St Petersburg continued its life as though he
had never existed. Thus disappeared a human
creature who had never possessed a patron or
friend, who had never elicited real hearty
sympathy from anyone, nor even aroused the
curiosity of the naturalists, though they are most
eager to subject a rare insect to microscopic
examination.

Without a complaint he had borne the scorn
and contempt of his colleagues; he had proceeded
on his quiet way to the grave without
anything extraordinary happening to him—only
towards the end of his life he had been joyfully
excited by the possession of a new cloak, and
had then been overthrown by misfortune.

Some days after his conversation with the
Superintendent, his superior in the chancellery,
where no one knew what had become of him,
sent an official to his house to demand his
presence. The official returned with the news
 
that no one would see the titular councillor any
more.

The next day his place was occupied by an
official of robuster fibre, a man who did not
trouble to make so many fair transcripts of state
documents.

It seems as though Akaki''s story ended here,
and that there was nothing more to be said
of him; but the modest titular councillor was
destined to attract more notice after his death
than during his life, and our tale now assumes a
somewhat ghostly complexion.

One day there spread in St Petersburg the
report that near the Katinka Bridge there
appeared every night a spectre in a uniform like
that of the chancellery officials; that he was
searching for a stolen cloak, and stripped all
passers-by of their cloaks without any regard
for rank or title. It mattered not whether they
were lined with wadding, mink, cat, otter, bear,
or beaverskin; he took all he could get hold of.
One of the titular councillor''s former colleagues
had seen the ghost, and quite clearly recognised
Akaki. He ran as hard as he could and managed
 
to escape, but had seen him shaking his fist
in the distance. Everywhere it was reported
that councillors, and not only titular councillors
but also state-councillors, had caught serious
colds in their honourable backs on account of
these raids.

The police adopted all possible measures in
order to get this ghost dead or alive into their
power, and to inflict an exemplary punishment
on him; but all their attempts were vain.

One evening, however, a sentinel succeeded
in getting hold of the malefactor just as he
was trying to rob a musician of his cloak. The
sentinel summoned with all the force of his lungs
two of his comrades, to whom he entrusted the
prisoner while he sought for his snuff-box in
order to bring some life again into his half-frozen
nose. Probably his snuff was so strong that
even a ghost could not stand it. Scarcely had
the sentinel thrust a grain or two up his nostrils
than the prisoner began to sneeze so violently
that a kind of mist rose before the eyes of the
sentinels. While the three were rubbing their
eyes, the prisoner disappeared. Since that day,
all the sentries were so afraid of the ghost that
they did not even venture to arrest the living
but shouted to them from afar “Go on! Go
on!”

Meanwhile the ghost extended his depredations
to the other side of the Katinka Bridge, and
 
spread dismay and alarm in the whole of the
quarter.

But now we must return to the Superintendent,
who is the real origin of our fantastic yet
so veracious story. First of all we must do him
the justice to state that after Akaki''s departure
he felt a certain sympathy for him. He was by
no means without a sense of justice—no, he
possessed various good qualities, but his infatuation
about his title hindered him from showing
his good side. When his friend left him, his
thoughts began to occupy themselves with the
unfortunate titular councillor, and from that
moment onwards he saw him constantly in his
mind''s eye, crushed by the severe reproof which
had been administered to him. This image so
haunted him that at last one day he ordered one
of his officials to find out what had become of
Akaki, and whether anything could be done for
him.

When the messenger returned with the news
that the poor man had died soon after that
interview, the Superintendent felt a pang in his
conscience, and remained the whole day absorbed
in melancholy brooding.

In order to banish his unpleasant sensations,
he went in the evening to a friend''s house, where
he hoped to find pleasant society and what was
the chief thing, some other officials of his own
rank, so that he would not be obliged to feel
 
bored. And in fact he did succeed in throwing
off his melancholy thoughts there; he unbent
and became lively, took an active part in the
conversation, and passed a very pleasant evening.
At supper he drank two glasses of champagne,
which, as everyone knows, is an effective
means of heightening one''s cheerfulness.

As he sat in his sledge, wrapped in his mantle,
on his way home, his mind was full of pleasant
reveries. He thought of the society in which
he had passed such a cheerful evening, and of
all the excellent jokes with which he had made
them laugh. He repeated some of them to
himself half-aloud, and laughed at them again.

From time to time, however, he was disturbed
in this cheerful mood by violent gusts of wind,
which from some corner or other blew a quantity
of snowflakes into his face, lifted the folds of his
cloak, and made it belly like a sail, so that he
had to exert all his strength to hold it firmly on
his shoulders. Suddenly he felt a powerful hand
seize him by the collar. He turned round, perceived
a short man in an old, shabby uniform,
and recognised with terror Akaki''s face, which
wore a deathly pallor and emaciation.

The titular councillor opened his mouth, from
which issued a kind of corpse-like odour, and
with inexpressible fright the Superintendent
heard him say, “At last I have you—by the
collar! I need your cloak. You did not
 
trouble about me when I was in distress; you
thought it necessary to reprimand me. Now
give me your cloak.”

The high dignitary nearly choked. In his
office, and especially in the presence of his
subordinates, he was a man of imposing
manners. He only needed to fix his eye on one
of them and they all seemed impressed by his
pompous bearing. But, as is the case with
many such officials, all this was only outward
show; at this moment he felt so upset that he
seriously feared for his health. Taking off his
cloak with a feverish, trembling hand, he handed
it to Akaki, and called to his coachman, “Drive
home quickly.”

When the coachman heard this voice, which
did not sound as it usually did, and had often
been accompanied by blows of a whip, he bent
his head cautiously and drove on apace.

Soon afterwards the Superintendent found
himself at home. Cloakless, he retired to his
room with a pale face and wild looks, and had
such a bad night that on the following morning
his daughter exclaimed “Father, are you ill?”
But he said nothing of what he had seen, though
a very deep impression had been made on him.
From that day onwards he no longer addressed
to his subordinates in a violent tone the words,
“Do you know with whom you are speaking?
Do you know who is standing before you?” Or
 
if it ever did happen that he spoke to them in a
domineering tone, it was not till he had first
listened to what they had to say.

Strangely enough, from that time the spectre
never appeared again. Probably it was the
Superintendent''s cloak which he had been seeking
so earnestly; now he had it and did not
want anything more. Various persons, however,
asserted that this formidable ghost was still to be
seen in other parts of the city. A sentinel went
so far as to say that he had seen him with his own
eyes glide like a furtive shadow behind a house.
But this sentinel was of such a nervous disposition
that he had been chaffed about his timidity
more than once. Since he did not venture to
seize the flitting shadow, he stole after it in the
darkness; but the shadow turned round and
shouted at him “What do you want?” shaking
an enormous fist, such as no man had ever
possessed.

This shadow, however, was taller than the
ghost of the titular councillor, and had an enormous
moustache. He went with great strides
towards the Obuchoff Bridge, and disappeared in
the darkness.

On the 25th March, 18—, a very strange occurrence
took place in St Petersburg. On the
Ascension Avenue there lived a barber of the
name of Ivan Jakovlevitch. He had lost his
family name, and on his sign-board, on which
was depicted the head of a gentleman with one
cheek soaped, the only inscription to be read
was, “Blood-letting done here.”

On this particular morning he awoke pretty
early. Becoming aware of the smell of fresh-baked
bread, he sat up a little in bed, and saw
his wife, who had a special partiality for coffee,
in the act of taking some fresh-baked bread out
of the oven.

“To-day, Prasskovna Ossipovna,” he said,
“I do not want any coffee; I should like a fresh
loaf with onions.”

“The blockhead may eat bread only as far as
I am concerned,” said his wife to herself; “then
I shall have a chance of getting some coffee.”
And she threw a loaf on the table.

For the sake of propriety, Ivan Jakovlevitch
drew a coat over his shirt, sat down at the table,
shook out some salt for himself, prepared two
onions, assumed a serious expression, and began
to cut the bread. After he had cut the loaf in
two halves, he looked, and to his great astonishment
saw something whitish sticking in it. He
carefully poked round it with his knife, and felt
it with his finger.

Ivan Jakovlevitch at first let his hands fall
from sheer astonishment; then he rubbed his
eyes and began to feel it. A nose, an actual
nose; and, moreover, it seemed to be the nose
of an acquaintance! Alarm and terror were
depicted in Ivan''s face; but these feelings were
slight in comparison with the disgust which took
possession of his wife.

“Whose nose have you cut off, you
monster?” she screamed, her face red with
anger. “You scoundrel! You tippler! I myself
will report you to the police! Such a
rascal! Many customers have told me that
while you were shaving them, you held them so
tight by the nose that they could hardly sit still.”

But Ivan Jakovlevitch was more dead than
alive; he saw at once that this nose could belong
to no other than to Kovaloff, a member of the
 
Municipal Committee whom he shaved every
Sunday and Wednesday.

“Stop, Prasskovna Ossipovna! I will wrap
it in a piece of cloth and place it in the corner.
There it may remain for the present; later on I
will take it away.”

“No, not there! Shall I endure an amputated
nose in my room? You understand
nothing except how to strop a razor. You know
nothing of the duties and obligations of a respectable
man. You vagabond! You good-for-nothing!
Am I to undertake all responsibility
for you at the police-office? Ah, you soap-smearer!
You blockhead! Take it away where
you like, but don''t let it stay under my
eyes!”

“The devil knows how that happened!” he
said at last, scratching his head behind his ear.
“Whether I came home drunk last night or not,
I really don''t know; but in all probability this
is a quite extraordinary occurrence, for a loaf
is something baked and a nose is something
different. I don''t understand the matter at
all.” And Ivan Jakovlevitch was silent. The
thought that the police might find him in unlawful
possession of a nose and arrest him, robbed
him of all presence of mind. Already he began
 
to have visions of a red collar with silver braid
and of a sword—and he trembled all over.

At last he finished dressing himself, and to the
accompaniment of the emphatic exhortations of
his spouse, he wrapped up the nose in a cloth and
issued into the street.

He intended to lose it somewhere—either at
somebody''s door, or in a public square, or in a
narrow alley; but just then, in order to complete
his bad luck, he was met by an acquaintance,
who showered inquiries upon him. “Hullo,
Ivan Jakovlevitch! Whom are you going to
shave so early in the morning?” etc., so that
he could find no suitable opportunity to do what
he wanted. Later on he did let the nose drop,
but a sentry bore down upon him with his
halberd, and said, “Look out! You have let
something drop!” and Ivan Jakovlevitch was
obliged to pick it up and put it in his pocket.

A feeling of despair began to take possession
of him; all the more as the streets became more
thronged and the merchants began to open their
shops. At last he resolved to go to the Isaac
Bridge, where perhaps he might succeed in
throwing it into the Neva.

But my conscience is a little uneasy that I have
not yet given any detailed information about
Ivan Jakovlevitch, an estimable man in many
ways.

Like every honest Russian tradesman, Ivan
 
Jakovlevitch was a terrible drunkard, and
although he shaved other people''s faces every
day, his own was always unshaved. His coat
(he never wore an overcoat) was quite mottled,
i.e. it had been black, but become brownish-yellow;
the collar was quite shiny, and instead
of the three buttons, only the threads by which
they had been fastened were to be seen.

Ivan Jakovlevitch was a great cynic, and when
Kovaloff, the member of the Municipal Committee,
said to him, as was his custom while being
shaved, “Your hands always smell, Ivan Jakovlevitch!”
the latter answered, “What do they
smell of?” “I don''t know, my friend, but
they smell very strong.” Ivan Jakovlevitch
after taking a pinch of snuff would then, by way
of reprisals, set to work to soap him on the cheek,
the upper lip, behind the ears, on the chin, and
everywhere.

This worthy man now stood on the Isaac
Bridge. At first he looked round him, then he
leant on the railings of the bridge, as though he
wished to look down and see how many fish were
swimming past, and secretly threw the nose,
wrapped in a little piece of cloth, into the
water. He felt as though a ton weight had been
lifted off him, and laughed cheerfully. Instead,
however, of going to shave any officials, he
turned his steps to a building, the sign-board of
which bore the legend “Teas served here,” in
 
order to have a glass of punch, when suddenly
he perceived at the other end of the bridge a
police inspector of imposing exterior, with long
whiskers, three-cornered hat, and sword hanging
at his side. He nearly fainted; but the police
inspector beckoned to him with his hand and
said, “Come here, my dear sir.”

Ivan Jakovlevitch, knowing how a gentleman
should behave, took his hat off quickly, went
towards the police inspector and said, “I hope
you are in the best of health.”

“By heaven, gracious sir, I was on the way
to my customers, and only looked down to see if
the river was flowing quickly.”

“I am willing to shave Your Grace two or
even three times a week gratis,” answered Ivan
Jakovlevitch.

“No, my friend, don''t put yourself out!
Three barbers are busy with me already, and
reckon it a high honour that I let them show me
their skill. Now then, out with it! What were
you doing there?”

Ivan Jakovlevitch grew pale. But here the
strange episode vanishes in mist, and what
further happened is not known.

Kovaloff, the member of the Municipal Committee,
awoke fairly early that morning, and
made a droning noise—“Brr! Brr!”—through
his lips, as he always did, though he could not
say why. He stretched himself, and told his
valet to give him a little mirror which was on the
table. He wished to look at the heat-boil which
had appeared on his nose the previous evening;
but to his great astonishment, he saw that instead
of his nose he had a perfectly smooth vacancy in
his face. Thoroughly alarmed, he ordered some
water to be brought, and rubbed his eyes with a
towel. Sure enough, he had no longer a nose!
Then he sprang out of bed, and shook himself
violently! No, no nose any more! He dressed
himself and went at once to the police superintendent.

But before proceeding further, we must certainly
give the reader some information about
Kovaloff, so that he may know what sort of a man
this member of the Municipal Committee really
was. These committee-men, who obtain that
title by means of certificates of learning, must
not be compared with the committee-men appointed
for the Caucasus district, who are of
quite a different kind. The learned committee-man—but
 
Russia is such a wonderful country
that when one committee-man is spoken of all
the others from Riga to Kamschatka refer it to
themselves. The same is also true of all other
titled officials. Kovaloff had been a Caucasian
committee-man two years previously, and could
not forget that he had occupied that position;
but in order to enhance his own importance,
he never called himself “committee-man” but
“Major.”

“Listen, my dear,” he used to say when he
met an old woman in the street who sold shirt-fronts;
“go to my house in Sadovaia Street and
ask ‘Does Major Kovaloff live here?’ Any
child can tell you where it is.”

Accordingly we will call him for the future
Major Kovaloff. It was his custom to take a daily
walk on the Neffsky Avenue. The collar of his
shirt was always remarkably clean and stiff. He
wore the same style of whiskers as those that are
worn by governors of districts, architects, and
regimental doctors; in short, all those who have
full red cheeks and play a good game of whist.
These whiskers grow straight across the cheek
towards the nose.

Major Kovaloff wore a number of seals, on
some of which were engraved armorial bearings,
and others the names of the days of the week.
He had come to St Petersburg with the view of
obtaining some position corresponding to his
 
rank, if possible that of vice-governor of a
province; but he was prepared to be content with
that of a bailiff in some department or other.
He was, moreover, not disinclined to marry, but
only such a lady who could bring with her a
dowry of two hundred thousand roubles. Accordingly,
the reader can judge for himself what
his sensations were when he found in his face,
instead of a fairly symmetrical nose, a broad,
flat vacancy.

To increase his misfortune, not a single
droshky was to be seen in the street, and so he
was obliged to proceed on foot. He wrapped
himself up in his cloak, and held his handkerchief
to his face as though his nose bled. “But
perhaps it is all only my imagination; it is impossible
that a nose should drop off in such a
silly way,” he thought, and stepped into a
confectioner''s shop in order to look into the
mirror.

Fortunately no customer was in the shop; only
small shop-boys were cleaning it out, and putting
chairs and tables straight. Others with sleepy
faces were carrying fresh cakes on trays, and
yesterday''s newspapers stained with coffee were
still lying about. “Thank God no one is
here!” he said to himself. “Now I can look
at myself leisurely.”

“What an infernal face!” he exclaimed, and
 
spat with disgust. “If there were only something
there instead of the nose, but there is
absolutely nothing.”

He bit his lips with vexation, left the confectioner''s,
and resolved, quite contrary to his habit,
neither to look nor smile at anyone on the street.
Suddenly he halted as if rooted to the spot before
a door, where something extraordinary happened.
A carriage drew up at the entrance; the
carriage door was opened, and a gentleman in
uniform came out and hurried up the steps.
How great was Kovaloff''s terror and astonishment
when he saw that it was his own nose!

At this extraordinary sight, everything seemed
to turn round with him. He felt as though he
could hardly keep upright on his legs; but,
though trembling all over as though with fever,
he resolved to wait till the nose should return
to the carriage. After about two minutes the
nose actually came out again. It wore a gold-embroidered
uniform with a stiff, high collar,
trousers of chamois leather, and a sword hung
at its side. The hat, adorned with a plume,
showed that it held the rank of a state-councillor.
It was obvious that it was paying “duty-calls.”
It looked round on both sides, called to the
coachman “Drive on,” and got into the carriage,
which drove away.

Poor Kovaloff nearly lost his reason. He did
not know what to think of this extraordinary
 
procedure. And indeed how was it possible
that the nose, which only yesterday he had on
his face, and which could neither walk nor drive,
should wear a uniform. He ran after the carriage,
which fortunately had stopped a short way
off before the Grand Bazar of Moscow. He
hurried towards it and pressed through a crowd
of beggar-women with their faces bound up,
leaving only two openings for the eyes, over
whom he had formerly so often made merry.

There were only a few people in front of the
Bazar. Kovaloff was so agitated that he could
decide on nothing, and looked for the nose
everywhere. At last he saw it standing before
a shop. It seemed half buried in its stiff collar,
and was attentively inspecting the wares displayed.

“How can I get at it?” thought Kovaloff.
“Everything—the uniform, the hat, and so on—show
that it is a state-councillor. How the
deuce has that happened?”

“It seems to me strange, most respected sir—you
should know where you belong—and I find
you all of a sudden—where? Judge yourself.”

“How shall I make my meaning plainer to
him?” Then plucking up fresh courage, he
continued, “Naturally—besides I am a Major.
You must admit it is not befitting that I should
go about without a nose. An old apple-woman
on the Ascension Bridge may carry on her business
without one, but since I am on the look out
for a post; besides in many houses I am acquainted
with ladies of high position—Madame
Tchektyriev, wife of a state-councillor, and
many others. So you see—I do not know,
honourable sir, what you——” (here the Major
shrugged his shoulders). “Pardon me; if one
regards the matter from the point of view of
duty and honour—you will yourself understand——”

“Honourable sir,” said Kovaloff with
dignity, “I do not know how I am to understand
your words. It seems to me the matter is as
clear as possible. Or do you wish—but you are
after all my own nose!”

The nose looked at the Major and wrinkled its
forehead. “There you are wrong, respected
sir; I am myself. Besides, there can be no close
 
relations between us. To judge by the buttons
of your uniform, you must be in quite a different
department to mine.” So saying, the nose
turned away.

Kovaloff was completely puzzled; he did not
know what to do, and still less what to think.
At this moment he heard the pleasant rustling of
a lady''s dress, and there approached an elderly
lady wearing a quantity of lace, and by her side
her graceful daughter in a white dress which set
off her slender figure to advantage, and wearing
a light straw hat. Behind the ladies marched a
tall lackey with long whiskers.

Kovaloff advanced a few steps, adjusted his
cambric collar, arranged his seals which hung
by a little gold chain, and with smiling face fixed
his eyes on the graceful lady, who bowed lightly
like a spring flower, and raised to her brow
her little white hand with transparent fingers.
He smiled still more when he spied under the
brim of her hat her little round chin, and part
of her cheek faintly tinted with rose-colour.
But suddenly he sprang back as though he had
been scorched. He remembered that he had
nothing but an absolute blank in place of a nose,
and tears started to his eyes. He turned round
in order to tell the gentleman in uniform that he
was only a state-councillor in appearance, but
really a scoundrel and a rascal, and nothing else
but his own nose; but the nose was no longer
 
there. He had had time to go, doubtless in
order to continue his visits.

His disappearance plunged Kovaloff into
despair. He went back and stood for a moment
under a colonnade, looking round him on all
sides in hope of perceiving the nose somewhere.
He remembered very well that it wore a hat with
a plume in it and a gold-embroidered uniform;
but he had not noticed the shape of the cloak,
nor the colour of the carriages and the horses,
nor even whether a lackey stood behind it, and,
if so, what sort of livery he wore. Moreover,
so many carriages were passing that it would
have been difficult to recognise one, and even if
he had done so, there would have been no means
of stopping it.

The day was fine and sunny. An immense
crowd was passing to and fro in the Neffsky
Avenue; a variegated stream of ladies flowed
along the pavement. There was his acquaintance,
the Privy Councillor, whom he was accustomed
to style “General,” especially when
strangers were present. There was Iarygin, his
intimate friend who always lost in the evenings
at whist; and there another Major, who had
obtained the rank of committee-man in the
Caucasus, beckoned to him.

“Go to the deuce!” said Kovaloff sotto voce.
“Hi! coachman, drive me straight to the superintendent
of police.” So saying, he got into a
 
droshky and continued to shout all the time to
the coachman “Drive hard!”

“Yes,” continued the porter, “he has only
just gone out; if you had been a moment
earlier you would perhaps have caught
him.”

Kovaloff, still holding his handkerchief to his
face, re-entered the droshky and cried in a
despairing voice “Drive on!”

This question made Kovaloff reflect. In his
situation it was necessary to have recourse to the
police; not because the affair had anything to do
with them directly but because they acted more
promptly than other authorities. As for demanding
any explanation from the department
to which the nose claimed to belong, it would,
he felt, be useless, for the answers of that
gentleman showed that he regarded nothing as
sacred, and he might just as likely have lied in
this matter as in saying that he had never seen
Kovaloff.

But just as he was about to order the coachman
to drive to the police-station, the idea
occurred to him that this rascally scoundrel who,
at their first meeting, had behaved so disloyally
towards him, might, profiting by the delay, quit
the city secretly; and then all his searching would
be in vain, or might last over a whole month.
Finally, as though visited with a heavenly inspiration,
he resolved to go directly to an advertisement
office, and to advertise the loss of his
nose, giving all its distinctive characteristics in
detail, so that anyone who found it might bring
it at once to him, or at any rate inform him
where it lived. Having decided on this course,
he ordered the coachman to drive to the advertisement
office, and all the way he continued to
punch him in the back—“Quick, scoundrel!
quick!”

At last they arrived, and Kovaloff, out of
breath, rushed into a little room where a grey-haired
official, in an old coat and with spectacles
on his nose, sat at a table holding his pen
between his teeth, counting a heap of copper
coins.

“At your service, sir,” answered the grey-haired
functionary, looking up and then fastening
 
his eyes again on the heap of coins before
him.

“Have the kindness to wait a minute,”
answered the official, putting down figures on
paper with one hand, and with the other moving
two balls on his calculating-frame.

A lackey, whose silver-laced coat showed that
he served in one of the houses of the nobility,
was standing by the table with a note in his hand,
and speaking in a lively tone, by way of showing
himself sociable. “Would you believe it, sir,
this little dog is really not worth twenty-four
kopecks, and for my own part I would not give a
farthing for it; but the countess is quite gone
upon it, and offers a hundred roubles'' reward to
anyone who finds it. To tell you the truth, the
tastes of these people are very different from
ours; they don''t mind giving five hundred or a
thousand roubles for a poodle or a pointer,
provided it be a good one.”

The official listened with a serious air while
counting the number of letters contained in the
note. At either side of the table stood a number
of housekeepers, clerks and porters, carrying
notes. The writer of one wished to sell a
barouche, which had been brought from Paris
in 1814 and had been very little used; others
wanted to dispose of a strong droshky which
 
wanted one spring, a spirited horse seventeen
years old, and so on. The room where these
people were collected was very small, and the air
was very close; but Kovaloff was not affected by
it, for he had covered his face with a handkerchief,
and because his nose itself was heaven
knew where.

“In a moment! In a moment! Two roubles,
twenty-four kopecks—one minute! One rouble,
sixty-four kopecks!” said the grey-haired
official, throwing their notes back to the housekeepers
and porters. “What do you wish?” he
said, turning to Kovaloff.

“I wish—” answered the latter, “I have just
been swindled and cheated, and I cannot get hold
of the perpetrator. I only want you to insert
an advertisement to say that whoever brings this
scoundrel to me will be well rewarded.”

“Why do you want my name? I have many
lady friends—Madame Tchektyriev, wife of a
state-councillor, Madame Podtotchina, wife of a
Colonel. Heaven forbid that they should get to
hear of it. You can simply write ‘committee-man,’
or, better, ‘Major.’”

“Mr Nose! Ah, you don''t understand me!
It is my own nose which has gone, I don''t know
where. The devil has played a trick on me.”

“I can''t tell you how, but the important point
is that now it walks about the city itself a state-councillor.
That is why I want you to advertise
that whoever gets hold of it should bring it as
soon as possible to me. Consider; how can I
live without such a prominent part of my body?
It is not as if it were merely a little toe; I would
only have to put my foot in my boot and no one
would notice its absence. Every Thursday I
call on the wife of M. Tchektyriev, the state-councillor;
Madame Podtotchina, a Colonel''s
wife who has a very pretty daughter, is one of
my acquaintances; and what am I to do now?
I cannot appear before them like this.”

The official compressed his lips and reflected.
“No, I cannot insert an advertisement like
that,” he said after a long pause.

“Because it might compromise the paper.
Suppose everyone could advertise that his nose
 
was lost. People already say that all sorts of
nonsense and lies are inserted.”

“You think so? Listen a minute. Last
week there was a case very like it. An official
came, just as you have done, bringing an advertisement
for the insertion of which he paid two
roubles, sixty-three kopecks; and this advertisement
simply announced the loss of a black-haired
poodle. There did not seem to be anything out
of the way in it, but it was really a satire; by the
poodle was meant the cashier of some establishment
or other.”

“That is a matter for a doctor. There are
said to be people who can provide you with any
kind of nose you like. But I see that you are a
witty man, and like to have your little joke.”

“Why put yourself out?” continued the
official, taking a pinch of snuff. “All the same,
if you don''t mind,” he added with a touch of
curiosity, “I should like to have a look at it.”

“It certainly does look odd,” said the official.
“It is perfectly flat like a freshly fried pancake.
It is hardly credible.”

“Very well. Are you going to hesitate
any more? You see it is impossible to refuse
to advertise my loss. I shall be particularly
obliged to you, and I shall be glad that this
incident has procured me the pleasure of making
your acquaintance.” The Major, we see, did
not even shrink from a slight humiliation.

“It certainly is not difficult to advertise it,”
replied the official; “but I don''t see what good
it would do you. However, if you lay so much
stress on it, you should apply to someone who
has a skilful pen, so that he may describe it as a
curious, natural freak, and publish the article in
the Northern Bee” (here he took another pinch)
“for the benefit of youthful readers” (he wiped
his nose), “or simply as a matter worthy of
arousing public curiosity.”

The committee-man felt completely discouraged.
He let his eyes fall absent-mindedly on
a daily paper in which theatrical performances
were advertised. Reading there the name of
an actress whom he knew to be pretty, he involuntarily
smiled, and his hand sought his pocket
to see if he had a blue ticket—for in Kovaloff''s
opinion superior officers like himself should not
take a lesser-priced seat; but the thought of his
lost nose suddenly spoilt everything.

The official himself seemed touched at his
difficult position. Desiring to console him, he
tried to express his sympathy by a few polite
words. “I much regret,” he said, “your
extraordinary mishap. Will you not try a
pinch of snuff? It clears the head, banishes
depression, and is a good preventive against
hÃ¦morrhoids.”

So saying, he reached his snuff-box out to
Kovaloff, skilfully concealing at the same time
the cover, which was adorned with the portrait of
some lady or other.

This act, quite innocent in itself, exasperated
Kovaloff. “I don''t understand what you find to
joke about in the matter,” he exclaimed angrily.
“Don''t you see that I lack precisely the essential
feature for taking snuff? The devil take
your snuff-box. I don''t want to look at snuff
now, not even the best, certainly not your vile
stuff!”

So saying, he left the advertisement office in
a state of profound irritation, and went to the
commissary of police. He arrived just as this
dignitary was reclining on his couch, and saying
to himself with a sigh of satisfaction, “Yes, I
shall make a nice little sum out of that.”

This police commissary was a great patron of
 
all the arts and industries; but what he liked
above everything else was a cheque. “It is a
thing,” he used to say, “to which it is not easy
to find an equivalent; it requires no food, it does
not take up much room, it stays in one''s pocket,
and if it falls, it is not broken.”

The commissary accorded Kovaloff a fairly
frigid reception, saying that the afternoon was
not the best time to come with a case, that nature
required one to rest a little after eating (this
showed the committee-man that the commissary
was acquainted with the aphorisms of the ancient
sages), and that respectable people did not have
their noses stolen.

The last allusion was too direct. We must
remember that Kovaloff was a very sensitive
man. He did not mind anything said against
him as an individual, but he could not endure
any reflection on his rank or social position. He
even believed that in comedies one might allow
attacks on junior officers, but never on their
seniors.

The commissary''s reception of him hurt his
feelings so much that he raised his head proudly,
and said with dignity, “After such insulting
expressions on your part, I have nothing more
to say.” And he left the place.

He reached his house quite wearied out. It
was already growing dark. After all his fruitless
search, his room seemed to him melancholy
 
and even ugly. In the vestibule he saw his
valet Ivan stretched on the leather couch and
amusing himself by spitting at the ceiling, which
he did very cleverly, hitting every time the same
spot. His servant''s equanimity enraged him;
he struck him on the forehead with his hat, and
said, “You good-for-nothing, you are always
playing the fool!”

Once in his room, the Major, tired and depressed,
threw himself in an armchair and, after
sighing a while, began to soliloquise:

“In heaven''s name, why should such a misfortune
befall me? If I had lost an arm or a
leg, it would be less insupportable; but a man
without a nose! Devil take it!—what is he good
for? He is only fit to be thrown out of the
window. If it had been taken from me in war or
in a duel, or if I had lost it by my own fault!
But it has disappeared inexplicably. But no! it
is impossible,” he continued after reflecting a few
moments, “it is incredible that a nose can disappear
like that—quite incredible. I must be
dreaming, or suffering from some hallucination;
perhaps I swallowed, by mistake instead of
water, the brandy with which I rub my chin after
being shaved. That fool of an Ivan must have
forgotten to take it away, and I must have
swallowed it.”

In order to find out whether he were really
drunk, the Major pinched himself so hard that
he unvoluntarily uttered a cry. The pain convinced
him that he was quite wide awake. He
walked slowly to the looking-glass and at first
closed his eyes, hoping to see his nose suddenly
in its proper place; but on opening them, he
started back. “What a hideous sight!” he
exclaimed.

It was really incomprehensible. One might
easily lose a button, a silver spoon, a watch, or
something similar; but a loss like this, and in
one''s own dwelling!

After considering all the circumstances, Major
Kovaloff felt inclined to suppose that the cause
of all his trouble should be laid at the door of
Madame Podtotchina, the Colonel''s wife, who
wished him to marry her daughter. He himself
paid her court readily, but always avoided
coming to the point. And when the lady one
day told him point-blank that she wished him
to marry her daughter, he gently drew back,
declaring that he was still too young, and that he
had to serve five years more before he would be
forty-two. This must be the reason why the
lady, in revenge, had resolved to bring him into
disgrace, and had hired two sorceresses for that
object. One thing was certain—his nose had
not been cut off; no one had entered his room,
and as for Ivan Jakovlevitch—he had been
 
shaved by him on Wednesday, and during that
day and the whole of Thursday his nose had
been there, as he knew and well remembered.
Moreover, if his nose had been cut off he
would naturally have felt pain, and doubtless
the wound would not have healed so quickly,
nor would the surface have been as flat as a
pancake.

All kinds of plans passed through his head:
should he bring a legal action against the wife
of a superior officer, or should he go to her and
charge her openly with her treachery?

His reflections were interrupted by a sudden
light, which shone through all the chinks of the
door, showing that Ivan had lit the wax-candles
in the vestibule. Soon Ivan himself came in
with the lights. Kovaloff quickly seized a handkerchief
and covered the place where his nose
had been the evening before, so that his blockhead
of a servant might not gape with his mouth
wide open when he saw his master''s extraordinary
appearance.

He saw a police official of pleasant appearance,
with grey whiskers and fairly full cheeks—the
same who at the commencement of this story was
 
standing at the end of the Isaac Bridge. “You
have lost your nose?” he asked.

Joy had suddenly paralysed his tongue. He
stared at the police commissary on whose cheeks
and full lips fell the flickering light of the candle.

“By a very singular chance. It has been
arrested just as it was getting into a carriage for
Riga. Its passport had been made out some
time ago in the name of an official; and what is
still more strange, I myself took it at first for a
gentleman. Fortunately I had my glasses with
me, and then I saw at once that it was a nose.
I am shortsighted, you know, and as you stand
before me I cannot distinguish your nose, your
beard, or anything else. My mother-in-law can
hardly see at all.”

“Don''t put yourself out. Knowing that you
need it, I have brought it with me. Another
singular thing is that the principal culprit in the
matter is a scoundrel of a barber living in the
Ascension Avenue, who is now safely locked up.
I had long suspected him of drunkenness and
 
theft; only the day before yesterday he stole
some buttons in a shop. Your nose is quite
uninjured.” So saying, the police commissary
put his hand in his pocket and brought out the
nose wrapped up in paper.

“I should like to very much, but I cannot.
I must go at once to the House of Correction.
The cost of living is very high nowadays. My
mother-in-law lives with me, and there are
several children; the eldest is very hopeful and
intelligent, but I have no means for their
education.”

After the commissary''s departure, Kovaloff
remained for some time plunged in a kind of
vague reverie, and did not recover full consciousness
for several moments, so great was the
effect of this unexpected good news. He placed
the recovered nose carefully in the palm of his
hand, and examined it again with the greatest
attention.

“Yes, this is it!” he said to himself. “Here
is the heat-boil on the left side, which came out
yesterday.” And he nearly laughed aloud with
delight.

But nothing is permanent in this world. Joy
in the second moment of its arrival is already
less keen than in the first, is still fainter in the
 
third, and finishes by coalescing with our normal
mental state, just as the circles which the fall of
a pebble forms on the surface of water, gradually
die away. Kovaloff began to meditate, and saw
that his difficulties were not yet over; his nose
had been recovered, but it had to be joined on
again in its proper place.

And suppose it could not? As he put this
question to himself, Kovaloff grew pale. With
a feeling of indescribable dread, he rushed
towards his dressing-table, and stood before the
mirror in order that he might not place his nose
crookedly. His hands trembled.

Very carefully he placed it where it had been
before. Horror! It did not remain there.
He held it to his mouth and warmed it a little
with his breath, and then placed it there again;
but it would not hold.

But the nose seemed to be made of wood, and
fell back on the table with a strange noise, as
though it had been a cork. The Major''s face
began to twitch feverishly. “Is it possible that
it won''t stick?” he asked himself, full of alarm.
But however often he tried, all his efforts were
in vain.

He called Ivan, and sent him to fetch the
doctor who occupied the finest flat in the
mansion. This doctor was a man of imposing
appearance, who had magnificent black whiskers
 
and a healthy wife. He ate fresh apples every
morning, and cleaned his teeth with extreme
care, using five different tooth-brushes for three-quarters
of an hour daily.

The doctor came immediately. After having
asked the Major when this misfortune had happened,
he raised his chin and gave him a fillip
with his finger just where the nose had been, in
such a way that the Major suddenly threw back
his head and struck the wall with it. The doctor
said that did not matter; then, making him turn
his face to the right, he felt the vacant place and
said “H''m!” then he made him turn it to the
left and did the same; finally he again gave him
a fillip with his finger, so that the Major started
like a horse whose teeth are being examined.
After this experiment, the doctor shook his head
and said, “No, it cannot be done. Rather
remain as you are, lest something worse happen.
Certainly one could replace it at once, but I
assure you the remedy would be worse than the
disease.”

“All very fine, but how am I to go on without
a nose?” answered Kovaloff. “There is
nothing worse than that. How can I show
myself with such a villainous appearance? I go
into good society, and this evening I am invited
to two parties. I know several ladies, Madame
Tchektyriev, the wife of a state-councillor,
Madame Podtotchina—although after what she
 
has done, I don''t want to have anything to do
with her except through the agency of the police.
I beg you,” continued Kovaloff in a supplicating
tone, “find some way or other of replacing it;
even if it is not quite firm, as long as it holds at
all; I can keep it in place sometimes with my
hand, whenever there is any risk. Besides, I
do not even dance, so that it is not likely to be
injured by any sudden movement. As to your
fee, be in no anxiety about that; I can well
afford it.”

“Believe me,” answered the doctor in a voice
which was neither too high nor too low, but soft
and almost magnetic, “I do not treat patients
from love of gain. That would be contrary to
my principles and to my art. It is true that I
accept fees, but that is only not to hurt my
patients'' feelings by refusing them. I could
certainly replace your nose, but I assure you on
my word of honour, it would only make matters
worse. Rather let Nature do her own work.
Wash the place often with cold water, and I
assure you that even without a nose, you will be
just as well as if you had one. As to the nose
itself, I advise you to have it preserved in a
bottle of spirits, or, still better, of warm vinegar
mixed with two spoonfuls of brandy, and then
you can sell it at a good price. I would be
willing to take it myself, provided you do not
ask too much.”

“Excuse me,” said the doctor, taking his
leave. “I hoped to be useful to you, but I can
do nothing more; you are at any rate convinced
of my good-will.” So saying, the doctor left
the room with a dignified air.

Kovaloff did not even notice his departure.
Absorbed in a profound reverie, he only saw the
edge of his snow-white cuffs emerging from the
sleeves of his black coat.

The next day he resolved, before bringing a
formal action, to write to the Colonel''s wife and
see whether she would not return to him, without
further dispute, that of which she had deprived
him.

“I hardly understand your method of action.
Be sure that by adopting such a course you will
gain nothing, and will certainly not succeed in
making me marry your daughter. Believe me,
the story of my nose has become well known; it
is you and no one else who have taken the principal
part in it. Its unexpected separation from
the place which it occupied, its flight and its
appearances sometimes in the disguise of an
official, sometimes in proper person, are nothing
but the consequence of unholy spells employed
 by you or by persons who, like you, are addicted
to such honourable pursuits. On my part, I wish
to inform you, that if the above-mentioned nose
is not restored to-day to its proper place, I shall
be obliged to have recourse to legal procedure.

“Your letter has profoundly astonished me.
I must confess that I had not expected such
unjust reproaches on your part. I assure you
that the official of whom you speak has not been
at my house, either disguised or in his proper
person. It is true that Philippe Ivanovitch
Potantchikoff has paid visits at my house, and
though he has actually asked for my daughter''s
hand, and was a man of good breeding, respectable
and intelligent, I never gave him any hope.

“Again, you say something about a nose.
If you intend to imply by that that I wished to
snub you, i.e. to meet you with a refusal, I am
very astonished because, as you well know, I was
quite of the opposite mind. If after this you
wish to ask for my daughter''s hand, I should be
glad to gratify you, for such has also been the
object of my most fervent desire, in the hope of
 the accomplishment of which, I remain, yours
most sincerely,

“No,” said Kovaloff, after having reperused
the letter, “she is certainly not guilty. It is
impossible. Such a letter could not be written
by a criminal.” The committee-man was experienced
in such matters, for he had been often
officially deputed to conduct criminal investigations
while in the Caucasus. “But then how
and by what trick of fate has the thing happened?”
he said to himself with a gesture of
discouragement. “The devil must be at the
bottom of it.”

Meanwhile the rumour of this extraordinary
event had spread all over the city, and, as is
generally the case, not without numerous additions.
At that period there was a general disposition
to believe in the miraculous; the public
had recently been impressed by experiments in
magnetism. The story of the floating chairs in
Koniouchennaia Street was still quite recent,
and there was nothing astonishing in hearing
soon afterwards that Major Kovaloff''s nose was
to be seen walking every day at three o''clock
on the Neffsky Avenue. The crowd of curious
spectators which gathered there daily was enormous.
On one occasion someone spread a report
that the nose was in Junker''s stores and immediately
 
the place was besieged by such a crowd
that the police had to interfere and establish
order. A certain speculator with a grave, whiskered
face, who sold cakes at a theatre door,
had some strong wooden benches made which
he placed before the window of the stores, and
obligingly invited the public to stand on them
and look in, at the modest charge of twenty-four
kopecks. A veteran colonel, leaving his house
earlier than usual expressly for the purpose, had
the greatest difficulty in elbowing his way through
the crowd, but to his great indignation he saw
nothing in the store window but an ordinary
flannel waistcoat and a coloured lithograph
representing a young girl darning a stocking,
while an elegant youth in a waistcoat with large
lappels watched her from behind a tree. The
picture had hung in the same place for more
than ten years. The colonel went off, growling
savagely to himself, “How can the fools let
themselves be excited by such idiotic stories?”

Then another rumour got abroad, to the effect
that the nose of Major Kovaloff was in the habit
of walking not on the Neffsky Avenue but in the
Tauris Gardens. Some students of the Academy
of Surgery went there on purpose to see it. A
high-born lady wrote to the keeper of the gardens
asking him to show her children this rare phenomenon,
and to give them some suitable instruction
on the occasion.

All these incidents were eagerly collected by
the town wits, who just then were very short
of anecdotes adapted to amuse ladies. On the
other hand, the minority of solid, sober people
were very much displeased. One gentleman
asserted with great indignation that he could not
understand how in our enlightened age such
absurdities could spread abroad, and he was
astonished that the Government did not direct
their attention to the matter. This gentleman
evidently belonged to the category of those
people who wish the Government to interfere in
everything, even in their daily quarrels with their
wives.

Strange events happen in this world, events
which are sometimes entirely improbable. The
same nose which had masqueraded as a state-councillor,
and caused so much sensation in the
town, was found one morning in its proper place,
i.e. between the cheeks of Major Kovaloff, as if
nothing had happened.

This occurred on 7th April. On awaking, the
Major looked by chance into a mirror and perceived
a nose. He quickly put his hand to it; it
was there beyond a doubt!

“Oh!” exclaimed Kovaloff. For sheer joy
 
he was on the point of performing a dance barefooted
across his room, but the entrance of Ivan
prevented him. He told him to bring water,
and after washing himself, he looked again in
the glass. The nose was there! Then he dried
his face with a towel and looked again. Yes,
there was no mistake about it!

And he thought to himself at the same time,
“That will be a nice business if Ivan says to
me ‘No, sir, not only is there no boil, but your
nose itself is not there!’”

At this moment the barber, Ivan Jakovlevitch,
put his head in at the door, but as timidly as a
cat which has just been beaten for stealing lard.

Kovaloff seated himself. Jakovlevitch tied a
napkin under his chin, and in the twinkling of an
eye covered his beard and part of his cheeks with
a copious creamy lather.

“There it is!” said the barber to himself, as
he glanced at the nose. Then he bent his head
a little and examined it from one side. “Yes,
it actually is the nose—really, when one
thinks——” he continued, pursuing his mental
soliloquy and still looking at it. Then quite
gently, with infinite precaution, he raised two
fingers in the air in order to take hold of it by
the extremity, as he was accustomed to do.

Ivan Jakovlevitch let his arm fall and felt more
embarrassed than he had ever done in his life.
At last he began to pass the razor very lightly
over the Major''s chin, and although it was very
difficult to shave him without using the olfactory
organ as a point of support, he succeeded, however,
by placing his wrinkled thumb against the
Major''s lower jaw and cheek, thus overcoming
all obstacles and bringing his task to a safe
conclusion.

When the barber had finished, Kovaloff hastened
to dress himself, took a droshky, and drove
straight to the confectioner''s. As he entered it,
he ordered a cup of chocolate. He then stepped
straight to the mirror; the nose was there!

He returned joyfully, and regarded with a
satirical expression two officers who were in the
shop, one of whom possessed a nose not much
larger than a waistcoat button.

After that he went to the office of the department
 
where he had applied for the post of vice-governor
of a province or Government bailiff.
As he passed through the hall of reception, he
cast a glance at the mirror; the nose was there!
Then he went to pay a visit to another committee-man,
a very sarcastic personage, to whom he was
accustomed to say in answer to his raillery,
“Yes, I know, you are the funniest fellow in
St Petersburg.”

On the way he said to himself, “If the Major
does not burst into laughter at the sight of me,
that is a most certain sign that everything is in
its accustomed place.”

As he returned, he met Madame Podtotchina
with her daughter. He accosted them, and they
responded very graciously. The conversation
lasted a long time, during which he took more
than one pinch of snuff, saying to himself, “No,
you haven''t caught me yet, coquettes that you
are! And as to the daughter, I shan''t marry
her at all.”

After that, the Major resumed his walks on
the Neffsky Avenue and his visits to the theatre
as if nothing had happened. His nose also
remained in its place as if it had never quitted it.
From that time he was always to be seen smiling,
in a good humour, and paying attentions to pretty
girls.

Such was the occurrence which took place in
the northern capital of our vast empire. On
considering the account carefully we see that
there is a good deal which looks improbable about
it. Not to speak of the strange disappearance of
the nose, and its appearance in different places
under the disguise of a councillor of state, how
was it that Kovaloff did not understand that one
cannot decently advertise for a lost nose? I do
not mean to say that he would have had to pay
too much for the advertisement—that is a mere
trifle, and I am not one of those who attach too
much importance to money; but to advertise in
such a case is not proper nor befitting.

Another difficulty is—how was the nose found
in the baked loaf, and how did Ivan Jakovlevitch
himself—no, I don''t understand it at all!

But the most incomprehensible thing of all is,
how authors can choose such subjects for their
stories. That really surpasses my understanding.
In the first place, no advantage results
from it for the country; and in the second place,
no harm results either.

All the same, when one reflects well, there
really is something in the matter. Whatever
may be said to the contrary, such cases do occur—rarely,
it is true, but now and then actually.

October 3rd.—A strange occurrence has taken
place to-day. I got up fairly late, and when
Mawra brought me my clean boots, I asked her
how late it was. When I heard it had long
struck ten, I dressed as quickly as possible.

To tell the truth, I would rather not have gone
to the office at all to-day, for I know beforehand
that our department-chief will look as sour as
vinegar. For some time past he has been in the
habit of saying to me, “Look here, my friend;
there is something wrong with your head. You
often rush about as though you were possessed.
Then you make such confused abstracts of the
documents that the devil himself cannot make
them out; you write the title without any capital
letters, and add neither the date nor the docket-number.”
The long-legged scoundrel! He is
certainly envious of me, because I sit in the
director''s work-room, and mend His Excellency''s
pens. In a word, I should not have gone
to the office if I had not hoped to meet the
accountant, and perhaps squeeze a little advance
out of this skinflint.

A terrible man, this accountant! As for his
advancing one''s salary once in a way—you might
sooner expect the skies to fall. You may beg
and beseech him, and be on the very verge of
ruin—this grey devil won''t budge an inch. At
the same time, his own cook at home, as all the
world knows, boxes his ears.

I really don''t see what good one gets by
serving in our department. There are no plums
there. In the fiscal and judicial offices it is quite
different. There some ungainly fellow sits in a
corner and writes and writes; he has such a
shabby coat and such an ugly mug that one would
like to spit on both of them. But you should see
what a splendid country-house he has rented.
He would not condescend to accept a gilt porcelain
cup as a present. “You can give that to
your family doctor,” he would say. Nothing
less than a pair of chestnut horses, a fine carriage,
or a beaver-fur coat worth three hundred
roubles would be good enough for him. And
yet he seems so mild and quiet, and asks so
amiably, “Please lend me your penknife; I wish
to mend my pen.” Nevertheless, he knows how
to scarify a petitioner till he has hardly a whole
stitch left on his body.

In our office it must be admitted everything is
done in a proper and gentlemanly way; there
is more cleanness and elegance than one will
ever find in Government offices. The tables
 
are mahogany, and everyone is addressed as
“sir.” And truly, were it not for this official
propriety, I should long ago have sent in my
resignation.

I put on my old cloak, and took my umbrella,
as a light rain was falling. No one was to be
seen on the streets except some women, who had
flung their skirts over their heads. Here and
there one saw a cabman or a shopman with his
umbrella up. Of the higher classes one only
saw an official here and there. One I saw at the
street-crossing, and thought to myself, “Ah!
my friend, you are not going to the office, but
after that young lady who walks in front of you.
You are just like the officers who run after every
petticoat they see.”

As I was thus following the train of my
thoughts, I saw a carriage stop before a shop just
as I was passing it. I recognised it at once; it
was our director''s carriage. “He has nothing
to do in the shop,” I said to myself; “it must be
his daughter.”

I pressed myself close against the wall. A
lackey opened the carriage door, and, as I had
expected, she fluttered like a bird out of it.
How proudly she looked right and left; how she
drew her eyebrows together, and shot lightnings
from her eyes—good heavens! I am lost, hopelessly
lost!

But why must she come out in such abominable
 
weather? And yet they say women are so mad
on their finery!

She did not recognise me. I had wrapped
myself as closely as possible in my cloak. It
was dirty and old-fashioned, and I would not
have liked to have been seen by her wearing it.
Now they wear cloaks with long collars, but
mine has only a short double collar, and the
cloth is of inferior quality.

Her little dog could not get into the shop, and
remained outside. I know this dog; its name is
“Meggy.”

Who the deuce was that? I looked round
and saw two ladies hurrying by under an umbrella—one
old, the other fairly young. They
had already passed me when I heard the same
voice say again, “For shame, Meggy!”

What was that? I saw Meggy sniffing at a
dog which ran behind the ladies. The deuce!
I thought to myself, “I am not drunk? That
happens pretty seldom.”

“No, Fidel, you are wrong,” I heard Meggy
say quite distinctly. “I was—bow—wow!—I
was—bow! wow! wow!—very ill.”

What an extraordinary dog! I was, to tell
the truth, quite amazed to hear it talk human
language. But when I considered the matter
well, I ceased to be astonished. In fact, such
 
things have already happened in the world. It
is said that in England a fish put its head out of
water and said a word or two in such an extraordinary
language that learned men have been
puzzling over them for three years, and have not
succeeded in interpreting them yet. I also read
in the paper of two cows who entered a shop and
asked for a pound of tea.

Meanwhile what Meggy went on to say seemed
to me still more remarkable. She added, “I
wrote to you lately, Fidel; perhaps Polkan did
not bring you the letter.”

Now I am willing to forfeit a whole month''s
salary if I ever heard of dogs writing before.
This has certainly astonished me. For some
little time past I hear and see things which no
other man has heard and seen.

“I will,” I thought, “follow that dog in
order to get to the bottom of the matter.
Accordingly, I opened my umbrella and went
after the two ladies. They went down Bean
Street, turned through Citizen Street and Carpenter
Street, and finally halted on the Cuckoo
Bridge before a large house. I know this house;
it is Sverkoff''s. What a monster he is! What
sort of people live there! How many cooks,
how many bagmen! There are brother officials
of mine also there packed on each other like
herrings. And I have a friend there, a fine
player on the cornet.”

The ladies mounted to the fifth story. “Very
good,” thought I; “I will make a note of the
number, in order to follow up the matter at the
first opportunity.”

October 4th.—To-day is Wednesday, and I
was as usual in the office. I came early on
purpose, sat down, and mended all the pens.

Our director must be a very clever man.
The whole room is full of bookcases. I read the
titles of some of the books; they were very
learned, beyond the comprehension of people
of my class, and all in French and German. I
look at his face; see! how much dignity there is
in his eyes. I never hear a single superfluous
word from his mouth, except that when he hands
over the documents, he asks “What sort of
weather is it?”

No, he is not a man of our class; he is a real
statesman. I have already noticed that I am a
special favourite of his. If now his daughter
also—ah! what folly—let me say no more about
it!

I have read the Northern Bee. What foolish
people the French are! By heavens! I should
like to tackle them all, and give them a thrashing.
I have also read a fine description of a
ball given by a landowner of Kursk. The landowners
of Kursk write a fine style.

Then I noticed that it was already half-past
 
twelve, and the director had not yet left his
bedroom. But about half-past one something
happened which no pen can describe.

The door opened. I thought it was the
director; I jumped up with my documents from
the seat, and—then—she—herself—came into
the room. Ye saints! how beautifully she was
dressed. Her garments were whiter than a
swan''s plumage—oh how splendid! A sun,
indeed, a real sun!

“Your Excellency,” I wanted to exclaim,
“don''t have me executed, but if it must be
done, then kill me rather with your own angelic
hand.” But, God knows why, I could not bring
it out, so I only said, “No, he has not come yet.”

She glanced at me, looked at the books, and
let her handkerchief fall. Instantly I started
up, but slipped on the infernal polished floor,
and nearly broke my nose. Still I succeeded
in picking up the handkerchief. Ye heavenly
choirs, what a handkerchief! So tender and
soft, of the finest cambric. It had the scent of
a general''s rank!

After I had sat there about an hour, a flunkey
came in and said, “You can go home, Mr
Ivanovitch; the director has already gone out!”

I cannot stand these lackeys! They hang
about the vestibules, and scarcely vouchsafe to
greet one with a nod. Yes, sometimes it is even
worse; once one of these rascals offered me his
snuff-box without even getting up from his chair.
“Don''t you know then, you country-bumpkin,
that I am an official and of aristocratic birth?”

This time, however, I took my hat and overcoat
quietly; these people naturally never think
of helping one on with it. I went home, lay a
good while on the bed, and wrote some verses
in my note:

In the evening I wrapped myself in my cloak,
hastened to the director''s house, and waited
there a long time to see if she would come out
and get into the carriage. I only wanted to see
her once, but she did not come.

November 6th.—Our chief clerk has gone
mad. When I came to the office to-day he called
me to his room and began as follows: “Look
here, my friend, what wild ideas have got into
your head?”

“Consider well. You are already past forty;
it is quite time to be reasonable. What do you
imagine? Do you think I don''t know all your
tricks? Are you trying to pay court to the
director''s daughter? Look at yourself and
realise what you are! A nonentity, nothing else.
I would not give a kopeck for you. Look well
in the glass. How can you have such thoughts
with such a caricature of a face?”

May the devil take him! Because his own
face has a certain resemblance to a medicine-bottle,
because he has a curly bush of hair on
his head, and sometimes combs it upwards, and
sometimes plasters it down in all kinds of queer
ways, he thinks that he can do everything. I
know well, I know why he is angry with me.
He is envious; perhaps he has noticed the tokens
of favour which have been graciously shown me.
But why should I bother about him? A councillor!
What sort of important animal is that?
He wears a gold chain with his watch, buys
himself boots at thirty roubles a pair; may the
deuce take him! Am I a tailor''s son or some
other obscure cabbage? I am a nobleman! I
can also work my way up. I am just forty-two—an
age when a man''s real career generally
begins. Wait a bit, my friend! I too may get
to a superior''s rank; or perhaps, if God is
gracious, even to a higher one. I shall make a
 
name which will far outstrip yours. You think
there are no able men except yourself? I only
need to order a fashionable coat and wear a tie
like yours, and you would be quite eclipsed.

November 8th.—I was at the theatre. “The
Russian House-Fool” was performed. I laughed
heartily. There was also a kind of musical
comedy which contained amusing hits at barristers.
The language was very broad; I wonder
the censor passed it. In the comedy lines occur
which accuse the merchants of cheating; their
sons are said to lead immoral lives, and to
behave very disrespectfully towards the nobility.

The critics also are criticised; they are said
only to be able to find fault, so that authors have
to beg the public for protection.

Our modern dramatists certainly write amusing
things. I am very fond of the theatre. If
I have only a kopeck in my pocket, I always
go there. Most of my fellow-officials are uneducated
boors, and never enter a theatre unless
one throws free tickets at their head.

November 9th.—About eight o''clock I went to
the office. The chief clerk pretended not to
notice my arrival. I for my part also behaved
 
as though he were not in existence. I read
through and collated documents. About four
o''clock I left. I passed by the director''s house,
but no one was to be seen. After dinner I lay
for a good while on the bed.

November 11th.—To-day I sat in the director''s
room, mended twenty-three pens for
him, and for Her—for Her Excellence, his
daughter, four more.

The director likes to see many pens lying on
his table. What a head he must have! He
continually wraps himself in silence, but I don''t
think the smallest trifle escapes his eye. I should
like to know what he is generally thinking of,
what is really going on in this brain; I should like
to get acquainted with the whole manner of life
of these gentlemen, and get a closer view of their
cunning courtiers'' arts, and all the activities of
these circles. I have often thought of asking His
Excellence about them; but—the deuce knows
why!—every time my tongue failed me and I
could get nothing out but my meteorological
report.

I wish I could get a look into the spare-room
whose door I so often see open. And a second
small room behind the spare-room excites my
curiosity. How splendidly it is fitted up; what a
quantity of mirrors and choice china it contains!
I should also like to cast a glance into those
 
regions where Her Excellency, the daughter,
wields the sceptre. I should like to see how all
the scent-bottles and boxes are arranged in her
boudoir, and the flowers which exhale so delicious
a scent that one is half afraid to breathe.
And her clothes lying about which are too
ethereal to be called clothes—but silence!

To-day there came to me what seemed a
heavenly inspiration. I remembered the conversation
between the two dogs which I had overheard
on the Nevski Prospect. “Very good,”
I thought; “now I see my way clear. I must
get hold of the correspondence which these two
silly dogs have carried on with each other. In
it I shall probably find many things explained.”

I had already once called Meggy to me and
said to her, “Listen, Meggy! Now we are
alone together; if you like, I will also shut the
door so that no one can see us. Tell me now
all that you know about your mistress. I swear
to you that I will tell no one.”

But the cunning dog drew in its tail, ruffled up
its hair, and went quite quietly out of the door,
as though it had heard nothing.

I had long been of the opinion that dogs are
much cleverer than men. I also believed that
they could talk, and that only a certain obstinacy
kept them from doing so. They are especially
watchful animals, and nothing escapes their
observation. Now, cost what it may, I will go
 
to-morrow to Sverkoff''s house in order to ask
after Fidel, and if I have luck, to get hold of all
the letters which Meggy has written to her.

November 12th.—To-day about two o''clock
in the afternoon I started in order, by some
means or other, to see Fidel and question her.

I cannot stand this smell of Sauerkraut which
assails one''s olfactory nerves from all the shops
in Citizen Street. There also exhales such an
odour from under each house door, that one
must hold one''s nose and pass by quickly.
There ascends also so much smoke and soot from
the artisans'' shops that it is almost impossible to
get through it.

When I had climbed up to the sixth story,
and had rung the bell, a rather pretty girl with a
freckled face came out. I recognised her as the
companion of the old lady. She blushed a little
and asked “What do you want?”

She was a simple-minded girl, as I saw at once.
The dog came running and barking loudly. I
wanted to take hold of it, but the abominable
beast nearly caught hold of my nose with its
teeth. But in a corner of the room I saw its
sleeping-basket. Ah! that was what I wanted.
I went to it, rummaged in the straw, and to my
great satisfaction drew out a little packet of small
 
pieces of paper. When the hideous little dog
saw this, it first bit me in the calf of the leg, and
then, as soon as it had become aware of my theft,
it began to whimper and to fawn on me; but I
said, “No, you little beast; good-bye!” and
hastened away.

When I reached my room I wished to get to
work at once, and read through the letters by
daylight, since I do not see well by candle-light;
but the wretched Mawra had got the idea of
sweeping the floor. These blockheads of Finnish
women are always clean where there is no
need to be.

I then went for a little walk and began to think
over what had happened. Now at last I could
get to the bottom of all facts, ideas and motives!
These letters would explain everything. Dogs
are clever fellows; they know all about politics,
and I will certainly find in the letters all I want,
especially the character of the director and all
his relationships. And through these letters I
will get information about her who—but silence!

November 13th.—Now let us see! The letter
is fairly legible but the handwriting is somewhat
doggish.

“Dear Fidel!—I cannot get accustomed to
your ordinary name, as if they could not have
found a better one for you! Fidel! How tasteless!
How ordinary! But this is not the time
to discuss it. I am very glad that we thought of
corresponding with each other.”

(The letter is quite correctly written. The
punctuation and spelling are perfectly right.
Even our head clerk does not write so simply
and clearly, though he declares he has been at
the University. Let us go on.)

“I think that it is one of the most refined joys
of this world to interchange thoughts, feelings,
and impressions.”

(H''m! This idea comes from some book
which has been translated from German. I
can''t remember the title.)

“I speak from experience, although I have
not gone farther into the world than just before
our front door. Does not my life pass happily
and comfortably? My mistress, whom her
father calls Sophie, is quite in love with me.”

“Her father also often strokes me. I drink
tea and coffee with cream. Yes, my dear, I must
confess to you that I find no satisfaction in those
large, gnawed-at bones which Polkan devours in
the kitchen. Only the bones of wild fowl are
good, and that only when the marrow has not
been sucked out of them. They taste very nice
 
with a little sauce, but there should be no green
stuff in it. But I know nothing worse than the
habit of giving dogs balls of bread kneaded up.
Someone sits at table, kneads a bread-ball with
dirty fingers, calls you and sticks it in your mouth.
Good manners forbid your refusing it, and you
eat it—with disgust it is true, but you eat it.”

(The deuce! What is this? What rubbish!
As if she could find nothing more suitable to
write about! I will see if there is anything more
reasonable on the second page.)

“I am quite willing to inform you of everything
that goes on here. I have already mentioned
the most important person in the house,
whom Sophie calls ‘Papa.’ He is a very strange
man.”

(Ah! Here we are at last! Yes, I knew it;
they have a politician''s penetrating eye for all
things. Let us see what she says about “Papa.”)

“… a strange man. Generally he is silent;
he only speaks seldom, but about a week ago he
kept on repeating to himself, ‘Shall I get it or
not?’ In one hand he took a sheet of paper;
the other he stretched out as though to receive
something, and repeated, ‘Shall I get it or not?’
Once he turned to me with the question, ‘What
do you think, Meggy?’ I did not understand in
the least what he meant, sniffed at his boots, and
went away. A week later he came home with
his face beaming. That morning he was visited
 
by several officers in uniform who congratulated
him. At the dinner-table he was in a better
humour than I have ever seen him before.”

“… was in an unusually excited state.
She went to a ball, and I was glad that I could
write to you in her absence. She likes going to
balls, although she gets dreadfully irritated while
dressing. I cannot understand, my dear, what
is the pleasure in going to a ball. She comes
home from the ball at six o''clock in the early
morning, and to judge by her pale and emaciated
face, she has had nothing to eat. I could,
frankly speaking, not endure such an existence.
If I could not get partridge with sauce, or the
wing of a roast chicken, I don''t know what I
should do. Porridge with sauce is also tolerable,
but I can get up no enthusiasm for carrots,
turnips, and artichokes.”

The style is very unequal! One sees at once
that it has not been written by a man. The
 
beginning is quite intelligent, but at the end the
canine nature breaks out. I will read another
letter; it is rather long and there is no date.

“Ah, my dear, how delightful is the arrival of
spring! My heart beats as though it expected
something. There is a perpetual ringing in my
ears, so that I often stand with my foot raised,
for several minutes at a time, and listen towards
the door. In confidence I will tell you that I
have many admirers. I often sit on the window-sill
and let them pass in review. Ah! if you
knew what miscreations there are among them;
one, a clumsy house-dog, with stupidity written
on his face, walks the street with an important
air and imagines that he is an extremely important
person, and that the eyes of all the world
are fastened on him. I don''t pay him the least
attention, and pretend not to see him at all.

“And what a hideous bulldog has taken up
his post opposite my window! If he stood on
his hind-legs, as the monster probably cannot,
he would be taller by a head than my mistress''s
papa, who himself has a stately figure. This lout
seems, moreover, to be very impudent. I growl
at him, but he does not seem to mind that at all.
If he at least would only wrinkle his forehead!
Instead of that, he stretches out his tongue,
droops his big ears, and stares in at the window—this
rustic boor! But do you think, my dear,
 
that my heart remains proof against all temptations?
Alas no! If you had only seen that
gentlemanly dog who crept through the fence
of the neighbouring house. ‘Treasure’ is his
name. Ah, my dear, what a delightful snout he
has!”

(To the deuce with the stuff! What rubbish
it is! How can one blacken paper with such
absurdities. Give me a man. I want to see a
man! I need some food to nourish and refresh
my mind, and get this silliness instead. I will
turn the page to see if there is anything better
on the other side.)

“Sophie sat at the table and sewed something.
I looked out of the window and amused myself
by watching the passers-by. Suddenly a flunkey
entered and announced a visitor—‘Mr Teploff.’

“‘Show him in!’ said Sophie, and began to
embrace me. ‘Ah! Meggy, Meggy, do you
know who that is? He is dark, and belongs to
the Royal Household; and what eyes he has!
Dark and brilliant as fire.’

“Sophie hastened into her room. A minute
later a young gentleman with black whiskers
entered. He went to the mirror, smoothed his
hair, and looked round the room. I turned away
and sat down in my place.

“I pretended to observe nothing, and continued
 
to look out of the window. But I leant
my head a little on one side to hear what they
were talking about. Ah, my dear! what silly
things they discussed—how a lady executed the
wrong figure in dancing; how a certain Boboff,
with his expansive shirt-frill, had looked like a
stork and nearly fallen down; how a certain
Lidina imagined she had blue eyes when they
were really green, etc.

“I do not know, my dear, what special charm
she finds in her Mr Teploff, and why she is so
delighted with him.”

(It seems to me myself that there is something
wrong here. It is impossible that this Teploff
should bewitch her. We will see further.)

“If this gentleman of the Household pleases
her, then she must also be pleased, according to
my view, with that official who sits in her papa''s
writing-room. Ah, my dear, if you know what
a figure he is! A regular tortoise!”

“He has an extraordinary name. He always
sits there and mends the pens. His hair looks
like a truss of hay. Her papa always employs
him instead of a servant.”

(I believe this abominable little beast is referring
to me. But what has my hair got to do with
hay?)

You lie, cursed dog! What a scandalous
tongue! As if I did not know that it is envy
which prompts you, and that here there is
treachery at work—yes, the treachery of the
chief clerk. This man hates me implacably; he
has plotted against me, he is always seeking to
injure me. I''ll look through one more letter;
perhaps it will make the matter clearer.

“Fidel, my dear, pardon me that I have not
written for so long. I was floating in a dream
of delight. In truth, some author remarks,
‘Love is a second life.’ Besides, great changes
are going on in the house. The young chamberlain
is always here. Sophie is wildly in love with
him. Her papa is quite contented. I heard
from Gregor, who sweeps the floor, and is in
the habit of talking to himself, that the marriage
will soon be celebrated. Her papa will at any
rate get his daughter married to a general, a
colonel, or a chamberlain.”

Deuce take it! I can read no more. It is
all about chamberlains and generals. I should
like myself to be a general—not in order to sue
for her hand and all that—no, not at all; I
should like to be a general merely in order to
see people wriggling, squirming, and hatching
plots before me.

And then I should like to tell them that they
are both of them not worth spitting on. But it is
 
vexatious! I tear the foolish dog''s letters up in
a thousand pieces.

December 3rd.—It is not possible that the
marriage should take place; it is only idle gossip.
What does it signify if he is a chamberlain!
That is only a dignity, not a substantial thing
which one can see or handle. His chamberlain''s
office will not procure him a third eye in his
forehead. Neither is his nose made of gold; it
is just like mine or anyone else''s nose. He does
not eat and cough, but smells and sneezes with
it. I should like to get to the bottom of the
mystery—whence do all these distinctions come?
Why am I only a titular councillor?

Perhaps I am really a count or a general, and
only appear to be a titular councillor. Perhaps
I don''t even know who and what I am. How
many cases there are in history of a simple
gentleman, or even a burgher or peasant, suddenly
turning out to be a great lord or
baron? Well, suppose that I appear suddenly
in a general''s uniform, on the right shoulder an
epaulette, on the left an epaulette, and a blue
sash across my breast, what sort of a tune would
my beloved sing then? What would her papa,
our director, say? Oh, he is ambitious! He is
a freemason, certainly a freemason; however
much he may conceal it, I have found it out.
When he gives anyone his hand, he only reaches
 
out two fingers. Well, could not I this minute
be nominated a general or a superintendent? I
should like to know why I am a titular councillor—why
just that, and nothing more?

December 5th.—To-day I have been reading
papers the whole morning. Very strange things
are happening in Spain. I have not understood
them all. It is said that the throne is vacant,
the representatives of the people are in difficulties
about finding an occupant, and riots are
taking place.

All this appears to me very strange. How can
the throne be vacant? It is said that it will be
occupied by a woman. A woman cannot sit on
a throne. That is impossible. Only a king can
sit on a throne. They say that there is no king
there, but that is not possible. There cannot be
a kingdom without a king. There must be a
king, but he is hidden away somewhere. Perhaps
he is actually on the spot, and only some
domestic complications, or fears of the neighbouring
Powers, France and other countries,
compel him to remain in concealment; there
might also be other reasons.

December 8th.—I was nearly going to the
office, but various considerations kept me from
doing so. I keep on thinking about these
Spanish affairs. How is it possible that a woman
should reign? It would not be allowed, especially
 
by England. In the rest of Europe the
political situation is also critical; the Emperor of
Austria——

These events, to tell the truth, have so shaken
and shattered me, that I could really do nothing
all day. Mawra told me that I was very absent-minded
at table. In fact, in my absent-mindedness
I threw two plates on the ground so that
they broke in pieces.

After dinner I felt weak, and did not feel up
to making abstracts of reports. I lay most of
the time on my bed, and thought of the Spanish
affairs.

The year 2000: April 43rd.—To-day is a day
of splendid triumph. Spain has a king; he has
been found, and I am he. I discovered it to-day;
all of a sudden it came upon me like a flash
of lightning.

I do not understand how I could imagine that
I am a titular councillor. How could such a
foolish idea enter my head? It was fortunate
that it occurred to no one to shut me up in an
asylum. Now it is all clear, and as plain as
a pikestaff. Formerly—I don''t know why—everything
seemed veiled in a kind of mist.
That is, I believe, because people think that the
human brain is in the head. Nothing of the
sort; it is carried by the wind from the Caspian
Sea.

For the first time I told Mawra who I am.
When she learned that the king of Spain stood
before her, she struck her hands together
over her head, and nearly died of alarm. The
stupid thing had never seen the king of Spain
before!

I comforted her, however, at once by assuring
her that I was not angry with her for having
hitherto cleaned my boots badly. Women are
stupid things; one cannot interest them in
lofty subjects. She was frightened because she
thought all kings of Spain were like Philip II.
But I explained to her that there was a great
difference between me and him. I did not go
to the office. Why the deuce should I? No, my
dear friends, you won''t get me there again! I
am not going to worry myself with your infernal
documents any more.

Marchember 86. Between day and night.—To-day
the office-messenger came and summoned
me, as I had not been there for three weeks. I
went just for the fun of the thing. The chief
clerk thought I would bow humbly before him,
and make excuses; but I looked at him quite
indifferently, neither angrily nor mildly, and sat
down quietly at my place as though I noticed no
one. I looked at all this rabble of scribblers,
and thought, “If you only knew who is sitting
among you! Good heavens! what a to-do you
 
would make. Even the chief clerk would bow
himself to the earth before me as he does now
before the director.”

A pile of reports was laid before me, of which
to make abstracts, but I did not touch them with
one finger.

After a little time there was a commotion in
the office, and there a report went round that the
director was coming. Many of the clerks vied
with each other to attract his notice; but I did not
stir. As he came through our room, each one
hastily buttoned up his coat; but I had no idea
of doing anything of the sort. What is the
director to me? Should I stand up before him?
Never. What sort of a director is he? He is a
bottle-stopper, and no director. A quite ordinary,
simple bottle-stopper—nothing more. I
felt quite amused as they gave me a document
to sign.

They thought I would simply put down my
name—“So-and-so, Clerk.” Why not? But
at the top of the sheet, where the director generally
writes his name, I inscribed “Ferdinand VIII.”
in bold characters. You should have
seen what a reverential silence ensued. But
I made a gesture with my hand, and said,
“Gentlemen, no ceremony please!” Then I
went out, and took my way straight to the
director''s house.

He was not at home. The flunkey wanted not
 
to let me in, but I talked to him in such a way
that he soon dropped his arms.

I went straight to Sophie''s dressing-room.
She sat before the mirror. When she saw me,
she sprang up and took a step backwards; but I
did not tell her that I was the king of Spain.

But I told her that a happiness awaited her,
beyond her power to imagine; and that in spite
of all our enemies'' devices we should be united.
That was all which I wished to say to her, and I
went out. Oh, what cunning creatures these
women are! Now I have found out what woman
really is. Hitherto no one knew whom a woman
really loves; I am the first to discover it—she
loves the devil. Yes, joking apart, learned men
write nonsense when they pronounce that she is
this and that; she loves the devil—that is all.
You see a woman looking through her lorgnette
from a box in the front row. One thinks she is
watching that stout gentleman who wears an
order. Not a bit of it! She is watching the
devil who stands behind his back. He has
hidden himself there, and beckons to her with
his finger. And she marries him—actually—she
marries him!

That is all ambition, and the reason is that
there is under the tongue a little blister in which
there is a little worm of the size of a pin''s head.
And this is constructed by a barber in Bean
Street; I don''t remember his name at the
 
moment, but so much is certain that, in conjunction
with a midwife, he wants to spread
Mohammedanism all over the world, and that in
consequence of this a large number of people in
France have already adopted the faith of Islam.

No date. The day had no date.—I went for
a walk incognito on the Nevski Prospect. I
avoided every appearance of being the king of
Spain. I felt it below my dignity to let myself
be recognised by the whole world, since I must
first present myself at court. And I was also
restrained by the fact that I have at present no
Spanish national costume. If I could only get
a cloak! I tried to have a consultation with a
tailor, but these people are real asses! Moreover,
they neglect their business, dabble in
speculation, and have become loafers. I will
have a cloak made out of my new official uniform
which I have only worn twice. But to prevent
this botcher of a tailor spoiling it, I will make it
myself with closed doors, so that no one sees
me. Since the cut must be altogether altered,
I have used the scissors myself.

I don''t remember the date. The devil knows
what month it was. The cloak is quite ready.
Mawra exclaimed aloud when I put it on. I
will, however, not present myself at court yet;
the Spanish deputation has not yet arrived. It
would not be befitting if I appeared without
 
them. My appearance would be less imposing.
From hour to hour I expect them.

The 1st.—The extraordinary long delay of the
deputies in coming astonishes me. What can
possibly keep them? Perhaps France has a hand
in the matter; it is certainly hostilely inclined.
I went to the post office to inquire whether the
Spanish deputation had come. The postmaster
is an extraordinary blockhead who knows
nothing. “No,” he said to me, “there is no
Spanish deputation here; but if you want to send
them a letter, we will forward it at the fixed
rate.” The deuce! What do I want with a
letter? Letters are nonsense. Letters are
written by apothecaries….

Madrid, February 30th.—So I am in Spain
after all! It has happened so quickly that I
could hardly take it in. The Spanish deputies
came early this morning, and I got with them
into the carriage. This unexpected promptness
seemed to me strange. We drove so quickly
that in half an hour we were at the Spanish
frontier. Over all Europe now there are cast-iron
roads, and the steamers go very fast. A
wonderful country, this Spain!

As we entered the first room, I saw numerous
persons with shorn heads. I guessed at once
that they must be either grandees or soldiers, at
least to judge by their shorn heads.

The Chancellor of the State, who led me by
the hand, seemed to me to behave in a very
strange way; he pushed me into a little room
and said, “Stay here, and if you call yourself
‘King Ferdinand’ again, I will drive the wish
to do so out of you.”

I knew, however, that that was only a test,
and I reasserted my conviction; on which the
Chancellor gave me two such severe blows with
a stick on the back, that I could have cried out
with the pain. But I restrained myself, remembering
that this was a usual ceremony of old-time
chivalry when one was inducted into a high
position, and in Spain the laws of chivalry
prevail up to the present day. When I was
alone, I determined to study State affairs; I
discovered that Spain and China are one and the
same country, and it is only through ignorance
that people regard them as separate kingdoms.
I advise everyone urgently to write down the
word “Spain” on a sheet of paper; he will see
that it is quite the same as China.

But I feel much annoyed by an event which is
about to take place to-morrow; at seven o''clock
the earth is going to sit on the moon. This is
foretold by the famous English chemist, Wellington.
To tell the truth, I often felt uneasy
when I thought of the excessive brittleness and
fragility of the moon. The moon is generally
repaired in Hamburg, and very imperfectly. It
 
is done by a lame cooper, an obvious blockhead
who has no idea how to do it. He took waxed
thread and olive-oil—hence that pungent smell
over all the earth which compels people to hold
their noses. And this makes the moon so fragile
that no men can live on it, but only noses.
Therefore we cannot see our noses, because they
are on the moon.

When I now pictured to myself how the earth,
that massive body, would crush our noses to
dust, if it sat on the moon, I became so uneasy,
that I immediately put on my shoes and stockings
and hastened into the council-hall to give
the police orders to prevent the earth sitting on
the moon.

The grandees with the shorn heads, whom
I met in great numbers in the hall, were
very intelligent people, and when I exclaimed,
“Gentlemen! let us save the moon, for the earth
is going to sit on it,” they all set to work to fulfil
my imperial wish, and many of them clambered
up the wall in order to take the moon down.
At that moment the Imperial Chancellor came in.
As soon as he appeared, they all scattered, but I
alone, as king, remained. To my astonishment,
however, the Chancellor beat me with the stick
and drove me to my room. So powerful are
ancient customs in Spain!

January in the same year, following after
 
February.—I can never understand what kind
of a country this Spain really is. The popular
customs and rules of court etiquette are quite
extraordinary. I do not understand them at all,
at all. To-day my head was shorn, although I
exclaimed as loudly as I could, that I did
not want to be a monk. What happened afterwards,
when they began to let cold water trickle
on my head, I do not know. I have never
experienced such hellish torments. I nearly
went mad, and they had difficulty in holding me.
The significance of this strange custom is entirely
hidden from me. It is a very foolish and unreasonable
one.

Nor can I understand the stupidity of the kings
who have not done away with it before now.
Judging by all the circumstances, it seems to me
as though I had fallen into the hands of the
Inquisition, and as though the man whom I took
to be the Chancellor was the Grand Inquisitor.
But yet I cannot understand how the king could
fall into the hands of the Inquisition. The affair
may have been arranged by France—especially
Polignac—he is a hound, that Polignac! He
has sworn to compass my death, and now he is
hunting me down. But I know, my friend, that
you are only a tool of the English. They are
clever fellows, and have a finger in every pie.
All the world knows that France sneezes when
England takes a pinch of snuff.

The 25th.—To-day the Grand Inquisitor came
into my room; when I heard his steps in the
distance, I hid myself under a chair. When
he did not see me, he began to call. At first he
called “Poprishchin!” I made no answer.
Then he called “Axanti Ivanovitch! Titular
Councillor! Nobleman!” I still kept silence.
“Ferdinand the Eighth, King of Spain!” I
was on the point of putting out my head, but I
thought, “No, brother, you shall not deceive
me! You shall not pour water on my head
again!”

But he had already seen me and drove me from
under the chair with his stick. The cursed stick
really hurts one. But the following discovery
compensated me for all the pain, i.e. that every
cock has his Spain under his feathers. The
Grand Inquisitor went angrily away, and threatened
me with some punishment or other. I felt
only contempt for his powerless spite, for I know
that he only works like a machine, like a tool of
the English.

34 March. February, 349.—No, I have no
longer power to endure. O God! what are they
going to do with me? They pour cold water on
my head. They take no notice of me, and seem
neither to see nor hear. Why do they torture
me? What do they want from one so wretched
as myself? What can I give them? I possess
 
nothing. I cannot bear all their tortures; my
head aches as though everything were turning
round in a circle. Save me! Carry me away!
Give me three steeds swift as the wind! Mount
your seat, coachman, ring bells, gallop horses,
and carry me straight out of this world. Farther,
ever farther, till nothing more is to be seen!

Ah! the heaven bends over me already; a star
glimmers in the distance; the forest with its dark
trees in the moonlight rushes past; a bluish mist
floats under my feet; music sounds in the cloud;
on the one side is the sea, on the other, Italy;
beyond I also see Russian peasants'' houses. Is
not my parents'' house there in the distance?
Does not my mother sit by the window? O
mother, mother, save your unhappy son! Let a
tear fall on his aching head! See how they
torture him! Press the poor orphan to your
bosom! He has no rest in this world; they hunt
him from place to place.

Mother, mother, have pity on your sick child!
And do you know that the Bey of Algiers has a
wart under his nose?

Songs were echoing in the village street. It
was just the time when the young men and girls,
tired with the work and cares of the day, were
in the habit of assembling for the dance. In the
mild evening light, cheerful songs blended with
mild melodies. A mysterious twilight obscured
the blue sky and made everything seem indistinct
and distant. It was growing dark, but the
songs were not hushed.

A young Cossack, Levko by name, the son of
the village headman, had stolen away from the
singers, guitar in hand. With his embroidered
cap set awry on his head, and his hand playing
over the strings, he stepped a measure to the
music. Then he stopped at the door of a house
half hidden by blossoming cherry-trees. Whose
house was it? To whom did the door lead?
After a little while he played and sang:

“No one is there; my bright-eyed beauty is
fast asleep,” said the Cossack to himself as he
finished the song and approached the window.
“Hanna, Hanna, are you asleep, or won''t you
come to me? Perhaps you are afraid someone
will see us, or will not expose your delicate face
to the cold! Fear nothing! The evening is
warm, and there is no one near. And if anyone
comes I will wrap you in my caftan, fold you in
my arms, and no one will see us. And if the wind
blows cold, I will press you close to my heart,
warm you with my kisses, and lay my cap on your
tiny feet, my darling. Only throw me a single
glance. No, you are not asleep, you proud
thing!” he exclaimed now louder, in a voice
which betrayed his annoyance at the humiliation.
“You are laughing at me! Good-bye!”

Then he turned away, set his cap jauntily, and,
still lightly touching his guitar, stepped back
from the window. Just then the wooden handle
of the door turned with a grating noise, and a girl
who counted hardly seventeen springs looked
out timidly through the darkness, and still keeping
hold of the handle, stepped over the threshold.
In the twilight her bright eyes shone like
little stars, her coral necklace gleamed, and the
pink flush on her cheeks did not escape the
Cossack''s observation.

“How impatient you are!” she said in a
whisper. “You get angry so quickly! Why
 
did you choose such a time? There are crowds
of people in the street…. I tremble all over.”

“Don''t tremble, my darling! Come close
to me!” said the Cossack, putting down his
guitar, which hung on a long strap round his
neck, and sitting down with her on the door-step.
“You know I find it hard to be only an
hour without seeing you.”

“Do you know what I am thinking of?”
interrupted the young girl, looking at him
thoughtfully. “Something whispers to me that
we shall not see so much of each other in the
future. The people here are not well disposed
to you, the girls look so envious, and the young
fellows…. I notice also that my mother
watches me carefully for some time past. I
must confess I was happier when among
strangers.” Her face wore a troubled expression
as she spoke.

“You are only two months back at home,
and are already tired of it!” said the Cossack.
“And of me too perhaps?”

“Oh no!” she replied, smiling. “I love
you, you black-eyed Cossack! I love you because
of your dark eyes, and my heart laughs
in my breast when you look at me. I feel so
happy when you come down the street stroking
your black moustache, and enjoy listening to
your song when you play the guitar!”

“About what?” he answered absent-mindedly.
“About my marrying you? Yes,
I did.” But he seemed to speak almost
reluctantly.

“What can you make of him? The old
curmudgeon pretends to be deaf; he will not
listen to anything, and blames me for loafing with
fellows, as he says, about the streets. But don''t
worry, Hanna! I give you my word as a
Cossack, I will break his obstinacy.”

“You only need to say a word, Levko, and it
shall be as you wish. I know that of myself.
Often I do not wish to obey you, but you speak
only a word, and I involuntarily do what you
wish. Look, look!” she continued, laying her
head on his shoulder and raising her eyes to the
sky, the immeasurable heaven of the Ukraine;
“there far away are twinkling little stars—one,
two, three, four, five. Is it not true that those
are angels opening the windows of their bright
little homes and looking down on us. Is it not
so, Levko? They are looking down on earth. If
men had wings like birds, how high they could
fly. But ah! not even our oaks reach the sky.
Still people say there is in some distant land a
 
tree whose top reaches to heaven, and that God
descends by it on the earth, the night before
Easter.”

“No, Hanna. God has a long ladder which
reaches from heaven to earth. Before Easter
Sunday holy angels set it up, and as soon as God
puts His foot on the first rung, all evil spirits
take to flight and fall in swarms into hell. That
is why on Easter Day there are none of them on
earth.”

“How gently the water ripples! Like a child
in the cradle,” continued Hanna, pointing to the
pool begirt by dark maples and weeping-willows,
whose melancholy branches drooped in the
water. On a hill near the wood slumbered an
old house with closed shutters. The roof was
covered with moss and weeds; leafy apple-trees
had grown high up before the windows; the wood
cast deep shadows on it; a grove of nut-trees
spread from the foot of the hill as far as the pool.

“I remember as if in a dream,” said Hanna,
keeping her eyes fixed on the house, “a long,
long time ago, when I was little and lived with
mother, someone told a terrible story about this
house. You must know it—tell me.”

“God forbid, my dear child! Old women
and stupid people talk a lot of nonsense. It
would only frighten you and spoil your sleep.”

“Tell me, my darling, my black-eyed
Cossack,” she said, pressing her cheek to his.
 
“No, you don''t love me; you have certainly
another sweetheart! I will not be frightened,
and will sleep quite quietly. If you refuse to tell
me, that would keep me awake. I would keep
on worrying and thinking about it. Tell me,
Levko!”

“Certainly it is true what people say, that the
devil possesses girls, and stirs up their curiosity.
Well then, listen. Long ago there lived in
that house an elderly man who had a beautiful
daughter white as snow, just like you. His wife
had been dead a long time, and he was thinking
of marrying again.

“‘Yes, my daughter,’ he answered, ‘I shall
love you more than ever, and give you yet more
rings and necklaces.’

“So he brought a young wife home, who was
beautiful and white and red, but she cast such
an evil glance at her stepdaughter that she cried
aloud, but not a word did her sulky stepmother
speak to her all day long.

“When night came, and her father and his
wife had retired, the young girl locked herself up
in her room, and feeling melancholy began to
weep bitterly. Suddenly she spied a hideous
black cat creeping towards her; its fur was aflame
and its claws struck on the ground like iron. In
her terror the girl sprang on a chair; the cat
 
followed her. Then she sprang into bed; the
cat sprang after her, and seizing her by
the throat began to choke her. She tore the
creature away, and flung it on the ground, but
the terrible cat began to creep towards her again.
Rendered desperate with terror, she seized her
father''s sabre which hung on the wall, and struck
at the cat, wounding one of its paws. The
animal disappeared, whimpering.

“The next day the young wife did not leave
her bedroom; the third day she appeared with
her hand bound up.

“On the fourth day her father told her to
bring water, to sweep the floor like a servant-maid,
and not to show herself where he and his
wife sat. She obeyed him, though with a heavy
heart. On the fifth day he drove her barefooted
out of the house, without giving her any food
for her journey. Then she began to sob and
covered her face with her hands.

“‘You have ruined your own daughter,
father!’ she cried; ‘and the witch has ruined
your soul. May God forgive you! He will not
allow me to live much longer.’

“And do you see,” continued Levko, turning
to Hanna and pointing to the house, “do you
see that high bank; from that bank she threw
 
herself into the water, and has been no more
seen on earth.”

“The witch? Old women say that when the
moon shines, all those who have been drowned
come out to warm themselves in its rays, and
that they are led by the witch''s stepdaughter.
One night she saw her stepmother by the pool,
caught hold of her, and dragged her screaming
into the water. But this time also the witch
played her a trick; she changed herself into one
of those who had been drowned, and so escaped
the chastisement she would have received at
their hands.

“Let anyone who likes believe the old
women''s stories. They say that the witch''s
stepdaughter gathers together those who have
been drowned every night, and looks in their
faces in order to find out which of them is the
witch; but has not done so yet. Such are the
old wives'' tales. It is said to be the intention
of the present owner to erect a distillery on the
spot. But I hear voices. They are coming
home from the dancing. Good-bye, Hanna!
Sleep well, and don''t think of all that nonsense.”
So saying he embraced her, kissed her, and
departed.

The brilliant moon was now rising and filling
all the earth with splendour. The pool shone
like silver, and the shadows of the trees stood
out in strong relief.

“Why, there is a whole band of them!” cried
Hanna, tearing herself from the youths who had
gathered round. “Are they never tired of the
eternal kissing? I shall soon not be able to show
myself on the street!” So saying, she closed
the door and bolted it.

Do you know a Ukraine night? No, you do not
know a night in the Ukraine. Gaze your full
on it. The moon shines in the midst of the sky;
the immeasurable vault of heaven seems to have
 
expanded to infinity; the earth is bathed in silver
light; the air is warm, voluptuous, and redolent
of innumerable sweet scents. Divine night!
Magical night! Motionless, but inspired with
divine breath, the forests stand, casting enormous
shadows and wrapped in complete darkness.
Calmly and placidly sleep the lakes surrounded
by dark green thickets. The virginal groves of
the hawthorns and cherry-trees stretch their
roots timidly into the cool water; only now and
then their leaves rustle unwillingly when that
freebooter, the night-wind, steals up to kiss them.
The whole landscape is hushed in slumber;
but there is a mysterious breath upon the
heights. One falls into a weird and unearthly
mood, and silvery apparitions rise from the
depths. Divine night! Magical night! Suddenly
the woods, lakes, and steppes become
alive. The nightingales of the Ukraine are singing,
and it seems as though the moon itself were
listening to their song. The village sleeps as
though under a magic spell; the cottages shine
in the moonlight against the darkness of the
woods behind them. The songs grow silent,
and all is still. Only here and there is a glimmer
of light in some small window. Some families,
sitting up late, are finishing their supper at the
thresholds of their houses.

“No, the ‘gallop’ is not danced like that!
Now I see, it does not go properly! What did
 
my godfather tell me? So then! Hop! tralala!
Hop! tralala! Hop! Hop! Hop!” Thus
a half-intoxicated, middle-aged Cossack talked
to himself as he danced through the street.
“By heaven, a ‘gallop’ is not danced like that!
What is the use of lying! On with it then!
Hop! tralala! Hop! tralala! Hop! Hop!
Hop!”

“See that fool there! If he were only a
young fellow! But to see a grown man dancing,
and the children laughing at him,” exclaimed an
old woman who was passing by, carrying a
bundle of straw. “Go home! It is quite time
to go to sleep!”

“I am going!” said the Cossack, standing
still. “I am going. What do I care about the
headman? He thinks because he is the eldest,
and throws cold water on people, and carries his
head high. As to being headman—I myself am
a headman. Yes indeed—otherwise——” As
he spoke, he stepped up to the door of the first
cottage he came to, stood at the window, drumming
with his fingers on the glass, and feeling
for the door-handle. “Woman, open! Woman,
open quickly I tell you! It is time for me to go
to sleep!”

“Where are you going, Kalenik? That is
the wrong house!” some young girls who were
returning from the dance called to him as they
passed. “Shall we show you yours?”

“Ladies! Just listen to him!” one of them
exclaimed. “How polite Kalenik is! We will
show you the house—but no, first dance before
us!”

“Dance before you? Oh, you are clever
girls!” said Kalenik in a drawling voice, and
laughing. He threatened them with his finger,
and stumbled, not being able to stand steadily.
“And will you let yourselves be kissed? I will
kiss the lot.” With tottering steps he began to
run after them.

The girls cried out and ran apart; but they
soon plucked up courage and went on the other
side of the road, when they saw that Kalenik
was not firm on his legs.

“There is your house!” they called to him,
pointing to one which was larger than the rest,
and which belonged to the village headman.

But who is this headman to whose disadvantage
so much has been said? Oh, he is a very
important person in the village. Before Kalenik
reaches his house, we shall doubtless find enough
time to say something about him. Everyone in
the village takes off his cap at the sight of him,
and even the smallest girls wish him good
morning. Which of the young Cossacks would
not like to be a headman? The headman has
 
an entry everywhere, and every stalwart rustic
stands respectfully, cap in hand, so long as the
headman feels round his snuff-box with his thick,
coarse finger. In parish-meetings and other
assemblies, although his power may be limited
by the votes of the majority, the headman still
maintains the upper hand, and sends whom
he chooses to make roads or dig ditches. In
outward manners he is morose and severe, and
not fond of talking. Long ago, when the
Empress Catherine of blessed memory journeyed
to the Crimea, he was chosen as one of her
escort for two whole days, and had the high
honour of sitting with the imperial coachman on
the box.

Since then the headman has formed the habit
of shaking his head solemnly and thoughtfully,
of stroking his long, drooping moustache, and of
darting hawk-like glances from his eyes. Whatever
the topic of conversation may be, he
manages to refer to his having accompanied the
Empress, and sat on the box of the imperial
coach. He often pretends to be hard of hearing,
especially when he hears something that he does
not like. He has an aversion for dandies, and
himself wears under a black caftan of cloth, made
at home, a simple, embroidered, woollen waist-band.
No one has seen him wear any other
dress except, of course, on the occasion of the
Czarina''s journey to the Crimea, when he wore a
 
blue Cossack''s uniform. Hardly anyone in the
village remembers that time, and he keeps the
uniform packed up in a chest.

The headman is a widower, but his sister-in-law
lives with him. She cooks his dinner and
supper, keeps the house and furniture clean,
weaves linen, and acts as housekeeper generally.
The village gossips say that she is not a relation
of his; but we must remark that the headman has
many enemies who spread all kinds of slanders
about him. We have now said what we considered
to be necessary about the headman, and
the drunken Kalenik is not yet half-way to his
house. He continued to abuse the headman in
terms which might be expected from one in his
condition.

“No, you fellows, I won''t. What is the
good of all those silly goings-on? Aren''t you
tired of these foolish jokes? People already call
us good-for-nothing scapegraces. Better go to
bed!” So Levko said one evening to his companions,
who were trying to persuade him to
take part with them in further practical jokes.
“Farewell, brothers! Good night!” he said,
and left them with quick steps.

“Does my bright-eyed Hanna sleep?” he
 
thought as he passed the house shaded by the
cherry-trees. Then in the silence he heard
the sound of a whispered conversation. Levko
stood still. Between the trees there glimmered
something white. “What is that?” he thought,
as he crept closer and hid himself behind a tree.

By the light of the moon he saw the face of a
girl standing opposite him. It was Hanna. But
who was the tall man who had his back turned to
him? In vain he strained his eyes; the whole
figure was hidden in shadow, and the slightest
forward step on Levko''s part would expose him
to the risk of discovery. He therefore leant
quietly against the tree, and determined to
remain where he was. Then he heard the girl
utter his name distinctly.

“Levko? Levko is a baby,” said the tall man
in an undertone. “If I ever find him with you,
I will pull his hair.”

“I should like to know what rascal is boasting
of pulling my hair,” said Levko to himself,
stretching out his head and endeavouring to miss
no word. But the stranger continued to speak
so low that he was inaudible.

“What, aren''t you ashamed?” said Hanna
after he had finished. “You are lying and
deceiving me; I will never believe that you love
me.”

“I know,” continued the tall man, “that
Levko has talked nonsense to you and turned
 
your head.” (Here it seemed to the Cossack
as though the stranger''s voice were not quite
unknown to him, and that he must have heard it
somewhere or other.) “But Levko shall learn to
know me,” continued the stranger. “He thinks
I don''t notice his rascally tricks; but he will yet
feel the weight of my fists, the scoundrel!”

At these words Levko could no longer restrain
his wrath. He came three steps nearer, and
took a run in order to plant a blow which would
have stretched the stranger on the ground in
spite of his strength. At that moment, however,
a ray of light fell on the latter''s face, and Levko
stood transfixed, for he saw it was his father.
But he only expressed his surprise by an involuntary
shake of the head and a low whistle.

On the other side there was the sound of
approaching footsteps. Hanna ran hastily into
the house and closed the door behind her.

“Good-bye, Hanna!” cried one of the youths,
who had stolen up and embraced the headman,
but started back alarmed when he felt a rough
moustache.

“Good-bye, my darling!” cried another, but
speedily executed a somersault in consequence
of a violent blow from the headman.

“Go to the deuce, you infernal scoundrels!”
shouted the headman, defending himself with
 
both hands and feet. “What kind of Hanna do
you take me for? Hang yourselves like your
fathers did, you children of the devil! Falling
on one like flies on honey! I will show you who
Hanna is!”

“Aha, father!” said Levko to himself,
recovering from his astonishment and looking
after the headman as he departed, cursing and
scolding. “Those are the tricks you like to
play! Splendid! And I wonder and puzzle my
head why he pretends to be deaf when I only
touch on the matter! Wait, you old sinner, I
will teach you to cajole other people''s sweethearts.
Hi! you fellows, come here!” he cried,
beckoning to the youths, who gathered round
him. “Come nearer! I told you to go to bed,
but I am differently minded now, and am ready
to go round with you all night.”

“That is reasonable,” exclaimed a broad-shouldered,
stout fellow, who was regarded as
the chief toper and good-for-nothing in the
village. “I always feel uncomfortable if I do
not have a good fling, and play some practical
jokes. I always feel as though there were something
wanting, as though I had lost my cap or my
pipe—in a word, I don''t feel like a proper
Cossack then!”

“Yes, the headman. I don''t know for whom
he takes himself. He carries on as though he
were a duke. It is not only that he treats us as
if we were his serfs, but he comes after our
girls.”

“But are we made of any worse stuff than he?
We are, thank God! free Cossacks. Let us show
him so.”

“Yes, we will show him!” they shouted.
“But when we go for the headman, we must not
forget his clerk.”

“The clerk shall have his share, too. Just
now a song that suits the headman occurs to me.
Go on! I will teach it you!” continued Levko,
striking the strings of his guitar. “But listen!
Disguise yourselves as well as you can.”

“Hurrah for the Cossacks!” cried the stout
reveller, dancing and clapping his hands.
“Long live freedom! When one lets the reins
go, one thinks of the good old times. It
feels as jolly as though one were in paradise.
Hurrah, you fellows! Go ahead!”

The youths rushed noisily through the village
street, and the pious old women, aroused from
their sleep, looked through the windows, crossed
 
themselves drowsily, and thought, “There they
go, the wild young fellows!”

Only in one house at the end of the street there
still burned a light; it was the headman''s. He
had long finished his supper, and would certainly
have gone to sleep but that he had a guest
with him, the brandy-distiller. The latter had
been sent to superintend the building of a distillery
for the lords of the manor, who possessed
small allotments between the lands of the free
Cossacks. At the upper end of the table, in the
place of honour, sat the guest—a short, stout
man with small, merry eyes. He smoked his
short pipe with obvious satisfaction, spitting
every moment and constantly pushing the
tobacco down in the bowl. The clouds of smoke
collected over his head, and veiled him in a bluish
mist. It seemed as though the broad chimney
of a distillery, which was bored at always being
perched up on the roof, had hit upon the idea of
taking a little recreation, and had now settled
itself comfortably at the headman''s table. Close
under his nose bristled his short, thick moustache,
which in the dim, smoky atmosphere
resembled a mouse which the distiller had caught
 
and held in his mouth, usurping the functions of
a dining-room cat. The headman sat there, as
master of the house, wearing only his shirt and
linen breeches. His eagle eye began to grow
dim like the setting sun, and to half close. At
the lower end of the table sat, smoking his pipe,
one of the village council, of which the headman
was superintendent. Out of respect for the
latter he had not removed his caftan.

“How soon do you think,” asked the headman,
turning to the distiller and putting his hand
before his gaping mouth, “will you have the
distillery put up?”

“With God''s help we shall be distilling brandy
this autumn. On Conception Day I bet the
headman will be tracing the figure eight with his
feet on his way home.” So saying, the distiller
laughed so heartily that his small eyes
disappeared altogether, his body was convulsed,
and his twitching lips actually let go of the
reeking pipe for a moment.

“God grant it!” said the headman, on whose
face the shadow of a smile was visible. “Now,
thank heaven, the number of distilleries is increasing
a little; but in the old days, when I
accompanied the Czarina on the Perejlaslov
Road, and the late Besborodko——”

“Yes, my friend, those were bad times.
Then from Krementchuk to Romen there were
hardly two distilleries. And now—but have you
 
heard what the infernal Germans have invented?
They say they will no longer use wood for fuel in
the distilleries, but devilish steam.” At these
words the distiller stared at the table reflectively,
and at his arms resting on it. “But how they
can use steam—by heavens! I don''t know.”

“What fools these Germans are!” said the
headman. “I should like to give these sons
of dogs a good thrashing. Whoever heard of
cooking with steam? At this rate one will not
be able to get a spoonful of porridge or a bit of
bacon into one''s mouth.”

“And you, friend,” broke in the headman''s
sister-in-law, who was sitting by the stove; “will
you be with us the whole time without your
wife?”

“How should she be; as old as Satan, and with
a face as full of wrinkles as an empty purse,”
said the distiller, shaking again with laughter.

Then a noise was heard at the door, which
opened and a Cossack stepped over the threshold
without removing his cap, and remained standing
in an absent-minded way in the middle of the
room, with open mouth and gazing at the ceiling.
It was Kalenik, whose acquaintance we have
already made.

“Now I am at home,” he said, taking his
seat by the door, without taking any notice of
those present. “Ah! to what a length Satan
made the road stretch. I went on and on, and
there was no end. My legs are quite broken.
Woman, bring me my fur blanket to lie down on.
There it is in the corner; but mind you don''t
upset the little pot of snuff. But no; better not
touch it! Leave it alone! You are really quite
drunk—I had better get it myself.”

“That''s a nice business!” said the headman.
“He comes into a strange house, and behaves
as though he were at home! Push him out, in
heaven''s name!”

“Let him rest a bit, friend!” said the
distiller, seizing the headman''s arm. “The
man is very useful; if we had only plenty of this
kind, our distillery would get on grandly….”
For the rest, it was not good-nature which
inspired these words. The distiller was full of
superstition, and to turn out a man who had
already sat down, seemed to him to be tantamount
to invoking the devil.

“That comes of being old,” grumbled
Kalenik, stretching himself out along the seat.
“People might say I was drunk, but no, I am
not! Why should I lie? I am ready to tell the
headman to his face! Who is the headman
 
anyway? May he break his neck, the son of a
dog! I spit at him! May he be run over by a
cart, the one-eyed devil!”

“Ah! the drunken sot has crawled into the
house, and now he lays his paws on the table,”
said the headman, rising angrily; but at that
moment a heavy stone, breaking a window-pane
to pieces, fell at his feet. The headman remained
standing. “If I knew,” he said, “what
jail-bird has thrown it, I would give him something.
What devil''s trick is this?” he continued,
looking at the stone, which he held in his
hand, with burning eyes. “I wish I could
choke him with it!”

“Stop! Stop! God preserve you, friend!”
broke in the distiller, looking pale. “God keep
you in this world and the next, but don''t curse
anyone so.”

“Yes, my mother-in-law. One evening,
perhaps rather earlier than this, they were sitting
at supper, my late mother-in-law, my father-in-law,
their two servants, and five children. My
mother-in-law emptied some dumplings from the
cooking-pot into a dish in order to cool them.
But the others, being hungry after the day''s
 
work, did not wait till they were quite cooled, but
stuck their long wooden forks into them and ate
them at once. All at once a stranger entered—heaven
knows whence!—and asked to be allowed
to share their meal. They could not refuse to
feed a hungry man, and gave him also a wooden
fork. But the guest made as short work with
the dumplings as a cow with hay. Before the
family had each of them finished his or her
dumpling and reached out their forks again for
another, the dish had been swept as clean as
the floor of a nobleman''s drawing-room. My
mother-in-law emptied out some more dumplings;
she thought to herself, ‘Now the guest is
satisfied, and will not be so greedy.’ But on the
contrary, he began to swallow them faster than
ever, and emptied the second dish also. ‘May
one of them choke you!’ said my mother-in-law
under her breath. Suddenly the guest seemed
to try to clear his throat, and fell back. They
rushed to his help, but his breath had stopped
and he was dead.”

“But it turned out quite otherwise; since that
time my mother-in-law has no rest. No sooner
is it dark than the dead man approaches the
house. He then sits astride the chimney, the
scoundrel, holding a dumpling between his teeth.
During the day it is quite quiet—one hears and
sees nothing; but as soon as it begins to grow
 
dark, and one casts a look at the roof, there he
is comfortably perched on the chimney!”

Then the headman suddenly stopped. Outside
there were noises, and the stamping of
dancers'' feet. The strings of a guitar were
being struck gently, to the accompaniment of
a voice. Then the guitar was played more
loudly, many voices joined in, and the whole
chorus struck up a song in ridicule of the
headman.

When it was over, the distiller said, with his
head bent a little on one side, to the headman
who was almost petrified by the audacity of the
serenaders, “A fine song, my friend!”

He folded his arms with a certain measure of
composure on the table, and prepared to listen
further, for the singing and noise outside continued.
A sharp observer, however, would have
seen that it was not mere torpidity which made
the headman sit so quietly. In the same way a
crafty cat often allows an inexperienced mouse
to play about her tail, while she is quickly devising
a plan to cut it off from the mouse-hole.
The headman''s one eye was still fastened on
the window, and his hand, after he had given
the village councillor a sign, was reaching for
 
the door-handle, when suddenly a loud noise
and shouts were heard from the street. The
distiller, who beside many other characteristics
possessed a keen curiosity, laid down his pipe
quickly and ran into the street; but the ne''er-do-wells
had all dispersed.

“No, you don''t escape me!” cried the
headman, dragging someone muffled up in a
sheepskin coat with the hair turned outwards, by
the arm.

The distiller rapidly seized a favourable
moment to look at the face of this disturber of
the peace; but he started back when he saw a
long beard and a grim, painted face.

“No, you don''t escape me!” exclaimed the
headman again as he dragged his prisoner into
the vestibule.

“Karpo, open the store-room!” the headman
called to the village councillor. “We will
throw him in there! Then we will awake the
clerk, call the village council together, catch this
impudent rabble, and pass our sentence on them
at once.”

The village councillor unlocked the store-room;
then in the darkness of the vestibule, the
prisoner made a desperate effort to break loose
from the headman''s arms.

“It is no good, brother! You may squeal if
you choose, like the devil, instead of imitating
a woman, but you won''t get round me.” So
saying, he thrust the prisoner with such violence
into the dark room that he fell on the ground and
groaned aloud.

The victorious headman, accompanied by the
village councillor, now betook himself to the
clerk''s; they were followed by the distiller, who
was veiled in clouds of tobacco-smoke, and
resembled a steamer.

They were all three walking reflectively with
bent heads, when suddenly, turning into a dark
side-alley, they uttered a cry and started back in
consequence of coming into collision with three
other men, who on their side shouted with equal
loudness. The headman saw with his one eye,
to his no small astonishment, the clerk with two
village councillors.

“The young fellows are roaming about the
streets using vile language. They are abusing
your honour in a way—in a word, it is a scandal.
A drunken Russian would be ashamed to use
such words.”

The lean notary, in his gaily striped breeches
and yeast-coloured waistcoat, kept on stretching
forward and drawing back his neck while he
talked.

“Hardly had I gone to sleep,” he continued,
“than the cursed loafers woke me up with their
shameful songs and their noise. I meant to give
them a sound rating, but while I was putting on
my breeches and vest, they all ran away. But
the ringleader has not escaped; for the present
he is shut up in the hut which we use as a prison.
I was very curious to know who the scapegrace
is, but his face is as sooty as the devil''s when
he forges nails for sinners.”

“Aren''t you telling me a lie, Mr Notary?
The same good-for-nothing is now shut up in my
store-room under lock and key.”

“No, your honour! You have drawn the
long bow a little yourself, and should not be
vexed at what I say.”

They returned to the headman''s house; the
store-room door was opened, and the headman
groaned for sheer amazement as he saw his sister-in-law
standing before him.

“Tell me then,” she said, stepping forward,
“have you quite lost your senses? Had you a
single particle of brains in your one-eyed fish-head
when you locked me up in the dark room?
It is a mercy I did not break my head against the
iron door hinge. Didn''t I shout out that it was
I? Then he seized me, the cursed bear, with
his iron claws, and pushed me in. May Satan
hereafter so push you into hell!” The last
words she spoke from the street, having wisely
gone out of his reach.

“Isn''t it high time to give all these loose
fellows a lesson, that they may at last betake
themselves to their work?”

“The fools have combined in a gang. What
the deuce is that? It sounded like my sister-in-law''s
voice. The blockheads think that I am
like her, an ordinary Cossack.”

Here he coughed and cleared his throat, and
 
a gleam in his eyes showed that he was about to
say something very important. “In the year
one thousand—I cannot keep these cursed dates
in my memory, if I was to be killed for it.
Well, never mind when it was, the Commissary
Ledatcho was commanded to choose out a
Cossack who was cleverer than the rest. Yes,”
he added, raising his forefinger, “cleverer than
the rest, to accompany the Czar. Then I
was——”

“Yes, yes,” the notary interrupted him, “we
all know, headman, that you well deserved the
imperial favour. But confess now that I was
right: you made a mistake when you declared
that you had caught the vagabond in the reversed
sheepskin.”

“This disguised devil I will have imprisoned
to serve as a warning to the rest. They will have
to learn what authority means. Who has appointed
the headman, if not the Czar? Then we
will tackle the other fellows. I don''t forget how
the scamps drove a whole herd of swine into my
garden, which ate up all the cabbages and
cucumbers; I don''t forget how those sons of
devils refused to thrash my rye for me. I don''t
forget—to the deuce with them! We must first
find out who this scoundrel in the sheepskin
really is.”

“He is a sly dog anyway,” said the distiller,
whose cheeks during the whole conversation had
 
been as full of smoke as a siege-cannon, and
whose lips, when he took his pipe out of his
mouth, seemed to emit sparks.

Meanwhile they had approached a small ruined
hut. Their curiosity had mounted to the highest
pitch, and they pressed round the door. The
notary produced a key and tried to turn the lock,
but it did not fit; it was the key of his trunk.
The impatience of the onlookers increased. He
plunged his hand into the wide pocket of his gaily
striped breeches, bent his back, scraped with his
feet, uttered imprecations, and at last cried
triumphantly, “I have it!”

At these words the hearts of our heroes beat
so loud, that the turning of the key in the lock
was almost inaudible. At last the door opened,
and the headman turned as white as a sheet.
The distiller felt a shiver run down his spine, and
his hair stood on end. Terror and apprehension
were stamped on the notary''s face; the village
councillors almost sank into the ground and could
not shut their wide-open mouths. Before them
stood the headman''s sister-in-law!

She was not less startled than they, but
recovered herself somewhat, and made a movement
as if to approach them.

“Stop!” cried the headman in an excited
voice, and slammed the door again. “Sirs,
Satan is behind this!” he continued. “Bring
fire quickly! Never mind the hut! Set it
 
alight and burn it up so that not even the witch''s
bones remain.”

“Wait a minute, brother!” exclaimed the
distiller. “Your hair is grey, but you are not
very intelligent; no ordinary fire will burn a
witch. Only the fire of a pipe can do it. I will
manage it all right.” So saying, he shook some
glowing ashes from his pipe on to a bundle of
straw, and began to fan the flame.

“Stop a moment, brother! Perhaps we are
incurring guilt needlessly. Perhaps she is really
no witch!” said the notary. “If the person
sitting in there declares herself ready to make
the sign of the cross, then she is not a child of
the devil.”

The proposal was accepted. “Look out,
Satan!” continued the notary, speaking at a
chink in the door. “If you promise not to
move, we will open the door.”

“Cross yourself!” exclaimed the headman,
looking round him for a safe place of retreat in
case of necessity.

The headman''s sister related amid sobs how
the rioters had seized her on the street, and in
spite of her resistance, pushed her through a
large window into the hut, on which they had
closed the shutters. The notary looked and
found that the bolt of the shutter had been
wrenched off, and that it was held in its place by
a wooden bar placed across it outside.

“You are a nice fellow, you one-eyed
Satan!” she now exclaimed, advancing towards
the headman, who stepped backwards and continued
to contemplate her from head to foot.
“I know your thoughts; you were glad of an
opportunity to get me shut up in order to run
after that petticoat, so that no one could see the
grey-haired sinner making a fool of himself.
You think I don''t know how you talked this
evening with Hanna. Oh, I know everything.
You must get up earlier if you want to make a
fool of me, you great stupid! I have endured
for a long time, but at last don''t take it ill
if——”

She made a threatening gesture with her fist,
and ran away swiftly, leaving the headman quite
taken aback.

“Bring him here!” cried the headman,
seizing the prisoner by the arm. “Are you
mad? This is the drunken Kalenik!”

“It is witchcraft! He was in our hands,
your honour!” replied the village councillors.
“The rascals were rushing about in the narrow
side-streets, dancing and behaving like idiots—the
devil take them! How it was we got hold of
this fellow instead of him, heaven only knows!”

“In virtue of my authority, and that of the
village assembly,” said the headman, “I issue
the order to seize these robbers and other young
vagabonds which may be met with in the streets,
and to bring them before me to be dealt with.”

“Excuse us, your honour,” answered the
village councillors, bowing low. “If you could
only see the hideous faces they had; may heaven
punish us if ever anyone has seen such miscreations
since he was born and baptised. These
devils might frighten one into an illness.”

“I''ll teach you to be afraid! You won''t
obey then? You are certainly in the conspiracy
with them! You mutineers! What is the
meaning of that? What? You abet robbery
and murder! You!—I will inform the Commissary.
Go at once, do you hear; fly like birds.
I shall—you will——”

Without troubling himself in the least about
those who had been sent to pursue him, the
originator of all this confusion slowly walked
towards the old house and the pool. We hardly
need to say it was Levko. His black fur coat
was buttoned up; he carried his cap in his hand,
and the perspiration was pouring down his face.
The moon poured her light on the gloomy majesty
of the dark maple-wood.

The coolness of the air round the motionless
pool enticed the weary wanderer to rest by it a
while. Universal silence prevailed, only that in
the forest thickets the nightingales'' songs were
heard. An overpowering drowsiness closed his
eyes; his tired limbs relaxed, and his head
nodded.

He looked round; the night seemed to him still
more beautiful. The moonlight seemed to have
an intoxicating quality about it, a glamour which
he had never perceived before. The landscape
was veiled in a silver mist. The air was redolent
with the perfume of the apple-blossoms and
 
the night-flowers. Entranced, he gazed on the
motionless pool. The old, half-ruined house
was clearly reflected without a quiver in the
water. But instead of dark shutters, he saw
light streaming from brilliantly lit windows.
Presently one of them opened. Holding his
breath, and without moving a muscle, he fastened
his eyes on the pool and seemed to penetrate
its depths. What did he see? First he saw
at the window a graceful, curly head with shining
eyes, propped on a white arm; the head moved
and smiled. His heart suddenly began to beat.
The water began to break into ripples, and the
window closed.

Quietly he withdrew from the pool, and looked
towards the house. The dark shutters were
flung back; the window-panes gleamed in the
moonlight. “How little one can believe what
people say!” he thought to himself. “The
house is brand-new, and looks as though it
had only just been painted. It is certainly
inhabited.”

He stepped nearer cautiously, but the house
was quite silent. The clear song of the nightingales
rose powerfully and distinctly on the air,
and as they died away one heard the chirping
and rustling of the grasshoppers, and the
marshbird clapping his slippery beak in the
water.

Levko felt enraptured with the sweetness and
 
stillness of the night. He struck the strings of
his guitar and sang:

A window opened gently, and the same girl
whose image he had seen in the pool looked out
and listened attentively to the song. Her long-lashed
eyelids were partly drooping over her
eyes; she was as pale as the moonlight, but
wonderfully beautiful. She smiled, and a shiver
ran through Levko.

“Sing me a song, young Cossack!” she said
gently, bending her head sideways and quite
closing her eyes.

Tears rolled down her pale cheeks.
“Cossack,” she said, and there was something
inexpressibly touching in her tone, “Cossack,
find my stepmother for me. I will do everything
for you; I will reward you; I will give you
abundant riches. I have armlets embroidered
with silk and coral necklaces; I will give you a
girdle set with pearls. I have gold. Cossack,
seek my stepmother for me. She is a terrible
witch; she allowed me no peace in the beautiful
world. She tortured me; she made me work like
a common maid-servant. Look at my face; she
 
has banished the redness from my cheeks with
her unholy magic. Look at my white neck; they
cannot be washed away, they cannot be washed
away—the blue marks of her iron claws. Look
at my white feet; they did not walk on carpets,
but on hot sand, on damp ground, on piercing
thorns. And my eyes—look at them; they are
almost blind with weeping. Seek my stepmother!”

The Cossack felt overpowered by sympathy and
grief. “I am ready to do everything to please
you, dear lady,” he cried with deep emotion;
“but where and how can I find her?”

“Look, look!” she said quickly, “she is
here! She dances on the lake-shore with my
maidens, and warms herself in the moonlight.
Yet she is cunning and sly. She has assumed the
shape of one who is drowned, yet I know and
hear that she is present. I am so afraid of her.
Because of her I cannot swim free and light as a
fish. I sink and fall to the bottom like a piece
of iron. Look for her, Cossack!”

Levko cast a glance at the lake-shore. In a
silvery mist there moved, like shadows, girls in
white dresses decked with May flowers; gold
necklaces and coins gleamed on their necks; but
they were very pale, as though formed of transparent
clouds. They danced nearer him, and he
 
could hear their voices, somewhat like the sound
of reeds stirred in the quiet evening by the
breeze.

Levko observed her attentively. Her face and
clothing resembled those of the others; but she
was evidently unwilling to play the part assigned
her. The dancers revolved rapidly round her,
without her being able to catch one of
them.

“No, I won''t be the raven any more,” she
said, quite exhausted. “I do not like to rob the
poor mother-hen of her chickens.”

Levko watched her closely. Boldly and
rapidly she ran after the dancers, and made every
effort to catch her prey. Levko began to notice
that her body was not transparent like the
others; there was something black in the midst
of it. Suddenly there was a cry; the “raven”
had rushed on a girl, embraced her, and it
seemed to Levko as though she had stretched out
 
claws, and as though her face shone with
malicious joy.

“How shall I reward you, Cossack?” said
the maiden. “I know you do not need gold;
you love Hanna, but her harsh father will not
allow you to marry. But give him this note, and
he will cease to hinder it.”

She stretched out her white hand, and her face
shone wonderfully. With strange shudders and
a beating heart, he grasped the paper and—awoke.

“Have I then been really asleep?” Levko
asked himself as he stood up. “Everything
seemed so real, as though I were awake. Wonderful!
Wonderful!” he repeated, looking
round him. The position of the moon vertical
overhead showed that it was midnight; a waft of
coolness came from the pool. The ruined house
 
with the closed shutters stood there with a
melancholy aspect; the moss and weeds which
grew thickly upon it showed that it had not been
entered by any human foot for a long time.
Then he suddenly opened his hand, which had
been convulsively clenched during his sleep, and
cried aloud with astonishment when he saw the
note in it. “Ah! if I could only read,” he
thought, turning it this way and that. At that
moment he heard a noise behind him.

“Fear nothing! Lay hold of him! What
are you afraid of? There are ten of us. I
wager that he is a man, and not the devil.”

“Throw off your mask, friend! Cease trying
to fool us,” said the headman, taking him by
the collar. But he started back when he saw
him closely. “Levko! My son!” he exclaimed,
letting his arms sink. “It is you,
miserable boy! I thought some rascal, or disguised
devil, was playing these tricks; but now
it seems you have cooked this mess for your own
father—placed yourself at the head of a band
of robbers, and composed songs to ridicule
him. Eh, Levko! What is the meaning of
that? It seems your back is itching. Tie him
fast!”

“Stop! Stop! That is unnecessary!” exclaimed
the headman. “Even if I have not
heard it, I know that that is not the chief matter.
Read further!”

“‘Consequently I order you at once to marry
 your son, Levko Makohonenko, to the Cossack''s
daughter, Hanna Petritchenka, to repair the
bridges on the post-road, and to give no horses
belonging to the lords of the manor to the
county-court magistrates without my knowledge.
If on my arrival I do not find these orders carried
out, I shall hold you singly responsible.

“There we have it!” exclaimed the headman,
with his mouth open. “Have you heard
it? The headman is made responsible for everything,
and therefore everyone has to obey him
without contradiction! Otherwise, I beg to resign
my office. And you,” he continued, turning to
Levko, “I will have married, as the Commissary
directs, though it seems to me strange how he
knows of the affair; but you will get a taste of my
knout first—the one, you know, which hangs on
the wall at my bed-head. But how did you get
hold of the note?”

Levko, in spite of the astonishment which the
unexpected turn of affairs caused him, had had
the foresight to prepare an answer, and to conceal
the way in which the note had come into
his possession. “I was in the town last night,”
he said, “and met the Commissary just as
he was alighting from his droshky. When he
heard from which village I was he gave me the
 
note and bid me tell you by word of mouth,
father, that he would dine with us on his way
back.”

“Have you heard it?” said the headman,
with a solemn air turning to his companions.
“The Commissary himself, in his own person,
comes to us, that is to me, to dine.” The
headman lifted a finger and bent his head as
though he were listening to something. “The
Commissary, do you hear, the Commissary is
coming to dine with me! What do you think,
Mr Notary? And what do you think, friend?
That is not a little honour, is it?”

“All headmen are not alike,” he answered
with a self-satisfied air. Then he uttered a
hoarse laugh and said, “What do you think,
Mr Notary? Isn''t it right to order that in
honour of the distinguished guest, a fowl, linen,
and other things should be offered by every
cottage?”

“Wedding! I should like to celebrate your
wedding in my way! Well, in honour of the
 
distinguished guest, to-morrow the pope(1) will
marry you. Let the Commissary see that you
are punctual. Now, children, we will go to bed.
Go to your houses. The present occasion
reminds me of the time when I——” At these
words the headman assumed his customary
solemn air.

“Now the headman will relate how he accompanied
the Czarina!” said Levko to himself, and
hastened quickly, and full of joy, to the cherry-tree-shaded
house, which we know. “May God
bless you, beloved, and the holy angels smile
on you. To no one will I relate the wonders of
this night except to you, Hanna; you alone will
believe it, and pray with me for the repose of the
souls of the poor drowned maidens.”

He approached the house; the window was
open; the moonbeams fell on Hanna, who was
sleeping by it. Her head was supported on her
arm; her cheeks glowed; her lips moved, gently
murmuring his name.

“Sleep sweetly, my darling. Dream of
everything that is good, and yet the awaking will
surpass all.” He made the sign of the cross
over her, closed the window, and gently withdrew.

In a few moments the whole village was buried
in slumber. Only the moon hung as brilliant
and wonderful as before in the immensity of
 
the Ukraine sky. The divine night continued
her reign in solemn stillness, while the earth
lay bathed in silvery radiance. The universal
silence was only broken here and there by the
bark of a dog; only the drunken Kalenik still
wandered about the empty streets seeking for his
house.

(The “Viy” is a monstrous creation of popular
fancy. It is the name which the inhabitants of
Little Russia give to the king of the gnomes, whose
eyelashes reach to the ground. The following story
is a specimen of such folk-lore. I have made no
alterations, but reproduce it in the same simple form
in which I heard it.—Author''s Note.)

As soon as the clear seminary bell began
sounding in Kieff in the morning, the pupils
would come flocking from all parts of the town.
The students of grammar, rhetoric, philosophy,
and theology hastened with their books under
their arms over the streets.

The “grammarians” were still mere boys.
On the way they pushed against each other and
quarrelled with shrill voices. Nearly all of them
wore torn or dirty clothes, and their pockets were
always crammed with all kinds of things—push-bones,
pipes made out of pens, remains of confectionery,
and sometimes even young sparrows.
The latter would sometimes begin to chirp in the
midst of deep silence in the school, and bring
 
down on their possessors severe canings and
thrashings.

The “rhetoricians” walked in a more orderly
way. Their clothes were generally untorn, but
on the other hand their faces were often
strangely decorated; one had a black eye, and
the lips of another resembled a single blister,
etc. These spoke to each other in tenor
voices.

The “philosophers” talked in a tone an
octave lower; in their pockets they only had
fragments of tobacco, never whole cakes of it;
for what they could get hold of, they used at
once. They smelt so strongly of tobacco and
brandy, that a workman passing by them would
often remain standing and sniffing with his nose
in the air, like a hound.

About this time of day the market-place was
generally full of bustle, and the market women,
selling rolls, cakes, and honey-tarts, plucked the
sleeves of those who wore coats of fine cloth or
cotton.

“Young sir! Young sir! Here! Here!”
they cried from all sides. “Rolls and cakes
and tasty tarts, very delicious! I have baked
them myself!”

Another drew something long and crooked
out of her basket and cried, “Here is a sausage,
young sir! Buy a sausage!”

“Don''t buy anything from her!” cried a
 
rival. “See how greasy she is, and what a
dirty nose and hands she has!”

But the market women carefully avoided
appealing to the philosophers and theologians,
for these only took handfuls of eatables merely
to taste them.

Arrived at the seminary, the whole crowd of
students dispersed into the low, large class-rooms
with small windows, broad doors, and
blackened benches. Suddenly they were filled
with a many-toned murmur. The teachers
heard the pupils'' lessons repeated, some in shrill
and others in deep voices which sounded like a
distant booming. While the lessons were being
said, the teachers kept a sharp eye open to see
whether pieces of cake or other dainties were
protruding from their pupils'' pockets; if so, they
were promptly confiscated.

When this learned crowd arrived somewhat
earlier than usual, or when it was known that the
teachers would come somewhat late, a battle
would ensue, as though planned by general
agreement. In this battle all had to take part,
even the monitors who were appointed to look
after the order and morality of the whole school.
Two theologians generally arranged the conditions
of the battle: whether each class should
split into two sides, or whether all the pupils
should divide themselves into two halves.

In each case the grammarians began the battle,
 
and after the rhetoricians had joined in, the
former retired and stood on the benches, in order
to watch the fortunes of the fray. Then came
the philosophers with long black moustaches, and
finally the thick-necked theologians. The battle
generally ended in a victory for the latter,
and the philosophers retired to the different
class-rooms rubbing their aching limbs, and
throwing themselves on the benches to take
breath.

When the teacher, who in his own time had
taken part in such contests, entered the class-room
he saw by the heated faces of his pupils that
the battle had been very severe, and while he
caned the hands of the rhetoricians, in another
room another teacher did the same for the
philosophers.

On Sundays and Festival Days the seminarists
took puppet-theatres to the citizens'' houses.
Sometimes they acted a comedy, and in that case
it was always a theologian who took the part of
the hero or heroine—Potiphar or Herodias, etc.
As a reward for their exertions, they received a
piece of linen, a sack of maize, half a roast
goose, or something similar. All the students,
lay and clerical, were very poorly provided with
means for procuring themselves necessary subsistence,
but at the same time very fond of
eating; so that, however much food was given
to them, they were never satisfied, and the
 
gifts bestowed by rich landowners were never
adequate for their needs.

Therefore the Commissariat Committee, consisting
of philosophers and theologians, sometimes
dispatched the grammarians and rhetoricians
under the leadership of a philosopher—themselves
sometimes joining in the expedition—with
sacks on their shoulders, into the town, in
order to levy a contribution on the fleshpots of
the citizens, and then there was a feast in the
seminary.

The most important event in the seminary year
was the arrival of the holidays; these began in
July, and then generally all the students went
home. At that time all the roads were thronged
with grammarians, rhetoricians, philosophers,
and theologians. He who had no home of his own,
would take up his quarters with some fellow-student''s
family; the philosophers and theologians
looked out for tutors'' posts, taught the
children of rich farmers, and received for doing
so a pair of new boots and sometimes also a new
coat.

A whole troop of them would go off in close
ranks like a regiment; they cooked their porridge
in common, and encamped under the open sky.
Each had a bag with him containing a shirt and
a pair of socks. The theologians were especially
economical; in order not to wear out their boots
too quickly, they took them off and carried them
 
on a stick over their shoulders, especially when
the road was very muddy. Then they tucked
up their breeches over their knees and waded
bravely through the pools and puddles. Whenever
they spied a village near the highway, they
at once left it, approached the house which
seemed the most considerable, and began with
loud voices to sing a psalm. The master of the
house, an old Cossack engaged in agriculture,
would listen for a long time with his head propped
in his hands, then with tears on his cheeks say
to his wife, “What the students are singing
sounds very devout; bring out some lard and
anything else of the kind we have in the house.”

After thus replenishing their stores, the
students would continue their way. The farther
they went, the smaller grew their numbers, as
they dispersed to their various houses, and left
those whose homes were still farther on.

On one occasion, during such a march, three
students left the main-road in order to get
provisions in some village, since their stock had
long been exhausted. This party consisted of
the theologian Khalava, the philosopher Thomas
Brutus, and the rhetorician Tiberius Gorobetz.

The first was a tall youth with broad shoulders
and of a peculiar character; everything which
came within reach of his fingers he felt obliged
to appropriate. Moreover, he was of a very
melancholy disposition, and when he had got
 
intoxicated he hid himself in the most tangled
thickets so that the seminary officials had the
greatest trouble in finding him.

The philosopher Thomas Brutus was a more
cheerful character. He liked to lie for a long
time on the same spot and smoke his pipe; and
when he was merry with wine, he hired a fiddler
and danced the “tropak.” Often he got a
whole quantity of “beans,” i.e. thrashings;
but these he endured with complete philosophic
calm, saying that a man cannot escape his
destiny.

The rhetorician Tiberius Gorobetz had not yet
the right to wear a moustache, to drink brandy,
or to smoke tobacco. He only wore a small crop
of hair, as though his character was at present
too little developed. To judge by the great
bumps on his forehead, with which he often
appeared in the class-room, it might be expected
that some day he would be a valiant fighter.
Khalava and Thomas often pulled his hair as a
mark of their special favour, and sent him on
their errands.

Evening had already come when they left the
high-road; the sun had just gone down, and the
air was still heavy with the heat of the day. The
theologian and the philosopher strolled along,
smoking in silence, while the rhetorician struck
off the heads of the thistles by the wayside with
his stick. The way wound on through thick
 
woods of oak and walnut; green hills alternated
here and there with meadows. Twice already
they had seen cornfields, from which they concluded
that they were near some village; but an
hour had already passed, and no human habitation
appeared. The sky was already quite dark,
and only a red gleam lingered on the western
horizon.

“The deuce!” said the philosopher Thomas
Brutus. “I was almost certain we would soon
reach a village.”

The theologian still remained silent, looked
round him, then put his pipe again between his
teeth, and all three continued their way.

“Perhaps we shall find a farm farther on,”
answered the theologian, without taking his pipe
out of his mouth.

Meanwhile the night had descended; clouds
increased the darkness, and according to all
appearance there was no chance of moon or stars
appearing. The seminarists found that they had
lost the way altogether.

The rhetorician went on one side, lay on the
ground, and groped for a path; but his hands
encountered only fox-holes. All around lay a
huge steppe over which no one seemed to have
passed. The wanderers made several efforts to
get forward, but the landscape grew wilder and
more inhospitable.

The philosopher tried to shout, but his voice
was lost in vacancy, no one answered; only, some
moments later, they heard a faint groaning
sound, like the whimpering of a wolf.

“Why, just stop here, and spend the night in
the open air,” answered the theologian. So
saying, he felt in his pocket, brought out his
timber and steel, and lit his pipe.

But the philosopher could not agree with this
proposal; he was not accustomed to sleep till he
had first eaten five pounds of bread and five of
dripping, and so he now felt an intolerable
emptiness in his stomach. Besides, in spite of
his cheerful temperament, he was a little afraid
of the wolves.

“No, Khalava,” he said, “that won''t do.
To lie down like a dog and without any supper!
Let us try once more; perhaps we shall find a
house, and the consolation of having a glass of
brandy to drink before going to sleep.”

At the word “brandy,” the theologian spat
 
on one side and said, “Yes, of course, we cannot
remain all night in the open air.”

The students went on and on, and to their great
joy they heard the barking of dogs in the distance.
After listening a while to see from which
direction the barking came, they went on their
way with new courage, and soon espied a light.

His supposition proved correct; they soon saw
two or three houses built round a court-yard.
Lights glimmered in the windows, and before
the fence stood a number of trees. The students
looked through the crevices of the gates and saw
a court-yard in which stood a large number of
roving tradesmen''s carts. In the sky there were
now fewer clouds, and here and there a star was
visible.

“See, brother!” one of them said, “we must
now cry ‘halt!’ Cost what it may, we must find
entrance and a night''s lodging.”

The door of one of the houses creaked on its
hinges, and an old woman wrapped in a sheepskin
appeared. “Who is there?” she exclaimed,
coughing loudly.

“Let us spend the night here, mother; we
have lost our way, our stomachs are empty, and
we do not want to spend the night out of doors.”

“Quite harmless people; the theologian
Khalava, the philosopher Brutus, and the
rhetorician Gorobetz.”

“It is impossible,” answered the old woman.
“The whole house is full of people, and every
corner occupied. Where can I put you up?
You are big and heavy enough to break the house
down. I know these philosophers and theologians;
when once one takes them in, they eat one
out of house and home. Go farther on! There
is no room here for you!”

“Have pity on us, mother! How can you be
so heartless? Don''t let Christians perish. Put
us up where you like, and if we eat up your provisions,
or do any other damage, may our hands
wither up, and all the punishment of heaven light
on us!”

The old woman seemed a little touched.
“Well,” she said after a few moments'' consideration,
“I will let you in; but I must put you
in different rooms, for I should have no quiet if
you were all together at night.”

“Well now, mother,” said the philosopher,
following the old woman, “if you had a little
scrap of something! By heavens! my stomach
 
is as empty as a drum. I have not had a bit of
bread in my mouth since early this morning!”

“Didn''t I say so?” replied the old woman.
“There you go begging at once. But I have no
food in the house, nor any fire.”

Her reply greatly depressed the philosopher
Thomas; but suddenly his nose caught the odour
of dried fish; he looked at the breeches of the
theologian, who walked by his side, and saw a
huge fish''s tail sticking out of his pocket. The
latter had already seized the opportunity to steal
a whole fish from one of the carts standing in the
court-yard. He had not done this from hunger
so much as from the force of habit. He had
quite forgotten the fish, and was looking about
to see whether he could not find something else
to appropriate. Then the philosopher put his
hand in the theologian''s pocket as though it were
his own, and laid hold of his prize.

The old woman found a special resting-place
for each student; the rhetorician she put in a
shed, the theologian in an empty store-room, and
the philosopher in a sheep''s stall.

As soon as the philosopher was alone, he
 
devoured the fish in a twinkling, examined the
fence which enclosed the stall, kicked away a
pig from a neighbouring stall, which had inquiringly
inserted its nose through a crevice,
and lay down on his right side to sleep like a
corpse.

The philosopher shrank back; but she still
approached, as though she wished to lay hold of
him. A terrible fright seized him, for he saw
the old hag''s eyes sparkle in an extraordinary
way. “Away with you, old witch, away with
you!” he shouted. But she still stretched her
hands after him.

He jumped up in order to rush out, but she
placed herself before the door, fixed her glowing
eyes upon him, and again approached him. The
philosopher tried to push her away with his
hands, but to his astonishment he found that he
could neither lift his hands nor move his legs,
nor utter an audible word. He only heard his
heart beating, and saw the old woman approach
him, place his hands crosswise on his breast, and
bend his head down. Then with the agility of
a cat she sprang on his shoulders, struck him on
 
the side with a broom, and he began to run like
a race-horse, carrying her on his shoulders.

All this happened with such swiftness, that the
philosopher could scarcely collect his thoughts.
He laid hold of his knees with both hands in
order to stop his legs from running; but to his
great astonishment they kept moving forward
against his will, making rapid springs like a
Caucasian horse.

Not till the house had been left behind them
and a wide plain stretched before them, bordered
on one side by a black gloomy wood, did he say
to himself, “Ah! it is a witch!”

The half-moon shone pale and high in the sky.
Its mild light, still more subdued by intervening
clouds, fell like a transparent veil on the earth.
Woods, meadows, hills, and valleys—all seemed
to be sleeping with open eyes; nowhere was a
breath of air stirring. The atmosphere was moist
and warm; the shadows of the trees and bushes
fell sharply defined on the sloping plain. Such
was the night through which the philosopher
Thomas Brutus sped with his strange rider.

A strange, oppressive, and yet sweet sensation
took possession of his heart. He looked
down and saw how the grass beneath his feet
seemed to be quite deep and far away; over it
there flowed a flood of crystal-clear water, and
the grassy plain looked like the bottom of a transparent
sea. He saw his own image, and that
 
of the old woman whom he carried on his back,
clearly reflected in it. Then he beheld how,
instead of the moon, a strange sun shone there;
he heard the deep tones of bells, and saw them
swinging. He saw a water-nixie rise from a bed
of tall reeds; she turned to him, and her face
was clearly visible, and she sang a song which
penetrated his soul; then she approached him
and nearly reached the surface of the water, on
which she burst into laughter and again disappeared.

Did he see it or did he not see it? Was he
dreaming or was he awake? But what was that
below—wind or music? It sounded and drew
nearer, and penetrated his soul like a song that
rose and fell. “What is it?” he thought as he
gazed into the depths, and still sped rapidly along.

The perspiration flowed from him in streams;
he experienced simultaneously a strange feeling
of oppression and delight in all his being. Often
he felt as though he had no longer a heart, and
pressed his hand on his breast with alarm.

Weary to death, he began to repeat all the
prayers which he knew, and all the formulas
of exorcism against evil spirits. Suddenly he
experienced a certain relief. He felt that his
pace was slackening; the witch weighed less
heavily on his shoulders, and the thick herbage
of the plain was again beneath his feet, with
nothing especial to remark about it.

“Splendid!” thought the philosopher
Thomas, and began to repeat his exorcisms in a
still louder voice.

Then suddenly he wrenched himself away from
under the witch, and sprang on her back in his
turn. She began to run, with short, trembling
steps indeed, but so rapidly that he could hardly
breathe. So swiftly did she run that she hardly
seemed to touch the ground. They were still on
the plain, but owing to the rapidity of their
flight everything seemed indistinct and confused
before his eyes. He seized a stick that was
lying on the ground, and began to belabour the
hag with all his might. She uttered a wild cry,
which at first sounded raging and threatening;
then it became gradually weaker and more
gentle, till at last it sounded quite low like the
pleasant tones of a silver bell, so that it penetrated
his innermost soul. Involuntarily the
thought passed through his mind:

He knelt beside her, and looked in her eyes.
The dawn was red in the sky, and in the distance
glimmered the gilt domes of the churches of Kieff.
Before him lay a beautiful maiden with thick,
dishevelled hair and long eyelashes. Unconsciously
she had stretched out her white, bare
arms, and her tear-filled eyes gazed at the sky.

Thomas trembled like an aspen-leaf. Sympathy,
and a strange feeling of excitement, and a
hitherto unknown fear overpowered him. He
began to run with all his might. His heart beat
violently, and he could not explain to himself
what a strange, new feeling had seized him. He
did not wish to return to the village, but hastened
towards Kieff, thinking all the way as he went
of his weird, unaccountable adventure.

There were hardly any students left in the
town; they were all scattered about the country,
and had either taken tutors'' posts or simply lived
without occupation; for at the farms in Little
Russia one can live comfortably and at ease without
paying a farthing. The great half-decayed
building in which the seminary was established
was completely empty; and however much the
philosopher searched in all its corners for a piece
of lard and bread, he could not find even one
of the hard biscuits which the seminarists were in
the habit of hiding.

But the philosopher found a means of extricating
himself from his difficulties by making
friends with a certain young widow in the market-place
who sold ribbons, etc. The same evening
he found himself being stuffed with cakes and
fowl; in fact it is impossible to say how many
things were placed before him on a little table
in an arbour shaded by cherry-trees.

Later on the same evening the philosopher was
 
to be seen in an ale-house. He lay on a bench,
smoked his pipe in his usual way, and threw the
Jewish publican a gold piece. He had a jug of
ale standing before him, looked on all who went
in and out in a cold-blooded, self-satisfied way,
and thought no more of his strange adventure.

About this time a report spread about that the
daughter of a rich colonel, whose estate lay about
fifty versts distant from Kieff, had returned home
one day from a walk in a quite broken-down condition.
She had scarcely enough strength to
reach her father''s house; now she lay dying, and
had expressed a wish that for three days after
her death the prayers for the dead should be
recited by a Kieff seminarist named Thomas
Brutus.

This fact was communicated to the philosopher
by the rector of the seminary himself, who sent
for him to his room and told him that he must
start at once, as a rich colonel had sent his
servants and a kibitka for him. The philosopher
trembled, and was seized by an uncomfortable
feeling which he could not define. He had a
gloomy foreboding that some evil was about to
befall him. Without knowing why, he declared
that he did not wish to go.

“Listen, Thomas,” said the rector, who
under certain circumstances spoke very politely
 
to his pupils; “I have no idea of asking you
whether you wish to go or not. I only tell you
that if you think of disobeying, I will have you
so soundly flogged on the back with young birch-rods,
that you need not think of having a bath
for a long time.”

The philosopher scratched the back of his
head, and went out silently, intending to make
himself scarce at the first opportunity. Lost in
thought, he descended the steep flight of steps
which led to the court-yard, thickly planted
with poplars; there he remained standing for a
moment, and heard quite distinctly the rector
giving orders in a loud voice to his steward,
and to another person, probably one of the
messengers sent by the colonel.

“Thank your master for the peeled barley and
the eggs,” said the rector; “and tell him that
as soon as the books which he mentions in his
note are ready, I will send them. I have already
given them to a clerk to be copied. And don''t
forget to remind your master that he has some
excellent fish, especially prime sturgeon, in his
ponds; he might send me some when he has the
opportunity, as here in the market the fish
are bad and dear. And you, Jantukh, give the
colonel''s man a glass of brandy. And mind you
tie up the philosopher, or he will show you a
clean pair of heels.”

“Listen to the scoundrel!” thought the
 
philosopher. “He has smelt a rat, the long-legged
stork!”

He descended into the court-yard and beheld
there a kibitka, which he at first took for a barn
on wheels. It was, in fact, as roomy as a kiln,
so that bricks might have been made inside it.
It was one of those remarkable Cracow vehicles
in which Jews travelled from town to town in
scores, wherever they thought they would find a
market. Six stout, strong, though somewhat
elderly Cossacks were standing by it. Their
gold-braided coats of fine cloth showed that
their master was rich and of some importance;
and certain little scars testified to their valour
on the battle-field.

“What can I do?” thought the philosopher.
“There is no escaping one''s destiny.” So he
stepped up to the Cossacks and said “Good day,
comrades.”

“Well, I am to travel with you! It is a
magnificent vehicle,” he continued as he got
into it. “If there were only musicians present,
one might dance in it.”

“Yes, it is a roomy carriage,” said one of the
Cossacks, taking his seat by the coachman. The
latter had tied a cloth round his head, as he had
already found an opportunity of pawning his cap
in the ale-house. The other five, with the
 
philosopher, got into the capacious kibitka, and
sat upon sacks which were filled with all sorts
of articles purchased in the city.

“I should like to know,” said the philosopher,
“if this equipage were laden with salt or iron,
how many horses would be required to draw it?”

“Yes,” said the Cossack who sat by the
coachman, after thinking a short time, “it would
require a good many horses.”

After giving this satisfactory answer, the
Cossack considered himself entitled to remain
silent for the whole of the rest of the journey.

The philosopher would gladly have found out
who the colonel was, and what sort of a character
he had. He was also curious to know about his
daughter, who had returned home in such a
strange way and now lay dying, and whose
destiny seemed to be mingled with his own;
and wanted to know the sort of life that was
lived in the colonel''s house. But the Cossacks
were probably philosophers like himself, for in
answer to his inquiries they only blew clouds of
tobacco and settled themselves more comfortably
on their sacks.

Meanwhile, one of them addressed to the
coachman on the box a brief command: “Keep
your eyes open, Overko, you old sleepy-head, and
when you come to the ale-house on the road to
Tchukrailoff, don''t forget to pull up and wake me
and the other fellows if we are asleep.” Then
 
he began to snore pretty loud. But in any
case his admonition was quite superfluous; for
scarcely had the enormous equipage begun to
approach the aforesaid ale-house, than they all
cried with one mouth “Halt! Halt!” Besides
this, Overko''s horse was accustomed to stop outside
every inn of its own accord.

In spite of the intense July heat, they all got
out and entered a low, dirty room where a Jewish
innkeeper received them in a friendly way as old
acquaintances. He brought in the skirt of his
long coat some sausages, and laid them on the
table, where, though forbidden by the Talmud,
they looked very seductive. All sat down at
table, and it was not long before each of the
guests had an earthenware jug standing in front
of him. The philosopher Thomas had to take
part in the feast, and as the Little Russians when
they are intoxicated always begin to kiss each
other or to weep, the whole room soon began to
echo with demonstrations of affection.

One Cossack, with a grey moustache, the
eldest of them all, leant his head on his hand
and began to weep bitterly because he was an
orphan and alone in God''s wide world. Another
tall, loquacious man did his best to comfort him,
 
saying, “Don''t weep, for God''s sake, don''t
weep! For over there—God knows best.”

The Cossack who had been addressed as
Dorosch was full of curiosity, and addressed
many questions to the philosopher Thomas. “I
should like to know,” he said, “what you learn
in your seminary; do you learn the same things
as the deacon reads to us in church, or something
else?”

“Don''t ask,” said the consoler; “let them
learn what they like. God knows what is to
happen; God knows everything.”

“No, I will know,” answered Dorosch, “I
will know what is written in their books; perhaps
it is something quite different from that in the
deacon''s book.”

“O good heavens!” said the other, “why all
this talk? It is God''s will, and one cannot
change God''s arrangements.”

“But I will know everything that is written;
I will enter the seminary too, by heaven I will!
Do you think perhaps I could not learn? I will
learn everything, everything.”

“Oh, heavens!” exclaimed the consoler, and
let his head sink on the table, for he could no
longer hold it upright.

When the philosopher Thomas saw the state
they were in, he determined to profit by it, and
 
to make his escape. In the first place he turned
to the grey-headed Cossack, who was lamenting
the loss of his parents. “But, little uncle,” he
said to him, “why do you weep so? I too am
an orphan! Let me go, children; why do you
want me?”

They were about to take him outside themselves,
when the one who had displayed a special
thirst for knowledge, stopped them, saying, “No,
I want to talk with him about the seminary; I am
going to the seminary myself.”

Moreover, it was not yet certain whether the
philosopher could have executed his project of
flight, for when he tried to rise from his chair,
he felt as though his feet were made of wood,
and he began to see such a number of doors leading
out of the room that it would have been
difficult for him to have found the right one.

It was not till evening that the company remembered
that they must continue their journey.
They crowded into the kibitka, whipped up the
horses, and struck up a song, the words and sense
of which were hard to understand. During a
great part of the night, they wandered about,
having lost the road which they ought to have
been able to find blindfolded. At last they drove
down a steep descent into a valley, and the
philosopher noticed, by the sides of the road,
 
hedges, behind which he caught glimpses of
small trees and house-roofs. All these belonged
to the colonel''s estate.

It was already long past midnight. The sky
was dark, though little stars glimmered here
and there; no light was to be seen in any of
the houses. They drove into a large court-yard,
while the dogs barked. On all sides were barns
and cottages with thatched roofs. Just opposite
the gateway was a house, which was larger than
the others, and seemed to be the colonel''s dwelling.
The kibitka stopped before a small barn,
and the travellers hastened into it and laid
themselves down to sleep. The philosopher however
attempted to look at the exterior of the
house, but, rub his eyes as he might, he could
distinguish nothing; the house seemed to turn
into a bear, and the chimney into the rector of
the seminary. Then he gave it up and lay down
to sleep.

When he woke up the next morning, the whole
house was in commotion; the young lady had
died during the night. The servants ran hither
and thither in a distracted state; the old women
wept and lamented; and a number of curious
people gazed through the enclosure into the
court-yard, as though there were something
special to be seen. The philosopher began now
to inspect the locality and the buildings, which
he had not been able to do during the night.

The colonel''s house was one of those low,
small buildings, such as used formerly to be constructed
in Russia. It was thatched with straw;
a small, high-peaked gable, with a window
shaped like an eye, was painted all over with
blue and yellow flowers and red crescent-moons;
it rested on little oaken pillars, which were round
above the middle, hexagonal below, and whose
capitals were adorned with quaint carvings.
Under this gable was a small staircase with seats
at the foot of it on either side.

The walls of the house were supported by
similar pillars. Before the house stood a large
pear-tree of pyramidal shape, whose leaves incessantly
trembled. A double row of buildings
formed a broad street leading up to the colonel''s
house. Behind the barns near the entrance-gate
stood two three-cornered wine-houses, also
thatched with straw; each of the stone walls had
a door in it, and was covered with all kinds of
paintings. On one was represented a Cossack
sitting on a barrel and swinging a large pitcher
over his head; it bore the inscription “I will
drink all that!” Elsewhere were painted large
and small bottles, a beautiful girl, a running
horse, a pipe, and a drum bearing the words
“Wine is the Cossack''s joy.”

In the loft of one of the barns one saw through
a huge round window a drum and some trumpets.
At the gate there stood two cannons. All this
 
showed that the colonel loved a cheerful life, and
the whole place often rang with sounds of merriment.
Before the gate were two windmills, and
behind the house gardens sloped away; through
the tree-tops the dark chimneys of the peasants''
houses were visible. The whole village lay on a
broad, even plateau, in the middle of a mountain-slope
which culminated in a steep summit on
the north side. When seen from below, it
looked still steeper. Here and there on the top
the irregular stems of the thick steppe-brooms
showed in dark relief against the blue sky. The
bare clay soil made a melancholy impression,
worn as it was into deep furrows by rain-water.
On the same slope there stood two cottages, and
over one of them a huge apple-tree spread its
branches; the roots were supported by small
props, whose interstices were filled with mould.
The apples, which were blown off by the wind,
rolled down to the court-yard below. A road
wound round the mountain to the village.

When the philosopher looked at this steep
slope, and remembered his journey of the night
before, he came to the conclusion that either the
colonel''s horses were very sagacious, or that the
Cossacks must have very strong heads, as they
ventured, even when the worse for drink, on
such a road with the huge kibitka.

When the philosopher turned and looked in
the opposite direction, he saw quite another
 
picture. The village reached down to the plain;
meadows stretched away to an immense distance,
their bright green growing gradually dark; far
away, about twenty versts off, many other villages
were visible. To the right of these meadows
were chains of hills, and in the remote distance
one saw the Dnieper shimmer and sparkle like a
mirror of steel.

“What a splendid country!” said the
philosopher to himself. “It must be fine to live
here! One could catch fish in the Dnieper, and
in the ponds, and shoot and snare partridges and
bustards; there must be quantities here. Much
fruit might be dried here and sold in the town,
or, better still, brandy might be distilled from it,
for fruit-brandy is the best of all. But what prevents
me thinking of my escape after all?”

Behind the hedge he saw a little path which
was almost entirely concealed by the high grass
of the steppe. The philosopher approached it
mechanically, meaning at first to walk a little
along it unobserved, and then quite quietly to
gain the open country behind the peasants''
houses. Suddenly he felt the pressure of a fairly
heavy hand on his shoulder.

Behind him stood the same old Cossack who
yesterday had so bitterly lamented the death of
his father and mother, and his own loneliness.
“You are giving yourself useless trouble, Mr
Philosopher, if you think you can escape from
 
us,” he said. “One cannot run away here; and
besides, the roads are too bad for walkers. Come
to the colonel; he has been waiting for you for
some time in his room.”

“Yes, of course! What are you talking
about? I will come with the greatest pleasure,”
said the philosopher, and followed the Cossack.

The colonel was an elderly man; his moustache
was grey, and his face wore the signs of deep sadness.
He sat in his room by a table, with his
head propped on both hands. He seemed about
five-and-fifty, but his attitude of utter despair,
and the pallor on his face, showed that his heart
had been suddenly broken, and that all his former
cheerfulness had for ever disappeared.

When Thomas entered with the Cossack, he
answered their deep bows with a slight inclination
of the head.

“Who are you, whence do you come, and
what is your profession, my good man?” asked
the colonel in an even voice, neither friendly nor
austere.

“I don''t know either; I know that I must have
had a mother, but who she was, and where she
lived, by heavens, I do not know.”

The colonel was silent, and seemed for a
moment lost in thought. “Where did you come
to know my daughter?”

The philosopher shrugged his shoulders.
“God only knows. It is a well-known fact that
grand people often demand things which the
most learned man cannot comprehend; and does
not the proverb say, ‘Dance, devil, as the Lord
commands!’”

“If she had only lived a moment longer,”
said the colonel sadly, “then I had certainly
found out everything. She said, ‘Let no one
offer up prayers for me, but send, father, at once
to the seminary in Kieff for the student Thomas
Brutus; he shall pray three nights running for
my sinful soul—he knows.’ But what he really
knows she never said. The poor dove could
speak no more, and died. Good man, you are
probably well known for your sanctity and
devout life, and she has perhaps heard of you.”

“What? Of me?” said the philosopher, and
took a step backward in amazement. “I and
 
sanctity!” he exclaimed, and stared at the
colonel. “God help us, gracious sir! What
are you saying? It was only last Holy Thursday
that I paid a visit to the tart-shop.”

“Well, she must at any rate have had some
reason for making the arrangement, and you
must begin your duties to-day.”

“I should like to remark to your honour—naturally
everyone who knows the Holy Scripture
at all can in his measure—but I believe it would
be better on this occasion to send for a deacon
or subdeacon. They are learned people, and
they know exactly what is to be done. I have
not got a good voice, nor any official standing.”

“You may say what you like, but I shall carry
out all my dove''s wishes. If you read the prayers
for her three nights through in the proper way, I
will reward you; and if not—I advise the devil
himself not to oppose me!”

The colonel spoke the last words in such an
emphatic way that the philosopher quite understood
them.

They went into the hall. The colonel opened
a door which was opposite his own. The
philosopher remained for a few minutes in the
hall in order to look about him; then he stepped
over the threshold with a certain nervousness.

The whole floor of the room was covered with
red cloth. In a corner under the icons of the
 
saints, on a table covered with a gold-bordered,
velvet cloth, lay the body of the girl. Tall
candles, round which were wound branches of
the “calina,” stood at her head and feet, and
burned dimly in the broad daylight. The face
of the dead was not to be seen, as the inconsolable
father sat before his daughter, with his
back turned to the philosopher. The words
which the latter overheard filled him with a
certain fear:

“I do not mourn, my daughter, that in the
flower of your age you have prematurely left the
earth, to my grief; but I mourn, my dove, that
I do not know my deadly enemy who caused your
death. Had I only known that anyone could
even conceive the idea of insulting you, or of
speaking a disrespectful word to you, I swear by
heaven he would never have seen his children
again, if he had been as old as myself; nor his
father and mother, if he had been young. And I
would have thrown his corpse to the birds of the
air, and the wild beasts of the steppe. But woe
is me, my flower, my dove, my light! I will spend
the remainder of my life without joy, and wipe
the bitter tears which flow out of my old eyes,
while my enemy will rejoice and laugh in secret
over the helpless old man!”

The philosopher was deeply affected by the
 
sight of such inconsolable sorrow. He coughed
gently in order to clear his throat. The colonel
turned and signed to him to take his place at the
head of the dead girl, before a little prayer-desk
on which some books lay.

“I can manage to hold out for three nights,”
thought the philosopher; “and then the colonel
will fill both my pockets with ducats.”

He approached the dead girl, and after coughing
once more, began to read, without paying
attention to anything else, and firmly resolved
not to look at her face.

Soon there was deep silence, and he saw that
the colonel had left the room. Slowly he turned
his head in order to look at the corpse. A
violent shudder thrilled through him; before him
lay a form of such beauty as is seldom seen
upon earth. It seemed to him that never in a
single face had so much intensity of expression
and harmony of feature been united. Her brow,
soft as snow and pure as silver, seemed to be
thinking; the fine, regular eyebrows shadowed
proudly the closed eyes, whose lashes gently
rested on her cheeks, which seemed to glow with
secret longing; her lips still appeared to smile.
But at the same time he saw something in these
features which appalled him; a terrible depression
seized his heart, as when in the midst of
dance and song someone begins to chant a dirge.
He felt as though those ruby lips were coloured
 
with his own heart''s blood. Moreover, her face
seemed dreadfully familiar.

“The witch!” he cried out in a voice which
sounded strange to himself; then he turned away
and began to read the prayers with white cheeks.
It was the witch whom he had killed.

When the sun had sunk below the horizon,
the corpse was carried into the church. The
philosopher supported one corner of the black-draped
coffin upon his shoulder, and felt an ice-cold
shiver run through his body. The colonel
walked in front of him, with his right hand
resting on the edge of the coffin.

The wooden church, black with age and
overgrown with green lichen, stood quite at the
end of the village in gloomy solitude; it was
adorned with three round cupolas. One saw at
the first glance that it had not been used for
divine worship for a long time.

Lighted candles were standing before almost
every icon. The coffin was set down before the
altar. The old colonel kissed his dead daughter
once more, and then left the church, together
with the bearers of the bier, after he had ordered
his servants to look after the philosopher and to
take him back to the church after supper.

The coffin-bearers, when they returned to the
 
house, all laid their hands on the stove. This
custom is always observed in Little Russia by
those who have seen a corpse.

The hunger which the philosopher now began
to feel caused him for a while to forget the dead
girl altogether. Gradually all the domestics of
the house assembled in the kitchen; it was really
a kind of club, where they were accustomed to
gather. Even the dogs came to the door, wagging
their tails in order to have bones and offal
thrown to them.

If a servant was sent on an errand, he always
found his way into the kitchen to rest there for
a while, and to smoke a pipe. All the Cossacks
of the establishment lay here during the whole
day on and under the benches—in fact, wherever
a place could be found to lie down in. Moreover,
everyone was always leaving something
behind in the kitchen—his cap, or his whip, or
something of the sort. But the numbers of the
club were not complete till the evening, when
the groom came in after tying up his horses in
the stable, the cowherd had shut up his cows
in their stalls, and others collected there who
were not usually seen in the day-time. During
supper-time even the tongues of the laziest were
set in motion. They talked of all and everything—of
the new pair of breeches which someone
had ordered for himself, of what might be
in the centre of the earth, and of the wolf which
 
someone had seen. There were a number of
wits in the company—a class which is always
represented in Little Russia.

The philosopher took his place with the rest in
the great circle which sat round the kitchen door
in the open-air. Soon an old woman with a red
cap issued from it, bearing with both hands a
large vessel full of hot “galuchkis,” which she
distributed among them. Each drew out of
his pocket a wooden spoon, or a one-pronged
wooden fork. As soon as their jaws began to
move a little more slowly, and their wolfish
hunger was somewhat appeased, they began to
talk. The conversation, as might be expected,
turned on the dead girl.

“Is it true,” said a young shepherd, “is it
true—though I cannot understand it—that our
young mistress had traffic with evil spirits?”

“Who, the young lady?” answered Dorosch,
whose acquaintance the philosopher had already
made in the kibitka. “Yes, she was a regular
witch! I can swear that she was a witch!”

“Hold your tongue, Dorosch!” exclaimed
another—the one who, during the journey, had
played the part of a consoler. “We have
nothing to do with that. May God be merciful
to her! One ought not to talk of such things.”

But Dorosch was not at all inclined to be
silent; he had just visited the wine-cellar with
the steward on important business, and having
 
stooped two or three times over one or two casks,
he had returned in a very cheerful and loquacious
mood.

“Why do you ask me to be silent?” he
answered. “She has ridden on my own shoulders,
I swear she has.”

“No, there are not,” answered Dorosch;
“even if you knew the Psalter by heart, you
could not recognise one.”

“Yes, Dorosch, it is possible; don''t talk such
nonsense,” retorted the former consoler. “It
is not for nothing that God has given each some
special peculiarity; the learned maintain that
every witch has a little tail.”

“Yes, you are a fine lot,” retorted the old
woman who entered at that moment with a vessel
full of fresh “galuchkis.” “You are great fat
pigs!”

A self-satisfied smile played round the lips of
the old Cossack whose name was Javtuch, when
he found that his remark had touched the old
woman on a tender point. The shepherd burst
into such a deep and loud explosion of laughter
as if two oxen were lowing together.

This conversation excited in the philosopher
 
a great curiosity, and a wish to obtain more
exact information regarding the colonel''s
daughter. In order to lead the talk back to the
subject, he turned to his next neighbour and
said, “I should like to know why all the people
here think that the young lady was a witch.
Has she done harm to anyone, or killed them by
witchcraft?”

“Yes, there are reports of that kind,”
answered a man, whose face was as flat as a
shovel. “Who does not remember the huntsman
Mikita, or the——”

“You, Mr Philosopher Thomas, did not know
Mikita. Ah! he was an extraordinary man.
He knew every dog as though he were his own
father. The present huntsman, Mikola, who sits
three places away from me, is not fit to hold a
candle to him, though good enough in his way;
but compared to Mikita, he is a mere milksop.”

“He saw a hare in the field quicker than
you can take a pinch of snuff. He only needed
to whistle ‘Come here, Rasboy! Come here,
Bosdraja!’ and flew away on his horse like the
wind, so that you could not say whether he went
quicker than the dog or the dog than he. He
could empty a quart pot of brandy in the twinkling
of an eye. Ah! he was a splendid huntsman,
only for some time he always had his eyes
fixed on the young lady. Either he had fallen
in love with her or she had bewitched him—in
short, he went to the dogs. He became a regular
old woman; yes, he became the devil knows what—it
is not fitting to relate it.”

“If the young lady only looked at him, he let
the reins slip out of his hands, called Bravko
instead of Rasboy, stumbled, and made all kinds
of mistakes. One day when he was currycombing
a horse, the young lady came to him in the
stable. ‘Listen, Mikita,’ she said. ‘I should
like for once to set my foot on you.’ And he,
the booby, was quite delighted, and answered,
‘Don''t only set your foot there, but sit on me
altogether.’ The young lady lifted her white
little foot, and as soon as he saw it, his delight
robbed him of his senses. He bowed his neck,
the idiot, took her feet in both hands, and began
to trot about like a horse all over the place.
 
Whither they went he could not say; he returned
more dead than alive, and from that time he
wasted away and became as dry as a chip of
wood. At last someone coming into the stable
one day found instead of him only a handful
of ashes and an empty jug; he had burned
completely out. But it must be said he
was a huntsman such as the world cannot
match.”

When Spirid had ended his tale, they all began
to vie with one another in praising the deceased
huntsman.

“Ha! Ha! One sees they don''t teach you
much in your seminary. Well, listen. We
have here in our village a Cossack called Cheptoun,
a fine fellow. Sometimes indeed he
amuses himself by stealing and lying without any
reason; but he is a fine fellow for all that. His
house is not far away from here. One evening,
just about this time, Cheptoun and his wife went
to bed after they had finished their day''s work.
Since it was fine weather, Cheptchicha went to
sleep in the court-yard, and Cheptoun in the
house—no! I mean Cheptchicha went to sleep
in the house on a bench and Cheptoun outside——”

“No, Cheptchicha didn''t go to sleep on a
 
bench, but on the ground,” interrupted the old
woman who stood at the door.

Dorosch looked at her, then at the ground,
then again at her, and said after a pause, “If I
tore your dress off your back before all these
people, it wouldn''t look pretty.”

“In the cradle which hung in the middle of the
room lay a one-year-old child. I do not know
whether it was a boy or a girl. Cheptchicha had
lain down, and heard on the other side of the
door a dog scratching and howling loud enough
to frighten anyone. She was afraid, for women
are such simple folk that if one puts out one''s
tongue at them behind the door in the dark, their
hearts sink into their boots. ‘But,’ she thought
to herself, ‘I must give this cursed dog one on
the snout to stop his howling!’ So she seized
the poker and opened the door. But hardly had
she done so than the dog rushed between her
legs straight to the cradle. Then Cheptchicha
saw that it was not a dog but the young lady;
and if it had only been the young lady as she
knew her it wouldn''t have mattered, but she
looked quite blue, and her eyes sparkled like fiery
coals. She seized the child, bit its throat, and
began to suck its blood. Cheptchicha shrieked,
‘Ah! my darling child!’ and rushed out of the
 
room. Then she saw that the house-door was
shut and rushed up to the attic and sat there, the
stupid woman, trembling all over. Then the
young lady came after her and bit her too, poor
fool! The next morning Cheptoun carried his
wife, all bitten and wounded, down from the
attic, and the next day she died. Such strange
things happen in the world. One may wear fine
clothes, but that does not matter; a witch is and
remains a witch.”

After telling his story, Dorosch looked around
him with a complacent air, and cleaned out his
pipe with his little finger in order to fill it again.
The story of the witch had made a deep impression
on all, and each of them had something to
say about her. One had seen her come to the
door of his house in the form of a hayrick; from
others she had stolen their caps or their pipes;
she had cut off the hair-plaits of many girls in
the village, and drunk whole pints of the blood
of others.

At last the whole company observed that they
had gossiped over their time, for it was already
night. All looked for a sleeping place—some
in the kitchen and others in the barn or the
court-yard.

“Now, Mr Thomas, it is time that we go
to the dead,” said the grey-headed Cossack,
turning to the philosopher. All four—Spirid,
Dorosch, the old Cossack, and the philosopher—betook
 
themselves to the church, keeping off with
their whips the wild dogs who roamed about the
roads in great numbers and bit the sticks of
passers-by in sheer malice.

Although the philosopher had seized the opportunity
of fortifying himself beforehand with a
stiff glass of brandy, yet he felt a certain secret
fear which increased as he approached the
church, which was lit up within. The strange
tales he had heard had made a deep impression
on his imagination. They had passed the thick
hedges and trees, and the country became more
open. At last they reached the small enclosure
round the church; behind it there were no more
trees, but a huge, empty plain dimly visible in
the darkness. The three Cossacks ascended the
steep steps with Thomas, and entered the church.
Here they left the philosopher, expressing their
hope that he would successfully accomplish his
duties, and locked him in as their master had
ordered.

He was left alone. At first he yawned, then
he stretched himself, blew on both hands, and
finally looked round him. In the middle of the
church stood the black bier; before the dark
pictures of saints burned the candles, whose
light only illuminated the icons, and cast a faint
glimmer into the body of the church; all the
corners were in complete darkness. The lofty
icons seemed to be of considerable age; only a
 
little of the original gilt remained on their broken
traceries; the faces of the saints had become
quite black and looked uncanny.

Once more the philosopher cast a glance
around him. “Bother it!” said he to himself.
“What is there to be afraid about? No living
creature can get in, and as for the dead and
those who come from the ‘other side,’ I can
protect myself with such effectual prayers that
they cannot touch me with the tips of their
fingers. There is nothing to fear,” he repeated,
swinging his arms. “Let us begin the
prayers!”

As he approached one of the side-aisles, he
noticed two packets of candles which had been
placed there.

“That is fine,” he thought. “I must
illuminate the whole church, till it is as bright
as day. What a pity that one cannot smoke
in it.”

He began to light the candles on all the wall-brackets
and all the candelabra, as well as those
already burning before the holy pictures; soon
the whole church was brilliantly lit up. Only
the darkness in the roof above seemed still
denser by contrast, and the faces of the saints
peering out of the frames looked as unearthly as
before. He approached the bier, looked nervously
at the face of the dead girl, could not
help shuddering slightly, and involuntarily closed
 
his eyes. What terrible and extraordinary
beauty!

He turned away and tried to go to one side,
but the strange curiosity and peculiar fascination
which men feel in moments of fear, compelled
him to look again and again, though with a
similar shudder. And in truth there was something
terrible about the beauty of the dead girl.
Perhaps she would not have inspired so much
fear had she been less beautiful; but there was
nothing ghastly or deathlike in the face, which
wore rather an expression of life, and it seemed
to the philosopher as though she were watching
him from under her closed eyelids. He even
thought he saw a tear roll from under the eyelash
of her right eye, but when it was half-way
down her cheek, he saw that it was a drop
of blood.

He quickly went into one of the stalls, opened
his book, and began to read the prayers in a very
loud voice in order to keep up his courage. His
deep voice sounded strange to himself in the
grave-like silence; it aroused no echo in the
silent and desolate wooden walls of the church.

“What is there to be afraid of?” he thought
to himself. “She will not rise from her bier,
since she fears God''s word. She will remain
quietly resting. Yes, and what sort of a Cossack
should I be, if I were afraid? The fact is, I
have drunk a little too much—that is why I feel
 
so queer. Let me take a pinch of snuff. It is
really excellent—first-rate!”

At the same time he cast a furtive glance over
the pages of the prayer-book towards the bier,
and involuntarily he said to himself, “There!
See! She is getting up! Her head is already
above the edge of the coffin!”

But a death-like silence prevailed; the coffin
was motionless, and all the candles shone
steadily. It was an awe-inspiring sight, this
church lit up at midnight, with the corpse in the
midst, and no living soul near but one. The
philosopher began to sing in various keys in
order to stifle his fears, but every moment he
glanced across at the coffin, and involuntarily the
question came to his lips, “Suppose she rose up
after all?”

But the coffin did not move. Nowhere was
there the slightest sound nor stir. Not even
did a cricket chirp in any corner. There was
nothing audible but the slight sputtering of
some distant candle, or the faint fall of a drop
of wax.

He raised his head. Then he looked round
him wildly and rubbed his eyes. Yes, she was
no longer lying in the coffin, but sitting upright.
He turned away his eyes, but at once looked
again, terrified, at the coffin. She stood up;
then she walked with closed eyes through the
 
church, stretching out her arms as though she
wanted to seize someone.

She now came straight towards him. Full of
alarm, he traced with his finger a circle round
himself; then in a loud voice he began to recite
the prayers and formulas of exorcism which he
had learnt from a monk who had often seen
witches and evil spirits.

She had almost reached the edge of the circle
which he had traced; but it was evident that she
had not the power to enter it. Her face wore a
bluish tint like that of one who has been several
days dead.

Thomas had not the courage to look at her, so
terrible was her appearance; her teeth chattered
and she opened her dead eyes, but as in her rage
she saw nothing, she turned in another direction
and felt with outstretched arms among the pillars
and corners of the church in the hope of seizing
him.

The philosopher could not recover his self-possession,
and kept on gazing anxiously at it.
Suddenly it rose from its place and began hurtling
about the church with a whizzing sound.
At one time it was almost directly over his head;
but the philosopher observed that it could not
pass over the area of his charmed circle, so he
kept on repeating his formulas of exorcism. The
 
coffin now fell with a crash in the middle of the
church, and remained lying there motionless.
The corpse rose again; it had now a greenish-blue
colour, but at the same moment the distant
crowing of a cock was audible, and it lay down
again.

The philosopher''s heart beat violently, and the
perspiration poured in streams from his face;
but heartened by the crowing of the cock, he
rapidly repeated the prayers.

As the first light of dawn looked through the
windows, there came a deacon and the grey-haired
Javtuk, who acted as sacristan, in order
to release him. When he had reached the
house, he could not sleep for a long time; but at
last weariness overpowered him, and he slept till
noon. When he awoke, his experiences of the
night appeared to him like a dream. He was
given a quart of brandy to strengthen him.

At table he was again talkative and ate a fairly
large sucking pig almost without assistance.
But none the less he resolved to say nothing of
what he had seen, and to all curious questions
only returned the answer, “Yes, some wonderful
things happened.”

The philosopher was one of those men who,
when they have had a good meal, are uncommonly
amiable. He lay down on a bench, with
his pipe in his mouth, looked blandly at all, and
expectorated every minute.

But as the evening approached, he became
more and more pensive. About supper-time
nearly the whole company had assembled in order
to play “krapli.” This is a kind of game of
skittles, in which, instead of bowls, long staves
are used, and the winner has the right to ride on
the back of his opponent. It provided the spectators
with much amusement; sometimes the
groom, a huge man, would clamber on the back
of the swineherd, who was slim and short
and shrunken; another time the groom would
present his own back, while Dorosch sprang on
it shouting, “What a regular ox!” Those
of the company who were more staid sat by the
threshold of the kitchen. They looked uncommonly
serious, smoked their pipes, and did not
even smile when the younger ones went into fits
of laughter over some joke of the groom or
Spirid.

Thomas vainly attempted to take part in the
game; a gloomy thought was firmly fixed like a
nail in his head. In spite of his desperate efforts
to appear cheerful after supper, fear had overmastered
his whole being, and it increased with
the growing darkness.

“Now it is time for us to go, Mr Student!”
said the grey-haired Cossack, and stood up with
Dorosch. “Let us betake ourselves to our
work.”

Thomas was conducted to the church in the
 
same way as on the previous evening; again he
was left alone, and the door was bolted behind
him.

As soon as he found himself alone, he began
to feel in the grip of his fears. He again saw
the dark pictures of the saints in their gilt
frames, and the black coffin, which stood menacing
and silent in the middle of the church.

“Never mind!” he said to himself. “I am
over the first shock. The first time I was frightened,
but I am not so at all now—no, not at
all!”

He quickly went into a stall, drew a circle
round him with his finger, uttered some prayers
and formulas for exorcism, and then began to
read the prayers for the dead in a loud voice and
with the fixed resolution not to look up from the
book nor take notice of anything.

He did so for an hour, and began to grow a
little tired; he cleared his throat and drew his
snuff-box out of his pocket, but before he had
taken a pinch he looked nervously towards the
coffin.

A sudden chill shot through him. The witch
was already standing before him on the edge of
the circle, and had fastened her green eyes upon
him. He shuddered, looked down at the book,
and began to read his prayers and exorcisms
aloud. Yet all the while he was aware how her
teeth chattered, and how she stretched out her
 
arms to seize him. But when he cast a hasty
glance towards her, he saw that she was not
looking in his direction, and it was clear that she
could not see him.

Then she began to murmur in an undertone,
and terrible words escaped her lips—words that
sounded like the bubbling of boiling pitch. The
philosopher did not know their meaning, but he
knew that they signified something terrible, and
were intended to counteract his exorcisms.

After she had spoken, a stormy wind arose
in the church, and there was a noise like the
rushing of many birds. He heard the noise of
their wings and claws as they flapped against and
scratched at the iron bars of the church windows.
There were also violent blows on the church
door, as if someone were trying to break it in
pieces.

The philosopher''s heart beat violently; he did
not dare to look up, but continued to read
the prayers without a pause. At last there was
heard in the distance the shrill sound of a cock''s
crow. The exhausted philosopher stopped and
gave a great sigh of relief.

Those who came to release him found him
more dead than alive; he had leant his back
against the wall, and stood motionless, regarding
them without any expression in his eyes.
They were obliged almost to carry him to the
house; he then shook himself, asked for and
 
drank a quart of brandy. He passed his hand
through his hair and said, “There are all sorts
of horrors in the world, and such dreadful things
happen that——” Here he made a gesture as
though to ward off something. All who heard
him bent their heads forward in curiosity.
Even a small boy, who ran on everyone''s
errands, stood by with his mouth wide open.

Just then a young woman in a close-fitting
dress passed by. She was the old cook''s assistant,
and very coquettish; she always stuck
something in her bodice by way of ornament, a
ribbon or a flower, or even a piece of paper if
she could find nothing else.

“Good day, Thomas,” she said, as she saw
the philosopher. “Dear me! what has happened
to you?” she exclaimed, striking her
hands together.

“Yes, so he has!” said Spirid, regarding him
more closely. “You have grown as grey as our
old Javtuk.”

When the philosopher heard that, he hastened
into the kitchen, where he had noticed on the wall
a dirty, three-cornered piece of looking-glass.
In front of it hung some forget-me-nots, evergreens,
and a small garland—a proof that it was
the toilette-glass of the young coquette. With
 
alarm he saw that it actually was as they had
said—his hair was quite grizzled.

He sank into a reverie; at last he said to
himself, “I will go to the colonel, tell him all,
and declare that I will read no more prayers.
He must send me back at once to Kieff.” With
this intention he turned towards the door-steps
of the colonel''s house.

The colonel was sitting motionless in his room;
his face displayed the same hopeless grief which
Thomas had observed on it on his first arrival,
only the hollows in his cheeks had deepened. It
was obvious that he took very little or no food.
A strange paleness made him look almost as
though made of marble.

“Good day,” he said as he observed Thomas
standing, cap in hand, at the door. “Well,
how are you getting on? All right?”

“Yes, sir, all right! Such hellish things are
going on, that one would like to rush away as
far as one''s feet can carry one.”

“Your daughter, sir…. When one considers
the matter, she is, of course, of noble
descent—no one can dispute that; but don''t be
angry, and may God grant her eternal rest!”

“Pray! Pray! It was not for nothing that
she sent for you. My dove was troubled about
her salvation, and wished to expel all evil
influences by means of prayer.”

“Pray! Pray!” continued the colonel in the
same persuasive tone. “There is only one night
more; you are doing a Christian work, and I will
reward you richly.”

“However great your rewards may be, I will
not read the prayers any more, sir,” said
Thomas in a tone of decision.

“Listen, philosopher!” said the colonel with
a menacing air. “I will not allow any objections.
In your seminary you may act as you
like, but here it won''t do. If I have you
knouted, it will be somewhat different to the
rector''s canings. Do you know what a strong
‘kantchuk’(2) is?”

“Of course I do,” said the philosopher in a
low voice; “a number of them together are
insupportable.”

“Yes, I think so too. But you don''t know
yet how hot my fellows can make it,” replied
the colonel threateningly. He sprang up, and
his face assumed a fierce, despotic expression,
betraying the savagery of his nature, which
had been only temporarily modified by grief.
 
“After the first flogging they pour on brandy
and then repeat it. Go away and finish your
work. If you don''t obey, you won''t be able
to stand again, and if you do, you will get a
thousand ducats.”

“That is a devil of a fellow,” thought the
philosopher to himself, and went out. “One
can''t trifle with him. But wait a little, my
friend; I will escape you so cleverly, that even
your hounds can''t find me!”

He determined, under any circumstances, to
run away, and only waited till the hour after
dinner arrived, when all the servants were accustomed
to take a nap on the hay in the barn, and
to snore and puff so loudly that it sounded as if
machinery had been set up there. At last the
time came. Even Javtuch stretched himself out
in the sun and closed his eyes. Tremblingly,
and on tiptoe, the philosopher stole softly into
the garden, whence he thought he could escape
more easily into the open country. This garden
was generally so choked up with weeds that it
seemed admirably adapted for such an attempt.
With the exception of a single path used by the
people of the house, the whole of it was covered
with cherry-trees, elder-bushes, and tall heath-thistles
with fibrous red buds. All these trees
and bushes had been thickly overgrown with ivy,
which formed a kind of roof. Its tendrils
reached to the hedge and fell down on the other
 
side in snake-like curves among the small, wild
field-flowers. Behind the hedge which bordered
the garden was a dense mass of wild heather, in
which it did not seem probable that anyone would
care to venture himself, and the strong, stubborn
stems of which seemed likely to baffle any
attempt to cut them.

As the philosopher was about to climb over the
hedge, his teeth chattered, and his heart beat
so violently that he felt frightened at it. The
skirts of his long cloak seemed to cling to the
ground as though they had been fastened to it
by pegs. When he had actually got over the
hedge he seemed to hear a shrill voice crying
behind him “Whither? Whither?”

He jumped into the heather and began to run,
stumbling over old roots and treading on unfortunate
moles. When he had emerged from the
heather he saw that he still had a wide field to
cross, behind which was a thick, thorny underwood.
This, according to his calculation, must
stretch as far as the road leading to Kieff, and
if he reached it he would be safe. Accordingly
he ran over the field and plunged into the thorny
copse. Every sharp thorn he encountered tore
a fragment from his coat. Then he reached a
small open space; in the centre of it stood a
willow, whose branches hung down to the earth,
and close by flowed a clear spring bright as
silver. The first thing the philosopher did was
 
to lie down and drink eagerly, for he was intolerably
thirsty.

“This devil of a Javtuch!” he thought. “I
should like to seize him by the feet and smash
his hang-dog face against the trunk of a tree.”

“Why did you go round such a long way?”
continued Javtuch. “You had much better
have chosen the path by which I came; it leads
directly by the stable. Besides, it is a pity about
your coat. Such splendid cloth! How much
did it cost an ell? Well, we have had a long
enough walk; it is time to go home.”

“Now the accursed witch will attack me in
earnest,” he thought. “But what have I really
to fear? Am I not a Cossack? I have read the
prayers for two nights already; with God''s help
I will get through the third night also. It is plain
that the witch must have a terrible load of guilt
upon her, else the evil one would not help her
so much.”

Feeling somewhat encouraged by these reflections,
 
he returned to the court-yard and asked
Dorosch, who sometimes, by the steward''s permission,
had access to the wine-cellar, to fetch
him a small bottle of brandy. The two friends
sat down before a barn and drank a pretty
large one. Suddenly the philosopher jumped
up and said, “I want musicians! Bring some
musicians!”

But without waiting for them he began to
dance the “tropak” in the court-yard. He
danced till tea-time, and the servants, who, as is
usual in such cases, had formed a small circle
round him, grew at last tired of watching him,
and went away saying, “By heavens, the man
can dance!”

Finally the philosopher lay down in the place
where he had been dancing, and fell asleep.
It was necessary to pour a bucket of cold water
on his head to wake him up for supper. At the
meal he enlarged on the topic of what a Cossack
ought to be, and how he should not be afraid of
anything in the world.

“I wish I could put a lighted match to your
tongue,” thought the philosopher; then he stood
up and said, “Let us go.”

On their way to the church, the philosopher
kept looking round him on all sides, and tried to
start a conversation with his companions; but
both Javtuch and Dorosch remained silent. It
 
was a weird night. In the distance wolves
howled continually, and even the barking of the
dogs had something unearthly about it.

They reached the church and walked over
the old wooden planks, whose rotten condition
showed how little the lord of the manor cared
about God and his soul. Javtuch and Dorosch
left the philosopher alone, as on the previous
evenings.

There was still the same atmosphere of menacing
silence in the church, in the centre of which
stood the coffin with the terrible witch inside it.

“I am not afraid, by heavens, I am not
afraid!” he said; and after drawing a circle
round himself as before, he began to read the
prayers and exorcisms.

An oppressive silence prevailed; the flickering
candles filled the church with their clear light.
The philosopher turned one page after another,
and noticed that he was not reading what was in
the book. Full of alarm, he crossed himself and
began to sing a hymn. This calmed him somewhat,
and he resumed his reading, turning the
pages rapidly as he did so.

Suddenly in the midst of the sepulchral silence
the iron lid of the coffin sprang open with a
 
jarring noise, and the dead witch stood up. She
was this time still more terrible in aspect than at
first. Her teeth chattered loudly and her lips,
through which poured a stream of dreadful
curses, moved convulsively. A whirlwind arose
in the church; the icons of the saints fell on the
ground, together with the broken window-panes.
The door was wrenched from its hinges, and a
huge mass of monstrous creatures rushed into
the church, which became filled with the noise
of beating wings and scratching claws. All these
creatures flew and crept about, seeking for the
philosopher, from whose brain the last fumes of
intoxication had vanished. He crossed himself
ceaselessly and uttered prayer after prayer, hearing
all the time the whole unclean swarm rustling
about him, and brushing him with the tips of
their wings. He had not the courage to look at
them; he only saw one uncouth monster standing
by the wall, with long, shaggy hair and two
flaming eyes. Over him something hung in the
air which looked like a gigantic bladder covered
with countless crabs'' claws and scorpions'' stings,
and with black clods of earth hanging from it.
All these monsters stared about seeking him, but
they could not find him, since he was protected
by his sacred circle.

A sudden silence followed; the howling of
wolves was heard in the distance, and soon
heavy footsteps resounded through the church.
Thomas looked up furtively and saw that an
ungainly human figure with crooked legs was
being led into the church. He was quite covered
with black soil, and his hands and feet resembled
knotted roots. He trod heavily and stumbled
at every step. His eyelids were of enormous
length. With terror, Thomas saw that his face
was of iron. They led him in by the arms and
placed him near Thomas''s circle.

“Raise my eyelids! I can''t see anything!”
said the Viy in a dull, hollow voice, and they all
hastened to help in doing so.

“There he is!” exclaimed the Viy, pointing
an iron finger at him; and all the monsters rushed
on him at once.

At that moment there sounded a cock''s crow
for the second time; the earth-spirits had not
heard the first one. In alarm they hurried to the
windows and the door to get out as quickly as
possible. But it was too late; they all remained
hanging as though fastened to the door and the
windows.

When the priest came he stood amazed at such
a desecration of God''s house, and did not venture
to read prayers there. The church remained
standing as it was, with the monsters hanging on
the windows and the door. Gradually it became
overgrown with creepers, bushes, and wild
heather, and no one can discover it now.

When the report of this event reached Kieff,
and the theologian Khalava heard what a fate had
overtaken the philosopher Thomas, he sank for a
whole hour into deep reflection. He had greatly
altered of late; after finishing his studies he had
become bell-ringer of one of the chief churches
in the city, and he always appeared with a bruised
nose, because the belfry staircase was in a
ruinous condition.

“Have you heard what has happened to
Thomas?” said Tiberius Gorobetz, who had
become a philosopher and now wore a moustache.

“Yes; God had appointed it so,” answered
the bell-ringer. “Let us go to the ale-house;
we will drink a glass to his memory.”

The young philosopher, who, with the enthusiasm
of a novice, had made such full use of his
privileges as a student that his breeches and coat
and even his cap reeked of brandy and tobacco,
agreed readily to the proposal.

“He was a fine fellow, Thomas,” said the
bell-ringer as the limping innkeeper set the third
 
jug of beer before him. “A splendid fellow!
And lost his life for nothing!”

“I know why he perished,” said Gorobetz;
“because he was afraid. If he had not feared
her, the witch could have done nothing to him.
One ought to cross oneself incessantly and spit
exactly on her tail, and then not the least harm
can happen. I know all about it, for here, in
Kieff, all the old women in the market-place are
witches.”

The bell-ringer nodded assent. But being
aware that he could not say any more, he got up
cautiously and went out, swaying to the right and
left in order to find a hiding-place in the thick
steppe grass outside the town. At the same time,
in accordance with his old habits, he did not
forget to steal an old boot-sole which lay on the
ale-house bench.

      thunderbolt.” These words of Maupassant to Jose Maria de Heredia on
      the occasion of a memorable meeting are, in spite of their morbid
      solemnity, not an inexact summing up of the brief career during which, for
      ten years, the writer, by turns undaunted and sorrowful, with the
      fertility of a master hand produced poetry, novels, romances and travels,
      only to sink prematurely into the abyss of madness and death. . . . .

In the month of April, 1880, an article appeared in the “Le Gaulois”
      announcing the publication of the Soirees de Medan. It was signed by a
      name as yet unknown: Guy de Maupassant. After a juvenile diatribe against
      romanticism and a passionate attack on languorous literature, the writer
      extolled the study of real life, and announced the publication of the new
      work. It was picturesque and charming. In the quiet of evening, on an
      island, in the Seine, beneath poplars instead of the Neapolitan cypresses
      dear to the friends of Boccaccio, amid the continuous murmur of the
      valley, and no longer to the sound of the Pyrennean streams that murmured
      a faint accompaniment to the tales of Marguerite''s cavaliers, the master
      and his disciples took turns in narrating some striking or pathetic
      episode of the war. And the issue, in collaboration, of these tales in one
      volume, in which the master jostled elbows with his pupils, took on the
      appearance of a manifesto, the tone of a challenge, or the utterance of a
      creed.

In fact, however, the beginnings had been much more simple, and they had
      confined themselves, beneath the trees of Medan, to deciding on a general
      title for the work. Zola had contributed the manuscript of the “Attaque
      du Moulin,” and it was at Maupassant''s house that the five young men
      gave in their contributions. Each one read his story, Maupassant being the
      last. When he had finished Boule de Suif, with a spontaneous impulse, with
      an emotion they never forgot, filled with enthusiasm at this revelation,
      they all rose and, without superfluous words, acclaimed him as a master.

He undertook to write the article for the Gaulois and, in cooperation with
      his friends, he worded it in the terms with which we are familiar,
      amplifying and embellishing it, yielding to an inborn taste for
      mystification which his youth rendered excusable. The essential point, he
      said, is to “unmoor” criticism.

It was unmoored. The following day Wolff wrote a polemical dissertation in
      the Figaro and carried away his colleagues. The volume was a brilliant
      success, thanks to Boule de Suif. Despite the novelty, the honesty of
      effort, on the part of all, no mention was made of the other stories.
      Relegated to the second rank, they passed without notice. From his first
      battle, Maupassant was master of the field in literature.

At once the entire press took him up and said what was appropriate
      regarding the budding celebrity. Biographers and reporters sought
      information concerning his life. As it was very simple and perfectly
      straightforward, they resorted to invention. And thus it is that at the
      present day Maupassant appears to us like one of those ancient heroes
      whose origin and death are veiled in mystery.

I will not dwell on Guy de Maupassant''s younger days. His relatives, his
      old friends, he himself, here and there in his works, have furnished us in
      their letters enough valuable revelations and touching remembrances of the
      years preceding his literary debut. His worthy biographer, H. Edouard
      Maynial, after collecting intelligently all the writings, condensing and
      comparing them, has been able to give us some definite information
      regarding that early period.

I will simply recall that he was born on the 5th of August, 1850, near
      Dieppe, in the castle of Miromesnil which he describes in Une Vie. . . .

Maupassant, like Flaubert, was a Norman, through his mother, and through
      his place of birth he belonged to that strange and adventurous race, whose
      heroic and long voyages on tramp trading ships he liked to recall. And
      just as the author of “Education sentimentale” seems to have
      inherited in the paternal line the shrewd realism of Champagne, so de
      Maupassant appears to have inherited from his Lorraine ancestors their
      indestructible discipline and cold lucidity.

His childhood was passed at Etretat, his beautiful childhood; it was there
      that his instincts were awakened in the unfoldment of his prehistoric
      soul. Years went by in an ecstasy of physical happiness. The delight of
      running at full speed through fields of gorse, the charm of voyages of
      discovery in hollows and ravines, games beneath the dark hedges, a passion
      for going to sea with the fishermen and, on nights when there was no moon,
      for dreaming on their boats of imaginary voyages.

Mme. de Maupassant, who had guided her son''s early reading, and had gazed
      with him at the sublime spectacle of nature, put, off as long as possible
      the hour of separation. One day, however, she had to take the child to the
      little seminary at Yvetot. Later, he became a student at the college at
      Rouen, and became a literary correspondent of Louis Bouilhet. It was at
      the latter''s house on those Sundays in winter when the Norman rain drowned
      the sound of the bells and dashed against the window panes that the school
      boy learned to write poetry.

Vacation took the rhetorician back to the north of Normandy. Now it was
      shooting at Saint Julien l''Hospitalier, across fields, bogs, and through
      the woods. From that time on he sealed his pact with the earth, and those
      “deep and delicate roots” which attached him to his native
      soil began to grow. It was of Normandy, broad, fresh and virile, that he
      would presently demand his inspiration, fervent and eager as a boy''s love;
      it was in her that he would take refuge when, weary of life, he would
      implore a truce, or when he simply wished to work and revive his energies
      in old-time joys. It was at this time that was born in him that voluptuous
      love of the sea, which in later days could alone withdraw him from the
      world, calm him, console him.

In 1870 he lived in the country, then he came to Paris to live; for, the
      family fortunes having dwindled, he had to look for a position. For
      several years he was a clerk in the Ministry of Marine, where he turned
      over musty papers, in the uninteresting company of the clerks of the
      admiralty.

Then he went into the department of Public Instruction, where bureaucratic
      servility is less intolerable. The daily duties are certainly scarcely
      more onerous and he had as chiefs, or colleagues, Xavier Charmes and Leon
      Dierx, Henry Roujon and Rene Billotte, but his office looked out on a
      beautiful melancholy garden with immense plane trees around which black
      circles of crows gathered in winter.

Maupassant made two divisions of his spare hours, one for boating, and the
      other for literature. Every evening in spring, every free day, he ran down
      to the river whose mysterious current veiled in fog or sparkling in the
      sun called to him and bewitched him. In the islands in the Seine between
      Chatou and Port-Marly, on the banks of Sartrouville and Triel he was long
      noted among the population of boatmen, who have now vanished, for his
      unwearying biceps, his cynical gaiety of good-fellowship, his unfailing
      practical jokes, his broad witticisms. Sometimes he would row with frantic
      speed, free and joyous, through the glowing sunlight on the stream;
      sometimes, he would wander along the coast, questioning the sailors,
      chatting with the ravageurs, or junk gatherers, or stretched at full
      length amid the irises and tansy he would lie for hours watching the frail
      insects that play on the surface of the stream, water spiders, or white
      butterflies, dragon flies, chasing each other amid the willow leaves, or
      frogs asleep on the lily-pads.

The rest of his life was taken up by his work. Without ever becoming
      despondent, silent and persistent, he accumulated manuscripts, poetry,
      criticisms, plays, romances and novels. Every week he docilely submitted
      his work to the great Flaubert, the childhood friend of his mother and his
      uncle Alfred Le Poittevin. The master had consented to assist the young
      man, to reveal to him the secrets that make chefs-d''oeuvre immortal. It
      was he who compelled him to make copious research and to use direct
      observation and who inculcated in him a horror of vulgarity and a contempt
      for facility.

Maupassant himself tells us of those severe initiations in the Rue
      Murillo, or in the tent at Croisset; he has recalled the implacable
      didactics of his old master, his tender brutality, the paternal advice of
      his generous and candid heart. For seven years Flaubert slashed,
      pulverized, the awkward attempts of his pupil whose success remained
      uncertain.

Suddenly, in a flight of spontaneous perfection, he wrote Boule de Suif.
      His master''s joy was great and overwhelming. He died two months later.

Until the end Maupassant remained illuminated by the reflection of the
      good, vanished giant, by that touching reflection that comes from the dead
      to those souls they have so profoundly stirred. The worship of Flaubert
      was a religion from which nothing could distract him, neither work, nor
      glory, nor slow moving waves, nor balmy nights.

At the end of his short life, while his mind was still clear: he wrote to
      a friend: “I am always thinking of my poor Flaubert, and I say to
      myself that I should like to die if I were sure that anyone would think of
      me in the same manner.”

During these long years of his novitiate Maupassant had entered the social
      literary circles. He would remain silent, preoccupied; and if anyone,
      astonished at his silence, asked him about his plans he answered simply:
      “I am learning my trade.” However, under the pseudonym of Guy
      de Valmont, he had sent some articles to the newspapers, and, later, with
      the approval and by the advice of Flaubert, he published, in the “Republique
      des Lettres,” poems signed by his name.

These poems, overflowing with sensuality, where the hymn to the Earth
      describes the transports of physical possession, where the impatience of
      love expresses itself in loud melancholy appeals like the calls of animals
      in the spring nights, are valuable chiefly inasmuch as they reveal the
      creature of instinct, the fawn escaped from his native forests, that
      Maupassant was in his early youth. But they add nothing to his glory. They
      are the “rhymes of a prose writer” as Jules Lemaitre said. To
      mould the expression of his thought according to the strictest laws, and
      to “narrow it down” to some extent, such was his aim.
      Following the example of one of his comrades of Medan, being readily
      carried away by precision of style and the rhythm of sentences, by the
      imperious rule of the ballad, of the pantoum or the chant royal,
      Maupassant also desired to write in metrical lines. However, he never
      liked this collection that he often regretted having published. His
      encounters with prosody had left him with that monotonous weariness that
      the horseman and the fencer feel after a period in the riding school, or a
      bout with the foils.

The day following the publication of “Boule de Suif,” his
      reputation began to grow rapidly. The quality of his story was unrivalled,
      but at the same time it must be acknowledged that there were some who, for
      the sake of discussion, desired to place a young reputation in opposition
      to the triumphant brutality of Zola.

From this time on, Maupassant, at the solicitation of the entire press,
      set to work and wrote story after story. His talent, free from all
      influences, his individuality, are not disputed for a moment. With a quick
      step, steady and alert, he advanced to fame, a fame of which he himself
      was not aware, but which was so universal, that no contemporary author
      during his life ever experienced the same. The “meteor” sent
      out its light and its rays were prolonged without limit, in article after
      article, volume on volume.

He was now rich and famous . . . . He is esteemed all the more as they
      believe him to be rich and happy. But they do not know that this young
      fellow with the sunburnt face, thick neck and salient muscles whom they
      invariably compare to a young bull at liberty, and whose love affairs they
      whisper, is ill, very ill. At the very moment that success came to him,
      the malady that never afterwards left him came also, and, seated
      motionless at his side, gazed at him with its threatening countenance. He
      suffered from terrible headaches, followed by nights of insomnia. He had
      nervous attacks, which he soothed with narcotics and anesthetics, which he
      used freely. His sight, which had troubled him at intervals, became
      affected, and a celebrated oculist spoke of abnormality, asymetry of the
      pupils. The famous young man trembled in secret and was haunted by all
      kinds of terrors.

The reader is charmed at the saneness of this revived art and yet, here
      and there, he is surprised to discover, amid descriptions of nature that
      are full of humanity, disquieting flights towards the supernatural,
      distressing conjurations, veiled at first, of the most commonplace, the
      most vertiginous shuddering fits of fear, as old as the world and as
      eternal as the unknown. But, instead of being alarmed, he thinks that the
      author must be gifted with infallible intuition to follow out thus the
      taints in his characters, even through their most dangerous mazes. The
      reader does not know that these hallucinations which he describes so
      minutely were experienced by Maupassant himself; he does not know that the
      fear is in himself, the anguish of fear “which is not caused by the
      presence of danger, or of inevitable death, but by certain abnormal
      conditions, by certain mysterious influences in presence of vague dangers,”
      the “fear of fear, the dread of that horrible sensation of
      incomprehensible terror.”

How can one explain these physical sufferings and this morbid distress
      that were known for some time to his intimates alone? Alas! the
      explanation is only too simple. All his life, consciously or
      unconsciously, Maupassant fought this malady, hidden as yet, which was
      latent in him.

As his malady began to take a more definite form, he turned his steps
      towards the south, only visiting Paris to see his physicians and
      publishers. In the old port of Antibes beyond the causeway of Cannes, his
      yacht, Bel Ami, which he cherished as a brother, lay at anchor and awaited
      him. He took it to the white cities of the Genoese Gulf, towards the palm
      trees of Hyeres, or the red bay trees of Antheor.

After several tragic weeks in which, from instinct, he made a desperate
      fight, on the 1st of January, 1892, he felt he was hopelessly vanquished,
      and in a moment of supreme clearness of intellect, like Gerard de Nerval,
      he attempted suicide. Less fortunate than the author of Sylvia, he was
      unsuccessful. But his mind, henceforth “indifferent to all
      unhappiness,” had entered into eternal darkness.

He was taken back to Paris and placed in Dr. Meuriot''s sanatorium, where,
      after eighteen months of mechanical existence, the “meteor”
      quietly passed away.

For several days in succession fragments of a defeated army had passed
      through the town. They were mere disorganized bands, not disciplined
      forces. The men wore long, dirty beards and tattered uniforms; they
      advanced in listless fashion, without a flag, without a leader. All seemed
      exhausted, worn out, incapable of thought or resolve, marching onward
      merely by force of habit, and dropping to the ground with fatigue the
      moment they halted. One saw, in particular, many enlisted men, peaceful
      citizens, men who lived quietly on their income, bending beneath the
      weight of their rifles; and little active volunteers, easily frightened
      but full of enthusiasm, as eager to attack as they were ready to take to
      flight; and amid these, a sprinkling of red-breeched soldiers, the pitiful
      remnant of a division cut down in a great battle; somber artillerymen,
      side by side with nondescript foot-soldiers; and, here and there, the
      gleaming helmet of a heavy-footed dragoon who had difficulty in keeping up
      with the quicker pace of the soldiers of the line. Legions of irregulars
      with high-sounding names “Avengers of Defeat,” “Citizens
      of the Tomb,” “Brethren in Death”—passed in their
      turn, looking like banditti. Their leaders, former drapers or grain
      merchants, or tallow or soap chandlers—warriors by force of
      circumstances, officers by reason of their mustachios or their money—covered
      with weapons, flannel and gold lace, spoke in an impressive manner,
      discussed plans of campaign, and behaved as though they alone bore the
      fortunes of dying France on their braggart shoulders; though, in truth,
      they frequently were afraid of their own men—scoundrels often brave
      beyond measure, but pillagers and debauchees.

The members of the National Guard, who for the past two months had been
      reconnoitering with the utmost caution in the neighboring woods,
      occasionally shooting their own sentinels, and making ready for fight
      whenever a rabbit rustled in the undergrowth, had now returned to their
      homes. Their arms, their uniforms, all the death-dealing paraphernalia
      with which they had terrified all the milestones along the highroad for
      eight miles round, had suddenly and marvellously disappeared.

The last of the French soldiers had just crossed the Seine on their way to
      Pont-Audemer, through Saint-Sever and Bourg-Achard, and in their rear the
      vanquished general, powerless to do aught with the forlorn remnants of his
      army, himself dismayed at the final overthrow of a nation accustomed to
      victory and disastrously beaten despite its legendary bravery, walked
      between two orderlies.

Then a profound calm, a shuddering, silent dread, settled on the city.
      Many a round-paunched citizen, emasculated by years devoted to business,
      anxiously awaited the conquerors, trembling lest his roasting-jacks or
      kitchen knives should be looked upon as weapons.

Life seemed to have stopped short; the shops were shut, the streets
      deserted. Now and then an inhabitant, awed by the silence, glided swiftly
      by in the shadow of the walls. The anguish of suspense made men even
      desire the arrival of the enemy.

In the afternoon of the day following the departure of the French troops,
      a number of uhlans, coming no one knew whence, passed rapidly through the
      town. A little later on, a black mass descended St. Catherine''s Hill,
      while two other invading bodies appeared respectively on the Darnetal and
      the Boisguillaume roads. The advance guards of the three corps arrived at
      precisely the same moment at the Square of the Hotel de Ville, and the
      German army poured through all the adjacent streets, its battalions making
      the pavement ring with their firm, measured tread.

Orders shouted in an unknown, guttural tongue rose to the windows of the
      seemingly dead, deserted houses; while behind the fast-closed shutters
      eager eyes peered forth at the victors-masters now of the city, its
      fortunes, and its lives, by “right of war.” The inhabitants,
      in their darkened rooms, were possessed by that terror which follows in
      the wake of cataclysms, of deadly upheavals of the earth, against which
      all human skill and strength are vain. For the same thing happens whenever
      the established order of things is upset, when security no longer exists,
      when all those rights usually protected by the law of man or of Nature are
      at the mercy of unreasoning, savage force. The earthquake crushing a whole
      nation under falling roofs; the flood let loose, and engulfing in its
      swirling depths the corpses of drowned peasants, along with dead oxen and
      beams torn from shattered houses; or the army, covered with glory,
      murdering those who defend themselves, making prisoners of the rest,
      pillaging in the name of the Sword, and giving thanks to God to the
      thunder of cannon—all these are appalling scourges, which destroy
      all belief in eternal justice, all that confidence we have been taught to
      feel in the protection of Heaven and the reason of man.

Small detachments of soldiers knocked at each door, and then disappeared
      within the houses; for the vanquished saw they would have to be civil to
      their conquerors.

At the end of a short time, once the first terror had subsided, calm was
      again restored. In many houses the Prussian officer ate at the same table
      with the family. He was often well-bred, and, out of politeness, expressed
      sympathy with France and repugnance at being compelled to take part in the
      war. This sentiment was received with gratitude; besides, his protection
      might be needful some day or other. By the exercise of tact the number of
      men quartered in one''s house might be reduced; and why should one provoke
      the hostility of a person on whom one''s whole welfare depended? Such
      conduct would savor less of bravery than of fool-hardiness. And
      foolhardiness is no longer a failing of the citizens of Rouen as it was in
      the days when their city earned renown by its heroic defenses. Last of
      all-final argument based on the national politeness—the folk of
      Rouen said to one another that it was only right to be civil in one''s own
      house, provided there was no public exhibition of familiarity with the
      foreigner. Out of doors, therefore, citizen and soldier did not know each
      other; but in the house both chatted freely, and each evening the German
      remained a little longer warming himself at the hospitable hearth.

Even the town itself resumed by degrees its ordinary aspect. The French
      seldom walked abroad, but the streets swarmed with Prussian soldiers.
      Moreover, the officers of the Blue Hussars, who arrogantly dragged their
      instruments of death along the pavements, seemed to hold the simple
      townsmen in but little more contempt than did the French cavalry officers
      who had drunk at the same cafes the year before.

But there was something in the air, a something strange and subtle, an
      intolerable foreign atmosphere like a penetrating odor—the odor of
      invasion. It permeated dwellings and places of public resort, changed the
      taste of food, made one imagine one''s self in far-distant lands, amid
      dangerous, barbaric tribes.

The conquerors exacted money, much money. The inhabitants paid what was
      asked; they were rich. But, the wealthier a Norman tradesman becomes, the
      more he suffers at having to part with anything that belongs to him, at
      having to see any portion of his substance pass into the hands of another.

Nevertheless, within six or seven miles of the town, along the course of
      the river as it flows onward to Croisset, Dieppedalle and Biessart,
      boat-men and fishermen often hauled to the surface of the water the body
      of a German, bloated in his uniform, killed by a blow from knife or club,
      his head crushed by a stone, or perchance pushed from some bridge into the
      stream below. The mud of the river-bed swallowed up these obscure acts of
      vengeance—savage, yet legitimate; these unrecorded deeds of bravery;
      these silent attacks fraught with greater danger than battles fought in
      broad day, and surrounded, moreover, with no halo of romance. For hatred
      of the foreigner ever arms a few intrepid souls, ready to die for an idea.

At last, as the invaders, though subjecting the town to the strictest
      discipline, had not committed any of the deeds of horror with which they
      had been credited while on their triumphal march, the people grew bolder,
      and the necessities of business again animated the breasts of the local
      merchants. Some of these had important commercial interests at Havre
      —occupied at present by the French army—and wished to attempt
      to reach that port by overland route to Dieppe, taking the boat from
      there.

Through the influence of the German officers whose acquaintance they had
      made, they obtained a permit to leave town from the general in command.

A large four-horse coach having, therefore, been engaged for the journey,
      and ten passengers having given in their names to the proprietor, they
      decided to start on a certain Tuesday morning before daybreak, to avoid
      attracting a crowd.

The ground had been frozen hard for some time-past, and about three
      o''clock on Monday afternoon—large black clouds from the north shed
      their burden of snow uninterruptedly all through that evening and night.

At half-past four in the morning the travellers met in the courtyard of
      the Hotel de Normandie, where they were to take their seats in the coach.

They were still half asleep, and shivering with cold under their wraps.
      They could see one another but indistinctly in the darkness, and the
      mountain of heavy winter wraps in which each was swathed made them look
      like a gathering of obese priests in their long cassocks. But two men
      recognized each other, a third accosted them, and the three began to talk.
      “I am bringing my wife,” said one. “So am I.”
      “And I, too.” The first speaker added: “We shall not
      return to Rouen, and if the Prussians approach Havre we will cross to
      England.” All three, it turned out, had made the same plans, being
      of similar disposition and temperament.

Still the horses were not harnessed. A small lantern carried by a
      stable-boy emerged now and then from one dark doorway to disappear
      immediately in another. The stamping of horses'' hoofs, deadened by the
      dung and straw of the stable, was heard from time to time, and from inside
      the building issued a man''s voice, talking to the animals and swearing at
      them. A faint tinkle of bells showed that the harness was being got ready;
      this tinkle soon developed into a continuous jingling, louder or softer
      according to the movements of the horse, sometimes stopping altogether,
      then breaking out in a sudden peal accompanied by a pawing of the ground
      by an iron-shod hoof.

A thick curtain of glistening white flakes fell ceaselessly to the ground;
      it obliterated all outlines, enveloped all objects in an icy mantle of
      foam; nothing was to be heard throughout the length and breadth of the
      silent, winter-bound city save the vague, nameless rustle of falling snow—a
      sensation rather than a sound—the gentle mingling of light atoms
      which seemed to fill all space, to cover the whole world.

The man reappeared with his lantern, leading by a rope a
      melancholy-looking horse, evidently being led out against his inclination.
      The hostler placed him beside the pole, fastened the traces, and spent
      some time in walking round him to make sure that the harness was all
      right; for he could use only one hand, the other being engaged in holding
      the lantern. As he was about to fetch the second horse he noticed the
      motionless group of travellers, already white with snow, and said to them:
      “Why don''t you get inside the coach? You''d be under shelter, at
      least.”

This did not seem to have occurred to them, and they at once took his
      advice. The three men seated their wives at the far end of the coach, then
      got in themselves; lastly the other vague, snow-shrouded forms clambered
      to the remaining places without a word.

The floor was covered with straw, into which the feet sank. The ladies at
      the far end, having brought with them little copper foot-warmers heated by
      means of a kind of chemical fuel, proceeded to light these, and spent some
      time in expatiating in low tones on their advantages, saying over and over
      again things which they had all known for a long time.

At last, six horses instead of four having been harnessed to the
      diligence, on account of the heavy roads, a voice outside asked: “Is
      every one there?” To which a voice from the interior replied:
      “Yes,” and they set out.

The vehicle moved slowly, slowly, at a snail''s pace; the wheels sank into
      the snow; the entire body of the coach creaked and groaned; the horses
      slipped, puffed, steamed, and the coachman''s long whip cracked
      incessantly, flying hither and thither, coiling up, then flinging out its
      length like a slender serpent, as it lashed some rounded flank, which
      instantly grew tense as it strained in further effort.

But the day grew apace. Those light flakes which one traveller, a native
      of Rouen, had compared to a rain of cotton fell no longer. A murky light
      filtered through dark, heavy clouds, which made the country more
      dazzlingly white by contrast, a whiteness broken sometimes by a row of
      tall trees spangled with hoarfrost, or by a cottage roof hooded in snow.

Right at the back, in the best seats of all, Monsieur and Madame Loiseau,
      wholesale wine merchants of the Rue Grand-Pont, slumbered opposite each
      other. Formerly clerk to a merchant who had failed in business, Loiseau
      had bought his master''s interest, and made a fortune for himself. He sold
      very bad wine at a very low price to the retail-dealers in the country,
      and had the reputation, among his friends and acquaintances, of being a
      shrewd rascal a true Norman, full of quips and wiles. So well established
      was his character as a cheat that, in the mouths of the citizens of Rouen,
      the very name of Loiseau became a byword for sharp practice.

Above and beyond this, Loiseau was noted for his practical jokes of every
      description—his tricks, good or ill-natured; and no one could
      mention his name without adding at once: “He''s an extraordinary man—Loiseau.”
      He was undersized and potbellied, had a florid face with grayish whiskers.

His wife-tall, strong, determined, with a loud voice and decided manner
      —represented the spirit of order and arithmetic in the business
      house which Loiseau enlivened by his jovial activity.

Beside them, dignified in bearing, belonging to a superior caste, sat
      Monsieur Carre-Lamadon, a man of considerable importance, a king in the
      cotton trade, proprietor of three spinning-mills, officer of the Legion of
      Honor, and member of the General Council. During the whole time the Empire
      was in the ascendancy he remained the chief of the well-disposed
      Opposition, merely in order to command a higher value for his devotion
      when he should rally to the cause which he meanwhile opposed with “courteous
      weapons,” to use his own expression.

Madame Carre-Lamadon, much younger than her husband, was the consolation
      of all the officers of good family quartered at Rouen. Pretty, slender,
      graceful, she sat opposite her husband, curled up in her furs, and gazing
      mournfully at the sorry interior of the coach.

Her neighbors, the Comte and Comtesse Hubert de Breville, bore one of the
      noblest and most ancient names in Normandy. The count, a nobleman advanced
      in years and of aristocratic bearing, strove to enhance by every artifice
      of the toilet, his natural resemblance to King Henry IV, who, according to
      a legend of which the family were inordinately proud, had been the favored
      lover of a De Breville lady, and father of her child —the frail
      one''s husband having, in recognition of this fact, been made a count and
      governor of a province.

A colleague of Monsieur Carre-Lamadon in the General Council, Count Hubert
      represented the Orleanist party in his department. The story of his
      marriage with the daughter of a small shipowner at Nantes had always
      remained more or less of a mystery. But as the countess had an air of
      unmistakable breeding, entertained faultlessly, and was even supposed to
      have been loved by a son of Louis-Philippe, the nobility vied with one
      another in doing her honor, and her drawing-room remained the most select
      in the whole countryside—the only one which retained the old spirit
      of gallantry, and to which access was not easy.

The fortune of the Brevilles, all in real estate, amounted, it was said,
      to five hundred thousand francs a year.

These six people occupied the farther end of the coach, and represented
      Society—with an income—the strong, established society of good
      people with religion and principle.

It happened by chance that all the women were seated on the same side; and
      the countess had, moreover, as neighbors two nuns, who spent the time in
      fingering their long rosaries and murmuring paternosters and aves. One of
      them was old, and so deeply pitted with smallpox that she looked for all
      the world as if she had received a charge of shot full in the face. The
      other, of sickly appearance, had a pretty but wasted countenance, and a
      narrow, consumptive chest, sapped by that devouring faith which is the
      making of martyrs and visionaries.

The man—a well-known character—was Cornudet, the democrat, the
      terror of all respectable people. For the past twenty years his big red
      beard had been on terms of intimate acquaintance with the tankards of all
      the republican cafes. With the help of his comrades and brethren he had
      dissipated a respectable fortune left him by his father, an
      old-established confectioner, and he now impatiently awaited the Republic,
      that he might at last be rewarded with the post he had earned by his
      revolutionary orgies. On the fourth of September—possibly as the
      result of a practical joke—he was led to believe that he had been
      appointed prefect; but when he attempted to take up the duties of the
      position the clerks in charge of the office refused to recognize his
      authority, and he was compelled in consequence to retire. A good sort of
      fellow in other respects, inoffensive and obliging, he had thrown himself
      zealously into the work of making an organized defence of the town. He had
      had pits dug in the level country, young forest trees felled, and traps
      set on all the roads; then at the approach of the enemy, thoroughly
      satisfied with his preparations, he had hastily returned to the town. He
      thought he might now do more good at Havre, where new intrenchments would
      soon be necessary.

The woman, who belonged to the courtesan class, was celebrated for an
      embonpoint unusual for her age, which had earned for her the sobriquet of
      “Boule de Suif” (Tallow Ball). Short and round, fat as a pig,
      with puffy fingers constricted at the joints, looking like rows of short
      sausages; with a shiny, tightly-stretched skin and an enormous bust
      filling out the bodice of her dress, she was yet attractive and much
      sought after, owing to her fresh and pleasing appearance. Her face was
      like a crimson apple, a peony-bud just bursting into bloom; she had two
      magnificent dark eyes, fringed with thick, heavy lashes, which cast a
      shadow into their depths; her mouth was small, ripe, kissable, and was
      furnished with the tiniest of white teeth.

As soon as she was recognized the respectable matrons of the party began
      to whisper among themselves, and the words “hussy” and “public
      scandal” were uttered so loudly that Boule de Suif raised her head.
      She forthwith cast such a challenging, bold look at her neighbors that a
      sudden silence fell on the company, and all lowered their eyes, with the
      exception of Loiseau, who watched her with evident interest.

But conversation was soon resumed among the three ladies, whom the
      presence of this girl had suddenly drawn together in the bonds of
      friendship—one might almost say in those of intimacy. They decided
      that they ought to combine, as it were, in their dignity as wives in face
      of this shameless hussy; for legitimized love always despises its
      easygoing brother.

The three men, also, brought together by a certain conservative instinct
      awakened by the presence of Cornudet, spoke of money matters in a tone
      expressive of contempt for the poor. Count Hubert related the losses he
      had sustained at the hands of the Prussians, spoke of the cattle which had
      been stolen from him, the crops which had been ruined, with the easy
      manner of a nobleman who was also a tenfold millionaire, and whom such
      reverses would scarcely inconvenience for a single year. Monsieur
      Carre-Lamadon, a man of wide experience in the cotton industry, had taken
      care to send six hundred thousand francs to England as provision against
      the rainy day he was always anticipating. As for Loiseau, he had managed
      to sell to the French commissariat department all the wines he had in
      stock, so that the state now owed him a considerable sum, which he hoped
      to receive at Havre.

And all three eyed one another in friendly, well-disposed fashion.
      Although of varying social status, they were united in the brotherhood of
      money—in that vast freemasonry made up of those who possess, who can
      jingle gold wherever they choose to put their hands into their breeches''
      pockets.

The coach went along so slowly that at ten o''clock in the morning it had
      not covered twelve miles. Three times the men of the party got out and
      climbed the hills on foot. The passengers were becoming uneasy, for they
      had counted on lunching at Totes, and it seemed now as if they would
      hardly arrive there before nightfall. Every one was eagerly looking out
      for an inn by the roadside, when, suddenly, the coach foundered in a
      snowdrift, and it took two hours to extricate it.

As appetites increased, their spirits fell; no inn, no wine shop could be
      discovered, the approach of the Prussians and the transit of the starving
      French troops having frightened away all business.

The men sought food in the farmhouses beside the road, but could not find
      so much as a crust of bread; for the suspicious peasant invariably hid his
      stores for fear of being pillaged by the soldiers, who, being entirely
      without food, would take violent possession of everything they found.

About one o''clock Loiseau announced that he positively had a big hollow in
      his stomach. They had all been suffering in the same way for some time,
      and the increasing gnawings of hunger had put an end to all conversation.

Now and then some one yawned, another followed his example, and each in
      turn, according to his character, breeding and social position, yawned
      either quietly or noisily, placing his hand before the gaping void whence
      issued breath condensed into vapor.

Several times Boule de Suif stooped, as if searching for something under
      her petticoats. She would hesitate a moment, look at her neighbors, and
      then quietly sit upright again. All faces were pale and drawn. Loiseau
      declared he would give a thousand francs for a knuckle of ham. His wife
      made an involuntary and quickly checked gesture of protest. It always hurt
      her to hear of money being squandered, and she could not even understand
      jokes on such a subject.

“As a matter of fact, I don''t feel well,” said the count.
      “Why did I not think of bringing provisions?” Each one
      reproached himself in similar fashion.

Cornudet, however, had a bottle of rum, which he offered to his neighbors.
      They all coldly refused except Loiseau, who took a sip, and returned the
      bottle with thanks, saying: “That''s good stuff; it warms one up, and
      cheats the appetite.” The alcohol put him in good humor, and he
      proposed they should do as the sailors did in the song: eat the fattest of
      the passengers. This indirect allusion to Boule de Suif shocked the
      respectable members of the party. No one replied; only Cornudet smiled.
      The two good sisters had ceased to mumble their rosary, and, with hands
      enfolded in their wide sleeves, sat motionless, their eyes steadfastly
      cast down, doubtless offering up as a sacrifice to Heaven the suffering it
      had sent them.

At last, at three o''clock, as they were in the midst of an apparently
      limitless plain, with not a single village in sight, Boule de Suif stooped
      quickly, and drew from underneath the seat a large basket covered with a
      white napkin.

From this she extracted first of all a small earthenware plate and a
      silver drinking cup, then an enormous dish containing two whole chickens
      cut into joints and imbedded in jelly. The basket was seen to contain
      other good things: pies, fruit, dainties of all sorts-provisions, in fine,
      for a three days'' journey, rendering their owner independent of wayside
      inns. The necks of four bottles protruded from among the food. She took a
      chicken wing, and began to eat it daintily, together with one of those
      rolls called in Normandy “Regence.”

All looks were directed toward her. An odor of food filled the air,
      causing nostrils to dilate, mouths to water, and jaws to contract
      painfully. The scorn of the ladies for this disreputable female grew
      positively ferocious; they would have liked to kill her, or throw, her and
      her drinking cup, her basket, and her provisions, out of the coach into
      the snow of the road below.

“Well, well, this lady had more forethought than the rest of us.
      Some people think of everything.”

“Upon my soul, I can''t refuse; I cannot hold out another minute. All
      is fair in war time, is it not, madame?” And, casting a glance on
      those around, he added:

He spread a newspaper over his knees to avoid soiling his trousers, and,
      with a pocketknife he always carried, helped himself to a chicken leg
      coated with jelly, which he thereupon proceeded to devour.

Then Boule le Suif, in low, humble tones, invited the nuns to partake of
      her repast. They both accepted the offer unhesitatingly, and after a few
      stammered words of thanks began to eat quickly, without raising their
      eyes. Neither did Cornudet refuse his neighbor''s offer, and, in
      combination with the nuns, a sort of table was formed by opening out the
      newspaper over the four pairs of knees.

Mouths kept opening and shutting, ferociously masticating and devouring
      the food. Loiseau, in his corner, was hard at work, and in low tones urged
      his wife to follow his example. She held out for a long time, but
      overstrained Nature gave way at last. Her husband, assuming his politest
      manner, asked their “charming companion” if he might be
      allowed to offer Madame Loiseau a small helping.

When the first bottle of claret was opened some embarrassment was caused
      by the fact that there was only one drinking cup, but this was passed from
      one to another, after being wiped. Cornudet alone, doubtless in a spirit
      of gallantry, raised to his own lips that part of the rim which was still
      moist from those of his fair neighbor.

Then, surrounded by people who were eating, and well-nigh suffocated by
      the odor of food, the Comte and Comtesse de Breville and Monsieur and
      Madame Carre-Lamadon endured that hateful form of torture which has
      perpetuated the name of Tantalus. All at once the manufacturer''s young
      wife heaved a sigh which made every one turn and look at her; she was
      white as the snow without; her eyes closed, her head fell forward; she had
      fainted. Her husband, beside himself, implored the help of his neighbors.
      No one seemed to know what to do until the elder of the two nuns, raising
      the patient''s head, placed Boule de Suif''s drinking cup to her lips, and
      made her swallow a few drops of wine. The pretty invalid moved, opened her
      eyes, smiled, and declared in a feeble voice that she was all right again.
      But, to prevent a recurrence of the catastrophe, the nun made her drink a
      cupful of claret, adding: “It''s just hunger —that''s what is
      wrong with you.”

Then Boule de Suif, blushing and embarrassed, stammered, looking at the
      four passengers who were still fasting:

“Hang it all, in such a case as this we are all brothers and sisters
      and ought to assist each other. Come, come, ladies, don''t stand on
      ceremony, for goodness'' sake! Do we even know whether we shall find a
      house in which to pass the night? At our present rate of going we sha''n''t
      be at Totes till midday to-morrow.”

They hesitated, no one daring to be the first to accept. But the count
      settled the question. He turned toward the abashed girl, and in his most
      distinguished manner said:

As usual, it was only the first step that cost. This Rubicon once crossed,
      they set to work with a will. The basket was emptied. It still contained a
      pate de foie gras, a lark pie, a piece of smoked tongue, Crassane pears,
      Pont-Leveque gingerbread, fancy cakes, and a cup full of pickled gherkins
      and onions—Boule de Suif, like all women, being very fond of
      indigestible things.

They could not eat this girl''s provisions without speaking to her. So they
      began to talk, stiffly at first; then, as she seemed by no means forward,
      with greater freedom. Mesdames de Breville and Carre-Lamadon, who were
      accomplished women of the world, were gracious and tactful. The countess
      especially displayed that amiable condescension characteristic of great
      ladies whom no contact with baser mortals can sully, and was absolutely
      charming. But the sturdy Madame Loiseau, who had the soul of a gendarme,
      continued morose, speaking little and eating much.

Conversation naturally turned on the war. Terrible stories were told about
      the Prussians, deeds of bravery were recounted of the French; and all
      these people who were fleeing themselves were ready to pay homage to the
      courage of their compatriots. Personal experiences soon followed, and
      Boule le Suif related with genuine emotion, and with that warmth of
      language not uncommon in women of her class and temperament, how it came
      about that she had left Rouen.

“I thought at first that I should be able to stay,” she said.
      “My house was well stocked with provisions, and it seemed better to
      put up with feeding a few soldiers than to banish myself goodness knows
      where. But when I saw these Prussians it was too much for me! My blood
      boiled with rage; I wept the whole day for very shame. Oh, if only I had
      been a man! I looked at them from my window—the fat swine, with
      their pointed helmets!—and my maid held my hands to keep me from
      throwing my furniture down on them. Then some of them were quartered on
      me; I flew at the throat of the first one who entered. They are just as
      easy to strangle as other men! And I''d have been the death of that one if
      I hadn''t been dragged away from him by my hair. I had to hide after that.
      And as soon as I could get an opportunity I left the place, and here I am.”

She was warmly congratulated. She rose in the estimation of her
      companions, who had not been so brave; and Cornudet listened to her with
      the approving and benevolent smile of an apostle, the smile a priest might
      wear in listening to a devotee praising God; for long-bearded democrats of
      his type have a monopoly of patriotism, just as priests have a monopoly of
      religion. He held forth in turn, with dogmatic self-assurance, in the
      style of the proclamations daily pasted on the walls of the town, winding
      up with a specimen of stump oratory in which he reviled “that
      besotted fool of a Louis-Napoleon.”

But Boule de Suif was indignant, for she was an ardent Bonapartist. She
      turned as red as a cherry, and stammered in her wrath: “I''d just
      like to have seen you in his place—you and your sort! There would
      have been a nice mix-up. Oh, yes! It was you who betrayed that man. It
      would be impossible to live in France if we were governed by such rascals
      as you!”

Cornudet, unmoved by this tirade, still smiled a superior, contemptuous
      smile; and one felt that high words were impending, when the count
      interposed, and, not without difficulty, succeeded in calming the
      exasperated woman, saying that all sincere opinions ought to be respected.
      But the countess and the manufacturer''s wife, imbued with the unreasoning
      hatred of the upper classes for the Republic, and instinct, moreover, with
      the affection felt by all women for the pomp and circumstance of despotic
      government, were drawn, in spite of themselves, toward this dignified
      young woman, whose opinions coincided so closely with their own.

The basket was empty. The ten people had finished its contents without
      difficulty amid general regret that it did not hold more. Conversation
      went on a little longer, though it flagged somewhat after the passengers
      had finished eating.

Night fell, the darkness grew deeper and deeper, and the cold made Boule
      de Suif shiver, in spite of her plumpness. So Madame de Breville offered
      her her foot-warmer, the fuel of which had been several times renewed
      since the morning, and she accepted the offer at once, for her feet were
      icy cold. Mesdames Carre-Lamadon and Loiseau gave theirs to the nuns.

The driver lighted his lanterns. They cast a bright gleam on a cloud of
      vapor which hovered over the sweating flanks of the horses, and on the
      roadside snow, which seemed to unroll as they went along in the changing
      light of the lamps.

All was now indistinguishable in the coach; but suddenly a movement
      occurred in the corner occupied by Boule de Suif and Cornudet; and
      Loiseau, peering into the gloom, fancied he saw the big, bearded democrat
      move hastily to one side, as if he had received a well-directed, though
      noiseless, blow in the dark.

Tiny lights glimmered ahead. It was Totes. The coach had been on the road
      eleven hours, which, with the three hours allotted the horses in four
      periods for feeding and breathing, made fourteen. It entered the town, and
      stopped before the Hotel du Commerce.

The coach door opened; a well-known noise made all the travellers start;
      it was the clanging of a scabbard, on the pavement; then a voice called
      out something in German.

Although the coach had come to a standstill, no one got out; it looked as
      if they were afraid of being murdered the moment they left their seats.
      Thereupon the driver appeared, holding in his hand one of his lanterns,
      which cast a sudden glow on the interior of the coach, lighting up the
      double row of startled faces, mouths agape, and eyes wide open in surprise
      and terror.

Beside the driver stood in the full light a German officer, a tall young
      man, fair and slender, tightly encased in his uniform like a woman in her
      corset, his flat shiny cap, tilted to one side of his head, making him
      look like an English hotel runner. His exaggerated mustache, long and
      straight and tapering to a point at either end in a single blond hair that
      could hardly be seen, seemed to weigh down the corners of his mouth and
      give a droop to his lips.

The two nuns were the first to obey, manifesting the docility of holy
      women accustomed to submission on every occasion. Next appeared the count
      and countess, followed by the manufacturer and his wife, after whom came
      Loiseau, pushing his larger and better half before him.

“Good-day, sir,” he said to the officer as he put his foot to
      the ground, acting on an impulse born of prudence rather than of
      politeness. The other, insolent like all in authority, merely stared
      without replying.

Boule de Suif and Cornudet, though near the door, were the last to alight,
      grave and dignified before the enemy. The stout girl tried to control
      herself and appear calm; the democrat stroked his long russet beard with a
      somewhat trembling hand. Both strove to maintain their dignity, knowing
      well that at such a time each individual is always looked upon as more or
      less typical of his nation; and, also, resenting the complaisant attitude
      of their companions, Boule de Suif tried to wear a bolder front than her
      neighbors, the virtuous women, while he, feeling that it was incumbent on
      him to set a good example, kept up the attitude of resistance which he had
      first assumed when he undertook to mine the high roads round Rouen.

They entered the spacious kitchen of the inn, and the German, having
      demanded the passports signed by the general in command, in which were
      mentioned the name, description and profession of each traveller,
      inspected them all minutely, comparing their appearance with the written
      particulars.

They breathed freely, All were still hungry; so supper was ordered. Half
      an hour was required for its preparation, and while two servants were
      apparently engaged in getting it ready the travellers went to look at
      their rooms. These all opened off a long corridor, at the end of which was
      a glazed door with a number on it.

They were just about to take their seats at table when the innkeeper
      appeared in person. He was a former horse dealer—a large, asthmatic
      individual, always wheezing, coughing, and clearing his throat. Follenvie
      was his patronymic.

They moved restlessly around her; every one wondered and speculated as to
      the cause of this order. The count approached:

“You are wrong, madame, for your refusal may bring trouble not only
      on yourself but also on all your companions. It never pays to resist those
      in authority. Your compliance with this request cannot possibly be fraught
      with any danger; it has probably been made because some formality or other
      was forgotten.”

All added their voices to that of the count; Boule de Suif was begged,
      urged, lectured, and at last convinced; every one was afraid of the
      complications which might result from headstrong action on her part. She
      said finally:

She left the room. All waited for her return before commencing the meal.
      Each was distressed that he or she had not been sent for rather than this
      impulsive, quick-tempered girl, and each mentally rehearsed platitudes in
      case of being summoned also.

All were anxious to know what had happened; but she declined to enlighten
      them, and when the count pressed the point, she silenced him with much
      dignity, saying:

Then they took their places round a high soup tureen, from which issued an
      odor of cabbage. In spite of this coincidence, the supper was cheerful.
      The cider was good; the Loiseaus and the nuns drank it from motives of
      economy. The others ordered wine; Cornudet demanded beer. He had his own
      fashion of uncorking the bottle and making the beer foam, gazing at it as
      he inclined his glass and then raised it to a position between the lamp
      and his eye that he might judge of its color. When he drank, his great
      beard, which matched the color of his favorite beverage, seemed to tremble
      with affection; his eyes positively squinted in the endeavor not to lose
      sight of the beloved glass, and he looked for all the world as if he were
      fulfilling the only function for which he was born. He seemed to have
      established in his mind an affinity between the two great passions of his
      life—pale ale and revolution—and assuredly he could not taste
      the one without dreaming of the other.

Monsieur and Madame Follenvie dined at the end of the table. The man,
      wheezing like a broken-down locomotive, was too short-winded to talk when
      he was eating. But the wife was not silent a moment; she told how the
      Prussians had impressed her on their arrival, what they did, what they
      said; execrating them in the first place because they cost her money, and
      in the second because she had two sons in the army. She addressed herself
      principally to the countess, flattered at the opportunity of talking to a
      lady of quality.

Then she lowered her voice, and began to broach delicate subjects. Her
      husband interrupted her from time to time, saying:

“Yes, madame, these Germans do nothing but eat potatoes and pork,
      and then pork and potatoes. And don''t imagine for a moment that they are
      clean! No, indeed! And if only you saw them drilling for hours, indeed for
      days, together; they all collect in a field, then they do nothing but
      march backward and forward, and wheel this way and that. If only they
      would cultivate the land, or remain at home and work on their high roads!
      Really, madame, these soldiers are of no earthly use! Poor people have to
      feed and keep them, only in order that they may learn how to kill! True, I
      am only an old woman with no education, but when I see them wearing
      themselves out marching about from morning till night, I say to myself:
      When there are people who make discoveries that are of use to people, why
      should others take so much trouble to do harm? Really, now, isn''t it a
      terrible thing to kill people, whether they are Prussians, or English, or
      Poles, or French? If we revenge ourselves on any one who injures us we do
      wrong, and are punished for it; but when our sons are shot down like
      partridges, that is all right, and decorations are given to the man who
      kills the most. No, indeed, I shall never be able to understand it.”

“War is a barbarous proceeding when we attack a peaceful neighbor,
      but it is a sacred duty when undertaken in defence of one''s country.”

“Yes; it''s another matter when one acts in self-defence; but would
      it not be better to kill all the kings, seeing that they make war just to
      amuse themselves?”

Monsieur Carre-Lamadon was reflecting profoundly. Although an ardent
      admirer of great generals, the peasant woman''s sturdy common sense made
      him reflect on the wealth which might accrue to a country by the
      employment of so many idle hands now maintained at a great expense, of so
      much unproductive force, if they were employed in those great industrial
      enterprises which it will take centuries to complete.

But Loiseau, leaving his seat, went over to the innkeeper and began
      chatting in a low voice. The big man chuckled, coughed, sputtered; his
      enormous carcass shook with merriment at the pleasantries of the other;
      and he ended by buying six casks of claret from Loiseau to be delivered in
      spring, after the departure of the Prussians.

But Loiseau, who had been making his observations on the sly, sent his
      wife to bed, and amused himself by placing first his ear, and then his
      eye, to the bedroom keyhole, in order to discover what he called “the
      mysteries of the corridor.”

At the end of about an hour he heard a rustling, peeped out quickly, and
      caught sight of Boule de Suif, looking more rotund than ever in a
      dressing-gown of blue cashmere trimmed with white lace. She held a candle
      in her hand, and directed her steps to the numbered door at the end of the
      corridor. But one of the side doors was partly opened, and when, at the
      end of a few minutes, she returned, Cornudet, in his shirt-sleeves,
      followed her. They spoke in low tones, then stopped short. Boule de Suif
      seemed to be stoutly denying him admission to her room. Unfortunately,
      Loiseau could not at first hear what they said; but toward the end of the
      conversation they raised their voices, and he caught a few words. Cornudet
      was loudly insistent.

“No, my good man, there are times when one does not do that sort of
      thing; besides, in this place it would be shameful.”

Apparently he did not understand, and asked the reason. Then she lost her
      temper and her caution, and, raising her voice still higher, said:

“Why? Can''t you understand why? When there are Prussians in the
      house! Perhaps even in the very next room!”

He was silent. The patriotic shame of this wanton, who would not suffer
      herself to be caressed in the neighborhood of the enemy, must have roused
      his dormant dignity, for after bestowing on her a simple kiss he crept
      softly back to his room. Loiseau, much edified, capered round the bedroom
      before taking his place beside his slumbering spouse.

Then silence reigned throughout the house. But soon there arose from some
      remote part—it might easily have been either cellar or attic—a
      stertorous, monotonous, regular snoring, a dull, prolonged rumbling,
      varied by tremors like those of a boiler under pressure of steam. Monsieur
      Follenvie had gone to sleep.

As they had decided on starting at eight o''clock the next morning, every
      one was in the kitchen at that hour; but the coach, its roof covered with
      snow, stood by itself in the middle of the yard, without either horses or
      driver. They sought the latter in the stables, coach-houses and barns
      —but in vain. So the men of the party resolved to scour the country
      for him, and sallied forth. They found themselves in the square, with the
      church at the farther side, and to right and left low-roofed houses where
      there were some Prussian soldiers. The first soldier they saw was peeling
      potatoes. The second, farther on, was washing out a barber''s shop. Another, bearded to the eyes, was fondling a crying infant, and dandling it
      on his knees to quiet it; and the stout peasant women, whose men-folk were
      for the most part at the war, were, by means of signs, telling their
      obedient conquerors what work they were to do: chop wood, prepare soup,
      grind coffee; one of them even was doing the washing for his hostess, an
      infirm old grandmother.

The count, astonished at what he saw, questioned the beadle who was coming
      out of the presbytery. The old man answered:

“Oh, those men are not at all a bad sort; they are not Prussians, I
      am told; they come from somewhere farther off, I don''t exactly know where.
      And they have all left wives and children behind them; they are not fond
      of war either, you may be sure! I am sure they are mourning for the men
      where they come from, just as we do here; and the war causes them just as
      much unhappiness as it does us. As a matter of fact, things are not so
      very bad here just now, because the soldiers do no harm, and work just as
      if they were in their own homes. You see, sir, poor folk always help one
      another; it is the great ones of this world who make war.”

Cornudet indignant at the friendly understanding established between
      conquerors and conquered, withdrew, preferring to shut himself up in the
      inn.

But they could not find the coach driver. At last he was discovered in the
      village cafe, fraternizing cordially with the officer''s orderly.

“I don''t know. Go and ask him. I am forbidden to harness the horses,
      so I don''t harness them—that''s all.”

They asked for Monsieur Follenvie, but the servant replied that on account
      of his asthma he never got up before ten o''clock. They were strictly
      forbidden to rouse him earlier, except in case of fire.

They wished to see the officer, but that also was impossible, although he
      lodged in the inn. Monsieur Follenvie alone was authorized to interview
      him on civil matters. So they waited. The women returned to their rooms,
      and occupied themselves with trivial matters.

Cornudet settled down beside the tall kitchen fireplace, before a blazing
      fire. He had a small table and a jug of beer placed beside him, and he
      smoked his pipe—a pipe which enjoyed among democrats a consideration
      almost equal to his own, as though it had served its country in serving
      Cornudet. It was a fine meerschaum, admirably colored to a black the shade
      of its owner''s teeth, but sweet-smelling, gracefully curved, at home in
      its master''s hand, and completing his physiognomy. And Cornudet sat
      motionless, his eyes fixed now on the dancing flames, now on the froth
      which crowned his beer; and after each draught he passed his long, thin
      fingers with an air of satisfaction through his long, greasy hair, as he
      sucked the foam from his mustache.

Loiseau, under pretence of stretching his legs, went out to see if he
      could sell wine to the country dealers. The count and the manufacturer
      began to talk politics. They forecast the future of France. One believed
      in the Orleans dynasty, the other in an unknown savior—a hero who
      should rise up in the last extremity: a Du Guesclin, perhaps a Joan of
      Arc? or another Napoleon the First? Ah! if only the Prince Imperial were
      not so young! Cornudet, listening to them, smiled like a man who holds the
      keys of destiny in his hands. His pipe perfumed the whole kitchen.

As the clock struck ten, Monsieur Follenvie appeared. He was immediately
      surrounded and questioned, but could only repeat, three or four times in
      succession, and without variation, the words:

“The officer said to me, just like this: ''Monsieur Follenvie, you
      will forbid them to harness up the coach for those travellers to-morrow.
      They are not to start without an order from me. You hear? That is
      sufficient.''”

Then they asked to see the officer. The count sent him his card, on which
      Monsieur Carre-Lamadon also inscribed his name and titles. The Prussian
      sent word that the two men would be admitted to see him after his luncheon—that
      is to say, about one o''clock.

The ladies reappeared, and they all ate a little, in spite of their
      anxiety. Boule de Suif appeared ill and very much worried.

Loiseau joined the other two; but when they tried to get Cornudet to
      accompany them, by way of adding greater solemnity to the occasion, he
      declared proudly that he would never have anything to do with the Germans,
      and, resuming his seat in the chimney corner, he called for another jug of
      beer.

The three men went upstairs, and were ushered into the best room in the
      inn, where the officer received them lolling at his ease in an armchair,
      his feet on the mantelpiece, smoking a long porcelain pipe, and enveloped
      in a gorgeous dressing-gown, doubtless stolen from the deserted dwelling
      of some citizen destitute of taste in dress. He neither rose, greeted
      them, nor even glanced in their direction. He afforded a fine example of
      that insolence of bearing which seems natural to the victorious soldier.

“I would respectfully call your attention, monsieur, to the fact
      that your general in command gave us a permit to proceed to Dieppe; and I
      do not think we have done anything to deserve this harshness at your
      hands.”

The afternoon was wretched. They could not understand the caprice of this
      German, and the strangest ideas came into their heads. They all
      congregated in the kitchen, and talked the subject to death, imagining all
      kinds of unlikely things. Perhaps they were to be kept as hostages —but
      for what reason? or to be extradited as prisoners of war? or possibly they
      were to be held for ransom? They were panic-stricken at this last
      supposition. The richest among them were the most alarmed, seeing
      themselves forced to empty bags of gold into the insolent soldier''s hands
      in order to buy back their lives. They racked their brains for plausible
      lies whereby they might conceal the fact that they were rich, and pass
      themselves off as poor—very poor. Loiseau took off his watch chain,
      and put it in his pocket. The approach of night increased their
      apprehension. The lamp was lighted, and as it wanted yet two hours to
      dinner Madame Loiseau proposed a game of trente et un. It would distract
      their thoughts. The rest agreed, and Cornudet himself joined the party,
      first putting out his pipe for politeness'' sake.

The count shuffled the cards—dealt—and Boule de Suif had
      thirty-one to start with; soon the interest of the game assuaged the
      anxiety of the players. But Cornudet noticed that Loiseau and his wife
      were in league to cheat.

They were about to sit down to dinner when Monsieur Follenvie appeared,
      and in his grating voice announced:

“The Prussian officer sends to ask Mademoiselle Elisabeth Rousset if
      she has changed her mind yet.”

Boule de Suif stood still, pale as death. Then, suddenly turning crimson
      with anger, she gasped out:

“Kindly tell that scoundrel, that cur, that carrion of a Prussian,
      that I will never consent—you understand?—never, never, never!”

The fat innkeeper left the room. Then Boule de Suif was surrounded,
      questioned, entreated on all sides to reveal the mystery of her visit to
      the officer. She refused at first; but her wrath soon got the better of
      her.

No one was shocked at the word, so great was the general indignation.
      Cornudet broke his jug as he banged it down on the table. A loud outcry
      arose against this base soldier. All were furious. They drew together in
      common resistance against the foe, as if some part of the sacrifice
      exacted of Boule de Suif had been demanded of each. The count declared,
      with supreme disgust, that those people behaved like ancient barbarians.
      The women, above all, manifested a lively and tender sympathy for Boule de
      Suif. The nuns, who appeared only at meals, cast down their eyes, and said
      nothing.

They dined, however, as soon as the first indignant outburst had subsided;
      but they spoke little and thought much.

The ladies went to bed early; and the men, having lighted their pipes,
      proposed a game of ecarte, in which Monsieur Follenvie was invited to
      join, the travellers hoping to question him skillfully as to the best
      means of vanquishing the officer''s obduracy. But he thought of nothing but
      his cards, would listen to nothing, reply to nothing, and repeated, time
      after time: “Attend to the game, gentlemen! attend to the game!”
      So absorbed was his attention that he even forgot to expectorate. The
      consequence was that his chest gave forth rumbling sounds like those of an
      organ. His wheezing lungs struck every note of the asthmatic scale, from
      deep, hollow tones to a shrill, hoarse piping resembling that of a young
      cock trying to crow.

He refused to go to bed when his wife, overcome with sleep, came to fetch
      him. So she went off alone, for she was an early bird, always up with the
      sun; while he was addicted to late hours, ever ready to spend the night
      with friends. He merely said: “Put my egg-nogg by the fire,”
      and went on with the game. When the other men saw that nothing was to be
      got out of him they declared it was time to retire, and each sought his
      bed.

They rose fairly early the next morning, with a vague hope of being
      allowed to start, a greater desire than ever to do so, and a terror at
      having to spend another day in this wretched little inn.

Alas! the horses remained in the stable, the driver was invisible. They
      spent their time, for want of something better to do, in wandering round
      the coach.

Luncheon was a gloomy affair; and there was a general coolness toward
      Boule de Suif, for night, which brings counsel, had somewhat modified the
      judgment of her companions. In the cold light of the morning they almost
      bore a grudge against the girl for not having secretly sought out the
      Prussian, that the rest of the party might receive a joyful surprise when
      they awoke. What more simple?

Besides, who would have been the wiser? She might have saved appearances
      by telling the officer that she had taken pity on their distress. Such a
      step would be of so little consequence to her.

In the afternoon, seeing that they were all bored to death, the count
      proposed a walk in the neighborhood of the village. Each one wrapped
      himself up well, and the little party set out, leaving behind only
      Cornudet, who preferred to sit over the fire, and the two nuns, who were
      in the habit of spending their day in the church or at the presbytery.

The cold, which grew more intense each day, almost froze the noses and
      ears of the pedestrians, their feet began to pain them so that each step
      was a penance, and when they reached the open country it looked so
      mournful and depressing in its limitless mantle of white that they all
      hastily retraced their steps, with bodies benumbed and hearts heavy.

Loiseau, who saw perfectly well how matters stood, asked suddenly “if
      that trollop were going to keep them waiting much longer in this
      Godforsaken spot.” The count, always courteous, replied that they
      could not exact so painful a sacrifice from any woman, and that the first
      move must come from herself. Monsieur Carre-Lamadon remarked that if the
      French, as they talked of doing, made a counter attack by way of Dieppe,
      their encounter with the enemy must inevitably take place at Totes. This
      reflection made the other two anxious.

“How can you think of such a thing, in this snow? And with our
      wives? Besides, we should be pursued at once, overtaken in ten minutes,
      and brought back as prisoners at the mercy of the soldiery.”

Suddenly, at the end of the street, the officer appeared. His tall,
      wasp-like, uniformed figure was outlined against the snow which bounded
      the horizon, and he walked, knees apart, with that motion peculiar to
      soldiers, who are always anxious not to soil their carefully polished
      boots.

He bowed as he passed the ladies, then glanced scornfully at the men, who
      had sufficient dignity not to raise their hats, though Loiseau made a
      movement to do so.

Boule de Suif flushed crimson to the ears, and the three married women
      felt unutterably humiliated at being met thus by the soldier in company
      with the girl whom he had treated with such scant ceremony.

Then they began to talk about him, his figure, and his face. Madame
      Carre-Lamadon, who had known many officers and judged them as a
      connoisseur, thought him not at all bad-looking; she even regretted that
      he was not a Frenchman, because in that case he would have made a very
      handsome hussar, with whom all the women would assuredly have fallen in
      love.

When they were once more within doors they did not know what to do with
      themselves. Sharp words even were exchanged apropos of the merest trifles.
      The silent dinner was quickly over, and each one went to bed early in the
      hope of sleeping, and thus killing time.

They came down next morning with tired faces and irritable tempers; the
      women scarcely spoke to Boule de Suif.

A church bell summoned the faithful to a baptism. Boule de Suif had a
      child being brought up by peasants at Yvetot. She did not see him once a
      year, and never thought of him; but the idea of the child who was about to
      be baptized induced a sudden wave of tenderness for her own, and she
      insisted on being present at the ceremony.

As soon as she had gone out, the rest of the company looked at one another
      and then drew their chairs together; for they realized that they must
      decide on some course of action. Loiseau had an inspiration: he proposed
      that they should ask the officer to detain Boule de Suif only, and to let
      the rest depart on their way.

Monsieur Follenvie was intrusted with this commission, but he returned to
      them almost immediately. The German, who knew human nature, had shown him
      the door. He intended to keep all the travellers until his condition had
      been complied with.

“We''re not going to die of old age here!” she cried. “Since
      it''s that vixen''s trade to behave so with men I don''t see that she has any
      right to refuse one more than another. I may as well tell you she took any
      lovers she could get at Rouen—even coachmen! Yes, indeed, madame—the
      coachman at the prefecture! I know it for a fact, for he buys his wine of
      us. And now that it is a question of getting us out of a difficulty she
      puts on virtuous airs, the drab! For my part, I think this officer has
      behaved very well. Why, there were three others of us, any one of whom he
      would undoubtedly have preferred. But no, he contents himself with the
      girl who is common property. He respects married women. Just think. He is
      master here. He had only to say: ''I wish it!'' and he might have taken us
      by force, with the help of his soldiers.”

The two other women shuddered; the eyes of pretty Madame Carre-Lamadon
      glistened, and she grew pale, as if the officer were indeed in the act of
      laying violent hands on her.

The men, who had been discussing the subject among themselves, drew near.
      Loiseau, in a state of furious resentment, was for delivering up “that
      miserable woman,” bound hand and foot, into the enemy''s power. But
      the count, descended from three generations of ambassadors, and endowed,
      moreover, with the lineaments of a diplomat, was in favor of more tactful
      measures.

The women drew together; they lowered their voices, and the discussion
      became general, each giving his or her opinion. But the conversation was
      not in the least coarse. The ladies, in particular, were adepts at
      delicate phrases and charming subtleties of expression to describe the
      most improper things. A stranger would have understood none of their
      allusions, so guarded was the language they employed. But, seeing that the
      thin veneer of modesty with which every woman of the world is furnished
      goes but a very little way below the surface, they began rather to enjoy
      this unedifying episode, and at bottom were hugely delighted —feeling
      themselves in their element, furthering the schemes of lawless love with
      the gusto of a gourmand cook who prepares supper for another.

Their gaiety returned of itself, so amusing at last did the whole business
      seem to them. The count uttered several rather risky witticisms, but so
      tactfully were they said that his audience could not help smiling. Loiseau
      in turn made some considerably broader jokes, but no one took offence; and
      the thought expressed with such brutal directness by his wife was
      uppermost in the minds of all: “Since it''s the girl''s trade, why
      should she refuse this man more than another?” Dainty Madame
      Carre-Lamadon seemed to think even that in Boule de Suif''s place she would
      be less inclined to refuse him than another.

The blockade was as carefully arranged as if they were investing a
      fortress. Each agreed on the role which he or she was to play, the
      arguments to be used, the maneuvers to be executed. They decided on the
      plan of campaign, the stratagems they were to employ, and the surprise
      attacks which were to reduce this human citadel and force it to receive
      the enemy within its walls.

So absorbed was the attention of all that Boule de Suif''s entrance was
      almost unnoticed. But the count whispered a gentle “Hush!”
      which made the others look up. She was there. They suddenly stopped
      talking, and a vague embarrassment prevented them for a few moments from
      addressing her. But the countess, more practiced than the others in the
      wiles of the drawing-room, asked her:

The girl, still under the stress of emotion, told what she had seen and
      heard, described the faces, the attitudes of those present, and even the
      appearance of the church. She concluded with the words:

Until lunch time the ladies contented themselves with being pleasant to
      her, so as to increase her confidence and make her amenable to their
      advice.

As soon as they took their seats at table the attack began. First they
      opened a vague conversation on the subject of self-sacrifice. Ancient
      examples were quoted: Judith and Holofernes; then, irrationally enough,
      Lucrece and Sextus; Cleopatra and the hostile generals whom she reduced to
      abject slavery by a surrender of her charms. Next was recounted an
      extraordinary story, born of the imagination of these ignorant
      millionaires, which told how the matrons of Rome seduced Hannibal, his
      lieutenants, and all his mercenaries at Capua. They held up to admiration
      all those women who from time to time have arrested the victorious
      progress of conquerors, made of their bodies a field of battle, a means of
      ruling, a weapon; who have vanquished by their heroic caresses hideous or
      detested beings, and sacrificed their chastity to vengeance and devotion.

All was said with due restraint and regard for propriety, the effect
      heightened now and then by an outburst of forced enthusiasm calculated to
      excite emulation.

A listener would have thought at last that the one role of woman on earth
      was a perpetual sacrifice of her person, a continual abandonment of
      herself to the caprices of a hostile soldiery.

The two nuns seemed to hear nothing, and to be lost in thought. Boule de
      Suif also was silent.

During the whole afternoon she was left to her reflections. But instead of
      calling her “madame” as they had done hitherto, her companions
      addressed her simply as “mademoiselle,” without exactly
      knowing why, but as if desirous of making her descend a step in the esteem
      she had won, and forcing her to realize her degraded position.

Just as soup was served, Monsieur Follenvie reappeared, repeating his
      phrase of the evening before:

But at dinner the coalition weakened. Loiseau made three unfortunate
      remarks. Each was cudgeling his brains for further examples of
      self-sacrifice, and could find none, when the countess, possibly without
      ulterior motive, and moved simply by a vague desire to do homage to
      religion, began to question the elder of the two nuns on the most striking
      facts in the lives of the saints. Now, it fell out that many of these had
      committed acts which would be crimes in our eyes, but the Church readily
      pardons such deeds when they are accomplished for the glory of God or the
      good of mankind. This was a powerful argument, and the countess made the
      most of it. Then, whether by reason of a tacit understanding, a thinly
      veiled act of complaisance such as those who wear the ecclesiastical habit
      excel in, or whether merely as the result of sheer stupidity—a
      stupidity admirably adapted to further their designs—the old nun
      rendered formidable aid to the conspirator. They had thought her timid;
      she proved herself bold, talkative, bigoted. She was not troubled by the
      ins and outs of casuistry; her doctrines were as iron bars; her faith knew
      no doubt; her conscience no scruples. She looked on Abraham''s sacrifice as
      natural enough, for she herself would not have hesitated to kill both
      father and mother if she had received a divine order to that effect; and
      nothing, in her opinion, could displease our Lord, provided the motive
      were praiseworthy. The countess, putting to good use the consecrated
      authority of her unexpected ally, led her on to make a lengthy and
      edifying paraphrase of that axiom enunciated by a certain school of
      moralists: “The end justifies the means.”

“Then, sister,” she asked, “you think God accepts all
      methods, and pardons the act when the motive is pure?”

“Undoubtedly, madame. An action reprehensible in itself often
      derives merit from the thought which inspires it.”

And in this wise they talked on, fathoming the wishes of God, predicting
      His judgments, describing Him as interested in matters which assuredly
      concern Him but little.

All was said with the utmost care and discretion, but every word uttered
      by the holy woman in her nun''s garb weakened the indignant resistance of
      the courtesan. Then the conversation drifted somewhat, and the nun began
      to talk of the convents of her order, of her Superior, of herself, and of
      her fragile little neighbor, Sister St. Nicephore. They had been sent for
      from Havre to nurse the hundreds of soldiers who were in hospitals,
      stricken with smallpox. She described these wretched invalids and their
      malady. And, while they themselves were detained on their way by the
      caprices of the Prussian officer, scores of Frenchmen might be dying, whom
      they would otherwise have saved! For the nursing of soldiers was the old
      nun''s specialty; she had been in the Crimea, in Italy, in Austria; and as
      she told the story of her campaigns she revealed herself as one of those
      holy sisters of the fife and drum who seem designed by nature to follow
      camps, to snatch the wounded from amid the strife of battle, and to quell
      with a word, more effectually than any general, the rough and
      insubordinate troopers—a masterful woman, her seamed and pitted face
      itself an image of the devastations of war.

As soon as the meal was over the travellers retired to their rooms, whence
      they emerged the following day at a late hour of the morning.

Luncheon passed off quietly. The seed sown the preceding evening was being
      given time to germinate and bring forth fruit.

In the afternoon the countess proposed a walk; then the count, as had been
      arranged beforehand, took Boule de Suif''s arm, and walked with her at some
      distance behind the rest.

He began talking to her in that familiar, paternal, slightly contemptuous
      tone which men of his class adopt in speaking to women like her, calling
      her “my dear child,” and talking down to her from the height
      of his exalted social position and stainless reputation. He came straight
      to the point.

“So you prefer to leave us here, exposed like yourself to all the
      violence which would follow on a repulse of the Prussian troops, rather
      than consent to surrender yourself, as you have done so many times in your
      life?”

He tried kindness, argument, sentiment. He still bore himself as count,
      even while adopting, when desirable, an attitude of gallantry, and making
      pretty—nay, even tender—speeches. He exalted the service she
      would render them, spoke of their gratitude; then, suddenly, using the
      familiar “thou”:

“And you know, my dear, he could boast then of having made a
      conquest of a pretty girl such as he won''t often find in his own country.”

As soon as they returned she went to her room, and was seen no more. The
      general anxiety was at its height. What would she do? If she still
      resisted, how awkward for them all!

The dinner hour struck; they waited for her in vain. At last Monsieur
      Follenvie entered, announcing that Mademoiselle Rousset was not well, and
      that they might sit down to table. They all pricked up their ears. The
      count drew near the innkeeper, and whispered:

Out of regard for propriety he said nothing to his companions, but merely
      nodded slightly toward them. A great sigh of relief went up from all
      breasts; every face was lighted up with joy.

“By Gad!” shouted Loiseau, “I''ll stand champagne all
      round if there''s any to be found in this place.” And great was
      Madame Loiseau''s dismay when the proprietor came back with four bottles in
      his hands. They had all suddenly become talkative and merry; a lively joy
      filled all hearts. The count seemed to perceive for the first time that
      Madame Carre-Lamadon was charming; the manufacturer paid compliments to
      the countess. The conversation was animated, sprightly, witty, and,
      although many of the jokes were in the worst possible taste, all the
      company were amused by them, and none offended—indignation being
      dependent, like other emotions, on surroundings. And the mental atmosphere
      had gradually become filled with gross imaginings and unclean thoughts.

At dessert even the women indulged in discreetly worded allusions. Their
      glances were full of meaning; they had drunk much. The count, who even in
      his moments of relaxation preserved a dignified demeanor, hit on a
      much-appreciated comparison of the condition of things with the
      termination of a winter spent in the icy solitude of the North Pole and
      the joy of shipwrecked mariners who at last perceive a southward track
      opening out before their eyes.

All stood up, and greeted the toast with acclamation. Even the two good
      sisters yielded to the solicitations of the ladies, and consented to
      moisten their lips with the foaming wine, which they had never before
      tasted. They declared it was like effervescent lemonade, but with a
      pleasanter flavor.

Cornudet had not spoken a word or made a movement; he seemed plunged in
      serious thought, and now and then tugged furiously at his great beard, as
      if trying to add still further to its length. At last, toward midnight,
      when they were about to separate, Loiseau, whose gait was far from steady,
      suddenly slapped him on the back, saying thickly:

Cornudet threw back his head, cast one swift and scornful glance over the
      assemblage, and answered:

A chill fell on all. Loiseau himself looked foolish and disconcerted for a
      moment, but soon recovered his aplomb, and, writhing with laughter,
      exclaimed:

Pressed for an explanation, he related the “mysteries of the
      corridor,” whereat his listeners were hugely amused. The ladies
      could hardly contain their delight. The count and Monsieur Carre-Lamadon
      laughed till they cried. They could scarcely believe their ears.

Then they separated. But Madame Loiseau, who was nothing if not spiteful,
      remarked to her husband as they were on the way to bed that “that
      stuck-up little minx of a Carre-Lamadon had laughed on the wrong side of
      her mouth all the evening.”

“You know,” she said, “when women run after uniforms
      it''s all the same to them whether the men who wear them are French or
      Prussian. It''s perfectly sickening!”

The next morning the snow showed dazzling white tinder a clear winter sun.
      The coach, ready at last, waited before the door; while a flock of white
      pigeons, with pink eyes spotted in the centres with black, puffed out
      their white feathers and walked sedately between the legs of the six
      horses, picking at the steaming manure.

The driver, wrapped in his sheepskin coat, was smoking a pipe on the box,
      and all the passengers, radiant with delight at their approaching
      departure, were putting up provisions for the remainder of the journey.

She seemed rather shamefaced and embarrassed, and advanced with timid step
      toward her companions, who with one accord turned aside as if they had not
      seen her. The count, with much dignity, took his wife by the arm, and
      removed her from the unclean contact.

The girl stood still, stupefied with astonishment; then, plucking up
      courage, accosted the manufacturer''s wife with a humble “Good-morning,
      madame,” to which the other replied merely with a slight and
      insolent nod, accompanied by a look of outraged virtue. Every one suddenly
      appeared extremely busy, and kept as far from Boule de Suif as if her
      skirts had been infected with some deadly disease. Then they hurried to
      the coach, followed by the despised courtesan, who, arriving last of all,
      silently took the place she had occupied during the first part of the
      journey.

The rest seemed neither to see nor to know her—all save Madame
      Loiseau, who, glancing contemptuously in her direction, remarked, half
      aloud, to her husband:

At first no one spoke. Boule de Suif dared not even raise her eyes. She
      felt at once indignant with her neighbors, and humiliated at having
      yielded to the Prussian into whose arms they had so hypocritically cast
      her.

“Delightful! Exceptionally talented, and an artist to the finger
      tips. She sings marvellously and draws to perfection.”

The manufacturer was chatting with the count, and amid the clatter of the
      window-panes a word of their conversation was now and then
      distinguishable: “Shares—maturity—premium—time-limit.”

Loiseau, who had abstracted from the inn the timeworn pack of cards, thick
      with the grease of five years'' contact with half-wiped-off tables, started
      a game of bezique with his wife.

The good sisters, taking up simultaneously the long rosaries hanging from
      their waists, made the sign of the cross, and began to mutter in unison
      interminable prayers, their lips moving ever more and more swiftly, as if
      they sought which should outdistance the other in the race of orisons;
      from time to time they kissed a medal, and crossed themselves anew, then
      resumed their rapid and unintelligible murmur.

His wife thereupon produced a parcel tied with string, from which she
      extracted a piece of cold veal. This she cut into neat, thin slices, and
      both began to eat.

“We may as well do the same,” said the countess. The rest
      agreed, and she unpacked the provisions which had been prepared for
      herself, the count, and the Carre-Lamadons. In one of those oval dishes,
      the lids of which are decorated with an earthenware hare, by way of
      showing that a game pie lies within, was a succulent delicacy consisting
      of the brown flesh of the game larded with streaks of bacon and flavored
      with other meats chopped fine. A solid wedge of Gruyere cheese, which had
      been wrapped in a newspaper, bore the imprint: “Items of News,”
      on its rich, oily surface.

The two good sisters brought to light a hunk of sausage smelling strongly
      of garlic; and Cornudet, plunging both hands at once into the capacious
      pockets of his loose overcoat, produced from one four hard-boiled eggs and
      from the other a crust of bread. He removed the shells, threw them into
      the straw beneath his feet, and began to devour the eggs, letting morsels
      of the bright yellow yolk fall in his mighty beard, where they looked like
      stars.

Boule de Suif, in the haste and confusion of her departure, had not
      thought of anything, and, stifling with rage, she watched all these people
      placidly eating. At first, ill-suppressed wrath shook her whole person,
      and she opened her lips to shriek the truth at them, to overwhelm them
      with a volley of insults; but she could not utter a word, so choked was
      she with indignation.

No one looked at her, no one thought of her. She felt herself swallowed up
      in the scorn of these virtuous creatures, who had first sacrificed, then
      rejected her as a thing useless and unclean. Then she remembered her big
      basket full of the good things they had so greedily devoured: the two
      chickens coated in jelly, the pies, the pears, the four bottles of claret;
      and her fury broke forth like a cord that is overstrained, and she was on
      the verge of tears. She made terrible efforts at self-control, drew
      herself up, swallowed the sobs which choked her; but the tears rose
      nevertheless, shone at the brink of her eyelids, and soon two heavy drops
      coursed slowly down her cheeks. Others followed more quickly, like water
      filtering from a rock, and fell, one after another, on her rounded bosom.
      She sat upright, with a fixed expression, her face pale and rigid, hoping
      desperately that no one saw her give way.

But the countess noticed that she was weeping, and with a sign drew her
      husband''s attention to the fact. He shrugged his shoulders, as if to say:
      “Well, what of it? It''s not my fault.” Madame Loiseau chuckled
      triumphantly, and murmured:

The two nuns had betaken themselves once more to their prayers, first
      wrapping the remainder of their sausage in paper:

Then Cornudet, who was digesting his eggs, stretched his long legs under
      the opposite seat, threw himself back, folded his arms, smiled like a man
      who had just thought of a good joke, and began to whistle the
      Marseillaise.

The faces of his neighbors clouded; the popular air evidently did not find
      favor with them; they grew nervous and irritable, and seemed ready to howl
      as a dog does at the sound of a barrel-organ. Cornudet saw the discomfort
      he was creating, and whistled the louder; sometimes he even hummed the
      words:

The coach progressed more swiftly, the snow being harder now; and all the
      way to Dieppe, during the long, dreary hours of the journey, first in the
      gathering dusk, then in the thick darkness, raising his voice above the
      rumbling of the vehicle, Cornudet continued with fierce obstinacy his
      vengeful and monotonous whistling, forcing his weary and
      exasperated-hearers to follow the song from end to end, to recall every
      word of every line, as each was repeated over and over again with untiring
      persistency.

And Boule de Suif still wept, and sometimes a sob she could not restrain
      was heard in the darkness between two verses of the song.

Besieged Paris was in the throes of famine. Even the sparrows on the roofs
      and the rats in the sewers were growing scarce. People were eating
      anything they could get.

As Monsieur Morissot, watchmaker by profession and idler for the nonce,
      was strolling along the boulevard one bright January morning, his hands in
      his trousers pockets and stomach empty, he suddenly came face to face with
      an acquaintance—Monsieur Sauvage, a fishing chum.

Before the war broke out Morissot had been in the habit, every Sunday
      morning, of setting forth with a bamboo rod in his hand and a tin box on
      his back. He took the Argenteuil train, got out at Colombes, and walked
      thence to the Ile Marante. The moment he arrived at this place of his
      dreams he began fishing, and fished till nightfall.

Every Sunday he met in this very spot Monsieur Sauvage, a stout, jolly,
      little man, a draper in the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette, and also an ardent
      fisherman. They often spent half the day side by side, rod in hand and
      feet dangling over the water, and a warm friendship had sprung up between
      the two.

Some days they did not speak; at other times they chatted; but they
      understood each other perfectly without the aid of words, having similar
      tastes and feelings.

In the spring, about ten o''clock in the morning, when the early sun caused
      a light mist to float on the water and gently warmed the backs of the two
      enthusiastic anglers, Morissot would occasionally remark to his neighbor:

In the autumn, toward the close of day, when the setting sun shed a
      blood-red glow over the western sky, and the reflection of the crimson
      clouds tinged the whole river with red, brought a glow to the faces of the
      two friends, and gilded the trees, whose leaves were already turning at
      the first chill touch of winter, Monsieur Sauvage would sometimes smile at
      Morissot, and say:

As soon as they recognized each other they shook hands cordially, affected
      at the thought of meeting under such changed circumstances.

They entered a small cafe and took an absinthe together, then resumed
      their walk along the pavement.

They were quite unsteady when they came out, owing to the effect of the
      alcohol on their empty stomachs. It was a fine, mild day, and a gentle
      breeze fanned their faces.

The fresh air completed the effect of the alcohol on Monsieur Sauvage. He
      stopped suddenly, saying:

“Why, to the old place. The French outposts are close to Colombes. I
      know Colonel Dumoulin, and we shall easily get leave to pass.”

An hour later they were walking side by side on the-highroad. Presently
      they reached the villa occupied by the colonel. He smiled at their
      request, and granted it. They resumed their walk, furnished with a
      password.

Soon they left the outposts behind them, made their way through deserted
      Colombes, and found themselves on the outskirts of the small vineyards
      which border the Seine. It was about eleven o''clock.

Before them lay the village of Argenteuil, apparently lifeless. The
      heights of Orgement and Sannois dominated the landscape. The great plain,
      extending as far as Nanterre, was empty, quite empty-a waste of
      dun-colored soil and bare cherry trees.

The Prussians! They had never seen them as yet, but they had felt their
      presence in the neighborhood of Paris for months past—ruining
      France, pillaging, massacring, starving them. And a kind of superstitious
      terror mingled with the hatred they already felt toward this unknown,
      victorious nation.

“We''d offer them some fish,” replied Monsieur Sauvage, with
      that Parisian light-heartedness which nothing can wholly quench.

Still, they hesitated to show themselves in the open country, overawed by
      the utter silence which reigned around them.

And they made their way through one of the vineyards, bent double,
      creeping along beneath the cover afforded by the vines, with eye and ear
      alert.

A strip of bare ground remained to be crossed before they could gain the
      river bank. They ran across this, and, as soon as they were at the water''s
      edge, concealed themselves among the dry reeds.

Morissot placed his ear to the ground, to ascertain, if possible, whether
      footsteps were coming their way. He heard nothing. They seemed to be
      utterly alone.

Before them the deserted Ile Marante hid them from the farther shore. The
      little restaurant was closed, and looked as if it had been deserted for
      years.

Monsieur Sauvage caught the first gudgeon, Monsieur Morissot the second,
      and almost every moment one or other raised his line with a little,
      glittering, silvery fish wriggling at the end; they were having excellent
      sport.

They slipped their catch gently into a close-meshed bag lying at their
      feet; they were filled with joy—the joy of once more indulging in a
      pastime of which they had long been deprived.

The sun poured its rays on their backs; they no longer heard anything or
      thought of anything. They ignored the rest of the world; they were
      fishing.

But suddenly a rumbling sound, which seemed to come from the bowels of the
      earth, shook the ground beneath them: the cannon were resuming their
      thunder.

Morissot turned his head and could see toward the left, beyond the banks
      of the river, the formidable outline of Mont-Valerien, from whose summit
      arose a white puff of smoke.

The next instant a second puff followed the first, and in a few moments a
      fresh detonation made the earth tremble.

Others followed, and minute by minute the mountain gave forth its deadly
      breath and a white puff of smoke, which rose slowly into the peaceful
      heaven and floated above the summit of the cliff.

Morissot, who was anxiously watching his float bobbing up and down, was
      suddenly seized with the angry impatience of a peaceful man toward the
      madmen who were firing thus, and remarked indignantly:

And the two began placidly discussing political problems with the sound
      common sense of peaceful, matter-of-fact citizens—agreeing on one
      point: that they would never be free. And Mont-Valerien thundered
      ceaselessly, demolishing the houses of the French with its cannon balls,
      grinding lives of men to powder, destroying many a dream, many a cherished
      hope, many a prospective happiness; ruthlessly causing endless woe and
      suffering in the hearts of wives, of daughters, of mothers, in other
      lands.

But they suddenly trembled with alarm at the sound of footsteps behind
      them, and, turning round, they perceived close at hand four tall, bearded
      men, dressed after the manner of livery servants and wearing flat caps on
      their heads. They were covering the two anglers with their rifles.

In the space of a few seconds they were seized, bound, thrown into a boat,
      and taken across to the Ile Marante.

A shaggy-looking giant, who was bestriding a chair and smoking a long clay
      pipe, addressed them in excellent French with the words:

Then a soldier deposited at the officer''s feet the bag full of fish, which
      he had taken care to bring away. The Prussian smiled.

“Not bad, I see. But we have something else to talk about. Listen to
      me, and don''t be alarmed:

“You must know that, in my eyes, you are two spies sent to
      reconnoitre me and my movements. Naturally, I capture you and I shoot you.
      You pretended to be fishing, the better to disguise your real errand. You
      have fallen into my hands, and must take the consequences. Such is war.

“But as you came here through the outposts you must have a password
      for your return. Tell me that password and I will let you go.”

The two friends, pale as death, stood silently side by side, a slight
      fluttering of the hands alone betraying their emotion.

“No one will ever know,” continued the officer. “You
      will return peacefully to your homes, and the secret will disappear with
      you. If you refuse, it means death-instant death. Choose!”

“Just think that in five minutes you will be at the bottom of that
      water. In five minutes! You have relations, I presume?”

The two fishermen remained silent. The German turned and gave an order in
      his own language. Then he moved his chair a little way off, that he might
      not be so near the prisoners, and a dozen men stepped forward, rifle in
      hand, and took up a position, twenty paces off.

Then he rose quickly, went over to the two Frenchmen, took Morissot by the
      arm, led him a short distance off, and said in a low voice:

Then by chance Morissot''s eyes fell on the bag full of gudgeon lying in
      the grass a few feet from him.

A ray of sunlight made the still quivering fish glisten like silver. And
      Morissot''s heart sank. Despite his efforts at self-control his eyes filled
      with tears.

Monsieur Sauvage fell forward instantaneously. Morissot, being the taller,
      swayed slightly and fell across his friend with face turned skyward and
      blood oozing from a rent in the breast of his coat.

His men dispersed, and presently returned with ropes and large stones,
      which they attached to the feet of the two friends; then they carried them
      to the river bank.

Two soldiers took Morissot by the head and the feet; two others did the
      same with Sauvage. The bodies, swung lustily by strong hands, were cast to
      a distance, and, describing a curve, fell feet foremost into the stream.

Suddenly he caught sight of the net full of gudgeons, lying forgotten in
      the grass. He picked it up, examined it, smiled, and called:

A white-aproned soldier responded to the summons, and the Prussian,
      tossing him the catch of the two murdered men, said:

“Have these fish fried for me at once, while they are still alive;
      they''ll make a tasty dish.”

It was after Bourbaki''s defeat in the east of France. The army, broken up,
      decimated, and worn out, had been obliged to retreat into Switzerland
      after that terrible campaign, and it was only its short duration that
      saved a hundred and fifty thousand men from certain death. Hunger, the
      terrible cold, forced marches in the snow without boots, over bad mountain
      roads, had caused us ''francs-tireurs'', especially, the greatest suffering,
      for we were without tents, and almost without food, always in the van when
      we were marching toward Belfort, and in the rear when returning by the
      Jura. Of our little band that had numbered twelve hundred men on the first
      of January, there remained only twenty-two pale, thin, ragged wretches,
      when we at length succeeded in reaching Swiss territory.

There we were safe, and could rest. Everybody knows what sympathy was
      shown to the unfortunate French army, and how well it was cared for. We
      all gained fresh life, and those who had been rich and happy before the
      war declared that they had never experienced a greater feeling of comfort
      than they did then. Just think. We actually had something to eat every
      day, and could sleep every night.

Meanwhile, the war continued in the east of France, which had been
      excluded from the armistice. Besancon still kept the enemy in check, and
      the latter had their revenge by ravaging Franche Comte. Sometimes we heard
      that they had approached quite close to the frontier, and we saw Swiss
      troops, who were to form a line of observation between us and them, set
      out on their march.

That pained us in the end, and, as we regained health and strength, the
      longing to fight took possession of us. It was disgraceful and irritating
      to know that within two or three leagues of us the Germans were victorious
      and insolent, to feel that we were protected by our captivity, and to feel
      that on that account we were powerless against them.

One day our captain took five or six of us aside, and spoke to us about
      it, long and furiously. He was a fine fellow, that captain. He had been a
      sublieutenant in the Zouaves, was tall and thin and as hard as steel, and
      during the whole campaign he had cut out their work for the Germans. He
      fretted in inactivity, and could not accustom himself to the idea of being
      a prisoner and of doing nothing.

“Confound it!” he said to us, “does it not pain you to
      know that there is a number of uhlans within two hours of us? Does it not
      almost drive you mad to know that those beggarly wretches are walking
      about as masters in our mountains, when six determined men might kill a
      whole spitful any day? I cannot endure it any longer, and I must go there.”

“How? It is not very difficult! Just as if we had not done a thing
      or two within the last six months, and got out of woods that were guarded
      by very different men from the Swiss. The day that you wish to cross over
      into France, I will undertake to get you there.”

“You are forgetting the treaty,” another soldier said; “we
      shall run the risk of doing the Swiss an injury, if Manteuffel learns that
      they have allowed prisoners to return to France.”

“Come,” said the captain, “those are all bad reasons. I
      mean to go and kill some Prussians; that is all I care about. If you do
      not wish to do as I do, well and good; only say so at once. I can quite
      well go by myself; I do not require anybody''s company.”

Naturally we all protested, and, as it was quite impossible to make the
      captain alter his mind, we felt obliged to promise to go with him. We
      liked him too much to leave him in the lurch, as he never failed us in any
      extremity; and so the expedition was decided on.

The captain had a plan of his own, that he had been cogitating over for
      some time. A man in that part of the country whom he knew was going to
      lend him a cart and six suits of peasants'' clothes. We could hide under
      some straw at the bottom of the wagon, which would be loaded with Gruyere
      cheese, which he was supposed to be going to sell in France. The captain
      told the sentinels that he was taking two friends with him to protect his
      goods, in case any one should try to rob him, which did not seem an
      extraordinary precaution. A Swiss officer seemed to look at the wagon in a
      knowing manner, but that was in order to impress his soldiers. In a word,
      neither officers nor men could make it out.

“Get up,” the captain said to the horses, as he cracked his
      whip, while our three men quietly smoked their pipes. I was half
      suffocated in my box, which only admitted the air through those holes in
      front, and at the same time I was nearly frozen, for it was terribly cold.

The Prussian lines were very badly guarded, as the enemy trusted to the
      watchfulness of the Swiss. The sergeant spoke North German, while our
      captain spoke the bad German of the Four Cantons, and so they could not
      understand each other. The sergeant, however, pretended to be very
      intelligent; and, in order to make us believe that he understood us, they
      allowed us to continue our journey; and, after travelling for seven hours,
      being continually stopped in the same manner, we arrived at a small
      village of the Jura in ruins, at nightfall.

What were we going to do? Our only arms were the captain''s whip, our
      uniforms our peasants'' blouses, and our food the Gruyere cheese. Our sole
      wealth consisted in our ammunition, packages of cartridges which we had
      stowed away inside some of the large cheeses. We had about a thousand of
      them, just two hundred each, but we needed rifles, and they must be
      chassepots. Luckily, however, the captain was a bold man of an inventive
      mind, and this was the plan that he hit upon:

While three of us remained hidden in a cellar in the abandoned village, he
      continued his journey as far as Besancon with the empty wagon and one man.
      The town was invested, but one can always make one''s way into a town among
      the hills by crossing the tableland till within about ten miles of the
      walls, and then following paths and ravines on foot. They left their wagon
      at Omans, among the Germans, and escaped out of it at night on foot; so as
      to gain the heights which border the River Doubs; the next day they
      entered Besancon, where there were plenty of chassepots. There were nearly
      forty thousand of them left in the arsenal, and General Roland, a brave
      marine, laughed at the captain''s daring project, but let him have six
      rifles and wished him “good luck.” There he had also found his
      wife, who had been through all the war with us before the campaign in the
      East, and who had been only prevented by illness from continuing with
      Bourbaki''s army. She had recovered, however, in spite of the cold, which
      was growing more and more intense, and in spite of the numberless
      privations that awaited her, she persisted in accompanying her husband. He
      was obliged to give way to her, and they all three, the captain, his wife,
      and our comrade, started on their expedition.

Going was nothing in comparison to returning. They were obliged to travel
      by night, so as to avoid meeting anybody, as the possession of six rifles
      would have made them liable to suspicion. But, in spite of everything, a
      week after leaving us, the captain and his two men were back with us
      again. The campaign was about to begin.

The first night of his arrival he began it himself, and, under pretext of
      examining the surrounding country, he went along the high road.

I must tell you that the little village which served as our fortress was a
      small collection of poor, badly built houses, which had been deserted long
      before. It lay on a steep slope, which terminated in a wooded plain. The
      country people sell the wood; they send it down the slopes, which are
      called coulees, locally, and which lead down to the plain, and there they
      stack it into piles, which they sell thrice a year to the wood merchants.
      The spot where this market is held in indicated by two small houses by the
      side of the highroad, which serve for public houses. The captain had gone
      down there by way of one of these coulees.

He had been gone about half an hour, and we were on the lookout at the top
      of the ravine, when we heard a shot. The captain had ordered us not to
      stir, and only to come to him when we heard him blow his trumpet. It was
      made of a goat''s horn, and could be heard a league off; but it gave no
      sound, and, in spite of our cruel anxiety, we were obliged to wait in
      silence, with our rifles by our side.

It is nothing to go down these coulees; one just lets one''s self slide
      down; but it is more difficult to get up again; one has to scramble up by
      catching hold of the hanging branches of the trees, and sometimes on all
      fours, by sheer strength. A whole mortal hour passed, and he did not come;
      nothing moved in the brushwood. The captain''s wife began to grow
      impatient. What could he be doing? Why did he not call us? Did the shot
      that we had heard proceed from an enemy, and had he killed or wounded our
      leader, her husband? They did not know what to think, but I myself fancied
      either that he was dead or that his enterprise was successful; and I was
      merely anxious and curious to know what he had done.

Suddenly we heard the sound of his trumpet, and we were much surprised
      that instead of coming from below, as we had expected, it came from the
      village behind us. What did that mean? It was a mystery to us, but the
      same idea struck us all, that he had been killed, and that the Prussians
      were blowing the trumpet to draw us into an ambush. We therefore returned
      to the cottage, keeping a careful lookout with our fingers on the trigger,
      and hiding under the branches; but his wife, in spite of our entreaties,
      rushed on, leaping like a tigress. She thought that she had to avenge her
      husband, and had fixed the bayonet to her rifle, and we lost sight of her
      at the moment that we heard the trumpet again; and, a few moments later,
      we heard her calling out to us:

We hastened on, and saw the captain smoking his pipe at the entrance of
      the village, but strangely enough, he was on horseback.

“Ah! ah!” he said to us, “you see that there is
      something to be done here. Here I am on horseback already; I knocked over
      an uhlan yonder, and took his horse; I suppose they were guarding the
      wood, but it was by drinking and swilling in clover. One of them, the
      sentry at the door, had not time to see me before I gave him a sugarplum
      in his stomach, and then, before the others could come out, I jumped on
      the horse and was off like a shot. Eight or ten of them followed me, I
      think; but I took the crossroads through the woods. I have got scratched
      and torn a bit, but here I am, and now, my good fellows, attention, and
      take care! Those brigands will not rest until they have caught us, and we
      must receive them with rifle bullets. Come along; let us take up our
      posts!”

We set out. One of us took up his position a good way from the village on
      the crossroads; I was posted at the entrance of the main street, where the
      road from the level country enters the village, while the two others, the
      captain and his wife, were in the middle of the village, near the church,
      whose tower served for an observatory and citadel.

We had not been in our places long before we heard a shot, followed by
      another, and then two, then three. The first was evidently a chassepot
      —one recognized it by the sharp report, which sounds like the crack
      of a whip—while the other three came from the lancers'' carbines.

The captain was furious. He had given orders to the outpost to let the
      enemy pass and merely to follow them at a distance if they marched toward
      the village, and to join me when they had gone well between the houses.
      Then they were to appear suddenly, take the patrol between two fires, and
      not allow a single man to escape; for, posted as we were, the six of us
      could have hemmed in ten Prussians, if needful.

“That confounded Piedelot has roused them,” the captain said,
      “and they will not venture to come on blindfolded any longer. And
      then I am quite sure that he has managed to get a shot into himself
      somewhere or other, for we hear nothing of him. It serves him right; why
      did he not obey orders?” And then, after a moment, he grumbled in
      his beard: “After all I am sorry for the poor fellow; he is so
      brave, and shoots so well!”

The captain was right in his conjectures. We waited until evening, without
      seeing the uhlans; they had retreated after the first attack; but
      unfortunately we had not seen Piedelot, either. Was he dead or a prisoner?
      When night came, the captain proposed that we should go out and look for
      him, and so the three of us started. At the crossroads we found a broken
      rifle and some blood, while the ground was trampled down; but we did not
      find either a wounded man or a dead body, although we searched every
      thicket, and at midnight we returned without having discovered anything of
      our unfortunate comrade.

“It is very strange,” the captain growled. “They must
      have killed him and thrown him into the bushes somewhere; they cannot
      possibly have taken him prisoner, as he would have called out for help. I
      cannot understand it at all.” Just as he said that, bright flames
      shot up in the direction of the inn on the high road, which illuminated
      the sky.

“Scoundrels! cowards!” he shouted. “I will bet that they
      have set fire to the two houses on the marketplace, in order to have their
      revenge, and then they will scuttle off without saying a word. They will
      be satisfied with having killed a man and set fire to two houses. All
      right. It shall not pass over like that. We must go for them; they will
      not like to leave their illuminations in order to fight.”

“It would be a great stroke of luck if we could set Piedelot free at
      the same time,” some one said.

The five of us set off, full of rage and hope. In twenty minutes we had
      got to the bottom of the coulee, and had not yet seen any one when we were
      within a hundred yards of the inn. The fire was behind the house, and all
      we saw of it was the reflection above the roof. However, we were walking
      rather slowly, as we were afraid of an ambush, when suddenly we heard
      Piedelot''s well-known voice. It had a strange sound, however; for it was
      at the same time—dull and vibrating, stifled and clear, as if he
      were calling out as loud as he could with a bit of rag stuffed into his
      mouth. He seemed to be hoarse and gasping, and the unlucky fellow kept
      exclaiming: “Help! Help!”

We sent all thoughts of prudence to the devil, and in two bounds we were
      at the back of the inn, where a terrible sight met our eyes.

Piedelot was being burned alive. He was writhing in the midst of a heap of
      fagots, tied to a stake, and the flames were licking him with their
      burning tongues. When he saw us, his tongue seemed to stick in his throat;
      he drooped his head, and seemed as if he were going to die. It was only
      the affair of a moment to upset the burning pile, to scatter the embers,
      and to cut the ropes that fastened him.

Poor fellow! In what a terrible state we found him. The evening before he
      had had his left arm broken, and it seemed as if he had been badly beaten
      since then, for his whole body was covered with wounds, bruises and blood.
      The flames had also begun their work on him, and he had two large burns,
      one on his loins and the other on his right thigh, and his beard and hair
      were scorched. Poor Piedelot!

No one knows the terrible rage we felt at this sight! We would have rushed
      headlong at a hundred thousand Prussians; our thirst for vengeance was
      intense. But the cowards had run away, leaving their crime behind them.
      Where could we find them now? Meanwhile, however, the captain''s wife was
      looking after Piedelot, and dressing his wounds as best she could, while
      the captain himself shook hands with him excitedly, and in a few minutes
      he came to himself.

“Good-morning, captain; good-morning, all of you,” he said.
      “Ah! the scoundrels, the wretches! Why, twenty of them came to
      surprise us.”

“Yes; there was a whole band of them, and that is why I disobeyed
      orders, captain, and fired on them, for they would have killed you all,
      and I preferred to stop them. That frightened them, and they did not
      venture to go farther than the crossroads. They were such cowards. Four of
      them shot at me at twenty yards, as if I had been a target, and then they
      slashed me with their swords. My arm was broken, so that I could only use
      my bayonet with one hand.”

“I took good care not to do that, for you would all have come; and
      you would neither have been able to defend me nor yourselves, being only
      five against twenty.”

“I preferred to die by myself, don''t you see! I did not want to
      bring you here, for it would have been a mere ambush.”

“No, I am suffocating. I know that I cannot live much longer. The
      brutes! They tied me to a tree, and beat me till I was half dead, and then
      they shook my broken arm; but I did not make a sound. I would rather have
      bitten my tongue out than have called out before them. Now I can tell what
      I am suffering and shed tears; it does one good. Thank you, my kind
      friends.”

“Yes, yes; I want you to do that. There is, in particular, a woman
      among them who passes as the wife of the lancer whom the captain killed
      yesterday. She is dressed like a lancer, and she tortured me the most
      yesterday, and suggested burning me; and it was she who set fire to the
      wood. Oh! the wretch, the brute! Ah! how I am suffering! My loins, my
      arms!” and he fell back gasping and exhausted, writhing in his
      terrible agony, while the captain''s wife wiped the perspiration from his
      forehead, and we all shed tears of grief and rage, as if we had been
      children. I will not describe the end to you; he died half an hour later,
      previously telling us in what direction the enemy had gone. When he was
      dead we gave ourselves time to bury him, and then we set out in pursuit of
      them, with our hearts full of fury and hatred.

“We will throw ourselves on the whole Prussian army, if it be
      necessary,” the captain said; “but we will avenge Piedelot. We
      must catch those scoundrels. Let us swear to die, rather than not to find
      them; and if I am killed first, these are my orders: All the prisoners
      that you take are to be shot immediately, and as for the lancer''s wife,
      she is to be tortured before she is put to death.”

“She must not be shot, because she is a woman,” the captain''s
      wife said. “If you survive, I am sure that you would not shoot a
      woman. Torturing her will be quite sufficient; but if you are killed in
      this pursuit, I want one thing, and that is to fight with her; I will kill
      her with my own hands, and the others can do what they like with her if
      she kills me.”

“We will outrage her! We will burn her! We will tear her to pieces!
      Piedelot shall be avenged!

The next morning we unexpectedly fell on an outpost of uhlans four leagues
      away. Surprised by our sudden attack, they were not able to mount their
      horses, nor even to defend themselves; and in a few moments we had five
      prisoner, corresponding to our own number. The captain questioned them,
      and from their answers we felt certain that they were the same whom we had
      encountered the previous day. Then a very curious operation took place.
      One of us was told off to ascertain their sex, and nothing can describe
      our joy when we discovered what we were seeking among them, the female
      executioner who had tortured our friend.

The four others were shot on the spot, with their backs to us and close to
      the muzzles of our rifles; and then we turned our attention to the woman.
      What were we going to do with her? I must acknowledge that we were all of
      us in favor of shooting her. Hatred, and the wish to avenge Piedelot, had
      extinguished all pity in us, and we had forgotten that we were going to
      shoot a woman, but a woman reminded us of it, the captain''s wife; at her
      entreaties, therefore, we determined to keep her a prisoner.

The next day we heard that the armistice had been extended to the eastern
      part of France, and we had to put an end to our little campaign. Two of
      us, who belonged to the neighborhood, returned home, so there were only
      four of us, all told: the captain, his wife, and two men. We belonged to
      Besancon, which was still being besieged in spite of the armistice.

“Let us stop here,” said the captain. “I cannot believe
      that the war is going to end like this. The devil take it! Surely there
      are men still left in France; and now is the time to prove what they are
      made of. The spring is coming on, and the armistice is only a trap laid
      for the Prussians. During the time that it lasts, a new army will be
      raised, and some fine morning we shall fall upon them again. We shall be
      ready, and we have a hostage—let us remain here.”

We fixed our quarters there. It was terribly cold, and we did not go out
      much, and somebody had always to keep the female prisoner in sight.

She was sullen, and never said anything, or else spoke of her husband,
      whom the captain had killed. She looked at him continually with fierce
      eyes, and we felt that she was tortured by a wild longing for revenge.
      That seemed to us to be the most suitable punishment for the terrible
      torments that she had made Piedelot suffer, for impotent vengeance is such
      intense pain!

Alas! we who knew how to avenge our comrade ought to have thought that
      this woman would know how to avenge her husband, and have been on our
      guard. It is true that one of us kept watch every night, and that at first
      we tied her by a long rope to the great oak bench that was fastened to the
      wall. But, by and by, as she had never tried to escape, in spite of her
      hatred for us, we relaxed our extreme prudence, and allowed her to sleep
      somewhere else except on the bench, and without being tied. What had we to
      fear? She was at the end of the room, a man was on guard at the door, and
      between her and the sentinel the captain''s wife and two other men used to
      lie. She was alone and unarmed against four, so there could be no danger.

One night when we were asleep, and the captain was on guard, the lancer''s
      wife was lying more quietly in her corner than usual, and she had even
      smiled for the first time since she had been our prisoner during the
      evening. Suddenly, however, in the middle of the night, we were all
      awakened by a terrible cry. We got up, groping about, and at once stumbled
      over a furious couple who were rolling about and fighting on the ground.
      It was the captain and the lancer''s wife. We threw ourselves on them, and
      separated them in a moment. She was shouting and laughing, and he seemed
      to have the death rattle. All this took place in the dark. Two of us held
      her, and when a light was struck a terrible sight met our eyes. The
      captain was lying on the floor in a pool of blood, with an enormous gash
      in his throat, and his sword bayonet, that had been taken from his rifle,
      was sticking in the red, gaping wound. A few minutes afterward he died,
      without having been able to utter a word.

His wife did not shed a tear. Her eyes were dry, her throat was
      contracted, and she looked at the lancer''s wife steadfastly, and with a
      calm ferocity that inspired fear.

“This woman belongs to me,” she said to us suddenly. “You
      swore to me not a week ago to let me kill her as I chose, if she killed my
      husband; and you must keep your oath. You must fasten her securely to the
      fireplace, upright against the back of it, and then you can go where you
      like, but far from here. I will take my revenge on her myself. Leave the
      captain''s body, and we three, he, she and I, will remain here.”

We obeyed, and went away. She promised to write to us to Geneva, as we
      were returning thither.

Two days later I received the following letter, dated the day after we had
      left, that had been written at an inn on the high road:

“MY FRIEND: I am writing to you, according to my promise. For the
      moment I am at the inn, where I have just handed my prisoner over to a
      Prussian officer.

“I must tell you, my friend, that this poor woman has left two
      children in Germany. She had followed her husband, whom she adored, as she
      did not wish him to be exposed to the risks of war by himself, and as her
      children were with their grandparents. I have learned all this since
      yesterday, and it has turned my ideas of vengeance into more humane
      feelings. At the very moment when I felt pleasure in insulting this woman,
      and in threatening her with the most fearful torments, in recalling
      Piedelot, who had been burned alive, and in threatening her with a similar
      death, she looked at me coldly, and said:

“''What have you got to reproach me with, Frenchwoman? You think that
      you will do right in avenging your husband''s death, is not that so?''

“''Very well, then; in killing him, I did what you are going to do in
      burning me. I avenged my husband, for your husband killed him.''

“And in fact she did not seem to have lost courage. Her face was
      calm, and she looked at me without trembling, while I brought wood and
      dried leaves together, and feverishly threw on to them the powder from
      some cartridges, which was to make her funeral pile the more cruel.

“I hesitated in my thoughts of persecution for a moment. But the
      captain was there, pale and covered with blood, and he seemed to be
      looking at me with his large, glassy eyes, and I applied myself to my work
      again after kissing his pale lips. Suddenly, however, on raising my head,
      I saw that she was crying, and I felt rather surprised.

“She continued to sob, but stopping suddenly, she said to me in
      broken words and in a low voice:

“A shiver rare over me, for I guessed that this poor woman had some.
      She asked me to look in a pocketbook which was in her bosom, and in it I
      saw two photographs of quite young children, a boy and a girl, with those
      kind, gentle, chubby faces that German children have. In it there were
      also two locks of light hair and a letter in a large, childish hand, and
      beginning with German words which meant:

“''I could not restrain my tears, my dear friend, and so I untied
      her, and without venturing to look at the face of my poor dead husband,
      who was not to be avenged, I went with her as far as the inn. She is free;
      I have just left her, and she kissed me with tears. I am going upstairs to
      my husband; come as soon as possible, my dear friend, to look for our two
      bodies.''”

I set off with all speed, and when I arrived there was a Prussian patrol
      at the cottage; and when I asked what it all meant, I was told that there
      was a captain of francs-tireurs and his wife inside, both dead. I gave
      their names; they saw that I knew them, and I begged to be allowed to
      arrange their funeral.

“Somebody has already undertaken it,” was the reply. “Go
      in if you wish to, as you know them. You can settle about their funeral
      with their friend.”

I went in. The captain and his wife were lying side by side on a bed, and
      were covered by a sheet. I raised it, and saw that the woman had inflicted
      a similar wound in her throat to that from which her husband had died.

At the side of the bed there sat, watching and weeping, the woman who had
      been mentioned to me as their best friend. It was the lancer''s wife.

There was not a sound in the forest save the indistinct, fluttering sound
      of the snow falling on the trees. It had been snowing since noon; a little
      fine snow, that covered the branches as with frozen moss, and spread a
      silvery covering over the dead leaves in the ditches, and covered the
      roads with a white, yielding carpet, and made still more intense the
      boundless silence of this ocean of trees.

Before the door of the forester''s dwelling a young woman, her arms bare to
      the elbow, was chopping wood with a hatchet on a block of stone. She was
      tall, slender, strong-a true girl of the woods, daughter and wife of a
      forester.

“We are alone to-night, Berthine; you must come in. It is getting
      dark, and there may be Prussians or wolves about.”

“I''ve just finished, mother,” replied the young woman,
      splitting as she spoke an immense log of wood with strong, deft blows,
      which expanded her chest each time she raised her arms to strike. “Here
      I am; there''s no need to be afraid; it''s quite light still.”

Then she gathered up her sticks and logs, piled them in the chimney
      corner, went back to close the great oaken shutters, and finally came in,
      drawing behind her the heavy bolts of the door.

Her husband had been called upon to serve in the army at the beginning of
      the Prussian invasion, and the two women had remained alone with the old
      father, a keeper named Nicolas Pichon, sometimes called Long-legs, who
      refused obstinately to leave his home and take refuge in the town.

This town was Rethel, an ancient stronghold built on a rock. Its
      inhabitants were patriotic, and had made up their minds to resist the
      invaders, to fortify their native place, and, if need be, to stand a siege
      as in the good old days. Twice already, under Henri IV and under Louis
      XIV, the people of Rethel had distinguished themselves by their heroic
      defence of their town. They would do as much now, by gad! or else be
      slaughtered within their own walls.

They had, therefore, bought cannon and rifles, organized a militia, and
      formed themselves into battalions and companies, and now spent their time
      drilling all day long in the square. All-bakers, grocers, butchers,
      lawyers, carpenters, booksellers, chemists-took their turn at military
      training at regular hours of the day, under the auspices of Monsieur
      Lavigne, a former noncommissioned officer in the dragoons, now a draper,
      having married the daughter and inherited the business of Monsieur
      Ravaudan, Senior.

He had taken the rank of commanding officer in Rethel, and, seeing that
      all the young men had gone off to the war, he had enlisted all the others
      who were in favor of resisting an attack. Fat men now invariably walked
      the streets at a rapid pace, to reduce their weight and improve their
      breathing, and weak men carried weights to strengthen their muscles.

And they awaited the Prussians. But the Prussians did not appear. They
      were not far off, however, for twice already their scouts had penetrated
      as far as the forest dwelling of Nicolas Pichon, called Long-legs.

The old keeper, who could run like a fox, had come and warned the town.
      The guns had been got ready, but the enemy had not shown themselves.

Long-legs'' dwelling served as an outpost in the Aveline forest. Twice a
      week the old man went to the town for provisions and brought the citizens
      news of the outlying district.

On this particular day he had gone to announce the fact that a small
      detachment of German infantry had halted at his house the day before,
      about two o''clock in the afternoon, and had left again almost immediately.
      The noncommissioned officer in charge spoke French.

When the old man set out like this he took with him his dogs—two
      powerful animals with the jaws of lions-as a safeguard against the wolves,
      which were beginning to get fierce, and he left directions with the two
      women to barricade themselves securely within their dwelling as soon as
      night fell.

And Berthine was hanging her pot over the fire to warm the soup when she
      suddenly stood still, listening attentively to a sound that had reached
      her through the chimney.

Berthine took the heavy revolver from its hook, slipped it into the pocket
      of her skirt, and, putting her ear to the door, asked:

“My men and I have lost our way in the forest since morning. Open
      the door or I''ll break it down!”

The forester''s daughter had no choice; she shot back the heavy bolts,
      threw open the ponderous shutter, and perceived in the wan light of the
      snow six men, six Prussian soldiers, the same who had visited the house
      the day before.

“I lost my bearings,” replied the officer; “lost them
      completely. Then I recognized this house. I''ve eaten nothing since
      morning, nor my men either.”

“Never mind,” replied the soldier, who seemed a decent sort of
      fellow. “We won''t do you any harm, but you must give us something to
      eat. We are nearly dead with hunger and fatigue.”

Then entered, covered with snow, their helmets sprinkled with a
      creamy-looking froth, which gave them the appearance of meringues. They
      seemed utterly worn out.

“Sit down,” she said, “and I''ll make you some soup. You
      certainly look tired out, and no mistake.”

She put more water in the pot, added butter and potatoes; then, taking
      down a piece of bacon from a hook in the chimney earner, cut it in two and
      slipped half of it into the pot.

The six men watched her movements with hungry eyes. They had placed their
      rifles and helmets in a corner and waited for supper, as well behaved as
      children on a school bench.

The old mother had resumed her spinning, casting from time to time a
      furtive and uneasy glance at the soldiers. Nothing was to be heard save
      the humming of the wheel, the crackling of the fire, and the singing of
      the water in the pot.

But suddenly a strange noise—a sound like the harsh breathing of
      some wild animal sniffing under the door-startled the occupants of the
      room.

The German officer sprang toward the rifles. Berthine stopped him with a
      gesture, and said, smilingly:

The incredulous man wanted to see with his own eyes, and as soon as the
      door was opened he perceived two large grayish animals disappearing with
      long, swinging trot into the darkness.

The men devoured their meal voraciously, with mouths stretched to their
      ears that they might swallow the more. Their round eyes opened at the same
      time as their jaws, and as the soup coursed down their throats it made a
      noise like the gurgling of water in a rainpipe.

The two women watched in silence the movements of the big red beards. The
      potatoes seemed to be engulfed in these moving fleeces.

But, as they were thirsty, the forester''s daughter went down to the cellar
      to draw them some cider. She was gone some time. The cellar was small,
      with an arched ceiling, and had served, so people said, both as prison and
      as hiding-place during the Revolution. It was approached by means of a
      narrow, winding staircase, closed by a trap-door at the farther end of the
      kitchen.

When Berthine returned she was smiling mysteriously to herself. She gave
      the Germans her jug of cider.

The soldiers had finished eating, and were all six falling asleep as they
      sat round the table. Every now and then a forehead fell with a thud on the
      board, and the man, awakened suddenly, sat upright again.

“Go and lie down, all of you, round the fire. There''s lots of room
      for six. I''m going up to my room with my mother.”

And the two women went upstairs. They could be heard locking the door and
      walking about overhead for a time; then they were silent.

The Prussians lay down on the floor, with their feet to the fire and their
      heads resting on their rolled-up cloaks. Soon all six snored loudly and
      uninterruptedly in six different keys.

They had been sleeping for some time when a shot rang out so loudly that
      it seemed directed against the very walls of the house. The soldiers rose
      hastily. Two-then three-more shots were fired.

The door opened hastily, and Berthine appeared, barefooted and only half
      dressed, with her candle in her hand and a scared look on her face.

“There are the French,” she stammered; “at least two
      hundred of them. If they find you here they''ll burn the house down. For
      God''s sake, hurry down into the cellar, and don''t make a sound, whatever
      you do. If you make any noise we are lost.”

The young woman hurriedly raised the small, square trap-door, and the six
      men disappeared one after another down the narrow, winding staircase,
      feeling their way as they went.

But as soon as the spike of the last helmet was out of sight Berthine
      lowered the heavy oaken lid—thick as a wall, hard as steel,
      furnished with the hinges and bolts of a prison cell—shot the two
      heavy bolts, and began to laugh long and silently, possessed with a mad
      longing to dance above the heads of her prisoners.

They made no sound, inclosed in the cellar as in a strong-box, obtaining
      air only from a small, iron-barred vent-hole.

Berthine lighted her fire again, hung the pot over it, and prepared more
      soup, saying to herself:

Then she sat and waited. The heavy pendulum of the clock swung to and fro
      with a monotonous tick.

Every now and then the young woman cast an impatient glance at the dial-a
      glance which seemed to say:

But soon there was a sound of voices beneath her feet. Low, confused words
      reached her through the masonry which roofed the cellar. The Prussians
      were beginning to suspect the trick she had played them, and presently the
      officer came up the narrow staircase, and knocked at the trap-door.

He struck with the butt-end of his gun at the closed oaken door. But it
      would have resisted a battering-ram.

The forester''s daughter heard him go down the stairs again. Then the
      soldiers came one after another and tried their strength against the
      trapdoor. But, finding their efforts useless, they all returned to the
      cellar and began to talk among themselves.

The young woman heard them for a short time, then she rose, opened the
      door of the house; looked out into the night, and listened.

A sound of distant barking reached her ear. She whistled just as a
      huntsman would, and almost immediately two great dogs emerged from the
      darkness, and bounded to her side. She held them tight, and shouted at the
      top of her voice:

“Don''t go in front of the vent-hole!” shouted his daughter.
      “There are Prussians in the cellar!”

“They are the same as were here yesterday. They lost their way, and
      I''ve given them free lodgings in the cellar.”

She told the story of how she had alarmed them by firing the revolver, and
      had shut them up in the cellar.

“Go and fetch Monsieur Lavigne with his men,” she replied.
      “He''ll take them prisoners. He''ll be delighted.”

The old keeper sat down at the table, and began to eat his soup, having
      first filled two plates and put them on the floor for the dogs.

Long-legs set off a quarter of an hour later, and Berthine, with her head
      between her hands, waited.

The prisoners began to make themselves heard again. They shouted, called,
      and beat furiously with the butts of their muskets against the rigid
      trap-door of the cellar.

Then they fired shots through the vent-hole, hoping, no doubt, to be heard
      by any German detachment which chanced to be passing that way.

The forester''s daughter did not stir, but the noise irritated and unnerved
      her. Blind anger rose in her heart against the prisoners; she would have
      been only too glad to kill them all, and so silence them.

Her father had been gone an hour and a half. He must have reached the town
      by now. She conjured up a vision of him telling the story to Monsieur
      Lavigne, who grew pale with emotion, and rang for his servant to bring him
      his arms and uniform. She fancied she could bear the drum as it sounded
      the call to arms. Frightened faces appeared at the windows. The
      citizen-soldiers emerged from their houses half dressed, out of breath,
      buckling on their belts, and hurrying to the commandant''s house.

Then the troop of soldiers, with Long-legs at its head, set forth through
      the night and the snow toward the forest.

A nervous impatience possessed her. The minutes seemed interminable. Would
      the time never come?

At last the clock marked the moment she had fixed on for their arrival.
      And she opened the door to listen for their approach. She perceived a
      shadowy form creeping toward the house. She was afraid, and cried out. But
      it was her father.

Then he gave a shrill whistle. Soon a dark mass loomed up under the trees;
      the advance guard, composed of ten men.

At last the main body of the troop arrived, in all two hundred men, each
      carrying two hundred cartridges.

Monsieur Lavigne, in a state of intense excitement, posted them in such a
      fashion as to surround the whole house, save for a large space left vacant
      in front of the little hole on a level with the ground, through which the
      cellar derived its supply of air.

Still no response. For the space of twenty minutes Monsieur Lavigne called
      on this silent officer to surrender with bag and baggage, promising him
      that all lives should be spared, and that he and his men should be
      accorded military honors. But he could extort no sign, either of consent
      or of defiance. The situation became a puzzling one.

The citizen-soldiers kicked their heels in the snow, slapping their arms
      across their chest, as cabdrivers do, to warm themselves, and gazing at
      the vent-hole with a growing and childish desire to pass in front of it.

At last one of them took the risk-a man named Potdevin, who was fleet of
      limb. He ran like a deer across the zone of danger. The experiment
      succeeded. The prisoners gave no sign of life.

And another soldier crossed the open space before the dangerous vent-hole.
      Then this hazardous sport developed into a game. Every minute a man ran
      swiftly from one side to the other, like a boy playing baseball, kicking
      up the snow behind him as he ran. They had lighted big fires of dead wood
      at which to warm themselves, and the figures of the runners were illumined
      by the flames as they passed rapidly from the camp on the right to that on
      the left.

Maloison was a fat baker, whose corpulent person served to point many a
      joke among his comrades.

He hesitated. They chaffed him. Then, nerving himself to the effort, he
      set off at a little, waddling gait, which shook his fat paunch and made
      the whole detachment laugh till they cried.

He had accomplished about two-thirds of his journey when a long, crimson
      flame shot forth from the vent-hole. A loud report followed, and the fat
      baker fell face forward to the ground, uttering a frightful scream. No one
      went to his assistance. Then he was seen to drag himself, groaning, on
      all-fours through the snow until he was beyond danger, when he fainted.

After the first surprise and fright were over they laughed at him again.
      But Monsieur Lavigne appeared on the threshold of the forester''s dwelling.
      He had formed his plan of attack. He called in a loud voice “I want
      Planchut, the plumber, and his workmen.”

Next, with infinite precaution, he had a small round hole drilled in the
      trap-door; then, making a conduit with the troughs from the pump to this
      opening, he said, with an air of extreme satisfaction:

A shout of frenzied admiration, mingled with uproarious laughter, burst
      from his followers. And the commandant organized relays of men, who were
      to relieve one another every five minutes. Then he commanded:

And, the pump handle having been set in motion, a stream of water trickled
      throughout the length of the piping, and flowed from step to step down the
      cellar stairs with a gentle, gurgling sound.

An hour passed, then two, then three. The commandant, in a state of
      feverish agitation, walked up and down the kitchen, putting his ear to the
      ground every now and then to discover, if possible, what the enemy were
      doing and whether they would soon capitulate.

The enemy was astir now. They could be heard moving the casks about,
      talking, splashing through the water.

Then, about eight o''clock in the morning, a voice came from the vent-hole
      “I want to speak to the French officer.”

A rifle immediately protruded from the hole, and fell into the snow, then
      another and another, until all were disposed of. And the voice which had
      spoken before said:

Then, having filled the kitchen with armed and waiting soldiers, he slowly
      raised the oaken trapdoor.

Four heads appeared, soaking wet, four fair heads with long, sandy hair,
      and one after another the six Germans emerged—scared, shivering and
      dripping from head to foot.

They were seized and bound. Then, as the French feared a surprise, they
      set off at once in two convoys, one in charge of the prisoners, and the
      other conducting Maloison on a mattress borne on poles.

Monsieur Lavigne was decorated as a reward for having captured a Prussian
      advance guard, and the fat baker received the military medal for wounds
      received at the hands of the enemy.

Every Sunday, as soon as they were free, the little soldiers would go for
      a walk. They turned to the right on leaving the barracks, crossed
      Courbevoie with rapid strides, as though on a forced march; then, as the
      houses grew scarcer, they slowed down and followed the dusty road which
      leads to Bezons.

They were small and thin, lost in their ill-fitting capes, too large and
      too long, whose sleeves covered their hands; their ample red trousers fell
      in folds around their ankles. Under the high, stiff shako one could just
      barely perceive two thin, hollow-cheeked Breton faces, with their calm,
      naive blue eyes. They never spoke during their journey, going straight
      before them, the same idea in each one''s mind taking the place of
      conversation. For at the entrance of the little forest of Champioux they
      had found a spot which reminded them of home, and they did not feel happy
      anywhere else.

At the crossing of the Colombes and Chatou roads, when they arrived under
      the trees, they would take off their heavy, oppressive headgear and wipe
      their foreheads.

They always stopped for a while on the bridge at Bezons, and looked at the
      Seine. They stood there several minutes, bending over the railing,
      watching the white sails, which perhaps reminded them of their home, and
      of the fishing smacks leaving for the open.

As soon as they had crossed the Seine, they would purchase provisions at
      the delicatessen, the baker''s, and the wine merchant''s. A piece of
      bologna, four cents'' worth of bread, and a quart of wine, made up the
      luncheon which they carried away, wrapped up in their handkerchiefs. But
      as soon as they were out of the village their gait would slacken and they
      would begin to talk.

Before them was a plain with a few clumps of trees, which led to the
      woods, a little forest which seemed to remind them of that other forest at
      Kermarivan. The wheat and oat fields bordered on the narrow path, and Jean
      Kerderen said each time to Luc Le Ganidec:

And they went on, side by side, their minds full of dim memories of home.
      They saw the fields, the hedges, the forests, and beaches.

Each time they stopped near a large stone on the edge of the private
      estate, because it reminded them of the dolmen of Locneuven.

As soon as they reached the first clump of trees, Luc Le Ganidec would cut
      off a small stick, and, whittling it slowly, would walk on, thinking of
      the folks at home.

From time to time Luc would mention a name, or allude to some boyish prank
      which would give them food for plenty of thought. And the home country, so
      dear and so distant, would little by little gain possession of their
      minds, sending them back through space, to the well-known forms and
      noises, to the familiar scenery, with the fragrance of its green fields
      and sea air. They no longer noticed the smells of the city. And in their
      dreams they saw their friends leaving, perhaps forever, for the dangerous
      fishing grounds.

They were walking slowly, Luc Le Ganidec and Jean Kerderen, contented and
      sad, haunted by a sweet sorrow, the slow and penetrating sorrow of a
      captive animal which remembers the days of its freedom.

And when Luc had finished whittling his stick, they came to a little nook,
      where every Sunday they took their meal. They found the two bricks, which
      they had hidden in a hedge, and they made a little fire of dry branches
      and roasted their sausages on the ends of their knives.

When their last crumb of bread had been eaten and the last drop of wine
      had been drunk, they stretched themselves out on the grass side by side,
      without speaking, their half-closed eyes looking away in the distance,
      their hands clasped as in prayer, their red-trousered legs mingling with
      the bright colors of the wild flowers.

Towards noon they glanced, from time to time, towards the village of
      Bezons, for the dairy maid would soon be coming. Every Sunday she would
      pass in front of them on the way to milk her cow, the only cow in the
      neighborhood which was sent out to pasture.

Soon they would see the girl, coming through the fields, and it pleased
      them to watch the sparkling sunbeams reflected from her shining pail. They
      never spoke of her. They were just glad to see her, without understanding
      why.

She was a tall, strapping girl, freckled and tanned by the open air—a
      girl typical of the Parisian suburbs.

That was all. But the following Sunday, on seeing them, she smiled with
      the kindly smile of a woman who understood their shyness, and she asked:

She went on. But when she came back with her pail full of milk, she
      stopped before them and said:

Both were moved. Then not without difficulty, she poured some milk into
      the bottle in which they had brought their wine. Luc started to drink,
      carefully watching lest he should take more than his share. Then he passed
      the bottle to Jean. She stood before them, her hands on her hips, her pail
      at her feet, enjoying the pleasure that she was giving them. Then she went
      on, saying: “Well, bye-bye until next Sunday!”

For a long time they watched her tall form as it receded in the distance,
      blending with the background, and finally disappeared.

They were sorely perplexed by the problem of choosing something to bring
      to the dairy maid. Luc was in favor of bringing her some chitterlings; but
      Jean, who had a sweet tooth, thought that candy would be the best thing.
      He won, and so they went to a grocery to buy two sous'' worth, of red and
      white candies.

Jean was the first one to notice her. “There she is,” he said;
      and Luc answered: “Yes, there she is.”

Then she started to talk of simple things which might interest them; of
      the weather, of the crops, of her masters.

They didn''t dare to offer their candies, which were slowly melting in
      Jean''s pocket. Finally Luc, growing bolder, murmured:

Then Jean, blushing to the tips of his ears, reached in his pocket, and
      drawing out the little paper bag, handed it to her.

She began to eat the little sweet dainties. The two soldiers sat in front
      of her, moved and delighted.

They thought of her all through the week and often spoke of her: The
      following Sunday she sat beside them for a longer time.

The three of them sat there, side by side, their eyes looking far away in
      the distance, their hands clasped over their knees, and they told each
      other little incidents and little details of the villages where they were
      born, while the cow, waiting to be milked, stretched her heavy head toward
      the girl and mooed.

Soon the girl consented to eat with them and to take a sip of wine. Often
      she brought them plums pocket for plums were now ripe. Her presence
      enlivened the little Breton soldiers, who chattered away like two birds.

One Tuesday something unusual happened to Luc Le Ganidec; he asked for
      leave and did not return until ten o''clock at night.

The following Friday, Luc borrowed ten sons from one of his friends, and
      once more asked and obtained leave for several hours.

When he started out with Jean on Sunday he seemed queer, disturbed,
      changed. Kerderen did not understand; he vaguely suspected something, but
      he could not guess what it might be.

Soon the girl appeared. They watched her approach as they always did. When
      she was near, Luc arose and went towards her. She placed her pail on the
      ground and kissed him. She kissed him passionately, throwing her arms
      around his neck, without paying attention to Jean, without even noticing
      that he was there.

Poor Jean was dazed, so dazed that he could not understand. His mind was
      upset and his heart broken, without his even realizing why.

Jean was not looking at them. He understood now why his friend had gone
      out twice during the week. He felt the pain and the sting which treachery
      and deceit leave in their wake.

Jean followed them with his eyes. He saw them disappear side by side, the
      red trousers of his friend making a scarlet spot against the white road.
      It was Luc who sank the stake to which the cow was tethered. The girl
      stooped down to milk the cow, while he absent-mindedly stroked the
      animal''s glossy neck. Then they left the pail in the grass and disappeared
      in the woods.

Jean could no longer see anything but the wall of leaves through which
      they had passed. He was unmanned so that he did not have strength to
      stand. He stayed there, motionless, bewildered and grieving-simple,
      passionate grief. He wanted to weep, to run away, to hide somewhere, never
      to see anyone again.

Then he saw them coming back again. They were walking slowly, hand in
      hand, as village lovers do. Luc was carrying the pail.

After kissing him again, the girl went on, nodding carelessly to Jean. She
      did not offer him any milk that day.

The two little soldiers sat side by side, motionless as always, silent and
      quiet, their calm faces in no way betraying the trouble in their hearts.
      The sun shone down on them. From time to time they could hear the
      plaintive lowing of the cow. At the usual time they arose to return.

Luc was whittling a stick. Jean carried the empty bottle. He left it at
      the wine merchant''s in Bezons. Then they stopped on the bridge, as they
      did every Sunday, and watched the water flowing by.

Jean leaned over the railing, farther and farther, as though he had seen
      something in the stream which hypnotized him. Luc said to him:

He had hardly said the last word when Jean''s head carried away the rest of
      his body, and the little blue and red soldier fell like a shot and
      disappeared in the water.

Luc, paralyzed with horror, tried vainly to shout for help. In the
      distance he saw something move; then his friend''s head bobbed up out of
      the water only to disappear again.

Farther down he again noticed a hand, just one hand, which appeared and
      again went out of sight. That was all.

Luc ran back to the barracks, crazed, and with eyes and voice full of
      tears, he related the accident: “He leaned—he—he was
      leaning —so far over—that his head carried him away—and—he—fell
      —he fell——”

For a month the hot sun has been parching the fields. Nature is expanding
      beneath its rays; the fields are green as far as the eye can see. The big
      azure dome of the sky is unclouded. The farms of Normandy, scattered over
      the plains and surrounded by a belt of tall beeches, look, from a
      distance, like little woods. On closer view, after lowering the worm-eaten
      wooden bars, you imagine yourself in an immense garden, for all the
      ancient apple-trees, as gnarled as the peasants themselves, are in bloom.
      The sweet scent of their blossoms mingles with the heavy smell of the
      earth and the penetrating odor of the stables. It is noon. The family is
      eating under the shade of a pear tree planted in front of the door;
      father, mother, the four children, and the help—two women and three
      men are all there. All are silent. The soup is eaten and then a dish of
      potatoes fried with bacon is brought on.

From time to time one of the women gets up and takes a pitcher down to the
      cellar to fetch more cider.

The man, a big fellow about forty years old, is watching a grape vine,
      still bare, which is winding and twisting like a snake along the side of
      the house.

At last he says: “Father''s vine is budding early this year. Perhaps
      we may get something from it.”

It was during the war of 1870. The Prussians were occupying the whole
      country. General Faidherbe, with the Northern Division of the army, was
      opposing them.

The Prussians had established their headquarters at this farm. The old
      farmer to whom it belonged, Father Pierre Milon, had received and
      quartered them to the best of his ability.

For a month the German vanguard had been in this village. The French
      remained motionless, ten leagues away; and yet, every night, some of the
      Uhlans disappeared.

Of all the isolated scouts, of all those who were sent to the outposts, in
      groups of not more than three, not one ever returned.

They were picked up the next morning in a field or in a ditch. Even their
      horses were found along the roads with their throats cut.

The country was terrorized. Farmers were shot on suspicion, women were
      imprisoned; children were frightened in order to try and obtain
      information. Nothing could be ascertained.

But, one morning, Father Milon was found stretched out in the barn, with a
      sword gash across his face.

Two Uhlans were found dead about a mile and a half from the farm. One of
      them was still holding his bloody sword in his hand. He had fought, tried
      to defend himself. A court-martial was immediately held in the open air,
      in front of the farm. The old man was brought before it.

He was sixty-eight years old, small, thin, bent, with two big hands
      resembling the claws of a crab. His colorless hair was sparse and thin,
      like the down of a young duck, allowing patches of his scalp to be seen.
      The brown and wrinkled skin of his neck showed big veins which disappeared
      behind his jaws and came out again at the temples. He had the reputation
      of being miserly and hard to deal with.

They stood him up between four soldiers, in front of the kitchen table,
      which had been dragged outside. Five officers and the colonel seated
      themselves opposite him.

“Father Milon, since we have been here we have only had praise for
      you. You have always been obliging and even attentive to us. But to-day a
      terrible accusation is hanging over you, and you must clear the matter up.
      How did you receive that wound on your face?”

“Your silence accuses you, Father Milon. But I want you to answer
      me! Do you understand? Do you know who killed the two Uhlans who were
      found this morning near Calvaire?”

The colonel, surprised, was silent for a minute, looking straight at the
      prisoner. Father Milon stood impassive, with the stupid look of the
      peasant, his eyes lowered as though he were talking to the priest. Just
      one thing betrayed an uneasy mind; he was continually swallowing his
      saliva, with a visible effort, as though his throat were terribly
      contracted.

The man''s family, his son Jean, his daughter-in-law and his two
      grandchildren were standing a few feet behind him, bewildered and
      affrighted.

“Do you also know who killed all the scouts who have been found
      dead, for a month, throughout the country, every morning?”

This time the man seemed moved; the necessity for talking any length of
      time annoyed him visibly. He stammered:

“I warn you that you will have to tell me everything. You might as
      well make up your mind right away. How did you begin?”

The man cast a troubled look toward his family, standing close behind him.
      He hesitated a minute longer, and then suddenly made up his mind to obey
      the order.

“I was coming home one night at about ten o''clock, the night after
      you got here. You and your soldiers had taken more than fifty ecus worth
      of forage from me, as well as a cow and two sheep. I said to myself: ''As
      much as they take from you; just so much will you make them pay back.'' And
      then I had other things on my mind which I will tell you. Just then I
      noticed one of your soldiers who was smoking his pipe by the ditch behind
      the barn. I went and got my scythe and crept up slowly behind him, so that
      he couldn''t hear me. And I cut his head off with one single blow, just as
      I would a blade of grass, before he could say ''Booh!'' If you should look
      at the bottom of the pond, you will find him tied up in a potato-sack,
      with a stone fastened to it.

“I got an idea. I took all his clothes, from his boots to his cap,
      and hid them away in the little wood behind the yard.”

The old man stopped. The officers remained speechless, looking at each
      other. The questioning began again, and this is what they learned.

Once this murder committed, the man had lived with this one thought:
      “Kill the Prussians!” He hated them with the blind, fierce
      hate of the greedy yet patriotic peasant. He had his idea, as he said. He
      waited several days.

He was allowed to go and come as he pleased, because he had shown himself
      so humble, submissive and obliging to the invaders. Each night he saw the
      outposts leave. One night he followed them, having heard the name of the
      village to which the men were going, and having learned the few words of
      German which he needed for his plan through associating with the soldiers.

He left through the back yard, slipped into the woods, found the dead
      man''s clothes and put them on. Then he began to crawl through the fields,
      following along the hedges in order to keep out of sight, listening to the
      slightest noises, as wary as a poacher.

As soon as he thought the time ripe, he approached the road and hid behind
      a bush. He waited for a while. Finally, toward midnight, he heard the
      sound of a galloping horse. The man put his ear to the ground in order to
      make sure that only one horseman was approaching, then he got ready.

An Uhlan came galloping along, carrying dispatches. As he went, he was
      all eyes and ears. When he was only a few feet away, Father Milon dragged
      himself across the road, moaning: “Hilfe! Hilfe!” ( Help!
      Help!) The horseman stopped, and recognizing a German, he thought he was
      wounded and dismounted, coming nearer without any suspicion, and just as
      he was leaning over the unknown man, he received, in the pit of his
      stomach, a heavy thrust from the long curved blade of the sabre. He
      dropped without suffering pain, quivering only in the final throes. Then
      the farmer, radiant with the silent joy of an old peasant, got up again,
      and, for his own pleasure, cut the dead man''s throat. He then dragged the
      body to the ditch and threw it in.

The horse quietly awaited its master. Father Milon mounted him and started
      galloping across the plains.

About an hour later he noticed two more Uhlans who were returning home,
      side by side. He rode straight for them, once more crying “Hilfe!
      Hilfe!”

The Prussians, recognizing the uniform, let him approach without distrust.
      The old man passed between them like a cannon-ball, felling them both, one
      with his sabre and the other with a revolver.

Then he killed the horses, German horses! After that he quickly returned
      to the woods and hid one of the horses. He left his uniform there and
      again put on his old clothes; then going back into bed, he slept until
      morning.

For four days he did not go out, waiting for the inquest to be terminated;
      but on the fifth day he went out again and killed two more soldiers by the
      same stratagem. From that time on he did not stop. Each night he wandered
      about in search of adventure, killing Prussians, sometimes here and
      sometimes there, galloping through deserted fields, in the moonlight, a
      lost Uhlan, a hunter of men. Then, his task accomplished, leaving behind
      him the bodies lying along the roads, the old farmer would return and hide
      his horse and uniform.

He went, toward noon, to carry oats and water quietly to his mount, and he
      fed it well as he required from it a great amount of work.

But one of those whom he had attacked the night before, in defending
      himself slashed the old peasant across the face with his sabre.

However, he had killed them both. He had come back and hidden the horse
      and put on his ordinary clothes again; but as he reached home he began to
      feel faint, and had dragged himself as far as the stable, being unable to
      reach the house.

When he had finished his tale, he suddenly lifted up his head and looked
      proudly at the Prussian officers.

“Yes, I served my time. And then, you had killed my father, who was
      a soldier of the first Emperor. And last month you killed my youngest son,
      Francois, near Evreux. I owed you one for that; I paid. We are quits.”

“Eight for my father, eight for the boy—we are quits. I did
      not seek any quarrel with you. I don''t know you. I don''t even know where
      you come from. And here you are, ordering me about in my home as though it
      were your own. I took my revenge upon the others. I''m not sorry.”

And, straightening up his bent back, the old man folded his arms in the
      attitude of a modest hero.

The Prussians talked in a low tone for a long time. One of them, a
      captain, who had also lost his son the previous month, was defending the
      poor wretch. Then the colonel arose and, approaching Father Milon, said in
      a low voice:

But the man was not listening, and, his eyes fixed on the hated officer,
      while the wind played with the downy hair on his head, he distorted his
      slashed face, giving it a truly terrible expression, and, swelling out his
      chest, he spat, as hard as he could, right in the Prussian''s face.

In less than a minute the old man, still impassive, was pushed up against
      the wall and shot, looking smilingly the while toward Jean, his eldest
      son, his daughter-in-law and his two grandchildren, who witnessed this
      scene in dumb terror.

Paris had just heard of the disaster at Sedan. A republic had been
      declared. All France was wavering on the brink of this madness which
      lasted until after the Commune. From one end of the country to the other
      everybody was playing soldier.

Cap-makers became colonels, fulfilling the duties of generals; revolvers
      and swords were displayed around big, peaceful stomachs wrapped in flaming
      red belts; little tradesmen became warriors commanding battalions of
      brawling volunteers, and swearing like pirates in order to give themselves
      some prestige.

The sole fact of handling firearms crazed these people, who up to that
      time had only handled scales, and made them, without any reason, dangerous
      to all. Innocent people were shot to prove that they knew how to kill; in
      forests which had never seen a Prussian, stray dogs, grazing cows and
      browsing horses were killed.

Each one thought himself called upon to play a great part in military
      affairs. The cafes of the smallest villages, full of uniformed tradesmen,
      looked like barracks or hospitals.

The town of Canneville was still in ignorance of the maddening news from
      the army and the capital; nevertheless, great excitement had prevailed for
      the last month, the opposing parties finding themselves face to face.

The mayor, Viscount de Varnetot, a thin, little old man, a conservative,
      who had recently, from ambition, gone over to the Empire, had seen a
      determined opponent arise in Dr. Massarel, a big, full-blooded man, leader
      of the Republican party of the neighborhood, a high official in the local
      masonic lodge, president of the Agricultural Society and of the firemen''s
      banquet and the organizer of the rural militia which was to save the
      country.

In two weeks, he had managed to gather together sixty-three volunteers,
      fathers of families, prudent farmers and town merchants, and every morning
      he would drill them in the square in front of the town-hall.

When, perchance, the mayor would come to the municipal building, Commander
      Massarel, girt with pistols, would pass proudly in front of his troop, his
      sword in his hand, and make all of them cry: “Long live the
      Fatherland!” And it had been noticed that this cry excited the
      little viscount, who probably saw in it a menace, a threat, as well as the
      odious memory of the great Revolution.

On the morning of the fifth of September, the doctor, in full uniform, his
      revolver on the table, was giving a consultation to an old couple, a
      farmer who had been suffering from varicose veins for the last seven years
      and had waited until his wife had them also, before he would consult the
      doctor, when the postman brought in the paper.

M. Massarel opened it, grew pale, suddenly rose, and lifting his hands to
      heaven in a gesture of exaltation, began to shout at the top of his voice
      before the two frightened country folks:

And as the peasant resumed: “It started with the ants, which began
      to run up and down my legs—-” Dr. Massarel exclaimed:

“Shut up! I haven''t got time to bother with your nonsense. The
      Republic has been proclaimed, the emperor has been taken prisoner, France
      is saved! Long live the Republic!”

The servant, affrighted, hastened in; he was trying to talk so rapidly,
      that he could only stammer:

“My boots, my sword, my cartridge-box and the Spanish dagger which
      is on my night-table! Hasten!”

As the persistent peasant, taking advantage of a moment''s silence,
      continued, “I seemed to get big lumps which hurt me when I walk,”
      the physician, exasperated, roared:

As he equipped himself from head to foot, he gave a series of important
      orders to his servant:

“Run over to Lieutenant Picart and to Second Lieutenant Pommel, and
      tell them that I am expecting them here immediately. Also send me
      Torchebeuf with his drum. Quick! quick!”

When Celeste had gone out, he sat down and thought over the situation and
      the difficulties which he would have to surmount.

The three men arrived together in their working clothes. The commandant,
      who expected to see them in uniform, felt a little shocked.

“Don''t you people know anything? The emperor has been taken
      prisoner, the Republic has been proclaimed. We must act. My position is
      delicate, I might even say dangerous.”

“We must act and not hesitate; minutes count as hours in times like
      these. All depends on the promptness of our decision. You, Picart, go to
      the cure and order him to ring the alarm-bell, in order to get together
      the people, to whom I am going to announce the news. You, Torchebeuf beat
      the tattoo throughout the whole neighborhood as far as the hamlets of
      Gerisaie and Salmare, in order to assemble the militia in the public
      square. You, Pommel, get your uniform on quickly, just the coat and cap.
      We are going to the town-hall to demand Monsieur de Varnetot to surrender
      his powers to me. Do you understand?”

“Now carry out those orders quickly. I will go over to your house
      with you, Pommel, since we shall act together.”

Five minutes later, the commandant and his subordinates, armed to the
      teeth, appeared on the square, just as the little Viscount de Varnetot,
      his legs encased in gaiters as for a hunting party, his gun on his
      shoulder, was coming down the other street at double-quick time, followed
      by his three green-coated guards, their swords at their sides and their
      guns swung over their shoulders.

While the doctor stopped, bewildered, the four men entered the town-hall
      and closed the door behind them.

“They have outstripped us,” muttered the physician, “we
      must now wait for reenforcements. There is nothing to do for the present.”

“The priest refuses to obey,” he said. “He has even
      locked himself in the church with the sexton and beadle.”

On the other side of the square, opposite the white, tightly closed
      town-hall, stood the church, silent and dark, with its massive oak door
      studded with iron.

But just as the perplexed inhabitants were sticking their heads out of the
      windows or coming out on their doorsteps, the drum suddenly began to be
      heard, and Torchebeuf appeared, furiously beating the tattoo. He crossed
      the square running, and disappeared along the road leading to the fields.

The commandant drew his sword, and advanced alone to half way between the
      two buildings behind which the enemy had intrenched itself, and, waving
      his sword over his head, he roared with all his might:

The butcher, the baker and the druggist, much disturbed, were anxiously
      pulling down their shades and closing their shops. The grocer alone kept
      open.

However, the militia were arriving by degrees, each man in a different
      uniform, but all wearing a black cap with gold braid, the cap being the
      principal part of the outfit. They were armed with old rusty guns, the old
      guns which had hung for thirty years on the kitchen wall; and they looked
      a good deal like an army of tramps.

When he had about thirty men about him, the commandant, in a few words,
      outlined the situation to them. Then, turning to his staff: “Let us
      act,” he said.

“Lieutenant Picart, you will advance under the windows of this
      town-hall and summon Monsieur de Varnetot, in the name of the Republic, to
      hand the keys over to me.”

“You''re smart, you are. I don''t care to get killed, thank you. Those
      people in there shoot straight, don''t you forget it. Do your errands
      yourself.”

And, leaving his sword and his revolver in the hands of a soldier, he
      advanced slowly, his eye fastened on the windows, expecting any minute to
      see a gun trained on him.

When he was within a few feet of the building, the doors at both ends,
      leading into the two schools, opened and a flood of children ran out, boys
      from one side, girls from the ether, and began to play around the doctor,
      in the big empty square, screeching and screaming, and making so much
      noise that he could not make himself heard.

“Monsieur, you know that great events have just taken place which
      have changed the entire aspect of the government. The one which you
      represented no longer exists. The one which I represent is taking control.
      Under these painful, but decisive circumstances, I come, in the name of
      the new Republic, to ask you to turn over to me the office which you held
      under the former government.”

“Doctor, I am the mayor of Canneville, duly appointed, and I shall
      remain mayor of Canneville until I have been dismissed by a decree from my
      superiors. As mayor, I am in my place in the townhall, and here I stay.
      Anyhow, just try to get me out.”

The commandant returned to his troop. But before giving any information,
      eyeing Lieutenant Picart from head to foot, he exclaimed:

“You''re a great one, you are! You''re a fine specimen of manhood!
      You''re a disgrace to the army! I degrade you.”

Then the doctor hesitated. What could he do? Attack? But would his men
      obey orders? And then, did he have the right to do so?

An idea struck him. He ran to the telegraph office, opposite the
      town-hall, and sent off three telegrams:

He explained the situation, pointed out the danger which the town would
      run if it should remain in the hands of the royalist mayor; offered his
      faithful services, asked for orders and signed, putting all his titles
      after his name.

Then he returned to his battalion, and, drawing ten francs from his
      pocket, he cried: “Here, my friends, go eat and drink; only leave me
      a detachment of ten men to guard against anybody''s leaving the town-hall.”

But ex-Lieutenant Picart, who had been talking with the watchmaker, heard
      him; he began to laugh, and exclaimed: “By Jove, if they come out,
      it''ll give you a chance to get in. Otherwise I can see you standing out
      there for the rest of your life!”

In the afternoon, he disposed his men about the town as though they were
      in immediate danger of an ambush.

Several times he passed in front of the town-hall and of the church
      without noticing anything suspicious; the two buildings looked as though
      empty.

Everybody was talking about the affair. If the emperor were a prisoner,
      there must have been some kind of treason. They did not know exactly which
      of the republics had returned to power.

Toward nine o''clock, the doctor, alone, noiselessly approached the
      entrance of the public building, persuaded that the enemy must have gone
      to bed; and, as he was preparing to batter down the door with a pick-axe,
      the deep voice of a sentry suddenly called:

Armed militia occupied the square. All the citizens had gathered around
      this troop awaiting developments. Even neighboring villagers had come to
      look on.

Then the doctor, seeing that his reputation was at stake, resolved to put
      an end to the matter in one way or another; and he was about to take some
      measures, undoubtedly energetic ones, when the door of the telegraph
      station opened and the little servant of the postmistress appeared,
      holding in her hands two papers.

First she went to the commandant and gave him one of the despatches; then
      she crossed the empty square, confused at seeing the eyes of everyone on
      her, and lowering her head and running along with little quick steps, she
      went and knocked softly at the door of the barricaded house, as though
      ignorant of the fact that those behind it were armed.

The door opened wide enough to let a man''s hand reach out and receive the
      message; and the young girl returned blushing, ready to cry at being thus
      stared at by the whole countryside.

He was-triumphant; his heart was throbbing with joy and his hands were
      trembling; but Picart, his former subordinate, cried to him from a
      neighboring group:

“That''s all right; but supposing the others don''t come out, what
      good is the telegram going to do you?”

M. Massarel grew pale. He had not thought of that; if the others did not
      come out, he would now have to take some decisive step. It was not only
      his right, but his duty.

The door remained closed. What could he do? The crowd was growing and
      closing around the militia. They were laughing.

One thought especially tortured the doctor. If he attacked, he would have
      to march at the head of his men; and as, with him dead, all strife would
      cease, it was at him and him only that M. de Varnetot and his three guards
      would aim. And they were good shots, very good shots, as Picart had just
      said. But an idea struck him and, turning to Pommel, he ordered:

He would make a flag of truce, a white flag, at the sight of which the
      royalist heart of the mayor would perhaps rejoice.

Pommel returned with the cloth and a broom-stick. With some twine they
      completed the flag, and M. Massarel, grasping it in both hands and holding
      it in front of him, again advanced in the direction of the town-hall. When
      he was opposite the door, he once more called: “Monsieur de
      Varnetot!” The door suddenly opened and M. de Varnetot and his three
      guards appeared on the threshold.

Instinctively the doctor stepped back; then he bowed courteously to his
      enemy, and, choking with emotion, he announced: “I have come,
      monsieur, to make you acquainted with the orders which I have received.”

The nobleman, without returning the bow, answered: “I resign,
      monsieur, but understand that it is neither through fear of, nor obedience
      to, the odious government which has usurped the power.” And,
      emphasizing every word, he declared: “I do not wish to appear, for a
      single day, to serve the Republic. That''s all.”

Massarel, stunned, answered nothing; and M. de Varnetot, walking quickly,
      disappeared around the corner of the square, still followed by his escort.

The doctor, puffed up with pride, returned to the crowd. As soon as he was
      near enough to make himself heard, he cried: “Hurrah! hurrah!
      Victory crowns the Republic everywhere.”

The motionless villagers were looking at him without any signs of triumph
      shining in their eyes.

He looked at them, indignant at their indifference, thinking of what he
      could say or do in order to make an impression to electrify this calm
      peasantry, to fulfill his mission as a leader.

He had an inspiration and, turning to Pommel, he ordered: “Lieutenant,
      go get me the bust of the ex-emperor which is in the meeting room of the
      municipal council, and bring it here with a chair.”

The man presently reappeared, carrying on his right shoulder the plaster
      Bonaparte, and holding in his left hand a cane-seated chair.

M. Massarel went towards him, took the chair, placed the white bust on it,
      then stepping back a few steps, he addressed it in a loud voice:

“Tyrant, tyrant, you have fallen down in the mud. The dying
      fatherland was in its death throes under your oppression. Vengeful Destiny
      has struck you. Defeat and shame have pursued you; you fall conquered, a
      prisoner of the Prussians; and from the ruins of your crumbling empire,
      the young and glorious Republic arises, lifting from the ground your
      broken sword——”

He waited for applause. Not a sound greeted his listening ear. The
      peasants, nonplussed, kept silent; and the white, placid, well-groomed
      statue seemed to look at M. Massarel with its plaster smile, ineffaceable
      and sarcastic.

Thus they stood, face to face, Napoleon on his chair, the physician
      standing three feet away. Anger seized the commandant. What could he do to
      move this crowd and definitely to win over public opinion?

He happened to carry his hand to his stomach, and he felt, under his red
      belt, the butt of his revolver.

Not another inspiration, not another word cane to his mind. Then, he drew
      his weapon, stepped back a few steps and shot the former monarch.

The bullet made a little black hole: like a spot, in his forehead. No
      sensation was created. M. Massarel shot a second time and made a second
      hole, then a third time, then, without stopping, he shot off the three
      remaining shots. Napoleon''s forehead was blown away in a white powder, but
      his eyes, nose and pointed mustache remained intact.

Then in exasperation, the doctor kicked the chair over, and placing one
      foot on what remained of the bust in the position of a conqueror, he
      turned to the amazed public and yelled: “Thus may all traitors die!”

As no enthusiasm was, as yet, visible, the spectators appearing to be dumb
      with astonishment, the commandant cried to the militia: “You may go
      home now.” And he himself walked rapidly, almost ran, towards his
      house.

As soon as he appeared, the servant told him that some patients had been
      waiting in his office for over three hours. He hastened in. They were the
      same two peasants as a few days before, who had returned at daybreak,
      obstinate and patient.

Since the beginning of the campaign Lieutenant Lare had taken two cannon
      from the Prussians. His general had said: “Thank you, lieutenant,”
      and had given him the cross of honor.

As he was as cautious as he was brave, wary, inventive, wily and
      resourceful, he was entrusted with a hundred soldiers and he organized a
      company of scouts who saved the army on several occasions during a
      retreat.

But the invading army entered by every frontier like a surging sea. Great
      waves of men arrived one after the other, scattering all around them a
      scum of freebooters. General Carrel''s brigade, separated from its
      division, retreated continually, fighting each day, but remaining almost
      intact, thanks to the vigilance and agility of Lieutenant Lare, who seemed
      to be everywhere at the same moment, baffling all the enemy''s cunning,
      frustrating their plans, misleading their Uhlans and killing their
      vanguards.

“Lieutenant,” said he, “here is a dispatch from General
      de Lacere, who will be destroyed if we do not go to his aid by sunrise
      to-morrow. He is at Blainville, eight leagues from here. You will start at
      nightfall with three hundred men, whom you will echelon along the road. I
      will follow you two hours later. Study the road carefully; I fear we may
      meet a division of the enemy.”

It had been freezing hard for a week. At two o''clock it began to snow, and
      by night the ground was covered and heavy white swirls concealed objects
      hard by.

Two men walked alone as scouts about three yards ahead. Then came a
      platoon of ten men commanded by the lieutenant himself. The rest followed
      them in two long columns. To the right and left of the little band, at a
      distance of about three hundred feet on either side, some soldiers marched
      in pairs.

The snow, which was still falling, covered them with a white powder in the
      darkness, and as it did not melt on their uniforms, they were hardly
      distinguishable in the night amid the dead whiteness of the landscape.

From time to time they halted. One heard nothing but that indescribable,
      nameless flutter of falling snow—a sensation rather than a sound, a
      vague, ominous murmur. A command was given in a low tone and when the
      troop resumed its march it left in its wake a sort of white phantom
      standing in the snow. It gradually grew fainter and finally disappeared.
      It was the echelons who were to lead the army.

“Turn to the right,” said the lieutenant; “it is the
      Ronfi wood; the chateau is more to the left.”

Presently the command “Halt” was passed along. The detachment
      stopped and waited for the lieutenant, who, accompanied by only ten men,
      had undertaken a reconnoitering expedition to the chateau.

They advanced, creeping under the trees. Suddenly they all remained
      motionless. Around them was a dead silence. Then, quite near them, a
      little clear, musical young voice was heard amid the stillness of the
      wood.

All at once a woman''s shrill cry was heard through the darkness. Two
      prisoners were brought back, an old man and a young girl. The lieutenant
      questioned them, still in a low tone:

“Twelve Uhlans passed by this evening. They shot three keepers and
      hanged the gardener. I was alarmed on account of the little one.”

They rejoined the column and resumed their march across country. The old
      man walked in silence beside the lieutenant, his daughter walking at his
      side. All at once she stopped.

And she sat down. She was shaking with cold and seemed about to lose
      consciousness. Her father wanted to carry her, but he was too old and too
      weak.

“Lieutenant,” said he, sobbing, “we shall only impede
      your march. France before all. Leave us here.”

The officer had given a command. Some men had started off. They came back
      with branches they had cut, and in a minute a litter was ready. The whole
      detachment had joined them by this time.

Two hundred capes were taken off. The young girl was wrapped up in these
      warm soldiers'' capes, gently laid in the litter, and then four'' hardy
      shoulders lifted her up, and like an Eastern queen borne by her slaves she
      was placed in the center of the detachment of soldiers, who resumed their
      march with more energy, more courage, more cheerfulness, animated by the
      presence of a woman, that sovereign inspiration that has stirred the old
      French blood to so many deeds of valor.

At the end of an hour they halted again and every one lay down in the
      snow. Over yonder on the level country a big, dark shadow was moving. It
      looked like some weird monster stretching itself out like a serpent, then
      suddenly coiling itself into a mass, darting forth again, then back, and
      then forward again without ceasing. Some whispered orders were passed
      around among the soldiers, and an occasional little, dry, metallic click
      was heard. The moving object suddenly came nearer, and twelve Uhlans were
      seen approaching at a gallop, one behind the other, having lost their way
      in the darkness. A brilliant flash suddenly revealed to them two hundred
      men lying on the ground before them. A rapid fire was heard, which died
      away in the snowy silence, and all the twelve fell to the ground, their
      horses with them.

They made another halt; some conferences took place. It had stopped
      snowing. A cold wind was driving the clouds, and innumerable stars were
      sparkling in the sky behind them, gradually paling in the rosy light of
      dawn.

A staff officer came forward to receive the detachment. But when he asked
      who was being carried in the litter, the form stirred; two little hands
      moved aside the big blue army capes and, rosy as the dawn, with two eyes
      that were brighter than the stars that had just faded from sight, and a
      smile as radiant as the morn, a dainty face appeared.

The soldiers, wild with delight, clapped their hands and bore the young
      girl in triumph into the midst of the camp, that was just getting to arms.
      Presently General Carrel arrived on the scene. At nine o''clock the
      Prussians made an attack. They beat a retreat at noon.

That evening, as Lieutenant Lare, overcome by fatigue, was sleeping on a
      bundle of straw, he was sent for by the general. He found the commanding
      officer in his tent, chatting with the old man whom they had come across
      during the night. As soon as he entered the tent the general took his
      hand, and addressing the stranger, said:

“My dear comte, this is the young man of whom you were telling me
      just now; he is one of my best officers.”

“My dear lieutenant, you have saved my daughter''s life. I have only
      one way of thanking you. You may come in a few months to tell me—if
      you like her.”

One year later, on the very same day, Captain Lare and Miss
      Louise-Hortense-Genevieve de Ronfi-Quedissac were married in the church of
      St. Thomas Aquinas.

She brought a dowry of six thousand francs, and was said to be the
      prettiest bride that had been seen that year.

The shadows of a balmy night were slowly falling. The women remained in
      the drawing-room of the villa. The men, seated, or astride of garden
      chairs, were smoking outside the door of the house, around a table laden
      with cups and liqueur glasses.

Their lighted cigars shone like eyes in the darkness, which was gradually
      becoming more dense. They had been talking about a frightful accident
      which had occurred the night before—two men and three women drowned
      in the river before the eyes of the guests.

“Horrible, that well-known word, means much more than terrible. A
      frightful accident like this affects, upsets, terrifies; it does not
      horrify. In order that we should experience horror, something more is
      needed than emotion, something more than the spectacle of a dreadful
      death; there must be a shuddering sense of mystery, or a sensation of
      abnormal terror, more than natural. A man who dies, even under the most
      tragic circumstances, does not excite horror; a field of battle is not
      horrible; blood is not horrible; the vilest crimes are rarely horrible.

“It was during the war of 1870. We were retreating toward
      Pont-Audemer, after having passed through Rouen. The army, consisting of
      about twenty thousand men, twenty thousand routed men, disbanded,
      demoralized, exhausted, were going to disband at Havre.

“The earth was covered with snow. The night was falling. They had
      not eaten anything since the day before. They were fleeing rapidly, the
      Prussians not being far off.

“All the Norman country, sombre, dotted with the shadows of the
      trees surrounding the farms, stretched out beneath a black, heavy,
      threatening sky.

“Nothing else could be heard in the wan twilight but the confused
      sound, undefined though rapid, of a marching throng, an endless tramping,
      mingled with the vague clink of tin bowls or swords. The men, bent,
      round-shouldered, dirty, in many cases even in rags, dragged themselves
      along, hurried through the snow, with a long, broken-backed stride.

“The skin of their hands froze to the butt ends of their muskets,
      for it was freezing hard that night. I frequently saw a little soldier
      take off his shoes in order to walk barefoot, as his shoes hurt his weary
      feet; and at every step he left a track of blood. Then, after some time,
      he would sit down in a field for a few minutes'' rest, and he never got up
      again. Every man who sat down was a dead man.

“Should we have left behind us those poor, exhausted soldiers, who
      fondly counted on being able to start afresh as soon as they had somewhat
      refreshed their stiffened legs? But scarcely had they ceased to move, and
      to make their almost frozen blood circulate in their veins, than an
      unconquerable torpor congealed them, nailed them to the ground, closed
      their eyes, and paralyzed in one second this overworked human mechanism.
      And they gradually sank down, their foreheads on their knees, without,
      however, falling over, for their loins and their limbs became as hard and
      immovable as wood, impossible to bend or to stand upright.

“And the rest of us, more robust, kept straggling on, chilled to the
      marrow, advancing by a kind of inertia through the night, through the
      snow, through that cold and deadly country, crushed by pain, by defeat, by
      despair, above all overcome by the abominable sensation of abandonment, of
      the end, of death, of nothingness.

“I saw two gendarmes holding by the arm a curious-looking little
      man, old, beardless, of truly surprising aspect.

“They were looking for an officer, believing that they had caught a
      spy. The word ''spy'' at once spread through the midst of the stragglers,
      and they gathered in a group round the prisoner. A voice exclaimed: ''He
      must be shot!'' And all these soldiers who were falling from utter
      prostration, only holding themselves on their feet by leaning on their
      guns, felt all of a sudden that thrill of furious and bestial anger which
      urges on a mob to massacre.

“I wanted to speak. I was at that time in command of a battalion;
      but they no longer recognized the authority of their commanding officers;
      they would even have shot me.

“One of the gendarmes said: ''He has been following us for the three
      last days. He has been asking information from every one about the
      artillery.''”

“He stammered out some words in some unintelligible dialect. He was,
      indeed, a strange being, with narrow shoulders, a sly look, and such an
      agitated air in my presence that I really no longer doubted that he was a
      spy. He seemed very aged and feeble. He kept looking at me from under his
      eyes with a humble, stupid, crafty air.

“I had not ceased speaking when a terrible shove threw me on my
      back, and in a second I saw the man seized by the furious soldiers, thrown
      down, struck, dragged along the side of the road, and flung against a
      tree. He fell in the snow, nearly dead already.

“And immediately they shot him. The soldiers fired at him, reloaded
      their guns, fired again with the desperate energy of brutes. They fought
      with each other to have a shot at him, filed off in front of the corpse,
      and kept on firing at him, as people at a funeral keep sprinkling holy
      water in front of a coffin.

“And all along the horizon I heard the great noise of this
      panic-stricken army in full flight.

“A panic, the result of these shots fired at this vagabond, had
      filled his very executioners with terror; and, without realizing that they
      were themselves the originators of the scare, they fled and disappeared in
      the darkness.

“I remained alone with the corpse, except for the two gendarmes
      whose duty compelled them to stay with me.

“''He must be searched,'' I said. And I handed them a box of taper
      matches which I had in my pocket. One of the soldiers had another box. I
      was standing between the two.

“The first match went out; we lighted a second. The man continued,
      as he turned out his pockets:

“''A horn-handled pocketknife, check handkerchief, a snuffbox, a bit
      of pack thread, a piece of bread.''

“The second match went out; we lighted a third. The gendarme, after
      having felt the corpse for a long time, said:

“And in order that the two soldiers might help each other in this
      task, I stood between them to hold the lighted match. By the rapid and
      speedily extinguished flame of the match, I saw them take off the garments
      one by one, and expose to view that bleeding bundle of flesh, still warm,
      though lifeless.

“I cannot describe to you the strange and poignant sensation of pain
      that moved my heart. I could not believe it, and I knelt down in the snow
      before this shapeless pulp of flesh to see for myself: it was a woman.

“The two gendarmes, speechless and stunned, waited for me to give my
      opinion on the matter. But I did not know what to think, what theory to
      adopt.

“And I, who had seen some very terrible things in my time, began to
      cry. And I felt, in the presence of this corpse, on that icy cold night,
      in the midst of that gloomy plain; at the sight of this mystery, at the
      sight of this murdered stranger, the meaning of that word ''horror.''

“I had the same sensation last year, while interrogating one of the
      survivors of the Flatters Mission, an Algerian sharpshooter.

“You know the details of that atrocious drama. It is possible,
      however, that you are unacquainted with one of them.

“The colonel travelled through the desert into the Soudan, and
      passed through the immense territory of the Touaregs, who, in that great
      ocean of sand which stretches from the Atlantic to Egypt and from the
      Soudan to Algeria, are a kind of pirates, resembling those who ravaged the
      seas in former days.

“Now, one day we encamped in the middle of the desert, and the Arabs
      declared that, as the spring was still some distance away, they would go
      with all their camels to look for water.

“One man alone warned the colonel that he had been betrayed.
      Flatters did not believe this, and accompanied the convoy with the
      engineers, the doctors, and nearly all his officers.

“The captain of the Arab Intelligence Department at Ouargla, who had
      remained in the camp, took command of the survivors, spahis and
      sharpshooters, and they began to retreat, leaving behind them the baggage
      and provisions, for want of camels to carry them.

“Then they started on their journey through this solitude without
      shade and boundless, beneath the devouring sun, which burned them from
      morning till night.

“One tribe came to tender its submission and brought dates as a
      tribute. The dates were poisoned. Nearly all the Frenchmen died, and,
      among them, the last officer.

“There now only remained a few spahis with their quartermaster,
      Pobeguin, and some native sharpshooters of the Chambaa tribe. They had
      still two camels left. They disappeared one night, along with two, Arabs.

“Then the survivors understood that they would be obliged to eat
      each other, and as soon as they discovered the flight of the two men with
      the two camels, those who remained separated, and proceeded to march, one
      by one, through the soft sand, under the glare of a scorching sun, at a
      distance of more than a gunshot from each other.

“So they went on all day, and when they reached a spring each of
      them came to drink at it in turn, as soon as each solitary marcher had
      moved forward the number of yards arranged upon. And thus they continued
      marching the whole day, raising everywhere they passed, in that level,
      burnt up expanse, those little columns of dust which, from a distance,
      indicate those who are trudging through the desert.

“But one morning one of the travellers suddenly turned round and
      approached the man behind him. And they all stopped to look.

“The man toward whom the famished soldier drew near did not flee,
      but lay flat on the ground, and took aim at the one who was coming toward
      him. When he believed he was within gunshot, he fired. The other was not
      hit, and he continued then to advance, and levelling his gun, in turn, he
      killed his comrade.

“Then from all directions the others rushed to seek their share. And
      he who had killed the fallen man, cutting the corpse into pieces,
      distributed it.

“And they once more placed themselves at fixed distances, these
      irreconcilable allies, preparing for the next murder which would bring
      them together.

“For two days they lived on this human flesh which they divided
      between them. Then, becoming famished again, he who had killed the first
      man began killing afresh. And again, like a butcher, he cut up the corpse
      and offered it to his comrades, keeping only his own portion of it.

“The last Frenchman, Pobeguin, was massacred at the side of a well,
      the very night before the supplies arrived.

I was sitting on the pier of the small port of Obernon, near the village
      of Salis, looking at Antibes, bathed in the setting sun. I had never
      before seen anything so wonderful and so beautiful.

The small town, enclosed by its massive ramparts, built by Monsieur de
      Vauban, extended into the open sea, in the middle of the immense Gulf of
      Nice. The great waves, coming in from the ocean, broke at its feet,
      surrounding it with a wreath of foam; and beyond the ramparts the houses
      climbed up the hill, one after the other, as far as the two towers, which
      rose up into the sky, like the peaks of an ancient helmet. And these two
      towers were outlined against the milky whiteness of the Alps, that
      enormous distant wall of snow which enclosed the entire horizon.

Between the white foam at the foot of the walls and the white snow on the
      sky-line the little city, dazzling against the bluish background of the
      nearest mountain ranges, presented to the rays of the setting sun a
      pyramid of red-roofed houses, whose facades were also white, but so
      different one from another that they seemed to be of all tints.

And the sky above the Alps was itself of a blue that was almost white, as
      if the snow had tinted it; some silvery clouds were floating just over the
      pale summits, and on the other side of the gulf Nice, lying close to the
      water, stretched like a white thread between the sea and the mountain. Two
      great sails, driven by a strong breeze, seemed to skim over the waves. I
      looked upon all this, astounded.

This view was one of those sweet, rare, delightful things that seem to
      permeate you and are unforgettable, like the memory of a great happiness.
      One sees, thinks, suffers, is moved and loves with the eyes. He who can
      feel with the eye experiences the same keen, exquisite and deep pleasure
      in looking at men and things as the man with the delicate and sensitive
      ear, whose soul music overwhelms.

“I have seen Mont Saint-Michel, that monstrous granite jewel, rise
      out of the sand at sunrise.

“I have seen, in the Sahara, Lake Raianechergui, fifty kilometers
      long, shining under a moon as brilliant as our sun and breathing up toward
      it a white cloud, like a mist of milk.

“I have seen, in the Lipari Islands, the weird sulphur crater of the
      Volcanello, a giant flower which smokes and burns, an enormous yellow
      flower, opening out in the midst of the sea, whose stem is a volcano.

“But I have seen nothing more wonderful than Antibes, standing
      against the Alps in the setting sun.

“And I know not how it is that memories of antiquity haunt me;
      verses of Homer come into my mind; this is a city of the ancient East, a
      city of the odyssey; this is Troy, although Troy was very far from the
      sea.”

M. Martini drew the Sarty guide-book out of his pocket and read: “This
      city was originally a colony founded by the Phocians of Marseilles, about
      340 B.C. They gave it the Greek name of Antipolis, meaning counter-city,
      city opposite another, because it is in fact opposite to Nice, another
      colony from Marseilles.

“After the Gauls were conquered, the Romans turned Antibes into a
      municipal city, its inhabitants receiving the rights of Roman citizenship.

“I don''t care what she was. I tell you that I see down there a city
      of the Odyssey. The coast of Asia and the coast of Europe resemble each
      other in their shores, and there is no city on the other coast of the
      Mediterranean which awakens in me the memories of the heroic age as this
      one does.”

A footstep caused me to turn my head; a woman, a large, dark woman, was
      walking along the road which skirts the sea in going to the cape.

“That is Madame Parisse, you know,” muttered Monsieur Martini,
      dwelling on the final syllable.

No, I did not know, but that name, mentioned carelessly, that name of the
      Trojan shepherd, confirmed me in my dream.

I assured him that I did not know it, and I looked after the woman, who
      passed by without seeing us, dreaming, walking with steady and slow step,
      as doubtless the ladies of old walked.

Mademoiselle Combelombe was married, one year before the war of 1870, to
      Monsieur Parisse, a government official. She was then a handsome young
      girl, as slender and lively as she has now become stout and sad.

Unwillingly she had accepted Monsieur Parisse, one of those little fat men
      with short legs, who trip along, with trousers that are always too large.

After the war Antibes was garrisoned by a single battalion commanded by
      Monsieur Jean de Carmelin, a young officer decorated during the war, and
      who had just received his four stripes.

As he found life exceedingly tedious in this fortress this stuffy
      mole-hole enclosed by its enormous double walls, he often strolled out to
      the cape, a kind of park or pine wood shaken by all the winds from the
      sea.

There he met Madame Parisse, who also came out in the summer evenings to
      get the fresh air under the trees. How did they come to love each other?
      Who knows? They met, they looked at each other, and when out of sight they
      doubtless thought of each other. The image of the young woman with the
      brown eyes, the black hair, the pale skin, this fresh, handsome
      Southerner, who displayed her teeth in smiling, floated before the eyes of
      the officer as he continued his promenade, chewing his cigar instead of
      smoking it; and the image of the commanding officer, in his close-fitting
      coat, covered with gold lace, and his red trousers, and a little blond
      mustache, would pass before the eyes of Madame Parisse, when her husband,
      half shaven and ill-clad, short-legged and big-bellied, came home to
      supper in the evening.

As they met so often, they perhaps smiled at the next meeting; then,
      seeing each other again and again, they felt as if they knew each other.
      He certainly bowed to her. And she, surprised, bowed in return, but very,
      very slightly, just enough not to appear impolite. But after two weeks she
      returned his salutation from a distance, even before they were side by
      side.

He spoke to her. Of what? Doubtless of the setting sun. They admired it
      together, looking for it in each other''s eyes more often than on the
      horizon. And every evening for two weeks this was the commonplace and
      persistent pretext for a few minutes'' chat.

Then they ventured to take a few steps together, talking of anything that
      came into their minds, but their eyes were already saying to each other a
      thousand more intimate things, those secret, charming things that are
      reflected in the gentle emotion of the glance, and that cause the heart to
      beat, for they are a better revelation of the soul than the spoken ward.

And then he would take her hand, murmuring those words which the woman
      divines, without seeming to hear them.

And it was agreed between them that they would love each other without
      evidencing it by anything sensual or brutal.

She would have remained indefinitely at this stage of intimacy, but he
      wanted more. And every day he urged her more hotly to give in to his
      ardent desire.

But one evening she said to him casually: “My husband has just gone
      to Marseilles. He will be away four days.”

Jean de Carmelin threw himself at her feet, imploring her to open her door
      to him that very night at eleven o''clock. But she would not listen to him,
      and went home, appearing to be annoyed.

The commandant was in a bad humor all the evening, and the next morning at
      dawn he went out on the ramparts in a rage, going from one exercise field
      to the other, dealing out punishment to the officers and men as one might
      fling stones into a crowd,

On going in to breakfast he found an envelope under his napkin with these
      four words: “To-night at ten.” And he gave one hundred sous
      without any reason to the waiter.

The day seemed endless to him. He passed part of it in curling his hair
      and perfuming himself.

As he was sitting down to the dinner-table another envelope was handed to
      him, and in it he found the following telegram:

The commandant let loose such a vehement oath that the waiter dropped the
      soup-tureen on the floor.

What should he do? He certainly wanted her, that very, evening at whatever
      cost; and he would have her. He would resort to any means, even to
      arresting and imprisoning the husband. Then a mad thought struck him.
      Calling for paper, he wrote the following note:

Toward eight o''clock he sent for Captain Gribois, the second in command,
      and said, rolling between his fingers the crumpled telegram of Monsieur
      Parisse:

“Captain, I have just received a telegram of a very singular nature,
      which it is impossible for me to communicate to you. You will immediately
      have all the gates of the city closed and guarded, so that no one, mind
      me, no one, will either enter or leave before six in the morning. You will
      also have men patrol the streets, who will compel the inhabitants to
      retire to their houses at nine o''clock. Any one found outside beyond that
      time will be conducted to his home ''manu militari''. If your men meet me
      this night they will at once go out of my way, appearing not to know me.
      You understand me?”

The train from Marseilles arrived at the station at nine o''clock sharp,
      left two passengers on the platform and went on toward Nice.

One of them, tall and thin, was Monsieur Saribe, the oil merchant, and the
      other, short and fat, was Monsieur Parisse.

But on arriving at the gate of the port the guards crossed their bayonets,
      commanding them to retire.

Frightened, surprised, cowed with astonishment, they retired to
      deliberate; then, after having taken counsel one with the other, they came
      back cautiously to parley, giving their names.

But the soldiers evidently had strict orders, for they threatened to
      shoot; and the two scared travellers ran off, throwing away their valises,
      which impeded their flight.

Making the tour of the ramparts, they presented themselves at the gate on
      the route to Cannes. This likewise was closed and guarded by a menacing
      sentinel. Messrs. Saribe and Parisse, like the prudent men they were,
      desisted from their efforts and went back to the station for shelter,
      since it was not safe to be near the fortifications after sundown.

The station agent, surprised and sleepy, permitted them to stay till
      morning in the waiting-room.

And they sat there side by side, in the dark, on the green velvet sofa,
      too scared to think of sleeping.

At half-past six in the morning they were informed that the gates were
      open and that people could now enter Antibes.

When they passed through the gates of the city, still somewhat anxious,
      the Commandant de Carmelin, with sly glance and mustache curled up, came
      himself to look at them and question them.

Then he bowed to them politely, excusing himself for having caused them a
      bad night. But he had to carry out orders.

The people of Antibes were scared to death. Some spoke of a surprise
      planned by the Italians, others of the landing of the prince imperial and
      others again believed that there was an Orleanist conspiracy. The truth
      was suspected only later, when it became known that the battalion of the
      commandant had been sent away, to a distance and that Monsieur de Carmelin
      had been severely punished.

Monsieur Martini had finished his story. Madame Parisse returned, her
      promenade being ended. She passed gravely near me, with her eyes fixed on
      the Alps, whose summits now gleamed rosy in the last rays of the setting
      sun.

I longed to speak to her, this poor, sad woman, who would ever be thinking
      of that night of love, now long past, and of the bold man who for the sake
      of a kiss from her had dared to put a city into a state of siege and to
      compromise his whole future.

And to-day he had probably forgotten her, if he did not relate this
      audacious, comical and tender farce to his comrades over their cups.

Had she seen him again? Did she still love him? And I thought: Here is an
      instance of modern love, grotesque and yet heroic. The Homer who should
      sing of this new Helen and the adventure of her Menelaus must be gifted
      with the soul of a Paul de Kock. And yet the hero of this deserted woman
      was brave, daring, handsome, strong as Achilles and more cunning than
      Ulysses.

Major Graf Von Farlsberg, the Prussian commandant, was reading his
      newspaper as he lay back in a great easy-chair, with his booted feet on
      the beautiful marble mantelpiece where his spurs had made two holes, which
      had grown deeper every day during the three months that he had been in the
      chateau of Uville.

A cup of coffee was smoking on a small inlaid table, which was stained
      with liqueur, burned by cigars, notched by the penknife of the victorious
      officer, who occasionally would stop while sharpening a pencil, to jot
      down figures, or to make a drawing on it, just as it took his fancy.

When he had read his letters and the German newspapers, which his orderly
      had brought him, he got up, and after throwing three or four enormous
      pieces of green wood on the fire, for these gentlemen were gradually
      cutting down the park in order to keep themselves warm, he went to the
      window. The rain was descending in torrents, a regular Normandy rain,
      which looked as if it were being poured out by some furious person, a
      slanting rain, opaque as a curtain, which formed a kind of wall with
      diagonal stripes, and which deluged everything, a rain such as one
      frequently experiences in the neighborhood of Rouen, which is the
      watering-pot of France.

For a long time the officer looked at the sodden turf and at the swollen
      Andelle beyond it, which was overflowing its banks; he was drumming a
      waltz with his fingers on the window-panes, when a noise made him turn
      round. It was his second in command, Captain Baron van Kelweinstein.

The major was a giant, with broad shoulders and a long, fan-like beard,
      which hung down like a curtain to his chest. His whole solemn person
      suggested the idea of a military peacock, a peacock who was carrying his
      tail spread out on his breast. He had cold, gentle blue eyes, and a scar
      from a swordcut, which he had received in the war with Austria; he was
      said to be an honorable man, as well as a brave officer.

The captain, a short, red-faced man, was tightly belted in at the waist,
      his red hair was cropped quite close to his head, and in certain lights he
      almost looked as if he had been rubbed over with phosphorus. He had lost
      two front teeth one night, though he could not quite remember how, and
      this sometimes made him speak unintelligibly, and he had a bald patch on
      top of his head surrounded by a fringe of curly, bright golden hair, which
      made him look like a monk.

The commandant shook hands with him and drank his cup of coffee (the sixth
      that morning), while he listened to his subordinate''s report of what had
      occurred; and then they both went to the window and declared that it was a
      very unpleasant outlook. The major, who was a quiet man, with a wife at
      home, could accommodate himself to everything; but the captain, who led a
      fast life, who was in the habit of frequenting low resorts, and enjoying
      women''s society, was angry at having to be shut up for three months in
      that wretched hole.

There was a knock at the door, and when the commandant said, “Come
      in,” one of the orderlies appeared, and by his mere presence
      announced that breakfast was ready. In the dining-room they met three
      other officers of lower rank—a lieutenant, Otto von Grossling, and
      two sub-lieutenants, Fritz Scheuneberg and Baron von Eyrick, a very short,
      fair-haired man, who was proud and brutal toward men, harsh toward
      prisoners and as explosive as gunpowder.

Since he had been in France his comrades had called him nothing but
      Mademoiselle Fifi. They had given him that nickname on account of his
      dandified style and small waist, which looked as if he wore corsets; of
      his pale face, on which his budding mustache scarcely showed, and on
      account of the habit he had acquired of employing the French expression,
      ''Fi, fi donc'', which he pronounced with a slight whistle when he wished to
      express his sovereign contempt for persons or things.

The dining-room of the chateau was a magnificent long room, whose fine old
      mirrors, that were cracked by pistol bullets, and whose Flemish tapestry,
      which was cut to ribbons, and hanging in rags in places from sword-cuts,
      told too well what Mademoiselle Fifi''s occupation was during his spare
      time.

There were three family portraits on the walls a steel-clad knight, a
      cardinal and a judge, who were all smoking long porcelain pipes, which had
      been inserted into holes in the canvas, while a lady in a long, pointed
      waist proudly exhibited a pair of enormous mustaches, drawn with charcoal.
      The officers ate their breakfast almost in silence in that mutilated room,
      which looked dull in the rain and melancholy in its dilapidated condition,
      although its old oak floor had become as solid as the stone floor of an
      inn.

When they had finished eating and were smoking and drinking, they began,
      as usual, to berate the dull life they were leading. The bottles of brandy
      and of liqueur passed from hand to hand, and all sat back in their chairs
      and took repeated sips from their glasses, scarcely removing from their
      mouths the long, curved stems, which terminated in china bowls, painted in
      a manner to delight a Hottentot.

As soon as their glasses were empty they filled them again, with a gesture
      of resigned weariness, but Mademoiselle Fifi emptied his every minute, and
      a soldier immediately gave him another. They were enveloped in a cloud of
      strong tobacco smoke, and seemed to be sunk in a state of drowsy, stupid
      intoxication, that condition of stupid intoxication of men who have
      nothing to do, when suddenly the baron sat up and said: “Heavens!
      This cannot go on; we must think of something to do.” And on hearing
      this, Lieutenant Otto and Sub-lieutenant Fritz, who preeminently possessed
      the serious, heavy German countenance, said: “What, captain?”

He thought for a few moments and then replied: “What? Why, we must
      get up some entertainment, if the commandant will allow us.” “What
      sort of an entertainment, captain?” the major asked, taking his pipe
      out of his mouth. “I will arrange all that, commandant,” the
      baron said. “I will send Le Devoir to Rouen, and he will bring back
      some ladies. I know where they can be found, We will have supper here, as
      all the materials are at hand and; at least, we shall have a jolly
      evening.”

But all the other officers had risen and surrounded their chief, saying:
      “Let the captain have his way, commandant; it is terribly dull here.”
      And the major ended by yielding. “Very well,” he replied, and
      the baron immediately sent for Le Devoir. He was an old non-commissioned
      officer, who had never been seen to smile, but who carried out all the
      orders of his superiors to the letter, no matter what they might be. He
      stood there, with an impassive face, while he received the baron''s
      instructions, and then went out, and five minutes later a large military
      wagon, covered with tarpaulin, galloped off as fast as four horses could
      draw it in the pouring rain. The officers all seemed to awaken from their
      lethargy, their looks brightened, and they began to talk.

Although it was raining as hard as ever, the major declared that it was
      not so dark, and Lieutenant von Grossling said with conviction that the
      sky was clearing up, while Mademoiselle Fifi did not seem to be able to
      keep still. He got up and sat down again, and his bright eyes seemed to be
      looking for something to destroy. Suddenly, looking at the lady with the
      mustaches, the young fellow pulled out his revolver and said: “You
      shall not see it.” And without leaving his seat he aimed, and with
      two successive bullets cut out both the eyes of the portrait.

“Let us make a mine!” he then exclaimed, and the conversation
      was suddenly interrupted, as if they had found some fresh and powerful
      subject of interest. The mine was his invention, his method of
      destruction, and his favorite amusement.

When he left the chateau, the lawful owner, Comte Fernand d''Amoys
      d''Uville, had not had time to carry away or to hide anything except the
      plate, which had been stowed away in a hole made in one of the walls. As
      he was very rich and had good taste, the large drawing-room, which opened
      into the dining-room, looked like a gallery in a museum, before his
      precipitate flight.

Expensive oil paintings, water colors and drawings hung against the walls,
      while on the tables, on the hanging shelves and in elegant glass cupboards
      there were a thousand ornaments: small vases, statuettes, groups of
      Dresden china and grotesque Chinese figures, old ivory and Venetian glass,
      which filled the large room with their costly and fantastic array.

Scarcely anything was left now; not that the things had been stolen, for
      the major would not have allowed that, but Mademoiselle Fifi would every
      now and then have a mine, and on those occasions all the officers
      thoroughly enjoyed themselves for five minutes. The little marquis went
      into the drawing-room to get what he wanted, and he brought back a small,
      delicate china teapot, which he filled with gunpowder, and carefully
      introduced a piece of punk through the spout. This he lighted and took his
      infernal machine into the next room, but he came back immediately and shut
      the door. The Germans all stood expectant, their faces full of childish,
      smiling curiosity, and as soon as the explosion had shaken the chateau,
      they all rushed in at once.

Mademoiselle Fifi, who got in first, clapped his hands in delight at the
      sight of a terra-cotta Venus, whose head had been blown off, and each
      picked up pieces of porcelain and wondered at the strange shape of the
      fragments, while the major was looking with a paternal eye at the large
      drawing-room, which had been wrecked after the fashion of a Nero, and was
      strewn with the fragments of works of art. He went out first and said with
      a smile: “That was a great success this time.”

But there was such a cloud of smoke in the dining-room, mingled with the
      tobacco smoke, that they could not breathe, so the commandant opened the
      window, and all the officers, who had returned for a last glass of cognac,
      went up to it.

The moist air blew into the room, bringing with it a sort of powdery
      spray, which sprinkled their beards. They looked at the tall trees which
      were dripping with rain, at the broad valley which was covered with mist,
      and at the church spire in the distance, which rose up like a gray point
      in the beating rain.

The bells had not rung since their arrival. That was the only resistance
      which the invaders had met with in the neighborhood. The parish priest had
      not refused to take in and to feed the Prussian soldiers; he had several
      times even drunk a bottle of beer or claret with the hostile commandant,
      who often employed him as a benevolent intermediary; but it was no use to
      ask him for a single stroke of the bells; he would sooner have allowed
      himself to be shot. That was his way of protesting against the invasion, a
      peaceful and silent protest, the only one, he said, which was suitable to
      a priest, who was a man of mildness, and not of blood; and every one, for
      twenty-five miles round, praised Abbe Chantavoine''s firmness and heroism
      in venturing to proclaim the public mourning by the obstinate silence of
      his church bells.

The whole village, enthusiastic at his resistance, was ready to back up
      their pastor and to risk anything, for they looked upon that silent
      protest as the safeguard of the national honor. It seemed to the peasants
      that thus they deserved better of their country than Belfort and
      Strassburg, that they had set an equally valuable example, and that the
      name of their little village would become immortalized by that; but, with
      that exception, they refused their Prussian conquerors nothing.

The commandant and his officers laughed among themselves at this
      inoffensive courage, and as the people in the whole country round showed
      themselves obliging and compliant toward them, they willingly tolerated
      their silent patriotism. Little Baron Wilhelm alone would have liked to
      have forced them to ring the bells. He was very angry at his superior''s
      politic compliance with the priest''s scruples, and every day begged the
      commandant to allow him to sound “ding-dong, ding-dong,” just
      once, only just once, just by way of a joke. And he asked it in the
      coaxing, tender voice of some loved woman who is bent on obtaining her
      wish, but the commandant would not yield, and to console himself,
      Mademoiselle Fifi made a mine in the Chateau d''Uville.

The five men stood there together for five minutes, breathing in the moist
      air, and at last Lieutenant Fritz said with a laugh: “The ladies
      will certainly not have fine weather for their drive.” Then they
      separated, each to his duty, while the captain had plenty to do in
      arranging for the dinner.

When they met again toward evening they began to laugh at seeing each
      other as spick and span and smart as on the day of a grand review. The
      commandant''s hair did not look so gray as it was in the morning, and the
      captain had shaved, leaving only his mustache, which made him look as if
      he had a streak of fire under his nose.

In spite of the rain, they left the window open, and one of them went to
      listen from time to time; and at a quarter past six the baron said he
      heard a rumbling in the distance. They all rushed down, and presently the
      wagon drove up at a gallop with its four horses steaming and blowing, and
      splashed with mud to their girths. Five women dismounted, five handsome
      girls whom a comrade of the captain, to whom Le Devoir had presented his
      card, had selected with care.

They had not required much pressing, as they had got to know the Prussians
      in the three months during which they had had to do with them, and so they
      resigned themselves to the men as they did to the state of affairs.

They went at once into the dining-room, which looked still more dismal in
      its dilapidated condition when it was lighted up; while the table covered
      with choice dishes, the beautiful china and glass, and the plate, which
      had been found in the hole in the wall where its owner had hidden it, gave
      it the appearance of a bandits'' inn, where they were supping after
      committing a robbery in the place. The captain was radiant, and put his
      arm round the women as if he were familiar with them; and when the three
      young men wanted to appropriate one each, he opposed them authoritatively,
      reserving to himself the right to apportion them justly, according to
      their several ranks, so as not to offend the higher powers. Therefore, to
      avoid all discussion, jarring, and suspicion of partiality, he placed them
      all in a row according to height, and addressing the tallest, he said in a
      voice of command:

“What is your name?” “Pamela,” she replied,
      raising her voice. And then he said: “Number One, called Pamela, is
      adjudged to the commandant.” Then, having kissed Blondina, the
      second, as a sign of proprietorship, he proffered stout Amanda to
      Lieutenant Otto; Eva, “the Tomato,” to Sub-lieutenant Fritz,
      and Rachel, the shortest of them all, a very young, dark girl, with eyes
      as black as ink, a Jewess, whose snub nose proved the rule which allots
      hooked noses to all her race, to the youngest officer, frail Count Wilhelm
      d''Eyrick.

They were all pretty and plump, without any distinctive features, and all
      had a similarity of complexion and figure.

The three young men wished to carry off their prizes immediately, under
      the pretext that they might wish to freshen their toilets; but the captain
      wisely opposed this, for he said they were quite fit to sit down to
      dinner, and his experience in such matters carried the day. There were
      only many kisses, expectant kisses.

Suddenly Rachel choked, and began to cough until the tears came into her
      eyes, while smoke came through her nostrils. Under pretence of kissing
      her, the count had blown a whiff of tobacco into her mouth. She did not
      fly into a rage and did not say a word, but she looked at her tormentor
      with latent hatred in her dark eyes.

They sat down to dinner. The commandant seemed delighted; he made Pamela
      sit on his right, and Blondina on his left, and said, as he unfolded his
      table napkin: “That was a delightful idea of yours, captain.”

Lieutenants Otto and Fritz, who were as polite as if they had been with
      fashionable ladies, rather intimidated their guests, but Baron von
      Kelweinstein beamed, made obscene remarks and seemed on fire with his
      crown of red hair. He paid the women compliments in French of the Rhine,
      and sputtered out gallant remarks, only fit for a low pothouse, from
      between his two broken teeth.

They did not understand him, however, and their intelligence did not seem
      to be awakened until he uttered foul words and broad expressions, which
      were mangled by his accent. Then they all began to laugh at once like
      crazy women and fell against each other, repeating the words, which the
      baron then began to say all wrong, in order that he might have the
      pleasure of hearing them say dirty things. They gave him as much of that
      stuff as he wanted, for they were drunk after the first bottle of wine,
      and resuming their usual habits and manners, they kissed the officers to
      right and left of them, pinched their arms, uttered wild cries, drank out
      of every glass and sang French couplets and bits of German songs which
      they had picked up in their daily intercourse with the enemy.

Soon the men themselves became very unrestrained, shouted and broke the
      plates and dishes, while the soldiers behind them waited on them stolidly.
      The commandant was the only one who kept any restraint upon himself.

Mademoiselle Fifi had taken Rachel on his knee, and, getting excited, at
      one moment he kissed the little black curls on her neck and at another he
      pinched her furiously and made her scream, for he was seized by a species
      of ferocity, and tormented by his desire to hurt her. He often held her
      close to him and pressed a long kiss on the Jewess'' rosy mouth until she
      lost her breath, and at last he bit her until a stream of blood ran down
      her chin and on to her bodice.

For the second time she looked him full in the face, and as she bathed the
      wound, she said: “You will have to pay for, that!” But he
      merely laughed a hard laugh and said: “I will pay.”

At dessert champagne was served, and the commandant rose, and in the same
      voice in which he would have drunk to the health of the Empress Augusta,
      he drank: “To our ladies!” And a series of toasts began,
      toasts worthy of the lowest soldiers and of drunkards, mingled with
      obscene jokes, which were made still more brutal by their ignorance of the
      language. They got up, one after the other, trying to say something witty,
      forcing themselves to be funny, and the women, who were so drunk that they
      almost fell off their chairs, with vacant looks and clammy tongues
      applauded madly each time.

The captain, who no doubt wished to impart an appearance of gallantry to
      the orgy, raised his glass again and said: “To our victories over
      hearts.” and, thereupon Lieutenant Otto, who was a species of bear
      from the Black Forest, jumped up, inflamed and saturated with drink, and
      suddenly seized by an access of alcoholic patriotism, he cried: “To
      our victories over France!”

Drunk as they were, the women were silent, but Rachel turned round,
      trembling, and said: “See here, I know some Frenchmen in whose
      presence you would not dare say that.” But the little count, still
      holding her on his knee, began to laugh, for the wine had made him very
      merry, and said: “Ha! ha! ha! I have never met any of them myself.
      As soon as we show ourselves, they run away!” The girl, who was in a
      terrible rage, shouted into his face: “You are lying, you dirty
      scoundrel!”

For a moment he looked at her steadily with his bright eyes upon her, as
      he had looked at the portrait before he destroyed it with bullets from his
      revolver, and then he began to laugh: “Ah! yes, talk about them, my
      dear! Should we be here now if they were brave?” And, getting
      excited, he exclaimed: “We are the masters! France belongs to us!”
      She made one spring from his knee and threw herself into her chair, while
      he arose, held out his glass over the table and repeated: “France
      and the French, the woods, the fields and the houses of France belong to
      us!”

The others, who were quite drunk, and who were suddenly seized by military
      enthusiasm, the enthusiasm of brutes, seized their glasses, and shouting,
      “Long live Prussia!” they emptied them at a draught.

The girls did not protest, for they were reduced to silence and were
      afraid. Even Rachel did not say a word, as she had no reply to make. Then
      the little marquis put his champagne glass, which had just been refilled,
      on the head of the Jewess and exclaimed: “All the women in France
      belong to us also!”

At that she got up so quickly that the glass upset, spilling the
      amber-colored wine on her black hair as if to baptize her, and broke into
      a hundred fragments, as it fell to the floor. Her lips trembling, she
      defied the looks of the officer, who was still laughing, and stammered out
      in a voice choked with rage:

He sat down again so as to laugh at his ease; and, trying to speak with
      the Parisian accent, he said: “She is good, very good! Then why did
      you come here, my dear?” She was thunderstruck and made no reply for
      a moment, for in her agitation she did not understand him at first, but as
      soon as she grasped his meaning she said to him indignantly and
      vehemently: “I! I! I am not a woman, I am only a strumpet, and that
      is all that Prussians want.”

Almost before she had finished he slapped her full in the face; but as he
      was raising his hand again, as if to strike her, she seized a small
      dessert knife with a silver blade from the table and, almost mad with
      rage, stabbed him right in the hollow of his neck. Something that he was
      going to say was cut short in his throat, and he sat there with his mouth
      half open and a terrible look in his eyes.

All the officers shouted in horror and leaped up tumultuously; but,
      throwing her chair between the legs of Lieutenant Otto, who fell down at
      full length, she ran to the window, opened it before they could seize her
      and jumped out into the night and the pouring rain.

In two minutes Mademoiselle Fifi was dead, and Fritz and Otto drew their
      swords and wanted to kill the women, who threw themselves at their feet
      and clung to their knees. With some difficulty the major stopped the
      slaughter and had the four terrified girls locked up in a room under the
      care of two soldiers, and then he organized the pursuit of the fugitive as
      carefully as if he were about to engage in a skirmish, feeling quite sure
      that she would be caught.

The table, which had been cleared immediately, now served as a bed on
      which to lay out the lieutenant, and the four officers stood at the
      windows, rigid and sobered with the stern faces of soldiers on duty, and
      tried to pierce through the darkness of the night amid the steady torrent
      of rain. Suddenly a shot was heard and then another, a long way off; and
      for four hours they heard from time to time near or distant reports and
      rallying cries, strange words of challenge, uttered in guttural voices.

In the morning they all returned. Two soldiers had been killed and three
      others wounded by their comrades in the ardor of that chase and in the
      confusion of that nocturnal pursuit, but they had not caught Rachel.

Then the inhabitants of the district were terrorized, the houses were
      turned topsy-turvy, the country was scoured and beaten up, over and over
      again, but the Jewess did not seem to have left a single trace of her
      passage behind her.

When the general was told of it he gave orders to hush up the affair, so
      as not to set a bad example to the army, but he severely censured the
      commandant, who in turn punished his inferiors. The general had said:
      “One does not go to war in order to amuse one''s self and to caress
      prostitutes.” Graf von Farlsberg, in his exasperation, made up his
      mind to have his revenge on the district, but as he required a pretext for
      showing severity, he sent for the priest and ordered him to have the bell
      tolled at the funeral of Baron von Eyrick.

Contrary to all expectation, the priest showed himself humble and most
      respectful, and when Mademoiselle Fifi''s body left the Chateau d''Uville on
      its way to the cemetery, carried by soldiers, preceded, surrounded and
      followed by soldiers who marched with loaded rifles, for the first time
      the bell sounded its funeral knell in a lively manner, as if a friendly
      hand were caressing it. At night it rang again, and the next day, and
      every day; it rang as much as any one could desire. Sometimes even it
      would start at night and sound gently through the darkness, seized with a
      strange joy, awakened one could not tell why. All the peasants in the
      neighborhood declared that it was bewitched, and nobody except the priest
      and the sacristan would now go near the church tower. And they went
      because a poor girl was living there in grief and solitude and provided
      for secretly by those two men.

She remained there until the German troops departed, and then one evening
      the priest borrowed the baker''s cart and himself drove his prisoner to
      Rouen. When they got there he embraced her, and she quickly went back on
      foot to the establishment from which she had come, where the proprietress,
      who thought that she was dead, was very glad to see her.

A short time afterward a patriot who had no prejudices, and who liked her
      because of her bold deed, and who afterward loved her for herself, married
      her and made her a lady quite as good as many others.

The war was over. The Germans occupied France. The whole country was
      pulsating like a conquered wrestler beneath the knee of his victorious
      opponent.

The first trains from Paris, distracted, starving, despairing Paris, were
      making their way to the new frontiers, slowly passing through the country
      districts and the villages. The passengers gazed through the windows at
      the ravaged fields and burned hamlets. Prussian soldiers, in their black
      helmets with brass spikes, were smoking their pipes astride their chairs
      in front of the houses which were still left standing. Others were working
      or talking just as if they were members of the families. As you passed
      through the different towns you saw entire regiments drilling in the
      squares, and, in spite of the rumble of the carriage-wheels, you could
      every moment hear the hoarse words of command.

M. Dubuis, who during the entire siege had served as one of the National
      Guard in Paris, was going to join his wife and daughter, whom he had
      prudently sent away to Switzerland before the invasion.

Famine and hardship had not diminished his big paunch so characteristic of
      the rich, peace-loving merchant. He had gone through the terrible events
      of the past year with sorrowful resignation and bitter complaints at the
      savagery of men. Now that he was journeying to the frontier at the close
      of the war, he saw the Prussians for the first time, although he had done
      his duty on the ramparts and mounted guard on many a cold night.

He stared with mingled fear and anger at those bearded armed men,
      installed all over French soil as if they were at home, and he felt in his
      soul a kind of fever of impotent patriotism, at the same time also the
      great need of that new instinct of prudence which since then has, never
      left us. In the same railway carriage were two Englishmen, who had come to
      the country as sightseers and were gazing about them with looks of quiet
      curiosity. They were both also stout, and kept chatting in their own
      language, sometimes referring to their guidebook, and reading aloud the
      names of the places indicated.

Suddenly the train stopped at a little village station, and a Prussian
      officer jumped up with a great clatter of his sabre on the double
      footboard of the railway carriage. He was tall, wore a tight-fitting
      uniform, and had whiskers up to his eyes. His red hair seemed to be on
      fire, and his long mustache, of a paler hue, stuck out on both sides of
      his face, which it seemed to cut in two.

The Englishmen at once began staring at him, with smiles of newly awakened
      interest, while M. Dubuis made a show of reading a newspaper. He sat
      concealed in his corner like a thief in presence of a gendarme.

The train started again. The Englishmen went on chatting and looking out
      for the exact scene of different battles; and all of a sudden, as one of
      them stretched out his arm toward the horizon as he pointed out a village,
      the Prussian officer remarked in French, extending his long legs and
      lolling backward:

The train rolled on, still passing through hamlets occupied by the
      victorious army. German soldiers could be seen along the roads, on the
      edges of fields, standing in front of gates or chatting outside cafes.
      They covered the soil like African locusts.

“If I had been in command, I''d have taken Paris, burned everything,
      killed everybody. No more France!”

“In twenty years all Europe, all of it, will belong to us. Prussia
      is more than a match for all of them.”

The Englishmen, getting uneasy, no longer replied. Their faces, which had
      become impassive, seemed made of wax behind their long whiskers. Then the
      Prussian officer began to laugh. And still, lolling back, he began to
      sneer. He sneered at the downfall of France, insulted the prostrate enemy;
      he sneered at Austria, which had been recently conquered; he sneered at
      the valiant but fruitless defence of the departments; he sneered at the
      Garde Mobile and at the useless artillery. He announced that Bismarck was
      going to build a city of iron with the captured cannon. And suddenly he
      placed his boots against the thigh of M. Dubuis, who turned away his eyes,
      reddening to the roots of his hair.

The Englishmen seemed to have become indifferent to all that was going on,
      as if they were suddenly shut up in their own island, far from the din of
      the world.

The train whistled, and slackened its pace. They passed a station that had
      been burned down; and then they stopped altogether.

A Prussian detachment occupied the station. Other soldiers were standing
      behind wooden gratings, looking on. The engine was getting up steam before
      starting off again. Then M. Dubuis hurriedly jumped on the platform, and,
      in spite of the warnings of the station master, dashed into the adjoining
      compartment.

He was alone! He tore open his waistcoat, his heart was beating so
      rapidly, and, gasping for breath, he wiped the perspiration from his
      forehead.

The train drew up at another station. And suddenly the officer appeared at
      the carriage door and jumped in, followed close behind by the two
      Englishmen, who were impelled by curiosity. The German sat facing the
      Frenchman, and, laughing still, said:

The German had already pulled out a few hairs, and was still tugging at
      the mustache, when M. Dubuis, with a back stroke of his hand, flung aside
      the officer''s arm, and, seizing him by the collar, threw him down on the
      seat. Then, excited to a pitch of fury, his temples swollen and his eyes
      glaring, he kept throttling the officer with one hand, while with the
      other clenched he began to strike him violent blows in the face. The
      Prussian struggled, tried to draw his sword, to clinch with his adversary,
      who was on top of him. But M. Dubuis crushed him with his enormous weight
      and kept punching him without taking breath or knowing where his blows
      fell. Blood flowed down the face of the German, who, choking and with a
      rattling in his throat, spat out his broken teeth and vainly strove to
      shake off this infuriated man who was killing him.

The Englishmen had got on their feet and came closer in order to see
      better. They remained standing, full of mirth and curiosity, ready to bet
      for, or against, either combatant.

Suddenly M. Dubuis, exhausted by his violent efforts, rose and resumed his
      seat without uttering a word.

The Prussian did not attack him, for the savage assault had terrified and
      astonished the officer as well as causing him suffering. When he was able
      to breathe freely, he said:

“Here is the town of Strasbourg. I''ll get two officers to be my
      seconds, and there will be time before the train leaves the station.”

In a minute the Prussian had found two comrades, who brought pistols, and
      they made their way toward the ramparts.

The Englishmen were continually looking at their watches, shuffling their
      feet and hurrying on with the preparations, uneasy lest they should be too
      late for the train.

While he was answering, “Yes, monsieur,” he noticed that one
      of the Englishmen had opened his umbrella in order to keep off the rays of
      the sun.

M. Dubuis fired at random without delay, and he was amazed to see the
      Prussian opposite him stagger, lift up his arms and fall forward, dead. He
      had killed the officer.

One of the Englishmen exclaimed: “Ah!” He was quivering with
      delight, with satisfied curiosity and joyous impatience. The other, who
      still kept his watch in his hand, seized M. Dubuis'' arm and hurried him in
      double-quick time toward the station, his fellow-countryman marking time
      as he ran beside them, with closed fists, his elbows at his sides, “One,
      two; one, two!”

And all three, running abreast rapidly, made their way to the station like
      three grotesque figures in a comic newspaper.

The train was on the point of starting. They sprang into their carriage.
      Then the Englishmen, taking off their travelling caps, waved them three
      times over their heads, exclaiming:

And gravely, one after the other, they extended their right hands to M.
      Dubuis and then went back and sat down in their own corner.

“Upon my word,” said Colonel Laporte, “although I am old
      and gouty, my legs as stiff as two pieces of wood, yet if a pretty woman
      were to tell me to go through the eye of a needle, I believe I should take
      a jump at it, like a clown through a hoop. I shall die like that; it is in
      the blood. I am an old beau, one of the old school, and the sight of a
      woman, a pretty woman, stirs me to the tips of my toes. There!

“We are all very much alike in France in this respect; we still
      remain knights, knights of love and fortune, since God has been abolished
      whose bodyguard we really were. But nobody can ever get woman out of our
      hearts; there she is, and there she will remain, and we love her, and
      shall continue to love her, and go on committing all kinds of follies on
      her account as long as there is a France on the map of Europe; and even if
      France were to be wiped off the map, there would always be Frenchmen left.

“When I am in the presence of a woman, of a pretty woman, I feel
      capable of anything. By Jove! when I feel her looks penetrating me, her
      confounded looks which set your blood on fire, I should like to do I don''t
      know what; to fight a duel, to have a row, to smash the furniture, in
      order to show that I am the strongest, the bravest, the most daring and
      the most devoted of men.

“But I am not the only one, certainly not; the whole French army is
      like me, I swear to you. From the common soldier to the general, we all
      start out, from the van to the rear guard, when there is a woman in the
      case, a pretty woman. Do you remember what Joan of Arc made us do
      formerly? Come. I will make a bet that if a pretty woman had taken command
      of the army on the eve of Sedan, when Marshal MacMahon was wounded, we
      should have broken through the Prussian lines, by Jove! and had a drink
      out of their guns.

“It was not a Trochu, but a Sainte-Genevieve, who was needed in
      Paris; and I remember a little anecdote of the war which proves that we
      are capable of everything in presence of a woman.

“I was a captain, a simple captain, at the time, and I was in
      command of a detachment of scouts, who were retreating through a district
      which swarmed with Prussians. We were surrounded, pursued, tired out and
      half dead with fatigue and hunger, but we were bound to reach Bar-sur-Tain
      before the morrow, otherwise we should be shot, cut down, massacred. I do
      not know how we managed to escape so far. However, we had ten leagues to
      go during the night, ten leagues through the night, ten leagues through
      the snow, and with empty stomachs, and I thought to myself:

“We had eaten nothing since the day before, and the whole day long
      we remained hidden in a barn, huddled close together, so as not to feel
      the cold so much, unable to speak or even move, and sleeping by fits and
      starts, as one does when worn out with fatigue.

“It was dark by five o''clock, that wan darkness of the snow, and I
      shook my men. Some of them would not get up; they were almost incapable of
      moving or of standing upright; their joints were stiff from cold and
      hunger.

“Before us there was a large expanse of flat, bare country; the snow
      was still falling like a curtain, in large, white flakes, which concealed
      everything under a thick, frozen coverlet, a coverlet of frozen wool One
      might have thought that it was the end of the world.

“They looked at the thick white flakes that were coming down, and
      they seemed to think: ''We have had enough of this; we may just as well die
      here!'' Then I took out my revolver and said:

“''I will shoot the first man who flinches.'' And so they set off, but
      very slowly, like men whose legs were of very little use to them, and I
      sent four of them three hundred yards ahead to scout, and the others
      followed pell-mell, walking at random and without any order. I put the
      strongest in the rear, with orders to quicken the pace of the sluggards
      with the points of their bayonets in the back.

“The snow seemed as if it were going to bury us alive; it powdered
      our kepis and cloaks without melting, and made phantoms of us, a kind of
      spectres of dead, weary soldiers. I said to myself: ''We shall never get
      out of this except by a miracle.''

“Sometimes we had to stop for a few minutes, on account of those who
      could not follow us, and then we heard nothing except the falling snow,
      that vague, almost undiscernible sound made by the falling flakes. Some of
      the men shook themselves, others did not move, and so I gave the order to
      set off again. They shouldered their rifles, and with weary feet we
      resumed our march, when suddenly the scouts fell back. Something had
      alarmed them; they had heard voices in front of them. I sent forward six
      men and a sergeant and waited.

“All at once a shrill cry, a woman''s cry, pierced through the heavy
      silence of the snow, and in a few minutes they brought back two prisoners,
      an old man and a girl, whom I questioned in a low voice. They were
      escaping from the Prussians, who had occupied their house during the
      evening and had got drunk. The father was alarmed on his daughter''s
      account, and, without even telling their servants, they had made their
      escape in the darkness. I saw immediately that they belonged to the better
      class. I invited them to accompany us, and we started off again, the old
      man who knew the road acting as our guide.

“It had ceased snowing, the stars appeared and the cold became
      intense. The girl, who was leaning on her father''s arm, walked unsteadily
      as though in pain, and several times she murmured:

“''I have no feeling at all in my feet''; and I suffered more than she
      did to see that poor little woman dragging herself like that through the
      snow. But suddenly she stopped and said:

“The old man wanted to carry her, but he could not even lift her up,
      and she sank to the ground with a deep sigh. We all gathered round her,
      and, as for me, I stamped my foot in perplexity, not knowing what to do,
      and being unwilling to abandon that man and girl like that, when suddenly
      one of the soldiers, a Parisian whom they had nicknamed Pratique, said:

“''Come, comrades, we must carry the young lady, otherwise we shall
      not show ourselves Frenchmen, confound it!''

“I really believe that I swore with pleasure. ''That is very good of
      you, my children,'' I said; ''and I will take my share of the burden.''

“We could indistinctly see, through the darkness, the trees of a
      little wood on the left. Several of the men went into it, and soon came
      back with a bundle of branches made into a litter.

“''Who will lend his cape? It is for a pretty girl, comrades,''
      Pratique said, and ten cloaks were thrown to him. In a moment the girl was
      lying, warm and comfortable, among them, and was raised upon six
      shoulders. I placed myself at their head, on the right, well pleased with
      my position.

“We started off much more briskly, as if we had had a drink of wine,
      and I even heard some jokes. A woman is quite enough to electrify
      Frenchmen, you see. The soldiers, who had become cheerful and warm, had
      almost reformed their ranks, and an old ''franc-tireur'' who was following
      the litter, waiting for his turn to replace the first of his comrades who
      might give out, said to one of his neighbors, loud enough for me to hear:
      “''I am not a young man now, but by—-, there is nothing like
      the women to put courage into you!''

“We went on, almost without stopping, until three o''clock in the
      morning, when suddenly our scouts fell back once more, and soon the whole
      detachment showed nothing but a vague shadow on the ground, as the men lay
      on the snow. I gave my orders in a low voice, and heard the harsh,
      metallic sound of the cocking, of rifles. For there, in the middle of the
      plain, some strange object was moving about. It looked like some enormous
      animal running about, now stretching out like a serpent, now coiling
      itself into a ball, darting to the right, then to the left, then stopping,
      and presently starting off again. But presently that wandering shape came
      nearer, and I saw a dozen lancers at full gallop, one behind the other.
      They had lost their way and were trying to find it.

“They were so near by that time that I could hear the loud breathing
      of their horses, the clinking of their swords and the creaking of their
      saddles, and cried: ''Fire!''

“Fifty rifle shots broke the stillness of the night, then there were
      four or five reports, and at last one single shot was heard, and when the
      smoke had cleared away, we saw that the twelve men and nine horses had
      fallen. Three of the animals were galloping away at a furious pace, and
      one of them was dragging the dead body of its rider, which rebounded
      violently from the ground; his foot had caught in the stirrup.

“One of the soldiers behind me gave a terrible laugh and said:
      ''There will be some widows there!''

“''Poor fellows!'' she said. But as she was cold, she quickly
      disappeared beneath the cloaks again, and we started off once more. We
      marched on for a long time, and at last the sky began to grow lighter. The
      snow became quite clear, luminous and glistening, and a rosy tint appeared
      in the east. Suddenly a voice in the distance cried:

“The whole detachment halted, and I advanced to give the
      countersign. We had reached the French lines, and, as my men defiled
      before the outpost, a commandant on horseback, whom I had informed of what
      had taken place, asked in a sonorous voice, as he saw the litter pass him:
      ''What have you in there?''

“And immediately a small head covered with light hair appeared,
      dishevelled and smiling, and replied:

“At this the men raised a hearty laugh, and we felt quite
      light-hearted, while Pratique, who was walking by the side of the litter,
      waved his kepi and shouted:

“''Vive la France!'' And I felt really affected. I do not know why,
      except that I thought it a pretty and gallant thing to say.

“It seemed to me as if we had just saved the whole of France and had
      done something that other men could not have done, something simple and
      really patriotic. I shall never forget that little face, you may be sure;
      and if I had to give my opinion about abolishing drums, trumpets and
      bugles, I should propose to replace them in every regiment by a pretty
      girl, and that would be even better than playing the ''Marseillaise: By
      Jove! it would put some spirit into a trooper to have a Madonna like that,
      a live Madonna, by the colonel''s side.”

He was silent for a few moments and then continued, with an air of
      conviction, and nodding his head:

Fifteen years had passed since I was at Virelogne. I returned there in the
      autumn to shoot with my friend Serval, who had at last rebuilt his
      chateau, which the Prussians had destroyed.

I loved that district. It is one of those delightful spots which have a
      sensuous charm for the eyes. You love it with a physical love. We, whom
      the country enchants, keep tender memories of certain springs, certain
      woods, certain pools, certain hills seen very often which have stirred us
      like joyful events. Sometimes our thoughts turn back to a corner in a
      forest, or the end of a bank, or an orchard filled with flowers, seen but
      a single time on some bright day, yet remaining in our hearts like the
      image of certain women met in the street on a spring morning in their
      light, gauzy dresses, leaving in soul and body an unsatisfied desire which
      is not to be forgotten, a feeling that you have just passed by happiness.

At Virelogne I loved the whole countryside, dotted with little woods and
      crossed by brooks which sparkled in the sun and looked like veins carrying
      blood to the earth. You fished in them for crawfish, trout and eels.
      Divine happiness! You could bathe in places and you often found snipe
      among the high grass which grew along the borders of these small water
      courses.

I was stepping along light as a goat, watching my two dogs running ahead
      of me, Serval, a hundred metres to my right, was beating a field of
      lucerne. I turned round by the thicket which forms the boundary of the
      wood of Sandres and I saw a cottage in ruins.

Suddenly I remembered it as I had seen it the last time, in 1869, neat,
      covered with vines, with chickens before the door. What is sadder than a
      dead house, with its skeleton standing bare and sinister?

I also recalled that inside its doors, after a very tiring day, the good
      woman had given me a glass of wine to drink and that Serval had told me
      the history of its people. The father, an old poacher, had been killed by
      the gendarmes. The son, whom I had once seen, was a tall, dry fellow who
      also passed for a fierce slayer of game. People called them “Les
      Sauvage.”

When war was declared the son Sauvage, who was then thirty-three years
      old, enlisted, leaving his mother alone in the house. People did not pity
      the old woman very much because she had money; they knew it.

She remained entirely alone in that isolated dwelling, so far from the
      village, on the edge of the wood. She was not afraid, however, being of
      the same strain as the men folk—a hardy old woman, tall and thin,
      who seldom laughed and with whom one never jested. The women of the fields
      laugh but little in any case, that is men''s business. But they themselves
      have sad and narrowed hearts, leading a melancholy, gloomy life. The
      peasants imbibe a little noisy merriment at the tavern, but their
      helpmates always have grave, stern countenances. The muscles of their
      faces have never learned the motions of laughter.

Mother Sauvage continued her ordinary existence in her cottage, which was
      soon covered by the snows. She came to the village once a week to get
      bread and a little meat. Then she returned to her house. As there was talk
      of wolves, she went out with a gun upon her shoulder—her son''s gun,
      rusty and with the butt worn by the rubbing of the hand—and she was
      a strange sight, the tall “Sauvage,” a little bent, going with
      slow strides over the snow, the muzzle of the piece extending beyond the
      black headdress, which confined her head and imprisoned her white hair,
      which no one had ever seen.

One day a Prussian force arrived. It was billeted upon the inhabitants,
      according to the property and resources of each. Four were allotted to the
      old woman, who was known to be rich.

They were four great fellows with fair complexion, blond beards and blue
      eyes, who had not grown thin in spite of the fatigue which they had
      endured already and who also, though in a conquered country, had remained
      kind and gentle. Alone with this aged woman, they showed themselves full
      of consideration, sparing her, as much as they could, all expense and
      fatigue. They could be seen, all four of them, making their toilet at the
      well in their shirt-sleeves in the gray dawn, splashing with great swishes
      of water their pink-white northern skin, while La Mere Sauvage went and
      came, preparing their soup. They would be seen cleaning the kitchen,
      rubbing the tiles, splitting wood, peeling potatoes, doing up all the
      housework like four good sons around their mother.

But the old woman thought always of her own son, so tall and thin, with
      his hooked nose and his brown eyes and his heavy mustache which made a
      roll of black hair upon his lip. She asked every day of each of the
      soldiers who were installed beside her hearth: “Do you know where
      the French marching regiment, No. 23, was sent? My boy is in it.”

They invariably answered, “No, we don''t know, don''t know a thing at
      all.” And, understanding her pain and her uneasiness—they who
      had mothers, too, there at home—they rendered her a thousand little
      services. She loved them well, moreover, her four enemies, since the
      peasantry have no patriotic hatred; that belongs to the upper class alone.
      The humble, those who pay the most because they are poor and because every
      new burden crushes them down; those who are killed in masses, who make the
      true cannon''s prey because they are so many; those, in fine, who suffer
      most cruelly the atrocious miseries of war because they are the feeblest
      and offer least resistance—they hardly understand at all those
      bellicose ardors, that excitable sense of honor or those pretended
      political combinations which in six months exhaust two nations, the
      conqueror with the conquered.

Now, one morning, when the old woman was alone in the house, she observed,
      far off on the plain, a man coming toward her dwelling. Soon she
      recognized him; it was the postman to distribute the letters. He gave her
      a folded paper and she drew out of her case the spectacles which she used
      for sewing. Then she read:

She did not cry at all. She remained motionless, so overcome and stupefied
      that she did not even suffer as yet. She thought: “There''s Victor
      killed now.” Then little by little the tears came to her eyes and
      the sorrow filled her heart. Her thoughts came, one by one, dreadful,
      torturing. She would never kiss him again, her child, her big boy, never
      again! The gendarmes had killed the father, the Prussians had killed the
      son. He had been cut in two by a cannon-ball. She seemed to see the thing,
      the horrible thing: the head falling, the eyes open, while he chewed the
      corner of his big mustache as he always did in moments of anger.

What had they done with his body afterward? If they had only let her have
      her boy back as they had brought back her husband—with the bullet in
      the middle of the forehead!

But she heard a noise of voices. It was the Prussians returning from the
      village. She hid her letter very quickly in her pocket, and she received
      them quietly, with her ordinary face, having had time to wipe her eyes.

They were laughing, all four, delighted, for they brought with them a fine
      rabbit—stolen, doubtless—and they made signs to the old woman
      that there was to be something good to east.

She set herself to work at once to prepare breakfast, but when it came to
      killing the rabbit, her heart failed her. And yet it was not the first.
      One of the soldiers struck it down with a blow of his fist behind the
      ears.

The beast once dead, she skinned the red body, but the sight of the blood
      which she was touching, and which covered her hands, and which she felt
      cooling and coagulating, made her tremble from head to foot, and she kept
      seeing her big boy cut in two, bloody, like this still palpitating animal.

She sat down at table with the Prussians, but she could not eat, not even
      a mouthful. They devoured the rabbit without bothering themselves about
      her. She looked at them sideways, without speaking, her face so impassive
      that they perceived nothing.

All of a sudden she said: “I don''t even know your names, and here''s
      a whole month that we''ve been together.” They understood, not
      without difficulty, what she wanted, and told their names.

That was not sufficient; she had them written for her on a paper, with the
      addresses of their families, and, resting her spectacles on her great
      nose, she contemplated that strange handwriting, then folded the sheet and
      put it in her pocket, on top of the letter which told her of the death of
      her son.

They were astonished at her taking all this trouble; she explained to them
      that thus they would not be so cold; and they helped her. They heaped the
      stacks of hay as high as the straw roof, and in that manner they made a
      sort of great chamber with four walls of fodder, warm and perfumed, where
      they should sleep splendidly.

At dinner one of them was worried to see that La Mere Sauvage still ate
      nothing. She told him that she had pains in her stomach. Then she kindled
      a good fire to warm herself, and the four Germans ascended to their
      lodging-place by the ladder which served them every night for this
      purpose.

As soon as they closed the trapdoor the old woman removed the ladder, then
      opened the outside door noiselessly and went back to look for more bundles
      of straw, with which she filled her kitchen. She went barefoot in the
      snow, so softly that no sound was heard. From time to time she listened to
      the sonorous and unequal snoring of the four soldiers who were fast
      asleep.

When she judged her preparations to be sufficient, she threw one of the
      bundles into the fireplace, and when it was alight she scattered it over
      all the others. Then she went outside again and looked.

In a few seconds the whole interior of the cottage was illumined with a
      brilliant light and became a frightful brasier, a gigantic fiery furnace,
      whose glare streamed out of the narrow window and threw a glittering beam
      upon the snow.

Then a great cry issued from the top of the house; it was a clamor of men
      shouting heartrending calls of anguish and of terror. Finally the trapdoor
      having given way, a whirlwind of fire shot up into the loft, pierced the
      straw roof, rose to the sky like the immense flame of a torch, and all the
      cottage flared.

Nothing more was heard therein but the crackling of the fire, the cracking
      of the walls, the falling of the rafters. Suddenly the roof fell in and
      the burning carcass of the dwelling hurled a great plume of sparks into
      the air, amid a cloud of smoke.

The old “Sauvage” stood before her ruined dwelling, armed with
      her gun, her son''s gun, for fear one of those men might escape.

When she saw that it was ended, she threw her weapon into the brasier. A
      loud report followed.

She reached her bony arm toward the red heap of fire which was almost out
      and answered with a strong voice:

They did not believe her, they thought that the sudden disaster had made
      her crazy. While all pressed round and listened, she told the story from
      beginning to end, from the arrival of the letter to the last shriek of the
      men who were burned with her house, and never omitted a detail.

When she had finished, she drew two pieces of paper from her pocket, and,
      in order to distinguish them by the last gleams of the fire, she again
      adjusted her spectacles. Then she said, showing one:

“That, that is the death of Victor.” Showing the other, she
      added, indicating the red ruins with a bend of the head: “Here are
      their names, so that you can write home.” She quietly held a sheet
      of paper out to the officer, who held her by the shoulders, and she
      continued:

“You must write how it happened, and you must say to their mothers
      that it was I who did that, Victoire Simon, la Sauvage! Do not forget.”

The officer shouted some orders in German. They seized her, they threw her
      against the walls of her house, still hot. Then twelve men drew quickly up
      before her, at twenty paces. She did not move. She had understood; she
      waited.

An order rang out, followed instantly by a long report. A belated shot
      went off by itself, after the others.

The Prussian officer approached. She was almost cut in two, and in her
      withered hand she held her letter bathed with blood.

“It was by way of reprisal that the Germans destroyed the chateau of
      the district, which belonged to me.”

I thought of the mothers of those four fine fellows burned in that house
      and of the horrible heroism of that other mother shot against the wall.

I should say I did remember that Epiphany supper during the war! exclaimed
      Count de Garens, an army captain.

I was quartermaster of cavalry at the time, and for a fortnight had been
      scouting in front of the German advance guard. The evening before we had
      cut down a few Uhlans and had lost three men, one of whom was that poor
      little Raudeville. You remember Joseph de Raudeville, of course.

Well, on that day my commanding officer ordered me to take six troopers
      and to go and occupy the village of Porterin, where there had been five
      skirmishes in three weeks, and to hold it all night. There were not twenty
      houses left standing, not a dozen houses in that wasps'' nest. So I took
      ten troopers and set out about four o''clock, and at five o''clock, while it
      was still pitch dark, we reached the first houses of Porterin. I halted
      and ordered Marchas—you know Pierre de Marchas, who afterward
      married little Martel-Auvelin, the daughter of the Marquis de Martel-Auvelin—to
      go alone into the village, and to report to me what he saw.

I had selected nothing but volunteers, all men of good family. It is
      pleasant when on duty not to be forced to be on intimate terms with
      unpleasant fellows. This Marchas was as smart as possible, cunning as a
      fox and supple as a serpent. He could scent the Prussians as a dog can
      scent a hare, could discover food where we should have died of hunger
      without him, and obtained information from everybody, and information
      which was always reliable, with incredible cleverness.

In ten minutes he returned. “All right,” he said; “there
      have been no Prussians here for three days. It is a sinister place, is
      this village. I have been talking to a Sister of Mercy, who is caring for
      four or five wounded men in an abandoned convent.”

I ordered them to ride on, and we entered the principal street. On the
      right and left we could vaguely see roofless walls, which were hardly
      visible in the profound darkness. Here and there a light was burning in a
      room; some family had remained to keep its house standing as well as they
      were able; a family of brave or of poor people. The rain began to fall, a
      fine, icy cold rain, which froze as it fell on our cloaks. The horses
      stumbled against stones, against beams, against furniture. Marchas guided
      us, going before us on foot, and leading his horse by the bridle.

“Where are you taking us to?” I asked him. And he replied:
      “I have a place for us to lodge in, and a rare good one.” And
      we presently stopped before a small house, evidently belonging to some
      proprietor of the middle class. It stood on the street, was quite
      inclosed, and had a garden in the rear.

Marchas forced open the lock by means of a big stone which he picked up
      near the garden gate; then he mounted the steps, smashed in the front door
      with his feet and shoulders, lit a bit of wax candle, which he was never
      without, and went before us into the comfortable apartments of some rich
      private individual, guiding us with admirable assurance, as if he lived in
      this house which he now saw for the first time.

Two troopers remained outside to take care of our horses, and Marchas said
      to stout Ponderel, who followed him: “The stables must be on the
      left; I saw that as we came in; go and put the animals up there, for we do
      not need them”; and then, turning to me, he said: “Give your
      orders, confound it all!”

This fellow always astonished me, and I replied with a laugh: “I
      will post my sentinels at the country approaches and will return to you
      here.”

“Very well. Leave me four to look after provisions, to do the
      cooking and to set the table. I will go and find out where the wine is
      hidden.”

I went off, to reconnoitre the deserted streets until they ended in the
      open country, so as to post my sentries there.

Half an hour later I was back, and found Marchas lounging in a great
      easy-chair, the covering of which he had taken off, from love of luxury,
      as he said. He was warming his feet at the fire and smoking an excellent
      cigar, whose perfume filled the room. He was alone, his elbows resting on
      the arms of the chair, his head sunk between his shoulders, his cheeks
      flushed, his eyes bright, and looking delighted.

I heard the noise of plates and dishes in the next room, and Marchas said
      to me, smiling in a contented manner: “This is famous; I found the
      champagne under the flight of steps outside, the brandy—fifty
      bottles of the very finest in the kitchen garden under a pear tree, which
      did not seem to me to be quite straight when I looked at it by the light
      of my lantern. As for solids, we have two fowls, a goose, a duck, and
      three pigeons. They are being cooked at this moment. It is a delightful
      district.”

I sat down opposite him, and the fire in the grate was burning my nose and
      cheeks. “Where did you find this wood?” I asked. “Splendid
      wood,” he replied. “The owner''s carriage. It is the paint
      which is causing all this flame, an essence of punch and varnish. A
      capital house!”

I laughed, for I saw the creature was funny, and he went on: “Fancy
      this being the Epiphany! I have had a bean put into the goose dressing;
      but there is no queen; it is really very annoying!” And I repeated
      like an echo: “It is annoying, but what do you want me to do in the
      matter?” “To find some, of course.” “Some women.
      Women?—you must be mad?” “I managed to find the brandy
      under the pear tree, and the champagne under the steps; and yet there was
      nothing to guide me, while as for you, a petticoat is a sure bait. Go and
      look, old fellow.”

He looked so grave, so convinced, that I could not tell whether he was
      joking or not, and so I replied: “Look here, Marchas, are you having
      a joke with me?” “I never joke on duty.” “But
      where the devil do you expect me to find any women?” “Where
      you like; there must be two or three remaining in the neighborhood, so
      ferret them out and bring them here.”

“Do you want an idea?” “Yes.” “Go and see
      the priest.” “The priest? What for?” “Ask him to
      supper, and beg him to bring a woman with him.” “The priest! A
      woman! Ha! ha! ha!”

But Marchas continued with extraordinary gravity: “I am not
      laughing; go and find the priest and tell him how we are situated, and, as
      he must be horribly dull, he will come. But tell him that we want one
      woman at least, a lady, of course, since we, are all men of the world. He
      is sure to know his female parishioners on the tips of his fingers, and if
      there is one to suit us, and you manage it well, he will suggest her to
      you.”

“Come, come, Marchas, what are you thinking of?” “My
      dear Garens, you can do this quite well. It will even be very funny. We
      are well bred, by Jove! and we will put on our most distinguished manners
      and our grandest style. Tell the abbe who we are, make him laugh, soften
      his heart, coax him and persuade him!” “No, it is impossible.”

He drew his chair close to mine, and as he knew my special weakness, the
      scamp continued: “Just think what a swaggering thing it will be to
      do and how amusing to tell about; the whole army will talk about it, and
      it will give you a famous reputation.”

I hesitated, for the adventure rather tempted me, and he persisted:
      “Come, my little Garens. You are the head of this detachment, and
      you alone can go and call on the head of the church in this neighborhood.
      I beg of you to go, and I promise you that after the war I will relate the
      whole affair in verse in the Revue de Deux Mondes. You owe this much to
      your men, for you have made them march enough during the last month.”

I got up at last and asked: “Where is the priest''s house?”
      “Take the second turning at the end of the street, you will see an
      avenue, and at the end of the avenue you will find the church. The
      parsonage is beside it.” As I went out, he called out: “Tell
      him the bill of fare, to make him hungry!”

I discovered the ecclesiastic''s little house without any difficulty; it
      was by the side of a large, ugly brick church. I knocked at the door with
      my fist, as there was neither bell nor knocker, and a loud voice from
      inside asked: “Who is there?” To which I replied: “A
      quartermaster of hussars.”

I heard the noise of bolts and of a key being turned, and found myself
      face to face with a tall priest with a large stomach, the chest of a
      prizefighter, formidable hands projecting from turned-up sleeves, a red
      face, and the look of a kind man. I gave him a military salute and said:
      “Good-day, Monsieur le Cure.”

He had feared a surprise, some marauders'' ambush, and he smiled as he
      replied: “Good-day, my friend; come in.” I followed him into a
      small room with a red tiled floor, in which a small fire was burning, very
      different to Marchas'' furnace, and he gave me a chair and said: “What
      can I do for you?” “Monsieur, allow me first of all to
      introduce myself”; and I gave him my card, which he took and read
      half aloud: “Le Comte de Garens.”

I continued: “There are eleven of us here, Monsieur l''Abbe, five on
      picket duty, and six installed at the house of an unknown inhabitant. The
      names of the six are: Garens, myself; Pierre de Marchas, Ludovic de
      Ponderel, Baron d''Streillis, Karl Massouligny, the painter''s son, and
      Joseph Herbon, a young musician. I have come to ask you, in their name and
      my own, to do us the honor of supping with us. It is an Epiphany supper,
      Monsieur le Cure, and we should like to make it a little cheerful.”

The priest smiled and murmured: “It seems to me to be hardly a
      suitable occasion for amusing one''s self.” And I replied: “We
      are fighting during the day, monsieur. Fourteen of our comrades have been
      killed in a month, and three fell as late as yesterday. It is war time. We
      stake our life at every moment; have we not, therefore, the right to amuse
      ourselves freely? We are Frenchmen, we like to laugh, and we can laugh
      everywhere. Our fathers laughed on the scaffold! This evening we should
      like to cheer ourselves up a little, like gentlemen, and not like
      soldiers; you understand me, I hope. Are we wrong?”

He replied quickly: “You are quite right, my friend, and I accept
      your invitation with great pleasure.” Then he called out: “Hermance!”

An old bent, wrinkled, horrible peasant woman appeared and said: “What
      do you want?” “I shall not dine at home, my daughter.”
      “Where are you going to dine then?” “With some
      gentlemen, the hussars.”

I felt inclined to say: “Bring your servant with you,” just to
      see Marchas'' face, but I did not venture, and continued: “Do you
      know any one among your parishioners, male or female, whom I could invite
      as well?” He hesitated, reflected, and then said: “No, I do
      not know anybody!”

I persisted: “Nobody! Come, monsieur, think; it would be very nice
      to have some ladies, I mean to say, some married couples! I know nothing
      about your parishioners. The baker and his wife, the grocer, the—the—the—watchmaker—the—shoemaker—the—the
      druggist with Mrs. Druggist. We have a good spread and plenty of wine, and
      we should be enchanted to leave pleasant recollections of ourselves with
      the people here.”

The priest thought again for a long time, and then said resolutely:
      “No, there is nobody.” I began to laugh. “By Jove,
      Monsieur le Cure, it is very annoying not to have an Epiphany queen, for
      we have the bean. Come, think. Is there not a married mayor, or a married
      deputy mayor, or a married municipal councillor or a schoolmaster?”
      “No, all the ladies have gone away.” “What, is there not
      in the whole place some good tradesman''s wife with her good tradesman, to
      whom we might give this pleasure, for it would be a pleasure to them, a
      great pleasure under present circumstances?”

But, suddenly, the cure began to laugh, and laughed so violently that he
      fairly shook, and presently exclaimed: “Ha! ha! ha! I have got what
      you want, yes. I have got what you want! Ha! ha! ha! We will laugh and
      enjoy ourselves, my children; we will have some fun. How pleased the
      ladies will be, I say, how delighted they will be! Ha! ha! Where are you
      staying?”

I described the house, and he understood where it was. “Very good,”
      he said. “It belongs to Monsieur Bertin-Lavaille. I will be there in
      half an hour, with four ladies! Ha! ha! ha! four ladies!”

He went out with me, still laughing, and left me, repeating: “That
      is capital; in half an hour at Bertin-Lavaille''s house.”

I returned quickly, very much astonished and very much puzzled. “Covers
      for how many?” Marchas asked, as soon as he saw me. “Eleven.
      There are six of us hussars, besides the priest and four ladies.” He
      was thunderstruck, and I was triumphant. He repeated: “Four ladies!
      Did you say, four ladies?” “I said four women.” “Real
      women?” “Real women.” “Well, accept my
      compliments!” “I will, for I deserve them.”

He got out of his armchair, opened the door, and I saw a beautiful white
      tablecloth on a long table, round which three hussars in blue aprons were
      setting out the plates and glasses. “There are some women coming!”
      Marchas cried. And the three men began to dance and to cheer with all
      their might.

Everything was ready, and we were waiting. We waited for nearly an hour,
      while a delicious smell of roast poultry pervaded the whole house. At
      last, however, a knock against the shutters made us all jump up at the
      same moment. Stout Ponderel ran to open the door, and in less than a
      minute a little Sister of Mercy appeared in the doorway. She was thin,
      wrinkled and timid, and successively greeted the four bewildered hussars
      who saw her enter. Behind her, the noise of sticks sounded on the tiled
      floor in the vestibule, and as soon as she had come into the drawing-room,
      I saw three old heads in white caps, following each other one by one, who
      came in, swaying with different movements, one inclining to the right,
      while the other inclined to the left. And three worthy women appeared,
      limping, dragging their legs behind them, crippled by illness and deformed
      through old age, three infirm old women, past service, the only three
      pensioners who were able to walk in the home presided over by Sister
      Saint-Benedict.

She had turned round to her invalids, full of anxiety for them, and then,
      seeing my quartermaster''s stripes, she said to me: “I am much
      obliged to you for thinking of these poor women. They have very little
      pleasure in life, and you are at the same time giving them a great treat
      and doing them a great honor.”

I saw the priest, who had remained in the dark hallway, and was laughing
      heartily, and I began to laugh in my turn, especially when I saw Marchas''
      face. Then, motioning the nun to the seats, I said:

“Sit down, sister; we are very proud and very happy that you have
      accepted our unpretentious invitation.”

She took three chairs which stood against the wall, set them before the
      fire, led her three old women to them, settled them on them, took their
      sticks and shawls, which she put into a corner, and then, pointing to the
      first, a thin woman with an enormous stomach, who was evidently suffering
      from the dropsy, she said: “This is Mother Paumelle; whose husband
      was killed by falling from a roof, and whose son died in Africa; she is
      sixty years old.” Then she pointed to another, a tall woman, whose
      head trembled unceasingly: “This is Mother Jean-Jean, who is
      sixty-seven. She is nearly blind, for her face was terribly singed in a
      fire, and her right leg was half burned off.”

Then she pointed to the third, a sort of dwarf, with protruding, round,
      stupid eyes, which she rolled incessantly in all directions, “This
      is La Putois, an idiot. She is only forty-four.”

I bowed to the three women as if I were being presented to some royal
      highnesses, and turning to the priest, I said: “You are an excellent
      man, Monsieur l''Abbe, to whom all of us here owe a debt of gratitude.”

Everybody was laughing, in fact, except Marchas, who seemed furious, and
      just then Karl Massouligny cried: “Sister Saint-Benedict, supper is
      on the table!”

I made her go first with the priest, then I helped up Mother Paumelle,
      whose arm I took and dragged her into the next room, which was no easy
      task, for she seemed heavier than a lump of iron.

Stout Ponderel gave his arm to Mother Jean-Jean, who bemoaned her crutch,
      and little Joseph Herbon took the idiot, La Putois, to the dining-room,
      which was filled with the odor of the viands.

As soon as we were opposite our plates, the sister clapped her hands three
      times, and, with the precision of soldiers presenting arms, the women made
      a rapid sign of the cross, and then the priest slowly repeated the
      Benedictus in Latin. Then we sat down, and the two fowls appeared, brought
      in by Marchas, who chose to wait at table, rather than to sit down as a
      guest to this ridiculous repast.

But I cried: “Bring the champagne at once!” and a cork flew
      out with the noise of a pistol, and in spite of the resistance of the
      priest and of the kind sister, the three hussars, sitting by the side of
      the three invalids, emptied their three full glasses down their throats by
      force.

Massouligny, who possessed the faculty of making himself at home, and of
      being on good terms with every one, wherever he was, made love to Mother
      Paumelle in the drollest manner. The dropsical woman, who had retained her
      cheerfulness in spite of her misfortunes, answered him banteringly in a
      high falsetto voice which appeared as if it were put on, and she laughed
      so heartily at her neighbor''s jokes that it was quite alarming. Little
      Herbon had seriously undertaken the task of making the idiot drunk, and
      Baron d''Streillis, whose wits were not always particularly sharp, was
      questioning old Jean-Jean about the life, the habits, and the rules of the
      hospital.

“Oh! oh! you will make her ill; pray do not make her laugh like
      that, monsieur. Oh! monsieur—” Then she got up and rushed at
      Herbon to take from him a full glass which he was hastily emptying down La
      Putois'' throat, while the priest shook with laughter, and said to the
      sister: “Never mind; just this once, it will not hurt them. Do leave
      them alone.”

After the two fowls they ate the duck, which was flanked by the three
      pigeons and the blackbird, and then the goose appeared, smoking,
      golden-brown, and diffusing a warm odor of hot, browned roast meat. La
      Paumelle, who was getting lively, clapped her hands; La Jean-Jean left off
      answering the baron''s numerous questions, and La Putois uttered grunts of
      pleasure, half cries and half sighs, as little children do when one shows
      them candy. “Allow me to take charge of this animal,” the cure
      said. “I understand these sort of operations better than most
      people.” “Certainly, Monsieur l''Abbe,” and the sister
      said: “How would it be to open the window a little? They are too
      warm, and I am afraid they will be ill.”

I turned to Marchas: “Open the window for a minute.” He did
      so; the cold outer air as it came in made the candles flare, and the steam
      from the goose, which the cure was scientifically carving, with a table
      napkin round his neck, whirl about. We watched him doing it, without
      speaking now, for we were interested in his attractive handiwork, and
      seized with renewed appetite at the sight of that enormous golden-brown
      bird, whose limbs fell one after another into the brown gravy at the
      bottom of the dish. At that moment, in the midst of that greedy silence
      which kept us all attentive, the distant report of a shot came in at the
      open window.

I started to my feet so quickly that my chair fell down behind me, and I
      shouted: “To saddle, all of you! You, Marchas, take two men and go
      and see what it is. I shall expect you back here in five minutes.”
      And while the three riders went off at full gallop through the night, I
      got into the saddle with my three remaining hussars, in front of the steps
      of the villa, while the cure, the sister and the three old women showed
      their frightened faces at the window.

We heard nothing more, except the barking of a dog in the distance. The
      rain had ceased, and it was cold, very cold, and soon I heard the gallop
      of a horse, of a single horse, coming back. It was Marchas, and I called
      out to him: “Well?” “It is nothing; Francois has wounded
      an old peasant who refused to answer his challenge: ''Who goes there?'' and
      who continued to advance in spite of the order to keep off; but they are
      bringing him here, and we shall see what is the matter.”

I gave orders for the horses to be put back in the stable, and I sent my
      two soldiers to meet the others, and returned to the house. Then the cure,
      Marchas, and I took a mattress into the room to lay the wounded man on;
      the sister tore up a table napkin in order to make lint, while the three
      frightened women remained huddled up in a corner.

Soon I heard the rattle of sabres on the road, and I took a candle to show
      a light to the men who were returning; and they soon appeared, carrying
      that inert, soft, long, sinister object which a human body becomes when
      life no longer sustains it.

They put the wounded man on the mattress that had been prepared for him,
      and I saw at the first glance that he was dying. He had the death rattle
      and was spitting up blood, which ran out of the corners of his mouth at
      every gasp. The man was covered with blood! His cheeks, his beard, his
      hair, his neck and his clothes seemed to have been soaked, to have been
      dipped in a red tub; and that blood stuck to him, and had become a dull
      color which was horrible to look at.

The wounded man, wrapped up in a large shepherd''s cloak, occasionally
      opened his dull, vacant eyes, which seemed stupid with astonishment, like
      those of animals wounded by a sportsman, which fall at his feet, more than
      half dead already, stupefied with terror and surprise.

The cure exclaimed: “Ah, it is old Placide, the shepherd from Les
      Moulins. He is deaf, poor man, and heard nothing. Ah! Oh, God! they have
      killed the unhappy man!” The sister had opened his blouse and shirt,
      and was looking at a little blue hole in his chest, which was not bleeding
      any more. “There is nothing to be done,” she said.

The shepherd was gasping terribly and bringing up blood with every last
      breath, and in his throat, to the very depth of his lungs, they could hear
      an ominous and continued gurgling. The cure, standing in front of him,
      raised his right hand, made the sign of the cross, and in a slow and
      solemn voice pronounced the Latin words which purify men''s souls, but
      before they were finished, the old man''s body trembled violently, as if
      something had given way inside him, and he ceased to breathe. He was dead.

When I turned round, I saw a sight which was even more horrible than the
      death struggle of this unfortunate man; the three old women were standing
      up huddled close together, hideous, and grimacing with fear and horror. I
      went up to them, and they began to utter shrill screams, while La
      Jean-Jean, whose burned leg could no longer support her, fell to the
      ground at full length.

Sister Saint-Benedict left the dead man, ran up to her infirm old women,
      and without a word or a look for me, wrapped their shawls round them, gave
      them their crutches, pushed them to the door, made them go out, and
      disappeared with them into the dark night.

I saw that I could not even let a hussar accompany them, for the mere
      rattle of a sword would have sent them mad with fear.

I have no news. We live in the drawing-room, looking out at the rain. We
      cannot go out in this frightful weather, so we have theatricals. How
      stupid they are, my dear, these drawing entertainments in the repertory of
      real life! All is forced, coarse, heavy. The jokes are like cannon balls,
      smashing everything in their passage. No wit, nothing natural, no
      sprightliness, no elegance. These literary men, in truth, know nothing of
      society. They are perfectly ignorant of how people think and talk in our
      set. I do not mind if they despise our customs, our conventionalities, but
      I do not forgive them for not knowing them. When they want to be humorous
      they make puns that would do for a barrack; when they try to be jolly,
      they give us jokes that they must have picked up on the outer boulevard in
      those beer houses artists are supposed to frequent, where one has heard
      the same students'' jokes for fifty years.

So we have taken to Theatricals. As we are only two women, my husband
      takes the part of a soubrette, and, in order to do that, he has shaved off
      his mustache. You cannot imagine, my dear Lucy, how it changes him! I no
      longer recognize him-by day or at night. If he did not let it grow again I
      think I should no longer love him; he looks so horrid like this.

In fact, a man without a mustache is no longer a man. I do not care much
      for a beard; it almost always makes a man look untidy. But a mustache, oh,
      a mustache is indispensable to a manly face. No, you would never believe
      how these little hair bristles on the upper lip are a relief to the eye
      and good in other ways. I have thought over the matter a great deal but
      hardly dare to write my thoughts. Words look so different on paper and the
      subject is so difficult, so delicate, so dangerous that it requires
      infinite skill to tackle it.

Well, when my husband appeared, shaven, I understood at once that I never
      could fall in love with a strolling actor nor a preacher, even if it were
      Father Didon, the most charming of all! Later when I was alone with him
      (my husband) it was worse still. Oh, my dear Lucy, never let yourself be
      kissed by a man without a mustache; their kisses have no flavor, none
      whatever! They no longer have the charm, the mellowness and the snap
      —yes, the snap—of a real kiss. The mustache is the spice.

Imagine placing to your lips a piece of dry—or moist—parchment.
      That is the kiss of the man without a mustache. It is not worth while.

Whence comes this charm of the mustache, will you tell me? Do I know
      myself? It tickles your face, you feel it approaching your mouth and it
      sends a little shiver through you down to the tips of your toes.

And on your neck! Have you ever felt a mustache on your neck? It
      intoxicates you, makes you feel creepy, goes to the tips of your fingers.
      You wriggle, shake your shoulders, toss back your head. You wish to get
      away and at the same time to remain there; it is delightful, but
      irritating. But how good it is!

A lip without a mustache is like a body without clothing; and one must
      wear clothes, very few, if you like, but still some clothing.

I recall a sentence (uttered by a politician) which has been running in my
      mind for three months. My husband, who keeps up with the newspapers, read
      me one evening a very singular speech by our Minister of Agriculture, who
      was called M. Meline. He may have been superseded by this time. I do not
      know.

I was paying no attention, but the name Meline struck me. It recalled, I
      do not exactly know why, the ''Scenes de la vie de boheme''. I thought it
      was about some grisette. That shows how scraps of the speech entered my
      mind. This M. Meline was making this statement to the people of Amiens, I
      believe, and I have ever since been trying to understand what he meant:
      “There is no patriotism without agriculture!” Well, I have
      just discovered his meaning, and I affirm in my turn that there is no love
      without a mustache. When you say it that way it sounds comical, does it
      not?

“There is no patriotism without agriculture,” said M. Meline,
      and he was right, that minister; I now understand why.

From a very different point of view the mustache is essential. It gives
      character to the face. It makes a man look gentle, tender, violent, a
      monster, a rake, enterprising! The hairy man, who does not shave off his
      whiskers, never has a refined look, for his features are concealed; and
      the shape of the jaw and the chin betrays a great deal to those who
      understand.

The man with a mustache retains his own peculiar expression and his
      refinement at the same time.

And how many different varieties of mustaches there are! Sometimes they
      are twisted, curled, coquettish. Those seem to be chiefly devoted to
      women.

Sometimes they are pointed, sharp as needles, and threatening. That kind
      prefers wine, horses and war.

Sometimes they are enormous, overhanging, frightful. These big ones
      generally conceal a fine disposition, a kindliness that borders on
      weakness and a gentleness that savors of timidity.

But what I adore above all in the mustache is that it is French,
      altogether French. It came from our ancestors, the Gauls, and has remained
      the insignia of our national character.

It is boastful, gallant and brave. It sips wine gracefully and knows how
      to laugh with refinement, while the broad-bearded jaws are clumsy in
      everything they do.

I recall something that made me weep all my tears and also—I see it
      now—made me love a mustache on a man''s face.

It was during the war, when I was living with my father. I was a young
      girl then. One day there was a skirmish near the chateau. I had heard the
      firing of the cannon and of the artillery all the morning, and that
      evening a German colonel came and took up his abode in our house. He left
      the following day.

My father was informed that there were a number of dead bodies in the
      fields. He had them brought to our place so that they might be buried
      together. They were laid all along the great avenue of pines as fast as
      they brought them in, on both sides of the avenue, and as they began to
      smell unpleasant, their bodies were covered with earth until the deep
      trench could be dug. Thus one saw only their heads which seemed to
      protrude from the clayey earth and were almost as yellow, with their
      closed eyes.

I wanted to see them. But when I saw those two rows of frightful faces, I
      thought I should faint. However, I began to look at them, one by one,
      trying to guess what kind of men these had been.

The uniforms were concealed beneath the earth, and yet immediately, yes,
      immediately, my dear, I recognized the Frenchmen by their mustache!

Some of them had shaved on the very day of the battle, as though they
      wished to be elegant up to the last; others seemed to have a week''s
      growth, but all wore the French mustache, very plain, the proud mustache
      that seems to say: “Do not take me for my bearded friend, little
      one; I am a brother.”

And I cried, oh, I cried a great deal more than I should if I had not
      recognized them, the poor dead fellows.

The first thing I did was to look at the clock as I entered the
      waiting-room of the station at Loubain, and I found that I had to wait two
      hours and ten minutes for the Paris express.

I had walked twenty miles and felt suddenly tired. Not seeing anything on
      the station walls to amuse me, I went outside and stood there racking my
      brains to think of something to do. The street was a kind of boulevard,
      planted with acacias, and on either side a row of houses of varying shape
      and different styles of architecture, houses such as one only sees in a
      small town, and ascended a slight hill, at the extreme end of which there
      were some trees, as though it ended in a park.

From time to time a cat crossed the street and jumped over the gutters
      carefully. A cur sniffed at every tree and hunted for scraps from the
      kitchens, but I did not see a single human being, and I felt listless and
      disheartened. What could I do with myself? I was already thinking of the
      inevitable and interminable visit to the small cafe at the railway
      station, where I should have to sit over a glass of undrinkable beer and
      the illegible newspaper, when I saw a funeral procession coming out of a
      side street into the one in which I was, and the sight of the hearse was a
      relief to me. It would, at any rate, give me something to do for ten
      minutes.

Suddenly, however, my curiosity was aroused. The hearse was followed by
      eight gentlemen, one of whom was weeping, while the others were chatting
      together, but there was no priest, and I thought to myself:

“This is a non-religious funeral,” and then I reflected that a
      town like Loubain must contain at least a hundred freethinkers, who would
      have made a point of making a manifestation. What could it be, then? The
      rapid pace of the procession clearly proved that the body was to be buried
      without ceremony, and, consequently, without the intervention of the
      Church.

My idle curiosity framed the most complicated surmises, and as the hearse
      passed me, a strange idea struck me, which was to follow it, with the
      eight gentlemen. That would take up my time for an hour, at least, and I
      accordingly walked with the others, with a sad look on my face, and, on
      seeing this, the two last turned round in surprise, and then spoke to each
      other in a low voice.

No doubt they were asking each other whether I belonged to the town, and
      then they consulted the two in front of them, who stared at me in turn.
      This close scrutiny annoyed me, and to put an end to it I went up to them,
      and, after bowing, I said:

“I beg your pardon, gentlemen, for interrupting your conversation,
      but, seeing a civil funeral, I have followed it, although I did not know
      the deceased gentleman whom you are accompanying.”

The other gentleman, who evidently wished to tell me all about it, then
      said: “Yes and no. The clergy have refused to allow us the use of
      the church.”

On hearing this I uttered a prolonged “A-h!” of astonishment.
      I could not understand it at all, but my obliging neighbor continued:

“It is rather a long story. This young woman committed suicide, and
      that is the reason why she cannot be buried with any religious ceremony.
      The gentleman who is walking first, and who is crying, is her husband.”

“You surprise and interest me very much, monsieur. Shall I be
      indiscreet if I ask you to tell me the facts of the case? If I am
      troubling you, forget that I have said anything about the matter.”

“Not at all, not at all. Let us linger a little behind the others,
      and I will tell it you, although it is a very sad story. We have plenty of
      time before getting to the cemetery, the trees of which you see up yonder,
      for it is a stiff pull up this hill.”

“This young woman, Madame Paul Hamot, was the daughter of a wealthy
      merchant in the neighborhood, Monsieur Fontanelle. When she was a mere
      child of eleven, she had a shocking adventure; a footman attacked her and
      she nearly died. A terrible criminal case was the result, and the man was
      sentenced to penal servitude for life.

“The little girl grew up, stigmatized by disgrace, isolated, without
      any companions; and grown-up people would scarcely kiss her, for they
      thought that they would soil their lips if they touched her forehead, and
      she became a sort of monster, a phenomenon to all the town. People said to
      each other in a whisper: ''You know, little Fontanelle,'' and everybody
      turned away in the streets when she passed. Her parents could not even get
      a nurse to take her out for a walk, as the other servants held aloof from
      her, as if contact with her would poison everybody who came near her.

“It was pitiable to see the poor child go and play every afternoon.
      She remained quite by herself, standing by her maid and looking at the
      other children amusing themselves. Sometimes, yielding to an irresistible
      desire to mix with the other children, she advanced timidly, with nervous
      gestures, and mingled with a group, with furtive steps, as if conscious of
      her own disgrace. And immediately the mothers, aunts and nurses would come
      running from every seat and take the children entrusted to their care by
      the hand and drag them brutally away.

“Little Fontanelle remained isolated, wretched, without
      understanding what it meant, and then she began to cry, nearly heartbroken
      with grief, and then she used to run and hide her head in her nurse''s lap,
      sobbing.

“As she grew up, it was worse still. They kept the girls from her,
      as if she were stricken with the plague. Remember that she had nothing to
      learn, nothing; that she no longer had the right to the symbolical wreath
      of orange-flowers; that almost before she could read she had penetrated
      that redoubtable mystery which mothers scarcely allow their daughters to
      guess at, trembling as they enlighten them on the night of their marriage.

“When she went through the streets, always accompanied by her
      governess, as if, her parents feared some fresh, terrible adventure, with
      her eyes cast down under the load of that mysterious disgrace which she
      felt was always weighing upon her, the other girls, who were not nearly so
      innocent as people thought, whispered and giggled as they looked at her
      knowingly, and immediately turned their heads absently, if she happened to
      look at them. People scarcely greeted her; only a few men bowed to her,
      and the mothers pretended not to see her, while some young blackguards
      called her Madame Baptiste, after the name of the footman who had attacked
      her.

“Nobody knew the secret torture of her mind, for she hardly ever
      spoke, and never laughed, and her parents themselves appeared
      uncomfortable in her presence, as if they bore her a constant grudge for
      some irreparable fault.

“An honest man would not willingly give his hand to a liberated
      convict, would he, even if that convict were his own son? And Monsieur and
      Madame Fontanelle looked on their daughter as they would have done on a
      son who had just been released from the hulks. She was pretty and pale,
      tall, slender, distinguished-looking, and she would have pleased me very
      much, monsieur, but for that unfortunate affair.

“Well, when a new sub-prefect was appointed here, eighteen months
      ago, he brought his private secretary with him. He was a queer sort of
      fellow, who had lived in the Latin Quarter, it appears. He saw
      Mademoiselle Fontanelle and fell in love with her, and when told of what
      occurred, he merely said:

“''Bah! That is just a guarantee for the future, and I would rather
      it should have happened before I married her than afterward. I shall live
      tranquilly with that woman.''

“He paid his addresses to her, asked for her hand and married her,
      and then, not being deficient in assurance, he paid wedding calls, as if
      nothing had happened. Some people returned them, others did not; but, at
      last, the affair began to be forgotten, and she took her proper place in
      society.

“She adored her husband as if he had been a god; for, you must
      remember, he had restored her to honor and to social life, had braved
      public opinion, faced insults, and, in a word, performed such a courageous
      act as few men would undertake, and she felt the most exalted and tender
      love for him.

“When she became enceinte, and it was known, the most particular
      people and the greatest sticklers opened their doors to her, as if she had
      been definitely purified by maternity.

“It is strange, but so it is, and thus everything was going on as
      well as possible until the other day, which was the feast of the patron
      saint of our town. The prefect, surrounded by his staff and the
      authorities, presided at the musical competition, and when he had finished
      his speech the distribution of medals began, which Paul Hamot, his private
      secretary, handed to those who were entitled to them.

“As you know, there are always jealousies and rivalries, which make
      people forget all propriety. All the ladies of the town were there on the
      platform, and, in his turn, the bandmaster from the village of Mourmillon
      came up. This band was only to receive a second-class medal, for one
      cannot give first-class medals to everybody, can one? But when the private
      secretary handed him his badge, the man threw it in his face and
      exclaimed:

“''You may keep your medal for Baptiste. You owe him a first-class
      one, also, just as you do me.''

“There were a number of people there who began to laugh. The common
      herd are neither charitable nor refined, and every eye was turned toward
      that poor lady. Have you ever seen a woman going mad, monsieur? Well, we
      were present at the sight! She got up and fell back on her chair three
      times in succession, as if she wished to make her escape, but saw that she
      could not make her way through the crowd, and then another voice in the
      crowd exclaimed:

“And a great uproar, partly of laughter and partly of indignation,
      arose. The word was repeated over and over again; people stood on tiptoe
      to see the unhappy woman''s face; husbands lifted their wives up in their
      arms, so that they might see her, and people asked:

“She did not move now on her state chair, but sat just as if she had
      been put there for the crowd to look at. She could not move, nor conceal
      herself, nor hide her face. Her eyelids blinked quickly, as if a vivid
      light were shining on them, and she breathed heavily, like a horse that is
      going up a steep hill, so that it almost broke one''s heart to see her.
      Meanwhile, however, Monsieur Hamot had seized the ruffian by the throat,
      and they were rolling on the ground together, amid a scene of
      indescribable confusion, and the ceremony was interrupted.

“An hour later, as the Hamots were returning home, the young woman,
      who had not uttered a word since the insult, but who was trembling as if
      all her nerves had been set in motion by springs, suddenly sprang over the
      parapet of the bridge and threw herself into the river before her husband
      could prevent her. The water is very deep under the arches, and it was two
      hours before her body was recovered. Of course, she was dead.”

“It was, perhaps, the best thing she could do under the
      circumstances. There are some things which cannot be wiped out, and now
      you understand why the clergy refused to have her taken into church. Ah!
      If it had been a religious funeral the whole town would have been present,
      but you can understand that her suicide added to the other affair and made
      families abstain from attending her funeral; and then, it is not an easy
      matter here to attend a funeral which is performed without religious
      rites.”

We passed through the cemetery gates and I waited, much moved by what I
      had heard, until the coffin had been lowered into the grave, before I went
      up to the poor fellow who was sobbing violently, to press his hand warmly.
      He looked at me in surprise through his tears and then said:

This subject of Latin that has been dinned into our ears for some time
      past recalls to my mind a story—a story of my youth.

I was finishing my studies with a teacher, in a big central town, at the
      Institution Robineau, celebrated through the entire province for the
      special attention paid there to the study of Latin.

For the past ten years, the Robineau Institute beat the imperial lycee of
      the town at every competitive examination, and all the colleges of the
      subprefecture, and these constant successes were due, they said, to an
      usher, a simple usher, M. Piquedent, or rather Pere Piquedent.

He was one of those middle-aged men quite gray, whose real age it is
      impossible to tell, and whose history we can guess at first glance. Having
      entered as an usher at twenty into the first institution that presented
      itself so that he could proceed to take first his degree of Master of Arts
      and afterward the degree of Doctor of Laws, he found himself so enmeshed
      in this routine that he remained an usher all his life. But his love for
      Latin did not leave him and harassed him like an unhealthy passion. He
      continued to read the poets, the prose writers, the historians, to
      interpret them and penetrate their meaning, to comment on them with a
      perseverance bordering on madness.

One day, the idea came into his head to oblige all the students in his
      class to answer him in Latin only; and he persisted in this resolution
      until at last they were capable of sustaining an entire conversation with
      him just as they would in their mother tongue. He listened to them, as a
      leader of an orchestra listens to his musicians rehearsing, and striking
      his desk every moment with his ruler, he exclaimed:

“Monsieur Plantel, your way of expressing yourself is altogether
      French and in no way Latin. You must understand the genius of a language.
      Look here, listen to me.”

Now, it came to pass that the pupils of the Institution Robineau carried
      off, at the end of the year, all the prizes for composition, translation,
      and Latin conversation.

Next year, the principal, a little man, as cunning as an ape, whom he
      resembled in his grinning and grotesque appearance, had had printed on his
      programmes, on his advertisements, and painted on the door of his
      institution:

“Two honor prizes at the general examinations in competition with
      all the lycees and colleges of France.”

For ten years the Institution Robineau triumphed in the same fashion. Now
      my father, allured by these successes, sent me as a day pupil to
      Robineau''s—or, as we called it, Robinetto or Robinettino''s—and
      made me take special private lessons from Pere Piquedent at the rate of
      five francs per hour, out of which the usher got two francs and the
      principal three francs. I was then eighteen, and was in the philosophy
      class.

These private lessons were given in a little room looking out on the
      street. It so happened that Pere Piquedent, instead of talking Latin to
      me, as he did when teaching publicly in the institution, kept telling me
      his troubles in French. Without relations, without friends, the poor man
      conceived an attachment to me, and poured out his misery to me.

The other ushers disgusted him. He knew nobody in the town, since he had
      no time to devote to making acquaintances.

“Not even the nights, my friend, and that is the hardest thing on
      me. The dream of my life is to have a room with my own furniture, my own
      books, little things that belong to myself and which others may not touch.
      And I have nothing of my own, nothing except my trousers and my
      frock-coat, nothing, not even my mattress and my pillow! I have not four
      walls to shut myself up in, except when I come to give a lesson in this
      room. Do you see what this means—a man forced to spend his life
      without ever having the right, without ever finding the time, to shut
      himself up all alone, no matter where, to think, to reflect, to work, to
      dream? Ah! my dear boy, a key, the key of a door which one can lock—this
      is happiness, mark you, the only happiness!

“Here, all day long, teaching all those restless rogues, and during
      the night the dormitory with the same restless rogues snoring. And I have
      to sleep in the bed at the end of two rows of beds occupied by these
      youngsters whom I must look after. I can never be alone, never! If I go
      out I find the streets full of people, and, when I am tired of walking, I
      go into some cafe crowded with smokers and billiard players. I tell you
      what, it is the life of a galley slave.”

“What, my little friend? I am not a shoemaker, or a joiner, or a
      hatter, or a baker, or a hairdresser. I only know Latin, and I have no
      diploma which would enable me to sell my knowledge at a high price. If I
      were a doctor I would sell for a hundred francs what I now sell for a
      hundred sous; and I would supply it probably of an inferior quality, for
      my title would be enough to sustain my reputation.”

“I have no rest in life except in the hours spent with you. Don''t be
      afraid! you''ll lose nothing by that. I''ll make it up to you in the
      class-room by making you speak twice as much Latin as the others.”

One day, I grew bolder, and offered him a cigarette. He stared at me in
      astonishment at first, then he gave a glance toward the door.

And we went and leaned our elbows on the windowsill looking on the street,
      holding concealed in our hands the little rolls of tobacco. Just opposite
      to us was a laundry. Four women in loose white waists were passing hot,
      heavy irons over the linen spread out before them, from which a warm steam
      arose.

Suddenly, another, a fifth, carrying on her arm a large basket which made
      her stoop, came out to take the customers their shirts, their
      handkerchiefs, and their sheets. She stopped on the threshold as if she
      were already fatigued; then, she raised her eyes, smiled as she saw us
      smoking, flung at us, with her left hand, which was free, the sly kiss
      characteristic of a free-and-easy working-woman, and went away at a slow
      place, dragging her feet as she went.

She was a woman of about twenty, small, rather thin, pale, rather pretty,
      with a roguish air and laughing eyes beneath her ill-combed fair hair.

And he spoke with emotion about the misery of the people. He had a heart
      which swelled with lofty democratic sentiment, and he referred to the
      fatiguing pursuits of the working class with phrases borrowed from
      Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and with sobs in his throat.

Next day, as we were leaning our elbows on the same window sill, the same
      woman perceived us and cried out to us:

“Good-day, scholars!” in a comical sort of tone, while she
      made a contemptuous gesture with her hands.

I flung her a cigarette, which she immediately began to smoke. And the
      four other ironers rushed out to the door with outstretched hands to get
      cigarettes also.

And each day a friendly intercourse was established between the
      working-women of the pavement and the idlers of the boarding school.

Pere Piquedent was really a comical sight. He trembled at being noticed,
      for he might lose his position; and he made timid and ridiculous gestures,
      quite a theatrical display of love signals, to which the women responded
      with a regular fusillade of kisses.

A perfidious idea came into my mind. One day, on entering our room, I said
      to the old usher in a low tone:

“You would not believe it, Monsieur Piquedent, I met the little
      washerwoman! You know the one I mean, the woman who had the basket, and I
      spoke to her!”

“She said to me—why, she said she thought you were very nice.
      The fact of the matter is, I believe, I believe, that she is a little in
      love with you.” I saw that he was growing pale.

But every day I pretended that I had met the little laundress and that I
      had spoken to her about him, so that in the end he believed me, and sent
      her ardent and earnest kisses.

Now it happened that one morning, on my way to the boarding school, I
      really came across her. I accosted her without hesitation, as if I had
      known her for the last ten years.

“Oh! no, I am not fooling! He keeps talking of you all through the
      lesson. I bet that he''ll marry you!”

She ceased laughing. The idea of marriage makes every girl serious. Then
      she repeated, with an incredulous air:

And he wrote a long letter, tenderly affectionate, full of phrases and
      circumlocutions, metaphors and similes, philosophy and academic gallantry;
      and I took on myself the responsibility of delivering it to the young
      woman.

“How well he writes! It is easy to see he has got education! Does he
      really mean to marry me?”

“She loves you, Monsieur Piquedent, and I believe her to be a decent
      girl. It is not right to lead her on and then abandon her.”

I confess I had at the time no plan. I was playing a practical joke a
      schoolboy joke, nothing more. I had been aware of the simplicity of the
      old usher, his innocence and his weakness. I amused myself without asking
      myself how it would turn out. I was eighteen, and I had been for a long
      time looked upon at the lycee as a sly practical joker.

So it was agreed that Pere Piquedent and I should set out in a hack for
      the ferry of Queue de Vache, that we should there pick up Angele, and that
      I should take them into my boat, for in those days I was fond of boating.
      I would then bring them to the Ile des Fleurs, where the three of us would
      dine. I had inflicted myself on them, the better to enjoy my triumph, and
      the usher, consenting to my arrangement, proved clearly that he was losing
      his head by thus risking the loss of his position.

When we arrived at the ferry, where my boat had been moored since morning,
      I saw in the grass, or rather above the tall weeds of the bank, an
      enormous red parasol, resembling a monstrous wild poppy. Beneath the
      parasol was the little laundress in her Sunday clothes. I was surprised.
      She was really pretty, though pale; and graceful, though with a rather
      suburban grace.

Pere Piquedent raised his hat and bowed. She put out her hand toward him,
      and they stared at one another without uttering a word. Then they stepped
      into my boat, and I took the oars. They were seated side by side near the
      stern.

She dipped her hand into the water, skimming the surface, making a thin,
      transparent film like a sheet of glass, which made a soft plashing along
      the side of the boat.

When they were in the restaurant, she took it on herself to speak, and
      ordered dinner, fried fish, a chicken, and salad; then she led us on
      toward the isle, which she knew perfectly.

Until dessert, no question of love arose. I had treated them to champagne,
      and Pere Piquedent was tipsy. Herself slightly the worse, she called out
      to him:

It was thus that these two silly creatures promised marriage to each other
      through the trick of a young scamp. But I did not believe that it was
      serious, nor, indeed, did they, perhaps.

“What do I know? We shall see. With five thousand francs we could do
      many things. You don''t want me to go and live in your boarding school, do
      you?”

“Then we''ll buy a grocer''s shop! Oh! what luck! we''ll buy a grocer''s
      shop. Not on a big scale, of course; with five thousand francs one does
      not go far.”

We got back into the boat. The night was dark, very dark. I saw clearly,
      however, that he had caught her by the waist, and that they were hugging
      each other again and again.

It was a frightful catastrophe. Our escapade was discovered, with the
      result that Pere Piquedent was dismissed. And my father, in a fit of
      anger, sent me to finish my course of philosophy at Ribaudet''s school.

Six months later I took my degree of Bachelor of Arts. Then I went to
      study law in Paris, and did not return to my native town till two years
      later.

At the corner of the Rue de Serpent a shop caught my eye. Over the door
      were the words: “Colonial Products—Piquedent”; then
      underneath, so as to enlighten the most ignorant: “Grocery.”

Piquedent raised his head, left his female customer, and rushed toward me
      with outstretched hands.

A beautiful woman, very plump, abruptly left the cashier''s desk and flung
      herself on my breast. I had some difficulty in recognizing her, she had
      grown so stout.

It was nothing but an accident, an accident pure and simple. On that
      particular evening the princess'' rooms were open, and as they appeared
      dark after the brilliantly lighted parlors, Baron d''Etraille, who was
      tired of standing, inadvertently wandered into an empty bedroom.

He looked round for a chair in which to have a doze, as he was sure his
      wife would not leave before daylight. As soon as he became accustomed to
      the light of the room he distinguished the big bed with its azure-and-gold
      hangings, in the middle of the great room, looking like a catafalque in
      which love was buried, for the princess was no longer young. Behind it, a
      large bright surface looked like a lake seen at a distance. It was a large
      mirror, discreetly covered with dark drapery, that was very rarely let
      down, and seemed to look at the bed, which was its accomplice. One might
      almost fancy that it had reminiscences, and that one might see in it
      charming female forms and the gentle movement of loving arms.

The baron stood still for a moment, smiling, almost experiencing an
      emotion on the threshold of this chamber dedicated to love. But suddenly
      something appeared in the looking-glass, as if the phantoms which he had
      evoked had risen up before him. A man and a woman who had been sitting on
      a low couch concealed in the shadow had arisen, and the polished surface,
      reflecting their figures, showed that they were kissing each other before
      separating.

Baron d''Etraille recognized his wife and the Marquis de Cervigne. He
      turned and went away like a man who is fully master of himself, and waited
      till it was day before taking away the baroness; but he had no longer any
      thoughts of sleeping.

“Madame, I saw you just now in Princesse de Raynes'' room; I need say
      no more, and I am not fond either of reproaches, acts of violence, or of
      ridicule. As I wish to avoid all such things, we shall separate without
      any scandal. Our lawyers will settle your position according to my orders.
      You will be free to live as you please when you are no longer under my
      roof; but, as you will continue to bear my name, I must warn you that
      should any scandal arise I shall show myself inflexible.”

He was more astonished and sad than unhappy. He had loved her dearly
      during the first period of their married life; but his ardor had cooled,
      and now he often amused himself elsewhere, either in a theatre or in
      society, though he always preserved a certain liking for the baroness.

She was very young, hardly four-and-twenty, small, slight—too slight—and
      very fair. She was a true Parisian doll: clever, spoiled, elegant,
      coquettish, witty, with more charm than real beauty. He used to say
      familiarly to his brother, when speaking of her:

“My wife is charming, attractive, but—there is nothing to lay
      hold of. She is like a glass of champagne that is all froth; when you get
      to the wine it is very good, but there is too little of it, unfortunately.”

He walked up and down the room in great agitation, thinking of a thousand
      things. At one moment he was furious, and felt inclined to give the
      marquis a good thrashing, or to slap his face publicly, in the club. But
      he decided that would not do, it would not be good form; he would be
      laughed at, and not his rival, and this thought wounded his vanity. So he
      went to bed, but could not sleep. Paris knew in a few days that the Baron
      and Baroness d''Etraille had agreed to an amicable separation on account of
      incompatibility of temper. No one suspected anything, no one laughed, and
      no one was astonished.

The baron, however, to avoid meeting his wife, travelled for a year, then
      spent the summer at the seaside, and the autumn in shooting, returning to
      Paris for the winter. He did not meet the baroness once.

He did not even know what people said about her. In any case, she took
      care to respect appearances, and that was all he asked for.

He became dreadfully bored, travelled again, restored his old castle of
      Villebosc, which took him two years; then for over a year he entertained
      friends there, till at last, tired of all these so-called pleasures, he
      returned to his mansion in the Rue de Lille, just six years after the
      separation.

He was now forty-five, with a good crop of gray hair, rather stout, and
      with that melancholy look characteristic of those who have been handsome,
      sought after, and liked, but who are deteriorating, daily.

A month after his return to Paris, he took cold on coming out of his club,
      and had such a bad cough that his medical man ordered him to Nice for the
      rest of the winter.

He reached the station only a few minutes before the departure of the
      train on Monday evening, and had barely time to get into a carriage, with
      only one other occupant, who was sitting in a corner so wrapped in furs
      and cloaks that he could not even make out whether it was a man or a
      woman, as nothing of the figure could be seen. When he perceived that he
      could not find out, he put on his travelling cap, rolled himself up in his
      rugs, and stretched out comfortably to sleep.

He did not wake until the day was breaking, and looked at once at his
      fellow-traveller, who had not stirred all night, and seemed still to be
      sound asleep.

M. d''Etraille made use of the opportunity to brush his hair and his beard,
      and to try to freshen himself up a little generally, for a night''s travel
      does not improve one''s appearance when one has attained a certain age.

As one grows older one wakes up in a very different condition. Dull eyes,
      red, swollen cheeks, dry lips, hair and beard disarranged, impart an old,
      fatigued, worn-out look to the face.

The engine whistled, the train stopped, and his neighbor moved. No doubt
      he was awake. They started off again, and then a slanting ray of sunlight
      shone into the carriage and on the sleeper, who moved again, shook
      himself, and then his face could be seen.

It was a young, fair, pretty, plump woman, and the baron looked at her in
      amazement. He did not know what to think. He could really have sworn that
      it was his wife, but wonderfully changed for the better: stouter —why
      she had grown as stout as he was, only it suited her much better than it
      did him.

She looked at him calmly, did not seem to recognize him, and then slowly
      laid aside her wraps. She had that quiet assurance of a woman who is sure
      of herself, who feels that on awaking she is in her full beauty and
      freshness.

The baron was really bewildered. Was it his wife, or else as like her as
      any sister could be? Not having seen her for six years, he might be
      mistaken.

She yawned, and this gesture betrayed her. She turned and looked at him
      again, calmly, indifferently, as if she scarcely saw him, and then looked
      out of the window again.

Yes; it was surely his wife. How could he possibly have doubted it? There
      could certainly not be two noses like that, and a thousand recollections
      flashed through his mind. He felt the old feeling of the intoxication of
      love stealing over him, and he called to mind the sweet odor of her skin,
      her smile when she put her arms on to his shoulders, the soft intonations
      of her voice, all her graceful, coaxing ways.

But how she had changed and improved! It was she and yet not she. She
      seemed riper, more developed, more of a woman, more seductive, more
      desirable, adorably desirable.

And this strange, unknown woman, whom he had accidentally met in a railway
      carriage, belonged to him; he had only to say to her:

He had formerly slept in her arms, existed only in her love, and now he
      had found her again certainly, but so changed that he scarcely knew her.
      It was another, and yet it was she herself. It was some one who had been
      born and had formed and grown since he had left her. It was she, indeed;
      she whom he had loved, but who was now altered, with a more assured smile
      and greater self-possession. There were two women in one, mingling a great
      part of what was new and unknown with many sweet recollections of the
      past. There was something singular, disturbing, exciting about it —a
      kind of mystery of love in which there floated a delicious confusion. It
      was his wife in a new body and in new flesh which lips had never pressed.

And he thought that in a few years nearly every thing changes in us; only
      the outline can be recognized, and sometimes even that disappears.

The blood, the hair, the skin, all changes and is renewed, and when people
      have not seen each other for a long time, when they meet they find each
      other totally different beings, although they are the same and bear the
      same name.

And the heart also can change. Ideas may be modified and renewed, so that
      in forty years of life we may, by gradual and constant transformations,
      become four or five totally new and different beings.

He dwelt on this thought till it troubled him; it had first taken
      possession of him when he surprised her in the princess'' room. He was not
      the least angry; it was not the same woman that he was looking at —that
      thin, excitable little doll of those days.

What was he to do? How should he address her? and what could he say to
      her? Had she recognized him?

The train stopped again. He got up, bowed, and said: “Bertha, do you
      want anything I could bring you?”

She looked at him from head to foot, and answered, without showing the
      slightest surprise, or confusion, or anger, but with the most perfect
      indifference:

He got out and walked up and down the platform a little in order to
      recover himself, and, as it were, to recover his senses after a fall. What
      should he do now? If he got into another carriage it would look as if he
      were running away. Should he be polite or importunate? That would look as
      if he were asking for forgiveness. Should he speak as if he were her
      master? He would look like a fool, and, besides, he really had no right to
      do so.

During his absence she had hastily arranged her dress and hair, and was
      now lying stretched out on the seat, radiant, and without showing any
      emotion.

He turned to her, and said: “My dear Bertha, since this singular
      chance has brought up together after a separation of six years—a
      quite friendly separation—are we to continue to look upon each other
      as irreconcilable enemies? We are shut up together, tete-a-tete, which is
      so much the better or so much the worse. I am not going to get into
      another carriage, so don''t you think it is preferable to talk as friends
      till the end of our journey?”

Then he suddenly stopped, really not knowing what to say; but as he had
      plenty of assurance, he sat down on the middle seat, and said:

“Well, I see I must pay my court to you; so much the better. It is,
      however, really a pleasure, for you are charming. You cannot imagine how
      you have improved in the last six years. I do not know any woman who could
      give me that delightful sensation which I experienced just now when you
      emerged from your wraps. I really could not have thought such a change
      possible.”

Without moving her head or looking at him, she said: “I cannot say
      the same with regard to you; you have certainly deteriorated a great deal.”

“Why?” was her reply. “I am only stating facts. I don''t
      suppose you intend to offer me your love? It must, therefore, be a matter
      of perfect indifference to you what I think about you. But I see it is a
      painful subject, so let us talk of something else. What have you been
      doing since I last saw you?”

He was very nearly saying something brutal, but he checked himself; and
      kissed his wife''s hand:

He went on: “As you have acceded to my first request, shall we now
      talk without any bitterness?”

“Bitterness? I don''t feel any; you are a complete stranger to me; I
      am only trying to keep up a difficult conversation.”

He was still looking at her, fascinated in spite of her harshness, and he
      felt seized with a brutal Beside, the desire of the master.

“I am forty-five”; and then he added: “I forgot to ask
      after Princesse de Raynes. Are you still intimate with her?”

“My dear Bertha, I have changed my mind. You are my wife, and I
      expect you to come with me to-day. You have, I think, improved both
      morally and physically, and I am going to take you back again. I am your
      husband, and it is my right to do so.”

She was stupefied, and looked at him, trying to divine his thoughts; but
      his face was resolute and impenetrable.

“So much the worse for you,” was his reply. “The law
      gives me the power, and I mean to use it.”

They were nearing Marseilles, and the train whistled and slackened speed.
      The baroness rose, carefully rolled up her wraps, and then, turning to her
      husband, said:

“My dear Raymond, do not make a bad use of this tete-a tete which I
      had carefully prepared. I wished to take precautions, according to your
      advice, so that I might have nothing to fear from you or from other
      people, whatever might happen. You are going to Nice, are you not?”

“Not at all; just listen to me, and I am sure that you will leave me
      in peace. In a few moments, when we get to the station, you will see the
      Princesse de Raynes and Comtesse Henriot waiting for me with their
      husbands. I wished them to see as, and to know that we had spent the night
      together in the railway carriage. Don''t be alarmed; they will tell it
      everywhere as a most surprising fact.

“I told you just now that I had most carefully followed your advice
      and saved appearances. Anything else does not matter, does it? Well, in
      order to do so, I wished to be seen with you. You told me carefully to
      avoid any scandal, and I am avoiding it, for, I am afraid—I am
      afraid—”

She waited till the train had quite stopped, and as her friends ran up to
      open the carriage door, she said:

The princess stretched out her arms to embrace her,—and the baroness
      said, painting to the baron, who was dumb with astonishment, and was
      trying to get at the truth:

“You do not recognize Raymond? He has certainly changed a good deal,
      and he agreed to come with me so that I might not travel alone. We take
      little trips like this occasionally, like good friends who cannot live
      together. We are going to separate here; he has had enough of me already.”

She put out her hand, which he took mechanically, and then she jumped out
      on to the platform among her friends, who were waiting for her.

The baron hastily shut the carriage door, for he was too much disturbed to
      say a word or come to any determination. He heard his wife''s voice and
      their merry laughter as they went away.

He never saw her again, nor did he ever discover whether she had told him
      a lie or was speaking the truth.

How is it that the sunlight gives us such joy? Why does this radiance when
      it falls on the earth fill us with the joy of living? The whole sky is
      blue, the fields are green, the houses all white, and our enchanted eyes
      drink in those bright colors which bring delight to our souls. And then
      there springs up in our hearts a desire to dance, to run, to sing, a happy
      lightness of thought, a sort of enlarged tenderness; we feel a longing to
      embrace the sun.

The blind, as they sit in the doorways, impassive in their eternal
      darkness, remain as calm as ever in the midst of this fresh gaiety, and,
      not understanding what is taking place around them, they continually check
      their dogs as they attempt to play.

When, at the close of the day, they are returning home on the arm of a
      young brother or a little sister, if the child says: “It was a very
      fine day!” the other answers: “I could notice that it was
      fine. Loulou wouldn''t keep quiet.”

I knew one of these men whose life was one of the most cruel martyrdoms
      that could possibly be conceived.

He was a peasant, the son of a Norman farmer. As long as his father and
      mother lived, he was more or less taken care of; he suffered little save
      from his horrible infirmity; but as soon as the old people were gone, an
      atrocious life of misery commenced for him. Dependent on a sister of his,
      everybody in the farmhouse treated him as a beggar who is eating the bread
      of strangers. At every meal the very food he swallowed was made a subject
      of reproach against him; he was called a drone, a clown, and although his
      brother-in-law had taken possession of his portion of the inheritance, he
      was helped grudgingly to soup, getting just enough to save him from
      starving.

His face was very pale and his two big white eyes looked like wafers. He
      remained unmoved at all the insults hurled at him, so reserved that one
      could not tell whether he felt them.

Moreover, he had never known any tenderness, his mother having always
      treated him unkindly and caring very little for him; for in country places
      useless persons are considered a nuisance, and the peasants would be glad
      to kill the infirm of their species, as poultry do.

As soon as he finished his soup he went and sat outside the door in summer
      and in winter beside the fireside, and did not stir again all the evening.
      He made no gesture, no movement; only his eyelids, quivering from some
      nervous affection, fell down sometimes over his white, sightless orbs. Had
      he any intellect, any thinking faculty, any consciousness of his own
      existence? Nobody cared to inquire.

For some years things went on in this fashion. But his incapacity for work
      as well as his impassiveness eventually exasperated his relatives, and he
      became a laughingstock, a sort of butt for merriment, a prey to the inborn
      ferocity, to the savage gaiety of the brutes who surrounded him.

It is easy to imagine all the cruel practical jokes inspired by his
      blindness. And, in order to have some fun in return for feeding him, they
      now converted his meals into hours of pleasure for the neighbors and of
      punishment for the helpless creature himself.

The peasants from the nearest houses came to this entertainment; it was
      talked about from door to door, and every day the kitchen of the farmhouse
      was full of people. Sometimes they placed before his plate, when he was
      beginning to eat his soup, some cat or dog. The animal instinctively
      perceived the man''s infirmity, and, softly approaching, commenced eating
      noiselessly, lapping up the soup daintily; and, when they lapped the food
      rather noisily, rousing the poor fellow''s attention, they would prudently
      scamper away to avoid the blow of the spoon directed at random by the
      blind man!

Then the spectators ranged along the wall would burst out laughing, nudge
      each other and stamp their feet on the floor. And he, without ever
      uttering a word, would continue eating with his right hand, while
      stretching out his left to protect his plate.

Another time they made him chew corks, bits of wood, leaves or even filth,
      which he was unable to distinguish.

After this they got tired even of these practical jokes, and the
      brother-in-law, angry at having to support him always, struck him, cuffed
      him incessantly, laughing at his futile efforts to ward off or return the
      blows. Then came a new pleasure—the pleasure of smacking his face.
      And the plough-men, the servant girls and even every passing vagabond were
      every moment giving him cuffs, which caused his eyelashes to twitch
      spasmodically. He did not know where to hide himself and remained with his
      arms always held out to guard against people coming too close to him.

He was placed somewhere on the high-road on market-days, and as soon as he
      heard the sound of footsteps or the rolling of a vehicle, he reached out
      his hat, stammering:

One winter the ground was covered with snow, and it was freezing hard. His
      brother-in-law led him one morning a great distance along the high road in
      order that he might solicit alms. The blind man was left there all day;
      and when night came on, the brother-in-law told the people of his house
      that he could find no trace of the mendicant. Then he added:

“Pooh! best not bother about him! He was cold and got someone to
      take him away. Never fear! he''s not lost. He''ll turn up soon enough
      tomorrow to eat the soup.”

After long hours of waiting, stiffened with the cold, feeling that he was
      dying, the blind man began to walk. Being unable to find his way along the
      road, owing to its thick coating of ice, he went on at random, falling
      into ditches, getting up again, without uttering a sound, his sole object
      being to find some house where he could take shelter.

But, by degrees, the descending snow made a numbness steal over him, and
      his feeble limbs being incapable of carrying him farther, he sat down in
      the middle of an open field. He did not get up again.

The white flakes which fell continuously buried him, so that his body,
      quite stiff and stark, disappeared under the incessant accumulation of
      their rapidly thickening mass, and nothing was left to indicate the place
      where he lay.

His relatives made a pretence of inquiring about him and searching for him
      for about a week. They even made a show of weeping.

The winter was severe, and the thaw did not set in quickly. Now, one
      Sunday, on their way to mass, the farmers noticed a great flight of crows,
      who were whirling incessantly above the open field, and then descending
      like a shower of black rain at the same spot, ever going and coming.

The following week these gloomy birds were still there. There was a crowd
      of them up in the air, as if they had gathered from all corners of the
      horizon, and they swooped down with a great cawing into the shining snow,
      which they covered like black patches, and in which they kept pecking
      obstinately. A young fellow went to see what they were doing and
      discovered the body of the blind man, already half devoured, mangled. His
      wan eyes had disappeared, pecked out by the long, voracious beaks.

And I can never feel the glad radiance of sunlit days without sadly
      remembering and pondering over the fate of the beggar who was such an
      outcast in life that his horrible death was a relief to all who had known
      him.

They had loved each other before marriage with a pure and lofty love. They
      had first met on the sea-shore. He had thought this young girl charming,
      as she passed by with her light-colored parasol and her dainty dress amid
      the marine landscape against the horizon. He had loved her, blond and
      slender, in these surroundings of blue ocean and spacious sky. He could
      not distinguish the tenderness which this budding woman awoke in him from
      the vague and powerful emotion which the fresh salt air and the grand
      scenery of surf and sunshine and waves aroused in his soul.

She, on the other hand, had loved him because he courted her, because he
      was young, rich, kind, and attentive. She had loved him because it is
      natural for young girls to love men who whisper sweet nothings to them.

So, for three months, they had lived side by side, and hand in hand. The
      greeting which they exchanged in the morning before the bath, in the
      freshness of the morning, or in the evening on the sand, under the stars,
      in the warmth of a calm night, whispered low, very low, already had the
      flavor of kisses, though their lips had never met.

Each dreamed of the other at night, each thought of the other on awaking,
      and, without yet having voiced their sentiments, each longing for the
      other, body and soul.

After marriage their love descended to earth. It was at first a tireless,
      sensuous passion, then exalted tenderness composed of tangible poetry,
      more refined caresses, and new and foolish inventions. Every glance and
      gesture was an expression of passion.

But, little by little, without even noticing it, they began to get tired
      of each other. Love was still strong, but they had nothing more to reveal
      to each other, nothing more to learn from each other, no new tale of
      endearment, no unexpected outburst, no new way of expressing the
      well-known, oft-repeated verb.

They tried, however, to rekindle the dwindling flame of the first love.
      Every day they tried some new trick or desperate attempt to bring back to
      their hearts the uncooled ardor of their first days of married life. They
      tried moonlight walks under the trees, in the sweet warmth of the summer
      evenings: the poetry of mist-covered beaches; the excitement of public
      festivals.

He looked at her with a questioning glance, seeing that she was thinking
      of something which she did not wish to tell.

He smiled: “Of course, I understand—you mean in one of the
      cafes which are commonly called bohemian.”

“Yes, that''s it. But take me to one of the big places, one where you
      are known, one where you have already supped—no—dined—well,
      you know—I—I—oh! I will never dare say it!”

“Well, I—I—I want to be taken for your sweetheart—there!
      and I want the boys, who do not know that you are married, to take me for
      such; and you too—I want you to think that I am your sweetheart for
      one hour, in that place which must hold so many memories for you. There!
      And I will play that I am your sweetheart. It''s awful, I know—I am
      abominably ashamed, I am as red as a peony. Don''t look at me!”

Toward seven o''clock they went up the stairs of one of the big cafes on
      the Boulevard, he, smiling, with the look of a conqueror, she, timid,
      veiled, delighted. They were immediately shown to one of the luxurious
      private dining-rooms, furnished with four large arm-chairs and a red plush
      couch. The head waiter entered and brought them the menu. Paul handed it
      to his wife.

After handing his coat to the waiter, he ordered dinner and champagne. The
      waiter looked at the young woman and smiled. He took the order and
      murmured:

Henriette was pleased to hear that this man knew her husband''s name. They
      sat on the couch, side by side, and began to eat.

Ten candles lighted the room and were reflected in the mirrors all around
      them, which seemed to increase the brilliancy a thousand-fold. Henriette
      drank glass after glass in order to keep up her courage, although she felt
      dizzy after the first few glasses. Paul, excited by the memories which
      returned to him, kept kissing his wife''s hands. His eyes were sparkling.

She was feeling strangely excited in this new place, restless, pleased, a
      little guilty, but full of life. Two waiters, serious, silent, accustomed
      to seeing and forgetting everything, to entering the room only when it was
      necessary and to leaving it when they felt they were intruding, were
      silently flitting hither and thither.

Toward the middle of the dinner, Henriette was well under the influence of
      champagne. She was prattling along fearlessly, her cheeks flushed, her
      eyes glistening.

He hesitated, a little perplexed, not knowing whether he should hide his
      adventures or boast of them.

“Because it''s dreadful when you think of it—all those women—and
      always—always the same thing. Oh! it''s dreadful, just the same—more
      than a hundred women!”

He was surprised that she should think that dreadful, and answered, with
      the air of superiority which men take with women when they wish to make
      them understand that they have said something foolish:

“Because with one woman you have a real bond of love which attaches
      you to her, while with a hundred women it''s not the same at all. There is
      no real love. I don''t understand how a man can associate with such women.”

She remained thoughtful, staring at her champagne glass. It was full
      —she drank it in one gulp; then putting it back on the table, she
      threw her arms around her husband''s neck and murmured in his ear:

He threw his arms around her in a passionate embrace. A waiter, who was
      just entering, backed out, closing the door discreetly. In about five
      minutes the head waiter came back, solemn and dignified, bringing the
      fruit for dessert. She was once more holding between her fingers a full
      glass, and gazing into the amber liquid as though seeking unknown things.
      She murmured in a dreamy voice:

The small engine attached to the Neuilly steam-tram whistled as it passed
      the Porte Maillot to warn all obstacles to get out of its way and puffed
      like a person out of breath as it sent out its steam, its pistons moving
      rapidly with a noise as of iron legs running. The train was going along
      the broad avenue that ends at the Seine. The sultry heat at the close of a
      July day lay over the whole city, and from the road, although there was
      not a breath of wind stirring, there arose a white, chalky, suffocating,
      warm dust, which adhered to the moist skin, filled the eyes and got into
      the lungs. People stood in the doorways of their houses to try and get a
      breath of air.

The windows of the steam-tram were open and the curtains fluttered in the
      wind. There were very few passengers inside, because on warm days people
      preferred the outside or the platforms. They consisted of stout women in
      peculiar costumes, of those shopkeepers'' wives from the suburbs, who made
      up for the distinguished looks which they did not possess by ill-assumed
      dignity; of men tired from office-work, with yellow faces, stooped
      shoulders, and with one shoulder higher than the other, in consequence of,
      their long hours of writing at a desk. Their uneasy and melancholy faces
      also spoke of domestic troubles, of constant want of money, disappointed
      hopes, for they all belonged to the army of poor, threadbare devils who
      vegetate economically in cheap, plastered houses with a tiny piece of
      neglected garden on the outskirts of Paris, in the midst of those fields
      where night soil is deposited.

A short, corpulent man, with a puffy face, dressed all in black and
      wearing a decoration in his buttonhole, was talking to a tall, thin man,
      dressed in a dirty, white linen suit, the coat all unbuttoned, with a
      white Panama hat on his head. The former spoke so slowly and hesitatingly
      that it occasionally almost seemed as if he stammered; he was Monsieur
      Caravan, chief clerk in the Admiralty. The other, who had formerly been
      surgeon on board a merchant ship, had set up in practice in Courbevoie,
      where he applied the vague remnants of medical knowledge which he had
      retained after an adventurous life, to the wretched population of that
      district. His name was Chenet, and strange rumors were current as to his
      morality.

Monsieur Caravan had always led the normal life of a man in a Government
      office. For the last thirty years he had invariably gone the same way to
      his office every morning, and had met the same men going to business at
      the same time, and nearly on the same spot, and he returned home every
      evening by the same road, and again met the same faces which he had seen
      growing old. Every morning, after buying his penny paper at the corner of
      the Faubourg Saint Honore, he bought two rolls, and then went to his
      office, like a culprit who is giving himself up to justice, and got to his
      desk as quickly as possible, always feeling uneasy; as though he were
      expecting a rebuke for some neglect of duty of which he might have been
      guilty.

Nothing had ever occurred to change the monotonous order of his existence,
      for no event affected him except the work of his office, perquisites,
      gratuities, and promotion. He never spoke of anything but of his duties,
      either at the office, or at home—he had married the portionless
      daughter of one of his colleagues. His mind, which was in a state of
      atrophy from his depressing daily work, had no other thoughts, hopes or
      dreams than such as related to the office, and there was a constant source
      of bitterness that spoilt every pleasure that he might have had, and that
      was the employment of so many naval officials, tinsmiths, as they were
      called because of their silver-lace as first-class clerks; and every
      evening at dinner he discussed the matter hotly with his wife, who shared
      his angry feelings, and proved to their own satisfaction that it was in
      every way unjust to give places in Paris to men who ought properly to have
      been employed in the navy.

He was old now, and had scarcely noticed how his life was passing, for
      school had merely been exchanged for the office without any intermediate
      transition, and the ushers, at whom he had formerly trembled, were
      replaced by his chiefs, of whom he was terribly afraid. When he had to go
      into the rooms of these official despots, it made him tremble from head to
      foot, and that constant fear had given him a very awkward manner in their
      presence, a humble demeanor, and a kind of nervous stammering.

He knew nothing more about Paris than a blind man might know who was led
      to the same spot by his dog every day; and if he read the account of any
      uncommon events or scandals in his penny paper, they appeared to him like
      fantastic tales, which some pressman had made up out of his own head, in
      order to amuse the inferior employees. He did not read the political news,
      which his paper frequently altered as the cause which subsidized it might
      require, for he was not fond of innovations, and when he went through the
      Avenue of the Champs-Elysees every evening, he looked at the surging crowd
      of pedestrians, and at the stream of carriages, as a traveller might who
      has lost his way in a strange country.

As he had completed his thirty years of obligatory service that year, on
      the first of January, he had had the cross of the Legion of Honor bestowed
      upon him, which, in the semi-military public offices, is a recompense for
      the miserable slavery—the official phrase is, loyal services—of
      unfortunate convicts who are riveted to their desk. That unexpected
      dignity gave him a high and new idea of his own capacities, and altogether
      changed him. He immediately left off wearing light trousers and fancy
      waistcoats, and wore black trousers and long coats, on which his ribbon,
      which was very broad, showed off better. He got shaved every morning,
      manicured his nails more carefully, changed his linen every two days, from
      a legitimate sense of what was proper, and out of respect for the national
      Order, of which he formed a part, and from that day he was another
      Caravan, scrupulously clean, majestic and condescending.

At home, he said, “my cross,” at every moment, and he had
      become so proud of it, that he could not bear to see men wearing any other
      ribbon in their button-holes. He became especially angry on seeing strange
      orders: “Which nobody ought to be allowed to wear in France,”
      and he bore Chenet a particular grudge, as he met him on a tram-car every
      evening, wearing a decoration of one kind or another, white, blue, orange,
      or green.

The conversation of the two men, from the Arc de Triomphe to Neuilly, was
      always the same, and on that day they discussed, first of all, various
      local abuses which disgusted them both, and the Mayor of Neuilly received
      his full share of their censure. Then, as invariably happens in the
      company of medical men, Caravan began to enlarge on the chapter of illness,
      as in that manner, he hoped to obtain a little gratuitous advice, if he
      was careful not to show his hand. His mother had been causing him no
      little anxiety for some time; she had frequent and prolonged fainting
      fits, and, although she was ninety, she would not take care of herself.

Caravan grew quite tender-hearted when he mentioned her great age, and
      more than once asked Doctor Chenet, emphasizing the word doctor—although
      he was not fully qualified, being only an Offcier de Sante—whether
      he had often met anyone as old as that. And he rubbed his hands with
      pleasure; not, perhaps, that he cared very much about seeing the good
      woman last forever here on earth, but because the long duration of his
      mother''s life was, as it were an earnest of old age for himself, and he
      continued:

“In my family, we last long, and I am sure that, unless I meet with
      an accident, I shall not die until I am very old.”

The doctor looked at him with pity, and glanced for a moment at his
      neighbor''s red face, his short, thick neck, his “corporation,”
      as Chenet called it to himself, his two fat, flabby legs, and the
      apoplectic rotundity of the old official; and raising the white Panama hat
      from his head, he said with a snigger:

“I am not so sure of that, old fellow; your mother is as tough as
      nails, and I should say that your life is not a very good one.”

This rather upset Caravan, who did not speak again until the tram put them
      down at their destination, where the two friends got out, and Chenet asked
      his friend to have a glass of vermouth at the Cafe du Globe, opposite,
      which both of them were in the habit of frequenting. The proprietor, who
      was a friend of theirs, held out to them two fingers, which they shook
      across the bottles of the counter; and then they joined three of their
      friends, who were playing dominoes, and who had been there since midday.
      They exchanged cordial greetings, with the usual question: “Anything
      new?” And then the three players continued their game, and held out
      their hands without looking up, when the others wished them “Good-night,”
      and then they both went home to dinner.

Caravan lived in a small two-story house in Courbevaie, near where the
      roads meet; the ground floor was occupied by a hair-dresser. Two bed
      rooms, a dining-room and a kitchen, formed the whole of their apartments,
      and Madame Caravan spent nearly her whole time in cleaning them up, while
      her daughter, Marie-Louise, who was twelve, and her son, Phillip-Auguste,
      were running about with all the little, dirty, mischievous brats of the
      neighborhood, and playing in the gutter.

Caravan had installed his mother, whose avarice was notorious in the
      neighborhood, and who was terribly thin, in the room above them. She was
      always cross, and she never passed a day without quarreling and flying
      into furious tempers. She would apostrophize the neighbors, who were
      standing at their own doors, the coster-mongers, the street-sweepers, and
      the street-boys, in the most violent language; and the latter, to have
      their revenge, used to follow her at a distance when she went out, and
      call out rude things after her.

A little servant from Normandy, who was incredibly giddy and thoughtless,
      performed the household work, and slept on the second floor in the same
      room as the old woman, for fear of anything happening to her in the night.

When Caravan got in, his wife, who suffered from a chronic passion for
      cleaning, was polishing up the mahogany chairs that were scattered about
      the room with a piece of flannel. She always wore cotton gloves, and
      adorned her head with a cap ornamented with many colored ribbons, which
      was always tilted over one ear; and whenever anyone caught her polishing,
      sweeping, or washing, she used to say:

“I am not rich; everything is very simple in my house, but
      cleanliness is my luxury, and that is worth quite as much as any other.”

As she was gifted with sound, obstinate, practical common sense, she led
      her husband in everything. Every evening during dinner, and afterwards
      when they were in their room, they talked over the business of the office
      for a long time, and although she was twenty years younger than he was, he
      confided everything to her as if she took the lead, and followed her
      advice in every matter.

She had never been pretty, and now she had grown ugly; in addition to
      that, she was short and thin, while her careless and tasteless way of
      dressing herself concealed her few small feminine attractions, which might
      have been brought out if she had possessed any taste in dress. Her skirts
      were always awry, and she frequently scratched herself, no matter on what
      part of her person, totally indifferent as to who might see her, and so
      persistently, that anyone who saw her might think that she was suffering
      from something like the itch. The only adornments that she allowed herself
      were silk ribbons, which she had in great profusion, and of various colors
      mixed together, in the pretentious caps which she wore at home.

He fell into a chair, in consternation, for that was the fourth time on
      which he had forgotten a commission that he had promised to do for her.

“It is a fatality,” he said; “it is no good for me to
      think of it all day long, for I am sure to forget it in the evening.”

“Yes, a great piece of news; another tinsmith has been appointed
      second chief clerk.” She became very serious, and said:

“So he succeeds Ramon; this was the very post that I wanted you to
      have. And what about Ramon?”

“There is nothing more to be done in that shop now. And what is the
      name of the new commissioner?”

“''Bonassot-Toulon. Born in 1851. Student Commissioner in 1871.
      Sub-Commissioner in 1875.'' Has he been to sea?” she continued. At
      that question Caravan''s looks cleared up, and he laughed until his sides
      shook.

“As much as Balin—as much as Baffin, his chief.” And he
      added an old office joke, and laughed more than ever:

“It would not even do to send them by water to inspect the
      Point-du-Jour, for they would be sick on the penny steamboats on the
      Seine.”

But she remained as serious as if she had not heard him, and then she said
      in a low voice, as she scratched her chin:

“If we only had a Deputy to fall back upon. When the Chamber hears
      everything that is going on at the Admiralty, the Minister will be turned
      out——”

She was interrupted by a terrible noise on the stairs. Marie-Louise and
      Philippe-Auguste, who had just come in from the gutter, were slapping each
      other all the way upstairs. Their mother rushed at them furiously, and
      taking each of them by an arm she dragged them into the room, shaking them
      vigorously; but as soon as they saw their father, they rushed up to him,
      and he kissed them affectionately, and taking one of them on each knee,
      began to talk to them.

Philippe-Auguste was an ugly, ill-kempt little brat, dirty from head to
      foot, with the face of an idiot, and Marie-Louise was already like her
      mother—spoke like her, repeated her words, and even imitated her
      movements. She also asked him whether there was anything fresh at the
      office, and he replied merrily:

“Your friend, Ramon, who comes and dines here every Sunday, is going
      to leave us, little one. There is a new second head-clerk.”

He stopped laughing, and did not reply, and in order to create a
      diversion, he said, addressing his wife, who was cleaning the windows:

Madame Caravan left off rubbing, turned round pulled her cap up, as it had
      fallen quite on to her back, and said with trembling lips:

“Ah! yes; let us talk about your mother, for she has made a pretty
      scene. Just imagine: a short time ago Madame Lebaudin, the hairdresser''s
      wife, came upstairs to borrow a packet of starch of me, and, as I was not
      at home, your mother chased her out as though she were a beggar; but I
      gave it to the old woman. She pretended not to hear, as she always does
      when one tells her unpleasant truths, but she is no more deaf than I am,
      as you know. It is all a sham, and the proof of it is, that she went up to
      her own room immediately, without saying a word.”

Caravan, embarrassed, did not utter a word, and at that moment the little
      servant came in to announce dinner. In order to let his mother know, he
      took a broom-handle, which always stood in a corner, and rapped loudly on
      the ceiling three times, and then they went into the dining-room. Madame
      Caravan, junior, helped the soup, and waited for the old woman, but she
      did not come, and as the soup was getting cold, they began to eat slowly,
      and when their plates were empty, they waited again, and Madame Caravan,
      who was furious, attacked her husband:

Not knowing which side to take, he sent Marie-Louise to fetch her
      grandmother, and he sat motionless, with his eyes cast down, while his
      wife tapped her glass angrily with her knife. In about a minute, the door
      flew open suddenly, and the child came in again, out of breath and very
      pale, and said hurriedly:

Caravan jumped up, threw his table-napkin down, and rushed upstairs, while
      his wife, who thought it was some trick of her mother-in-law''s, followed
      more slowly, shrugging her shoulders, as if to express her doubt. When
      they got upstairs, however, they found the old woman lying at full length
      in the middle of the room; and when they turned her over, they saw that
      she was insensible and motionless, while her skin looked more wrinkled and
      yellow than usual, her eyes were closed, her teeth clenched, and her thin
      body was stiff.

“Bah! She has only fainted again, that is all, and she has done it
      to prevent us from dining comfortably, you may be sure of that.”

They put her on the bed, undressed her completely, and Caravan, his wife,
      and the servant began to rub her; but, in spite of their efforts, she did
      not recover consciousness, so they sent Rosalie, the servant, to fetch
      Doctor Chenet. He lived a long way off, on the quay, going towards
      Suresnes, and so it was a considerable time before he arrived. He came at
      last, however, and, after having looked at the old woman, felt her pulse,
      and listened for a heart beat, he said: “It is all over.”

Caravan threw himself on the body, sobbing violently; he kissed his
      mother''s rigid face, and wept so that great tears fell on the dead woman''s
      face like drops of water, and, naturally, Madame Caravan, junior, showed a
      decorous amount of grief, and uttered feeble moans as she stood behind her
      husband, while she rubbed her eyes vigorously.

But, suddenly, Caravan raised himself up, with his thin hair in disorder,
      and, looking very ugly in his grief, said:

The doctor stooped over the body, and, handling it with professional
      dexterity, as a shopkeeper might do, when showing off his goods, he said:

He raised the eyelid, and the old woman''s eye appeared altogether
      unaltered, unless, perhaps, the pupil was rather larger, and Caravan felt
      a severe shock at the sight. Then Monsieur Chenet took her thin arm,
      forced the fingers open, and said, angrily, as if he had been
      contradicted:

Caravan fell on the bed, and almost bellowed, while his wife, still
      whimpering, did what was necessary.

She brought the night-table, on which she spread a towel and placed four
      wax candles on it, which she lighted; then she took a sprig of box, which
      was hanging over the chimney glass, and put it between the four candles,
      in a plate, which she filled with clean water, as she had no holy water.
      But, after a moment''s rapid reflection, she threw a pinch of salt into the
      water, no doubt thinking she was performing some sort of act of
      consecration by doing that, and when she had finished, she remained
      standing motionless, and the doctor, who had been helping her, whispered
      to her:

She nodded assent, and, going up to her husband, who was still on his
      knees, sobbing, she raised him up by one arm, while Chenet took him by the
      other.

They put him into a chair, and his wife kissed his forehead, and then
      began to lecture him. Chenet enforced her words and preached firmness,
      courage, and resignation—the very things which are always wanting in
      such overwhelming misfortunes—and then both of them took him by the
      arms again and led him out.

He was crying like a great child, with convulsive sobs; his arms hanging
      down, and his legs weak, and he went downstairs without knowing what he
      was doing, and moving his feet mechanically. They put him into the chair
      which he always occupied at dinner, in front of his empty soup plate. And
      there he sat, without moving, his eyes fixed on his glass, and so
      stupefied with grief, that he could not even think.

In a corner, Madame Caravan was talking with the doctor and asking what
      the necessary formalities were, as she wanted to obtain practical
      information. At last, Monsieur Chenet, who appeared to be waiting for
      something, took up his hat and prepared to go, saying that he had not
      dined yet; whereupon she exclaimed:

“What! you have not dined? Why, stay here, doctor; don''t go. You
      shall have whatever we have, for, of course, you understand that we do not
      fare sumptuously.” He made excuses and refused, but she persisted,
      and said: “You really must stay; at times like this, people like to
      have friends near them, and, besides that, perhaps you will be able to
      persuade my husband to take some nourishment; he must keep up his
      strength.”

She gave Rosalie, who seemed to have lost her head, some orders, and then
      sat down, “to pretend to eat,” as she said, “to keep the
      doctor company.”

The soup was brought in again, and Monsieur Chenet took two helpings. Then
      there came a dish of tripe, which exhaled a smell of onions, and which
      Madame Caravan made up her mind to taste.

“It is excellent,” the doctor said, at which she smiled, and,
      turning to her husband, she said:

“Do take a little, my poor Alfred, only just to put something in
      your stomach. Remember that you have got to pass the night watching by
      her!”

He held out his plate, docilely, just as he would have gone to bed, if he
      had been told to, obeying her in everything, without resistance and
      without reflection, and he ate; the doctor helped himself three times,
      while Madame Caravan, from time to time, fished out a large piece at the
      end of her fork, and swallowed it with a sort of studied indifference.

“By Jove! That is what I am very fond of.” And this time,
      Madame Caravan helped everybody. She even filled the saucers that were
      being scraped by the children, who, being left to themselves, had been
      drinking wine without any water, and were now kicking each other under the
      table.

Chenet remembered that Rossini, the composer, had been very fond of that
      Italian dish, and suddenly he exclaimed:

Nobody listened to him, however. Madame Caravan, who had suddenly grown
      thoughtful, was thinking of all the probable consequences of the event,
      while her husband made bread pellets, which he put on the table-cloth, and
      looked at with a fixed, idiotic stare. As he was devoured by thirst, he
      was continually raising his glass full of wine to his lips, and the
      consequence was that his mind, which had been upset by the shock and
      grief, seemed to become vague, and his ideas danced about as digestion
      commenced.

The doctor, who, meanwhile, had been drinking away steadily, was getting
      visibly drunk, and Madame Caravan herself felt the reaction which follows
      all nervous shocks, and was agitated and excited, and, although she had
      drunk nothing but water, her head felt rather confused.

Presently, Chenet began to relate stories of death that appeared comical
      to him. For in that suburb of Paris, that is full of people from the
      provinces, one finds that indifference towards death which all peasants
      show, were it even their own father or mother; that want of respect, that
      unconscious brutality which is so common in the country, and so rare in
      Paris, and he said:

“Why, I was sent for last week to the Rue du Puteaux, and when I
      went, I found the patient dead and the whole family calmly sitting beside
      the bed finishing a bottle of aniseed cordial, which had been bought the
      night before to satisfy the dying man''s fancy.”

But Madame Caravan was not listening; she was continually thinking of the
      inheritance, and Caravan was incapable of understanding anything further.

Coffee was presently served, and it had been made very strong to give them
      courage. As every cup was well flavored with cognac, it made all their
      faces red, and confused their ideas still more. To make matters still
      worse, Chenet suddenly seized the brandy bottle and poured out “a
      drop for each of them just to wash their mouths out with,” as he
      termed it, and then, without speaking any more, overcome in spite of
      themselves, by that feeling of animal comfort which alcohol affords after
      dinner, they slowly sipped the sweet cognac, which formed a yellowish
      syrup at the bottom of their cups.

The children had fallen asleep, and Rosalie carried them off to bed.
      Caravan, mechanically obeying that wish to forget oneself which possesses
      all unhappy persons, helped himself to brandy again several times, and his
      dull eyes grew bright. At last the doctor rose to go, and seizing his
      friend''s arm, he said:

“Come with me; a little fresh air will do you good. When one is in
      trouble, one must not remain in one spot.”

The other obeyed mechanically, put on his hat, took his stick, and went
      out, and both of them walked arm-in-arm towards the Seine, in the
      starlight night.

The air was warm and sweet, for all the gardens in the neighborhood were
      full of flowers at this season of the year, and their fragrance, which is
      scarcely perceptible during the day, seemed to awaken at the approach of
      night, and mingled with the light breezes which blew upon them in the
      darkness.

The broad avenue with its two rows of gas lamps, that extended as far as
      the Arc de Triomphe, was deserted and silent, but there was the distant
      roar of Paris, which seemed to have a reddish vapor hanging over it. It
      was a kind of continual rumbling, which was at times answered by the
      whistle of a train in the distance, travelling at full speed to the ocean,
      through the provinces.

The fresh air on the faces of the two men rather overcame them at first,
      made the doctor lose his equilibrium a little, and increased Caravan''s
      giddiness, from which he had suffered since dinner. He walked as if he
      were in a dream; his thoughts were paralyzed, although he felt no great
      grief, for he was in a state of mental torpor that prevented him from
      suffering, and he even felt a sense of relief which was increased by the
      mildness of the night.

When they reached the bridge, they turned to the right, and got the fresh
      breeze from the river, which rolled along, calm and melancholy, bordered
      by tall poplar trees, while the stars looked as if they were floating on
      the water and were moving with the current. A slight white mist that
      floated over the opposite banks, filled their lungs with a sensation of
      cold, and Caravan stopped suddenly, for he was struck by that smell from
      the water which brought back old memories to his mind. For, in his mind,
      he suddenly saw his mother again, in Picardy, as he had seen her years
      before, kneeling in front of their door, and washing the heaps of linen at
      her side in the stream that ran through their garden. He almost fancied
      that he could hear the sound of the wooden paddle with which she beat the
      linen in the calm silence of the country, and her voice, as she called out
      to him: “Alfred, bring me some soap.” And he smelled that odor
      of running water, of the mist rising from the wet ground, that marshy
      smell, which he should never forget, and which came back to him on this
      very evening on which his mother had died.

He stopped, seized with a feeling of despair. A sudden flash seemed to
      reveal to him the extent of his calamity, and that breath from the river
      plunged him into an abyss of hopeless grief. His life seemed cut in half,
      his youth disappeared, swallowed up by that death. All the former days
      were over and done with, all the recollections of his youth had been swept
      away; for the future, there would be nobody to talk to him of what had
      happened in days gone by, of the people he had known of old, of his own
      part of the country, and of his past life; that was a part of his
      existence which existed no longer, and the rest might as well end now.

And then he saw “the mother” as she was when young, wearing
      well-worn dresses, which he remembered for such a long time that they
      seemed inseparable from her; he recollected her movements, the different
      tones of her voice, her habits, her predilections, her fits of anger, the
      wrinkles on her face, the movements of her thin fingers, and all her
      well-known attitudes, which she would never have again, and clutching hold
      of the doctor, he began to moan and weep. His thin legs began to tremble,
      his whole stout body was shaken by his sobs, all he could say was:

But his companion, who was still drunk, and who intended to finish the
      evening in certain places of bad repute that he frequented secretly, made
      him sit down on the grass by the riverside, and left him almost
      immediately, under the pretext that he had to see a patient.

Caravan went on crying for some time, and when he had got to the end of
      his tears, when his grief had, so to say, run out, he again felt relief,
      repose and sudden tranquillity.

The tall poplar trees had a silvery sheen on them, and the mist on the
      plain looked like drifting snow; the river, in which the stars were
      reflected, and which had a sheen as of mother-of-pearl, was gently rippled
      by the wind. The air was soft and sweet, and Caravan inhaled it almost
      greedily, and thought that he could perceive a feeling of freshness, of
      calm and of superhuman consolation pervading him.

He actually resisted that feeling of comfort and relief, and kept on
      saying to himself: “My poor mother, my poor mother!” and tried
      to make himself cry, from a kind of conscientious feeling; but he could
      not succeed in doing so any longer, and those sad thoughts, which had made
      him sob so bitterly a shore time before, had almost passed away. In a few
      moments, he rose to go home, and returned slowly, under the influence of
      that serene night, and with a heart soothed in spite of himself.

When he reached the bridge, he saw that the last tramcar was ready to
      start, and behind it were the brightly lighted windows of the Cafe du
      Globe. He felt a longing to tell somebody of his loss, to excite pity, to
      make himself interesting. He put on a woeful face, pushed open the door,
      and went up to the counter, where the landlord still was. He had counted
      on creating a sensation, and had hoped that everybody would get up and
      come to him with outstretched hands, and say: “Why, what is the
      matter with you?” But nobody noticed his disconsolate face, so he
      rested his two elbows on the counter, and, burying his face in his hands,
      he murmured: “Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!”

“Ah!” the other exclaimed, and as a customer at the other end
      of the establishment asked for a glass of Bavarian beer, he went to attend
      to him, leaving Caravan dumfounded at his want of sympathy.

The three domino players were sitting at the same table which they had
      occupied before dinner, totally absorbed in their game, and Caravan went
      up to them, in search of pity, but as none of them appeared to notice him
      he made up his mind to speak.

All three slightly raised their heads at the same instant, but keeping
      their eyes fixed on the pieces which they held in their hands.

“Oh! the devil,” with that false air of sorrow which
      indifferent people assume. Another, who could not find anything to say,
      emitted a sort of sympathetic whistle, shaking his head at the same time,
      and the third turned to the game again, as if he were saying to himself:
      “Is that all!”

Caravan had expected some of these expressions that are said to “come
      from the heart,” and when he saw how his news was received, he left
      the table, indignant at their calmness at their friend''s sorrow, although
      this sorrow had stupefied him so that he scarcely felt it any longer. When
      he got home his wife was waiting for him in her nightgown, and sitting in
      a low chair by the open window, still thinking of the inheritance.

“I beg your pardon, Rosalie is with her, and you can go and take her
      place at three o''clock in the morning, when you have had some sleep.”

He only partially undressed, however, so as to be ready for anything that
      might happen, and after tying a silk handkerchief round his head, he lay
      down to rest, and for some time neither of them spoke. Madame Caravan was
      thinking.

Her nightcap was adorned with a red bow, and was pushed rather to one
      side, as was the way with all the caps she wore, and presently she turned
      towards him and said:

“I call that infamous; here we have been wearing ourselves out for
      ten years in looking after her, and have boarded and lodged her! Your
      sister would not have done so much for her, nor I either, if I had known
      how I was to be rewarded! Yes, it is a disgrace to her memory! I dare say
      that you will tell me that she paid us, but one cannot pay one''s children
      in ready money for what they do; that obligation is recognized after
      death; at any rate, that is how honorable people act. So I have had all my
      worry and trouble for nothing! Oh, that is nice! that is very nice!”

“Of course we must; I had forgotten all about it; I will send her a
      telegram the first thing in the morning.”

“No,” she replied, like a woman who had foreseen everything;
      “no, do not send it before ten or eleven o''clock, so that we may
      have time to turn round before she comes. It does not take more than two
      hours to get here from Charenton, and we can say that you lost your head
      from grief. If we let her know in the course of the day, that will be soon
      enough, and will give us time to look round.”

Caravan put his hand to his forehead, and, in the came timid voice in
      which he always spoke of his chief, the very thought of whom made him
      tremble, he said:

“Why?” she replied. “On occasions like this, it is
      always excusable to forget. Take my advice, and don''t let him know; your
      chief will not be able to say anything to you, and you will put him in a
      nice fix.

“Oh! yes, that I shall, and he will be in a terrible rage, too, when
      he notices my absence. Yes, you are right; it is a capital idea, and when
      I tell him that my mother is dead, he will be obliged to hold his tongue.”

And he rubbed his hands in delight at the joke, when he thought of his
      chief''s face; while upstairs lay the body of the dead old woman, with the
      servant asleep beside it.

But Madame Caravan grew thoughtful, as if she were preoccupied by
      something which she did not care to mention, and at last she said:

“Yes, yes; she said to me (but it was a long time ago, when she
      first came here): ''I shall leave the clock to you, if you look after me
      well.''”

“Well, then, you must go and fetch it out of her room, for if we get
      your sister here, she will prevent us from taking it.”

“I certainly think so; once it is in our possession, she will know
      nothing at all about where it came from; it belongs to us. It is just the
      same with the chest of drawers with the marble top, that is in her room;
      she gave it me one day when she was in a good temper. We will bring it
      down at the same time.”

“Oh! Indeed! Will you never change? You would let your children die
      of hunger, rather than make a move. Does not that chest of drawers belong
      to us, as she gave it to me? And if your sister is not satisfied, let her
      tell me so, me! I don''t care a straw for your sister. Come, get up, and we
      will bring down what your mother gave us, immediately.”

Trembling and vanquished, he got out of bed and began to put on his
      trousers, but she stopped him:

“It is not worth while to dress yourself; your underwear is quite
      enough. I mean to go as I am.”

They both left the room in their night clothes, went upstairs quite
      noiselessly, opened the door and went into the room, where the four
      lighted tapers and the plate with the sprig of box alone seemed to be
      watching the old woman in her rigid repose, for Rosalie, who was lying
      back in the easy chair with her legs stretched out, her hands folded in
      her lap, and her head on one side, was also quite motionless, and was
      snoring with her mouth wide open.

Caravan took the clock, which was one of those grotesque objects that were
      produced so plentifully under the Empire. A girl in gilt bronze was
      holding a cup and ball, and the ball formed the pendulum.

He put the marble slab on his shoulder with considerable effort, and they
      left the room. Caravan had to stoop in the doorway, and trembled as he
      went downstairs, while his wife walked backwards, so as to light him, and
      held the candlestick in one hand, carrying the clock under the other arm.

“We have got over the worst part of the job,” she said;
      “so now let us go and fetch the other things.”

But the bureau drawers were full of the old woman''s wearing apparel, which
      they must manage to hide somewhere, and Madame Caravan soon thought of a
      plan.

“Go and get that wooden packing case in the vestibule; it is hardly
      worth anything, and we may just as well put it here.”

And when he had brought it upstairs they began to fill it. One by one they
      took out all the collars, cuffs, chemises, caps, all the well-worn things
      that had belonged to the poor woman lying there behind them, and arranged
      them methodically in the wooden box in such a manner as to deceive Madame
      Braux, the deceased woman''s other child, who would be coming the next day.

When they had finished, they first of all carried the bureau drawers
      downstairs, and the remaining portion afterwards, each of them holding an
      end, and it was some time before they could make up their minds where it
      would stand best; but at last they decided upon their own room, opposite
      the bed, between the two windows, and as soon as it was in its place
      Madame Caravan filled it with her own things. The clock was placed on the
      chimney-piece in the dining-room, and they looked to see what the effect
      was, and were both delighted with it and agreed that nothing could be
      better. Then they retired, she blew out the candle, and soon everybody in
      the house was asleep.

It was broad daylight when. Caravan opened his eyes again. His mind was
      rather confused when he woke up, and he did not clearly remember what had
      happened for a few minutes; when he did, he felt a weight at his heart,
      and jumped out of bed, almost ready to cry again.

He hastened to the room overhead, where Rosalie was still sleeping in the
      same position as the night before, not having awakened once. He sent her
      to do her work, put fresh tapers in the place of those that had burnt out,
      and then he looked at his mother, revolving in his brain those apparently
      profound thoughts, those religious and philosophical commonplaces which
      trouble people of mediocre intelligence in the presence of death.

But, as his wife was calling him, he went downstairs. She had written out
      a list of what had to be done during the morning, and he was horrified
      when he saw the memorandum:

1. Report the death at the mayor''s office. 2. See the doctor who had
      attended her. 3. Order the coffin. 4. Give notice at the church. 5. Go to
      the undertaker. 6. Order the notices of her death at the printer''s. 7. Go
      to the lawyer. 8. Telegraph the news to all the family.

Besides all this, there were a number of small commissions; so he took his
      hat and went out. As the news had spread abroad, Madame Caravan''s female
      friends and neighbors soon began to come in and begged to be allowed to
      see the body. There had been a scene between husband and wife at the
      hairdresser''s on the ground floor about the matter, while a customer was
      being shaved. The wife, who was knitting steadily, said: “Well,
      there is one less, and as great a miser as one ever meets with. I
      certainly did not care for her; but, nevertheless, I must go and have a
      look at her.”

The husband, while lathering his patient''s chin, said: “That is
      another queer fancy! Nobody but a woman would think of such a thing. It is
      not enough for them to worry you during life, but they cannot even leave
      you at peace when you are dead:” But his wife, without being in the
      least disconcerted, replied: “The feeling is stronger than I am, and
      I must go. It has been on me since the morning. If I were not to see her,
      I should think about it all my life; but when I have had a good look at
      her, I shall be satisfied.”

The knight of the razor shrugged his shoulders and remarked in a low voice
      to the gentleman whose cheek he was scraping: “I just ask you, what
      sort of ideas do you think these confounded females have? I should not
      amuse myself by going to see a corpse!” But his wife had heard him
      and replied very quietly: “But it is so, it is so.” And then,
      putting her knitting on the counter, she went upstairs to the first floor,
      where she met two other neighbors, who had just come, and who were
      discussing the event with Madame Caravan, who was giving them the details,
      and they all went together to the death chamber. The four women went in
      softly, and, one after the other, sprinkled the bed clothes with the salt
      water, knelt down, made the sign of the cross while they mumbled a prayer.
      Then they rose from their knees and looked for some time at the corpse
      with round, wide-open eyes and mouths partly open, while the
      daughter-in-law of the dead woman, with her handkerchief to her face,
      pretended to be sobbing piteously.

When she turned about to walk away whom should she perceive standing close
      to the door but Marie-Louise and Philippe-Auguste, who were curiously
      taking stock of all that was going on. Then, forgetting her pretended
      grief, she threw herself upon them with uplifted hands, crying out in a
      furious voice, “Will you get out of this, you horrid brats!”

Ten minutes later, going upstairs again with another contingent of
      neighbors, she prayed, wept profusely, performed all her duties, and found
      once more her two children, who had followed her upstairs. She again boxed
      their ears soundly, but the next time she paid no heed to them, and at
      each fresh arrival of visitors the two urchins always followed in the
      wake, kneeling down in a corner and imitating slavishly everything they
      saw their mother do.

When the afternoon came the crowds of inquisitive people began to
      diminish, and soon there were no more visitors. Madame Caravan, returning
      to her own apartments, began to make the necessary preparations for the
      funeral ceremony, and the deceased was left alone.

The window of the room was open. A torrid heat entered, along with clouds
      of dust; the flames of the four candles were flickering beside the
      immobile corpse, and upon the cloth which covered the face, the closed
      eyes, the two stretched-out hands, small flies alighted, came, went and
      careered up and down incessantly, being the only companions of the old
      woman for the time being.

Marie-Louise and Philippe-Auguste, however, had now left the house and
      were running up and down the street. They were soon surrounded by their
      playmates, by little girls especially, who were older and who were much
      more interested in all the mysteries of life, asking questions as if they
      were grown people.

“Then your grandmother is dead?” “Yes, she died
      yesterday evening.” “What does a dead person look like?”

Then Marie began to explain, telling all about the candles, the sprig of
      box and the face of the corpse. It was not long before great curiosity was
      aroused in the minds of all the children, and they asked to be allowed to
      go upstairs to look at the departed.

Marie-Louise at once organized a first expedition, consisting of five
      girls and two boys—the biggest and the most courageous. She made
      them take off their shoes so that they might not be discovered. The troupe
      filed into the house and mounted the stairs as stealthily as an army of
      mice.

Once in the chamber, the little girl, imitating her mother, regulated the
      ceremony. She solemnly walked in advance of her comrades, went down on her
      knees, made the sign of the cross, moved her lips as in prayer, rose,
      sprinkled the bed, and while the children, all crowded together, were
      approaching—frightened and curious and eager to look at the face and
      hands of the deceased—she began suddenly to simulate sobbing and to
      bury her eyes in her little handkerchief. Then, becoming instantly
      consoled, on thinking of the other children who were downstairs waiting at
      the door, she ran downstairs followed by the rest, returning in a minute
      with another group, then a third; for all the little ragamuffins of the
      countryside, even to the little beggars in rags, had congregated in order
      to participate in this new pleasure; and each time she repeated her
      mother''s grimaces with absolute perfection.

At length, however, she became tired. Some game or other drew the children
      away from the house, and the old grandmother was left alone, forgotten
      suddenly by everybody.

The room was growing dark, and upon the dry and rigid features of the
      corpse the fitful flames of the candles cast patches of light.

Towards 8 o''clock Caravan ascended to the chamber of death, closed the
      windows and renewed the candles. He was now quite composed on entering the
      room, accustomed already to regard the corpse as though it had been there
      for months. He even went the length of declaring that, as yet, there were
      no signs of decomposition, making this remark just at the moment when he
      and his wife were about to sit down at table. “Pshaw!” she
      responded, “she is now stark and stiff; she will keep for a year.”

The soup was eaten in silence. The children, who had been left to
      themselves all day, now worn out by fatigue, were sleeping soundly on
      their chairs, and nobody ventured to break the silence.

Suddenly the flame of the lamp went down. Madame Caravan immediately
      turned up the wick, a hollow sound ensued, and the light went out. They
      had forgotten to buy oil. To send for it now to the grocer''s would keep
      back the dinner, and they began to look for candles, but none were to be
      found except the tapers which had been placed upon the table upstairs in
      the death chamber.

Madame Caravan, always prompt in her decisions, quickly despatched
      Marie-Louise to fetch two, and her return was awaited in total darkness.

The footsteps of the girl who had ascended the stairs were distinctly
      heard. There was silence for a few seconds and then the child descended
      precipitately. She threw open the door and in a choking voice murmured:
      “Oh! papa, grandmamma is dressing herself!”

Caravan bounded to his feet with such precipitance that his chair fell
      over against the wall. He stammered out: “You say? . . . . What are
      you saying?”

But Marie-Louise, gasping with emotion, repeated: “Grand—grand
      —grandmamma is putting on her clothes, she is coming downstairs.”

Caravan rushed boldly up the staircase, followed by his wife, dumfounded;
      but he came to a standstill before the door of the second floor, overcome
      with terror, not daring to enter. What was he going to see? Madame
      Caravan, more courageous, turned the handle of the door and stepped
      forward into the room.

The old woman was standing up. In awakening from her lethargic sleep,
      before even regaining full consciousness, in turning upon her side and
      raising herself on her elbow, she had extinguished three of the candles
      which burned near the bed. Then, gaining strength, she got off the bed and
      began to look for her clothes. The absence of her chest of drawers had at
      first worried her, but, after a little, she had succeeded in finding her
      things at the bottom of the wooden box, and was now quietly dressing. She
      emptied the plateful of water, replaced the sprig of box behind the
      looking-glass, and arranged the chairs in their places, and was ready to
      go downstairs when there appeared before her her son and daughter-in-law.

Caravan rushed forward, seized her by the hands, embraced her with tears
      in his eyes, while his wife, who was behind him, repeated in a
      hypocritical tone of voice: “Oh, what a blessing! oh, what a
      blessing!”

But the old woman, without being at all moved, without even appearing to
      understand, rigid as a statue, and with glazed eyes, simply asked: “Will
      dinner soon be ready?”

And with an alacrity unusual in him, he took her arm, while Madame
      Caravan, the younger, seized the candle and lighted them downstairs,
      walking backwards in front of them, step by step, just as she had done the
      previous night for her husband, who was carrying the marble.

On reaching the first floor, she almost ran against people who were
      ascending the stairs. It was the Charenton family, Madame Braux, followed
      by her husband.

The wife, tall and stout, with a prominent stomach, opened wide her
      terrified eyes and was ready to make her escape. The husband, a socialist
      shoemaker, a little hairy man, the perfect image of a monkey, murmured
      quite unconcerned: “Well, what next? Is she resurrected?”

As soon as Madame Caravan recognized them, she made frantic gestures to
      them; then, speaking aloud, she said: “Why, here you are! What a
      pleasant surprise!”

But Madame Braux, dumfounded, understood nothing. She responded in a low
      voice: “It was your telegram that brought us; we thought that all
      was over.”

Her husband, who was behind her, pinched her to make her keep silent. He
      added with a sly laugh, which his thick beard concealed: “It was
      very kind of you to invite us here. We set out post haste,” which
      remark showed the hostility which had for a long time reigned between the
      households. Then, just as the old woman reached the last steps, he pushed
      forward quickly and rubbed his hairy face against her cheeks, shouting in
      her ear, on account of her deafness: “How well you look, mother;
      sturdy as usual, hey!”

Madame Braux, in her stupefaction at seeing the old woman alive, whom they
      all believed to be dead, dared not even embrace her; and her enormous bulk
      blocked up the passageway and hindered the others from advancing. The old
      woman, uneasy and suspicious, but without speaking, looked at everyone
      around her; and her little gray eyes, piercing and hard, fixed themselves
      now on one and now on the other, and they were so full of meaning that the
      children became frightened.

Caravan, to explain matters, said: “She has been somewhat ill, but
      she is better now; quite well, indeed, are you not, mother?”

Then the good woman, continuing to walk, replied in a husky voice, as
      though it came from a distance: “It was syncope. I heard you all the
      while.”

An embarrassing silence followed. They entered the dining-room, and in a
      few minutes all sat down to an improvised dinner.

Only M. Braux had retained his self-possession. His gorilla features
      grinned wickedly, while he let fall some words of double meaning which
      painfully disconcerted everyone.

But the door bell kept ringing every second, and Rosalie, distracted, came
      to call Caravan, who rushed out, throwing down his napkin. His
      brother-in-law even asked him whether it was not one of his reception
      days, to which he stammered out in answer: “No, only a few packages;
      nothing more.”

A parcel was brought in, which he began to open carelessly, and the
      mourning announcements with black borders appeared unexpectedly. Reddening
      up to the very eyes, he closed the package hurriedly and pushed it under
      his waistcoat.

His mother had not seen it! She was looking intently at her clock which
      stood on the mantelpiece, and the embarrassment increased in midst of a
      dead silence. Turning her wrinkled face towards her daughter, the old
      woman, in whose eyes gleamed malice, said: “On Monday you must take
      me away from here, so that I can see your little girl. I want so much to
      see her.” Madame Braux, her features all beaming, exclaimed: “Yes,
      mother, that I will,” while Madame Caravan, the younger, who had
      turned pale, was ready to faint with annoyance. The two men, however,
      gradually drifted into conversation and soon became embroiled in a
      political discussion. Braux maintained the most revolutionary and
      communistic doctrines, his eyes glowing, and gesticulating and throwing
      about his arms. “Property, sir,” he said, “is a robbery
      perpetrated on the working classes; the land is the common property of
      every man; hereditary rights are an infamy and a disgrace.” But here
      he suddenly stopped, looking as if he had just said something foolish,
      then added in softer tones: “But this is not the proper moment to
      discuss such things.”

The door was opened and Dr. Chenet appeared. For a moment he seemed
      bewildered, but regaining his usual smirking expression of countenance, he
      jauntily approached the old woman and said: “Aha! mamma; you are
      better to-day. Oh! I never had any doubt but you would come round again;
      in fact, I said to myself as I was mounting the staircase, ''I have an idea
      that I shall find the old lady on her feet once more'';” and as he
      patted her gently on the back: “Ah! she is as solid as the
      Pont-Neuf, she will bury us all; see if she does not.”

He sat down, accepted the coffee that was offered him, and soon began to
      join in the conversation of the two men, backing up Braux, for he himself
      had been mixed up in the Commune.

The old woman, now feeling herself fatigued, wished to retire. Caravan
      rushed forward. She looked him steadily in the eye and said: “You,
      you must carry my clock and chest of drawers upstairs again without a
      moment''s delay.” “Yes, mamma,” he replied, gasping;
      “yes, I will do so.” The old woman then took the arm of her
      daughter and withdrew from the room. The two Caravans remained astounded,
      silent, plunged in the deepest despair, while Braux rubbed his hands and
      sipped his coffee gleefully.

Suddenly Madame Caravan, consumed with rage, rushed at him, exclaiming:
      “You are a thief, a footpad, a cur! I would spit in your face! I—I
      —would——” She could find nothing further to say,
      suffocating as she was with rage, while he went on sipping his coffee with
      a smile.

His wife returning just then, Madame Caravan attacked her sister-in-law,
      and the two women—the one with her enormous bulk, the other
      epileptic and spare, with changed voices and trembling hands flew at one
      another with words of abuse.

Chenet and Braux now interposed, and the latter, taking his better half by
      the shoulders, pushed her out of the door before him, shouting: “Go
      on, you slut; you talk too much”; and the two were heard in the
      street quarrelling until they disappeared from sight.

M. Chenet also took his departure, leaving the Caravans alone, face to
      face. The husband fell back on his chair, and with the cold sweat standing
      out in beads on his temples, murmured: “What shall I say to my chief
      to-morrow?”

He was slowly dying, as consumptives die. I saw him each day, about two
      o''clock, sitting beneath the hotel windows on a bench in the promenade,
      looking out on the calm sea. He remained for some time without moving, in
      the heat of the sun, gazing mournfully at the Mediterranean. Every now and
      then, he cast a glance at the lofty mountains with beclouded summits that
      shut in Mentone; then, with a very slow movement, he would cross his long
      legs, so thin that they seemed like two bones, around which fluttered the
      cloth of his trousers, and he would open a book, always the same book. And
      then he did not stir any more, but read on, read on with his eye and his
      mind; all his wasting body seemed to read, all his soul plunged, lost,
      disappeared, in this book, up to the hour when the cool air made him cough
      a little. Then, he got up and reentered the hotel.

He was a tall German, with fair beard, who breakfasted and dined in his
      own room, and spoke to nobody.

A vague, curiosity attracted me to him. One day, I sat down by his side,
      having taken up a book, too, to keep up appearances, a volume of Musset''s
      poems.

“I am sorry for that. Since chance has thrown us side by side, I
      could have lent you, I could have shown you, an inestimable thing—this
      book which I hold in my hand.”

“It is a copy of my master, Schopenhauer, annotated with his own
      hand. All the margins, as you may see, are covered with his handwriting.”

I took the book from him reverently, and I gazed at these forms
      incomprehensible to me, but which revealed the immortal thoughts of the
      greatest shatterer of dreams who had ever dwelt on earth.

And involuntarily I compared the childish sarcasm, the religious sarcasm
      of Voltaire with the irresistible irony of the German philosopher whose
      influence is henceforth ineffaceable.

Let us protest and let us be angry, let us be indignant, or let us be
      enthusiastic, Schopenhauer has marked humanity with the seal of his
      disdain and of his disenchantment.

A disabused pleasure-seeker, he overthrew beliefs, hopes, poetic ideals
      and chimeras, destroyed the aspirations, ravaged the confidence of souls,
      killed love, dragged down the chivalrous worship of women, crushed the
      illusions of hearts, and accomplished the most gigantic task ever
      attempted by scepticism. He spared nothing with his mocking spirit, and
      exhausted everything. And even to-day those who execrate him seem to carry
      in their own souls particles of his thought.

And he spoke to me about the philosopher and told me about the almost
      supernatural impression which this strange being made on all who came near
      him.

He gave me an account of the interview of the old iconoclast with a French
      politician, a doctrinaire Republican, who wanted to get a glimpse of this
      man, and found him in a noisy tavern, seated in the midst of his
      disciples, dry, wrinkled, laughing with an unforgettable laugh, attacking
      and tearing to pieces ideas and beliefs with a single word, as a dog tears
      with one bite of his teeth the tissues with which he plays.

He repeated for me the comment of this Frenchman as he went away,
      astonished and terrified: “I thought I had spent an hour with the
      devil.”

“He had, indeed, monsieur, a frightful smile, which terrified us
      even after his death. I can tell you an anecdote about it that is not
      generally known, if it would interest you.”

“Schopenhauer had just died, and it was arranged that we should
      watch, in turn, two by two, till morning.

“He was lying in a large apartment, very simple, vast and gloomy.
      Two wax candles were burning on the stand by the bedside.

“It was midnight when I went on watch, together with one of our
      comrades. The two friends whom we replaced had left the apartment, and we
      came and sat down at the foot of the bed.

“The face was not changed. It was laughing. That pucker which we
      knew so well lingered still around the corners of the lips, and it seemed
      to us that he was about to open his eyes, to move and to speak. His
      thought, or rather his thoughts, enveloped us. We felt ourselves more than
      ever in the atmosphere of his genius, absorbed, possessed by him. His
      domination seemed to be even more sovereign now that he was dead. A
      feeling of mystery was blended with the power of this incomparable spirit.

“The bodies of these men disappear, but they themselves remain; and
      in the night which follows the cessation of their heart''s pulsation I
      assure you, monsieur, they are terrifying.

“And in hushed tones we talked about him, recalling to mind certain
      sayings, certain formulas of his, those startling maxims which are like
      jets of flame flung, in a few words, into the darkness of the Unknown
      Life.

“''It seems to me that he is going to speak,'' said my comrade. And we
      stared with uneasiness bordering on fear at the motionless face, with its
      eternal laugh. Gradually, we began to feel ill at ease, oppressed, on the
      point of fainting. I faltered:

“Then, my comrade suggested that we should go into the adjoining
      room, and leave the door open; and I assented to his proposal.

“I took one of the wax candles which burned on the stand, and I left
      the second behind. Then we went and sat down at the other end of the
      adjoining apartment, in such a position that we could see the bed and the
      corpse, clearly revealed by the light.

“But he still held possession of us. One would have said that his
      immaterial essence, liberated, free, all-powerful and dominating, was
      flitting around us. And sometimes, too, the dreadful odor of the
      decomposed body came toward us and penetrated us, sickening and
      indefinable.

“Suddenly a shiver passed through our bones: a sound, a slight
      sound, came from the death-chamber. Immediately we fixed our glances on
      him, and we saw, yes, monsieur, we saw distinctly, both of us, something
      white pass across the bed, fall on the carpet, and vanish under an
      armchair.

“We were on our feet before we had time to think of anything,
      distracted by stupefying terror, ready to run away. Then we stared at each
      other. We were horribly pale. Our hearts throbbed fiercely enough to have
      raised the clothing on our chests. I was the first to speak:

“I took our wax candle and entered first, glancing into all the dark
      corners in the large apartment. Nothing was moving now, and I approached
      the bed. But I stood transfixed with stupor and fright:

“Schopenhauer was no longer laughing! He was grinning in a horrible
      fashion, with his lips pressed together and deep hollows in his cheeks. I
      stammered out:

“But the terrible odor ascended to my nose and stifled me. And I no
      longer moved, but kept staring fixedly at him, terrified as if in the
      presence of an apparition.

“Then my companion, having seized the other wax candle, bent
      forward. Next, he touched my arm without uttering a word. I followed his
      glance, and saw on the ground, under the armchair by the side of the bed,
      standing out white on the dark carpet, and open as if to bite,
      Schopenhauer''s set of artificial teeth.

And as the sun was sinking toward the glittering sea, the consumptive
      German rose from his seat, gave me a parting bow, and retired into the
      hotel.

There were seven of us on a drag, four women and three men; one of the
      latter sat on the box seat beside the coachman. We were ascending, at a
      snail''s pace, the winding road up the steep cliff along the coast.

Setting out from Etretat at break of day in order to visit the ruins of
      Tancarville, we were still half asleep, benumbed by the fresh air of the
      morning. The women especially, who were little accustomed to these early
      excursions, half opened and closed their eyes every moment, nodding their
      heads or yawning, quite insensible to the beauties of the dawn.

It was autumn. On both sides of the road stretched the bare fields,
      yellowed by the stubble of wheat and oats which covered the soil like a
      beard that had been badly shaved. The moist earth seemed to steam. Larks
      were singing high up in the air, while other birds piped in the bushes.

The sun rose at length in front of us, bright red on the plane of the
      horizon, and in proportion as it ascended, growing clearer from minute to
      minute, the country seemed to awake, to smile, to shake itself like a
      young girl leaving her bed in her white robe of vapor. The Comte
      d''Etraille, who was seated on the box, cried:

“Look! look! a hare!” and he extended his arm toward the left,
      pointing to a patch of clover. The animal scurried along, almost hidden by
      the clover, only its large ears showing. Then it swerved across a furrow,
      stopped, started off again at full speed, changed its course, stopped
      anew, uneasy, spying out every danger, uncertain what route to take, when
      suddenly it began to run with great bounds, disappearing finally in a
      large patch of beet-root. All the men had waked up to watch the course of
      the animal.

“We are not at all gallant this morning,” and; regarding his
      neighbor, the little Baroness de Serennes, who struggled against sleep, he
      said to her in a low tone: “You are thinking of your husband,
      baroness. Reassure yourself; he will not return before Saturday, so you
      have still four days.”

“How stupid you are!” Then, shaking off her torpor, she added:
      “Now, let somebody say something to make us laugh. You, Monsieur
      Chenal, who have the reputation of having had more love affairs than the
      Duc de Richelieu, tell us a love story in which you have played a part;
      anything you like.”

Leon Chenal, an old painter, who had once been very handsome, very strong,
      very proud of his physique and very popular with women, took his long
      white beard in his hand and smiled. Then, after a few moments'' reflection,
      he suddenly became serious.

“Ladies, it will not be an amusing tale, for I am going to relate to
      you the saddest love affair of my life, and I sincerely hope that none of
      my friends may ever pass through a similar experience.

“I was twenty-five years of age and was pillaging along the coast of
      Normandy. I call ''pillaging'' wandering about, with a knapsack on one''s
      back, from inn to inn, under the pretext of making studies and sketching
      landscapes. I knew nothing more enjoyable than that happy-go-lucky
      wandering life, in which one is perfectly free, without shackles of any
      kind, without care, without preoccupation, without thinking even of the
      morrow. One goes in any direction one pleases, without any guide save his
      fancy, without any counsellor save his eyes. One stops because a running
      brook attracts one, because the smell of potatoes frying tickles one''s
      olfactories on passing an inn. Sometimes it is the perfume of clematis
      which decides one in his choice or the roguish glance of the servant at an
      inn. Do not despise me for my affection for these rustics. These girls
      have a soul as well as senses, not to mention firm cheeks and fresh lips;
      while their hearty and willing kisses have the flavor of wild fruit. Love
      is always love, come whence it may. A heart that beats at your approach,
      an eye that weeps when you go away are things so rare, so sweet, so
      precious that they must never be despised.

“I have had rendezvous in ditches full of primroses, behind the cow
      stable and in barns among the straw, still warm from the heat of the day.
      I have recollections of coarse gray cloth covering supple peasant skin and
      regrets for simple, frank kisses, more delicate in their unaffected
      sincerity than the subtle favors of charming and distinguished women.

“But what one loves most amid all these varied adventures is the
      country, the woods, the rising of the sun, the twilight, the moonlight.
      These are, for the painter, honeymoon trips with Nature. One is alone with
      her in that long and quiet association. You go to sleep in the fields,
      amid marguerites and poppies, and when you open your eyes in the full
      glare of the sunlight you descry in the distance the little village with
      its pointed clock tower which sounds the hour of noon.

“You sit down by the side of a spring which gushes out at the foot
      of an oak, amid a growth of tall, slender weeds, glistening with life. You
      go down on your knees, bend forward and drink that cold, pellucid water
      which wets your mustache and nose; you drink it with a physical pleasure,
      as though you kissed the spring, lip to lip. Sometimes, when you find a
      deep hole along the course of these tiny brooks, you plunge in quite
      naked, and you feel on your skin, from head to foot, as it were, an icy
      and delicious caress, the light and gentle quivering of the stream.

“You are gay on the hills, melancholy on the edge of ponds, inspired
      when the sun is setting in an ocean of blood-red clouds and casts red
      reflections or the river. And at night, under the moon, which passes
      across the vault of heaven, you think of a thousand strange things which
      would never have occurred to your mind under the brilliant light of day.

“So, in wandering through the same country where we, are this year,
      I came to the little village of Benouville, on the cliff between Yport and
      Etretat. I came from Fecamp, following the coast, a high coast as straight
      as a wall, with its projecting chalk cliffs descending perpendicularly
      into the sea. I had walked since early morning on the short grass, smooth
      and yielding as a carpet, that grows on the edge of the cliff. And,
      singing lustily, I walked with long strides, looking sometimes at the slow
      circling flight of a gull with its white curved wings outlined on the blue
      sky, sometimes at the brown sails of a fishing bark on the green sea. In
      short, I had passed a happy day, a day of liberty and of freedom from
      care.

“A little farmhouse where travellers were lodged was pointed out to
      me, a kind of inn, kept by a peasant woman, which stood in the centre of a
      Norman courtyard surrounded by a double row of beeches.

“Leaving the coast, I reached the hamlet, which was hemmed in by
      great trees, and I presented myself at the house of Mother Lecacheur.

“She was an old, wrinkled and stern peasant woman, who seemed always
      to receive customers under protest, with a kind of defiance.

“It was the month of May. The spreading apple trees covered the
      court with a shower of blossoms which rained unceasingly both upon people
      and upon the grass.

“In five minutes we had come to an agreement, and I deposited my bag
      upon the earthen floor of a rustic room, furnished with a bed, two chairs,
      a table and a washbowl. The room looked into the large, smoky kitchen,
      where the lodgers took their meals with the people of the farm and the
      landlady, who was a widow.

“I washed my hands, after which I went out. The old woman was making
      a chicken fricassee for dinner in the large fireplace in which hung the
      iron pot, black with smoke.

“''I have a lady, an English lady, who has reached years of maturity.
      She occupies the other room.''

“I obtained, by means of an extra five sous a day, the privilege of
      dining alone out in the yard when the weather was fine.

“My place was set outside the door, and I was beginning to gnaw the
      lean limbs of the Normandy chicken, to drink the clear cider and to munch
      the hunk of white bread, which was four days old but excellent.

“Suddenly the wooden gate which gave on the highway was opened, and
      a strange lady directed her steps toward the house. She was very thin,
      very tall, so tightly enveloped in a red Scotch plaid shawl that one might
      have supposed she had no arms, if one had not seen a long hand appear just
      above the hips, holding a white tourist umbrella. Her face was like that
      of a mummy, surrounded with curls of gray hair, which tossed about at
      every step she took and made me think, I know not why, of a pickled
      herring in curl papers. Lowering her eyes, she passed quickly in front of
      me and entered the house.

“That singular apparition cheered me. She undoubtedly was my
      neighbor, the English lady of mature age of whom our hostess had spoken.

“I did not see her again that day. The next day, when I had settled
      myself to commence painting at the end of that beautiful valley which you
      know and which extends as far as Etretat, I perceived, on lifting my eyes
      suddenly, something singular standing on the crest of the cliff, one might
      have said a pole decked out with flags. It was she. On seeing me, she
      suddenly disappeared. I reentered the house at midday for lunch and took
      my seat at the general table, so as to make the acquaintance of this odd
      character. But she did not respond to my polite advances, was insensible
      even to my little attentions. I poured out water for her persistently, I
      passed her the dishes with great eagerness. A slight, almost
      imperceptible, movement of the head and an English word, murmured so low
      that I did not understand it, were her only acknowledgments.

“She was called Miss Harriet. Seeking out a secluded village in
      which to pass the summer, she had been attracted to Benouville some six
      months before and did not seem disposed to leave it. She never spoke at
      table, ate rapidly, reading all the while a small book of the Protestant
      propaganda. She gave a copy of it to everybody. The cure himself had
      received no less than four copies, conveyed by an urchin to whom she had
      paid two sous commission. She said sometimes to our hostess abruptly,
      without preparing her in the least for the declaration:

“''I love the Saviour more than all. I admire him in all creation; I
      adore him in all nature; I carry him always in my heart.''

“And she would immediately present the old woman with one of her
      tracts which were destined to convert the universe.

“In, the village she was not liked. In fact, the schoolmaster having
      pronounced her an atheist, a kind of stigma attached to her. The cure, who
      had been consulted by Madame Lecacheur, responded:

“''She is a heretic, but God does not wish the death of the sinner,
      and I believe her to be a person of pure morals.''

“These words, ''atheist,'' ''heretic,'' words which no one can precisely
      define, threw doubts into some minds. It was asserted, however, that this
      English woman was rich and that she had passed her life in travelling
      through every country in the world because her family had cast her off.
      Why had her family cast her off? Because of her impiety, of course!

“She was, in fact, one of those people of exalted principles; one of
      those opinionated puritans, of which England produces so many; one of
      those good and insupportable old maids who haunt the tables d''hote of
      every hotel in Europe, who spoil Italy, poison Switzerland, render the
      charming cities of the Mediterranean uninhabitable, carry everywhere their
      fantastic manias their manners of petrified vestals, their indescribable
      toilets and a certain odor of india-rubber which makes one believe that at
      night they are slipped into a rubber casing.

“Whenever I caught sight of one of these individuals in a hotel I
      fled like the birds who see a scarecrow in a field.

“Madame Lecacheur, hostile by instinct to everything that was not
      rustic, felt in her narrow soul a kind of hatred for the ecstatic
      declarations of the old maid. She had found a phrase by which to describe
      her, a term of contempt that rose to her lips, called forth by I know not
      what confused and mysterious mental ratiocination. She said: ''That woman
      is a demoniac.'' This epithet, applied to that austere and sentimental
      creature, seemed to me irresistibly droll. I myself never called her
      anything now but ''the demoniac,'' experiencing a singular pleasure in
      pronouncing aloud this word on perceiving her.

“''What do you think, sir? She picked up a toad which had had its paw
      crushed and carried it to her room and has put it in her washbasin and
      bandaged it as if it were a man. If that is not profanation I should like
      to know what is!''

“On another occasion, when walking along the shore she bought a
      large fish which had just been caught, simply to throw it back into the
      sea again. The sailor from whom she had bought it, although she paid him
      handsomely, now began to swear, more exasperated, indeed, than if she had
      put her hand into his pocket and taken his money. For more than a month he
      could not speak of the circumstance without becoming furious and
      denouncing it as an outrage. Oh, yes! She was indeed a demoniac, this Miss
      Harriet, and Mother Lecacheur must have had an inspiration in thus
      christening her.

“The stable boy, who was called Sapeur, because he had served in
      Africa in his youth, entertained other opinions. He said with a roguish
      air: ''She is an old hag who has seen life.''

“The little kind-hearted Celeste did not wait upon her willingly,
      but I was never able to understand why. Probably her only reason was that
      she was a stranger, of another race; of a different tongue and of another
      religion. She was, in fact, a demoniac!

“She passed her time wandering about the country, adoring and
      seeking God in nature. I found her one evening on her knees in a cluster
      of bushes. Having discovered something red through the leaves, I brushed
      aside the branches, and Miss Harriet at once rose to her feet, confused at
      having been found thus, fixing on me terrified eyes like those of an owl
      surprised in open day.

“Sometimes, when I was working among the rocks, I would suddenly
      descry her on the edge of the cliff like a lighthouse signal. She would be
      gazing in rapture at the vast sea glittering in the sunlight and the
      boundless sky with its golden tints. Sometimes I would distinguish her at
      the end of the valley, walking quickly with her elastic English step, and
      I would go toward her, attracted by I know not what, simply to see her
      illuminated visage, her dried-up, ineffable features, which seemed to glow
      with inward and profound happiness.

“I would often encounter her also in the corner of a field, sitting
      on the grass under the shadow of an apple tree, with her little religious
      booklet lying open on her knee while she gazed out at the distance.

“I could not tear myself away from that quiet country neighborhood,
      to which I was attached by a thousand links of love for its wide and
      peaceful landscape. I was happy in this sequestered farm, far removed from
      everything, but in touch with the earth, the good, beautiful, green earth.
      And—must I avow it?—there was, besides, a little curiosity
      which retained me at the residence of Mother Lecacheur. I wished to become
      acquainted a little with this strange Miss Harriet and to know what
      transpires in the solitary souls of those wandering old English women.

“We became acquainted in a rather singular manner. I had just
      finished a study which appeared to me to be worth something, and so it
      was, as it sold for ten thousand francs fifteen years later. It was as
      simple, however, as two and two make four and was not according to
      academic rules. The whole right side of my canvas represented a rock, an
      enormous rock, covered with sea-wrack, brown, yellow and red, across which
      the sun poured like a stream of oil. The light fell upon the rock as
      though it were aflame without the sun, which was at my back, being
      visible. That was all. A first bewildering study of blazing, gorgeous
      light.

“On the left was the sea, not the blue sea, the slate-colored sea,
      but a sea of jade, greenish, milky and solid beneath the deep-colored sky.

“I was so pleased with my work that I danced from sheer delight as I
      carried it back to the inn. I would have liked the whole world to see it
      at once. I can remember that I showed it to a cow that was browsing by the
      wayside, exclaiming as I did so: ''Look at that, my old beauty; you will
      not often see its like again.''

“When I had reached the house I immediately called out to Mother
      Lecacheur, shouting with all my might:

“The rustic approached and looked at my work with her stupid eyes
      which distinguished nothing and could not even tell whether the picture
      represented an ox or a house.

“Miss Harriet just then came home, and she passed behind me just as
      I was holding out my canvas at arm''s length, exhibiting it to our
      landlady. The demoniac could not help but see it, for I took care to
      exhibit the thing in such a way that it could not escape her notice. She
      stopped abruptly and stood motionless, astonished. It was her rock which
      was depicted, the one which she climbed to dream away her time
      undisturbed.

“She uttered a British ''Aoh,'' which was at once so accentuated and
      so flattering that I turned round to her, smiling, and said:

“I colored and was more touched by that compliment than if it had
      come from a queen. I was captured, conquered, vanquished. I could have
      embraced her, upon my honor.

“I passed her some bread, some water, some wine. She now accepted
      these with a little smile of a mummy. I then began to talk about the
      scenery.

“After the meal we rose from the table together and walked leisurely
      across the courtyard; then, attracted doubtless by the fiery glow which
      the setting sun cast over the surface of the sea, I opened the gate which
      led to the cliff, and we walked along side by side, as contented as two
      persons might be who have just learned to understand and penetrate each
      other''s motives and feelings.

“It was one of those warm, soft evenings which impart a sense of
      ease to flesh and spirit alike. All is enjoyment, everything charms. The
      balmy air, laden with the perfume of grasses and the smell of seaweed,
      soothes the olfactory sense with its wild fragrance, soothes the palate
      with its sea savor, soothes the mind with its pervading sweetness.

“We were now walking along the edge of the cliff, high above the
      boundless sea which rolled its little waves below us at a distance of a
      hundred metres. And we drank in with open mouth and expanded chest that
      fresh breeze, briny from kissing the waves, that came from the ocean and
      passed across our faces.

“Wrapped in her plaid shawl, with a look of inspiration as she faced
      the breeze, the English woman gazed fixedly at the great sun ball as it
      descended toward the horizon. Far off in the distance a three-master in
      full sail was outlined on the blood-red sky and a steamship, somewhat
      nearer, passed along, leaving behind it a trail of smoke on the horizon.
      The red sun globe sank slowly lower and lower and presently touched the
      water just behind the motionless vessel, which, in its dazzling
      effulgence, looked as though framed in a flame of fire. We saw it plunge,
      grow smaller and disappear, swallowed up by the ocean.

“Miss Harriet gazed in rapture at the last gleams of the dying day.
      She seemed longing to embrace the sky, the sea, the whole landscape.

“She murmured: ''Aoh! I love—I love'' I saw a tear in her eye.
      She continued: ''I wish I were a little bird, so that I could mount up into
      the firmament.''

“She remained standing as I had often before seen her, perched on
      the cliff, her face as red as her shawl. I should have liked to have
      sketched her in my album. It would have been a caricature of ecstasy.

“I then spoke to her of painting as I would have done to a fellow
      artist, using the technical terms common among the devotees of the
      profession. She listened attentively, eagerly seeking to divine the
      meaning of the terms, so as to understand my thoughts. From time to time
      she would exclaim:

“The next day, on seeing me, she approached me, cordially holding
      out her hand; and we at once became firm friends.

“She was a good creature who had a kind of soul on springs, which
      became enthusiastic at a bound. She lacked equilibrium like all women who
      are spinsters at the age of fifty. She seemed to be preserved in a pickle
      of innocence, but her heart still retained something very youthful and
      inflammable. She loved both nature and animals with a fervor, a love like
      old wine fermented through age, with a sensuous love that she had never
      bestowed on men.

“One thing is certain, that the sight of a bitch nursing her
      puppies, a mare roaming in a meadow with a foal at its side, a bird''s nest
      full of young ones, screaming, with their open mouths and their enormous
      heads, affected her perceptibly.

“Poor, solitary, sad, wandering beings! I love you ever since I
      became acquainted with Miss Harriet.

“I soon discovered that she had something she would like to tell me,
      but dare not, and I was amused at her timidity. When I started out in the
      morning with my knapsack on my back, she would accompany me in silence as
      far as the end of the village, evidently struggling to find words with
      which to begin a conversation. Then she would leave me abruptly and walk
      away quickly with her springy step.

“She remained standing behind me, following all my gestures with
      concentrated attention. Then, suddenly, fearing perhaps that she was
      disturbing me, she said: ''Thank you,'' and walked away.

“But she soon became more friendly, and accompanied me every day,
      her countenance exhibiting visible pleasure. She carried her camp stool
      under her arm, not permitting me to carry it. She would remain there for
      hours, silent and motionless, following with her eyes the point of my
      brush, in its every movement. When I obtained unexpectedly just the effect
      I wanted by a dash of color put on with the palette knife, she
      involuntarily uttered a little ''Ah!'' of astonishment, of joy, of
      admiration. She had the most tender respect for my canvases, an almost
      religious respect for that human reproduction of a part of nature''s work
      divine. My studies appeared to her a kind of religious pictures, and
      sometimes she spoke to me of God, with the idea of converting me.

“Oh, he was a queer, good-natured being, this God of hers! He was a
      sort of village philosopher without any great resources and without great
      power, for she always figured him to herself as inconsolable over
      injustices committed under his eyes, as though he were powerless to
      prevent them.

“She was, however, on excellent terms with him, affecting even to be
      the confidante of his secrets and of his troubles. She would say:

“''God wills'' or ''God does not will,'' just like a sergeant announcing
      to a recruit: ''The colonel has commanded.''

“At the bottom of her heart she deplored my ignorance of the
      intentions of the Eternal, which she endeavored to impart to me.

“Almost every day I found in my pockets, in my hat when I lifted it
      from the ground, in my paintbox, in my polished shoes, standing in front
      of my door in the morning, those little pious tracts which she no doubt,
      received directly from Paradise.

“I treated her as one would an old friend, with unaffected
      cordiality. But I soon perceived that she had changed somewhat in her
      manner, though, for a while, I paid little attention to it.

“When I was painting, whether in my valley or in some country lane,
      I would see her suddenly appear with her rapid, springy walk. She would
      then sit down abruptly, out of breath, as though she had been running or
      were overcome by some profound emotion. Her face would be red, that
      English red which is denied to the people of all other countries; then,
      without any reason, she would turn ashy pale and seem about to faint away.
      Gradually, however, her natural color would return and she would begin to
      speak.

“Then, without warning, she would break off in the middle of a
      sentence, spring up from her seat and walk away so rapidly and so
      strangely that I was at my wits'' ends to discover whether I had done or
      said anything to displease or wound her.

“I finally came to the conclusion that those were her normal
      manners, somewhat modified no doubt in my honor during the first days of
      our acquaintance.

“When she returned to the farm, after walking for hours on the windy
      coast, her long curls often hung straight down, as if their springs had
      been broken. This had hitherto seldom given her any concern, and she would
      come to dinner without embarrassment all dishevelled by her sister, the
      breeze.

“But now she would go to her room and arrange the untidy locks, and
      when I would say, with familiar gallantry, which, however, always offended
      her:

“''You are as beautiful as a star to-day, Miss Harriet,'' a blush
      would immediately rise to her cheeks, the blush of a young girl, of a girl
      of fifteen.

“Then she would suddenly become quite reserved and cease coming to
      watch me paint. I thought, ''This is only a fit of temper; it will blow
      over.'' But it did not always blow over, and when I spoke to her she would
      answer me either with affected indifference or with sullen annoyance.

“She became by turns rude, impatient and nervous. I never saw her
      now except at meals, and we spoke but little. I concluded at length that I
      must have offended her in some way, and, accordingly, I said to her one
      evening:

“''Miss Harriet, why is it that you do not act toward me as formerly?
      What have I done to displease you? You are causing me much pain!''

“''I am just the same with you as formerly. It is not true, not
      true,'' and she ran upstairs and shut herself up in her room.

“Occasionally she would look at me in a peculiar manner. I have
      often said to myself since then that those who are condemned to death must
      look thus when they are informed that their last day has come. In her eye
      there lurked a species of insanity, an insanity at once mystical and
      violent; and even more, a fever, an aggravated longing, impatient and
      impotent, for the unattained and unattainable.

“Nay, it seemed to me there was also going on within her a struggle
      in which her heart wrestled with an unknown force that she sought to
      master, and even, perhaps, something else. But what do I know? What do I
      know?

“For some time I had commenced to work, as soon as daylight
      appeared, on a picture the subject of which was as follows:

“A deep ravine, enclosed, surmounted by two thickets of trees and
      vines, extended into the distance and was lost, submerged in that milky
      vapor, in that cloud like cotton down that sometimes floats over valleys
      at daybreak. And at the extreme end of that heavy, transparent fog one
      saw, or, rather, surmised, that a couple of human beings were approaching,
      a human couple, a youth and a maiden, their arms interlaced, embracing
      each other, their heads inclined toward each other, their lips meeting.

“A first ray of the sun, glistening through the branches, pierced
      that fog of the dawn, illuminated it with a rosy reflection just behind
      the rustic lovers, framing their vague shadows in a silvery background. It
      was well done; yes, indeed, well done.

“I was working on the declivity which led to the Valley of Etretat.
      On this particular morning I had, by chance, the sort of floating vapor
      which I needed. Suddenly something rose up in front of me like a phantom;
      it was Miss Harriet. On seeing me she was about to flee. But I called
      after her, saying: ''Come here, come here, mademoiselle. I have a nice
      little picture for you.''

“She came forward, though with seeming reluctance. I handed her my
      sketch. She said nothing, but stood for a long time, motionless, looking
      at it, and suddenly she burst into tears. She wept spasmodically, like men
      who have striven hard to restrain their tears, but who can do so no longer
      and abandon themselves to grief, though still resisting. I sprang to my
      feet, moved at the sight of a sorrow I did not comprehend, and I took her
      by the hand with an impulse of brusque affection, a true French impulse
      which acts before it reflects.

“She let her hands rest in mine for a few seconds, and I felt them
      quiver as if all her nerves were being wrenched. Then she withdrew her
      hands abruptly, or, rather, snatched them away.

“I recognized that tremor, for I had felt it, and I could not be
      deceived. Ah! the love tremor of a woman, whether she be fifteen or fifty
      years of age, whether she be of the people or of society, goes so straight
      to my heart that I never have any hesitation in understanding it!

“Her whole frail being had trembled, vibrated, been overcome. I knew
      it. She walked away before I had time to say a word, leaving me as
      surprised as if I had witnessed a miracle and as troubled as if I had
      committed a crime.

“I did not go in to breakfast. I went to take a turn on the edge of
      the cliff, feeling that I would just as lief weep as laugh, looking on the
      adventure as both comic and deplorable and my position as ridiculous,
      believing her unhappy enough to go insane.

“I asked myself what I ought to do. It seemed best for me to leave
      the place, and I immediately resolved to do so.

“Somewhat sad and perplexed, I wandered about until dinner time and
      entered the farmhouse just when the soup had been served up.

“I sat down at the table as usual. Miss Harriet was there, eating
      away solemnly, without speaking to any one, without even lifting her eyes.
      Her manner and expression were, however, the same as usual.

“I waited patiently till the meal had been finished, when, turning
      toward the landlady, I said: ''Well, Madame Lecacheur, it will not be long
      now before I shall have to take my leave of you.''

“The good woman, at once surprised and troubled, replied in her
      drawling voice: ''My dear sir, what is it you say? You are going to leave
      us after I have become so accustomed to you?''

“I glanced at Miss Harriet out of the corner of my eye. Her
      countenance did not change in the least. But Celeste, the little servant,
      looked up at me. She was a fat girl, of about eighteen years of age, rosy,
      fresh, as strong as a horse, and possessing the rare attribute of
      cleanliness. I had kissed her at odd times in out-of-the-way corners,
      after the manner of travellers—nothing more.

“The dinner being at length over, I went to smoke my pipe under the
      apple trees, walking up and down from one end of the enclosure to the
      other. All the reflections which I had made during the day, the strange
      discovery of the morning, that passionate and grotesque attachment for me,
      the recollections which that revelation had suddenly called up,
      recollections at once charming and perplexing, perhaps also that look
      which the servant had cast on me at the announcement of my departure—all
      these things, mixed up and combined, put me now in a reckless humor, gave
      me a tickling sensation of kisses on the lips and in my veins a something
      which urged me on to commit some folly.

“Night was coming on, casting its dark shadows under the trees, when
      I descried Celeste, who had gone to fasten up the poultry yard at the
      other end of the enclosure. I darted toward her, running so noiselessly
      that she heard nothing, and as she got up from closing the small trapdoor
      by which the chickens got in and out, I clasped her in my arms and rained
      on her coarse, fat face a shower of kisses. She struggled, laughing all
      the time, as she was accustomed to do in such circumstances. Why did I
      suddenly loose my grip of her? Why did I at once experience a shock? What
      was it that I heard behind me?

“It was Miss Harriet, who had come upon us, who had seen us and who
      stood in front of us motionless as a spectre. Then she disappeared in the
      darkness.

“I was ashamed, embarrassed, more desperate at having been thus
      surprised by her than if she had caught me committing some criminal act.

“I slept badly that night. I was completely unnerved and haunted by
      sad thoughts. I seemed to hear loud weeping, but in this I was no doubt
      deceived. Moreover, I thought several times that I heard some one walking
      up and down in the house and opening the hall door.

“Toward morning I was overcome by fatigue and fell asleep. I got up
      late and did not go downstairs until the late breakfast, being still in a
      bewildered state, not knowing what kind of expression to put on.

“No one had seen Miss Harriet. We waited for her at table, but she
      did not appear. At length Mother Lecacheur went to her room. The English
      woman had gone out. She must have set out at break of day, as she was wont
      to do, in order to see the sun rise.

“The weather was hot, very hot, one of those broiling, heavy days
      when not a leaf stirs. The table had been placed out of doors, under an
      apple tree, and from time to time Sapeur had gone to the cellar to draw a
      jug of cider, everybody was so thirsty. Celeste brought the dishes from
      the kitchen, a ragout of mutton with potatoes, a cold rabbit and a salad.
      Afterward she placed before us a dish of strawberries, the first of the
      season.

“As I wished to wash and freshen these, I begged the servant to go
      and draw me a pitcher of cold water.

“In about five minutes she returned, declaring that the well was
      dry. She had lowered the pitcher to the full extent of the cord and had
      touched the bottom, but on drawing the pitcher up again it was empty.
      Mother Lecacheur, anxious to examine the thing for herself, went and
      looked down the hole. She returned, announcing that one could see clearly
      something in the well, something altogether unusual. But this no doubt was
      bundles of straw, which a neighbor had thrown in out of spite.

“I wished to look down the well also, hoping I might be able to
      clear up the mystery, and I perched myself close to the brink. I perceived
      indistinctly a white object. What could it be? I then conceived the idea
      of lowering a lantern at the end of a cord. When I did so the yellow flame
      danced on the layers of stone and gradually became clearer. All four of us
      were leaning over the opening, Sapeur and Celeste having now joined us.
      The lantern rested on a black-and-white indistinct mass, singular,
      incomprehensible. Sapeur exclaimed:

“''It is a horse. I see the hoofs. It must have got out of the meadow
      during the night and fallen in headlong.''

“But suddenly a cold shiver froze me to the marrow. I first
      recognized a foot, then a leg sticking up; the whole body and the other
      leg were completely under water.

“I stammered out in a loud voice, trembling so violently that the
      lantern danced hither and thither over the slipper:

“But it was necessary to recover the corpse of the dead woman. I
      attached the young man securely by the waist to the end of the pulley rope
      and lowered him very slowly, watching him disappear in the darkness. In
      one hand he held the lantern and a rope in the other. Soon I recognized
      his voice, which seemed to come from the centre of the earth, saying:

“I then saw him fish something out of the water. It was the other
      leg. He then bound the two feet together and shouted anew:

“I began to wind up, but I felt my arms crack, my muscles twitch,
      and I was in terror lest I should let the man fall to the bottom. When his
      head appeared at the brink I asked:

“We both got on the stone slab at the edge of the well and from
      opposite sides we began to haul up the body.

“Mother Lecacheur and Celeste watched us from a distance, concealed
      from view behind the wall of the house. When they saw issuing from the
      hole the black slippers and white stockings of the drowned person they
      disappeared.

“Sapeur seized the ankles, and we drew up the body of the poor
      woman. The head was shocking to look at, being bruised and lacerated, and
      the long gray hair, out of curl forevermore, hanging down tangled and
      disordered.

“We carried her into the room, and as the women did not put in an
      appearance I, with the assistance of the stable lad, dressed the corpse
      for burial.

“I washed her disfigured face. Under the touch of my finger an eye
      was slightly opened and regarded me with that pale, cold look, that
      terrible look of a corpse which seems to come from the beyond. I braided
      as well as I could her dishevelled hair and with my clumsy hands arranged
      on her head a novel and singular coiffure. Then I took off her dripping
      wet garments, baring, not without a feeling of shame, as though I had been
      guilty of some profanation, her shoulders and her chest and her long arms,
      as slim as the twigs of a tree.

“I next went to fetch some flowers, poppies, bluets, marguerites and
      fresh, sweet-smelling grass with which to strew her funeral couch.

“I then had to go through the usual formalities, as I was alone to
      attend to everything. A letter found in her pocket, written at the last
      moment, requested that her body be buried in the village in which she had
      passed the last days of her life. A sad suspicion weighed on my heart. Was
      it not on my account that she wished to be laid to rest in this place?

“Toward evening all the female gossips of the locality came to view
      the remains of the defunct, but I would not allow a single person to
      enter. I wanted to be alone, and I watched beside her all night.

“I looked at the corpse by the flickering light of the candles, at
      this unhappy woman, unknown to us all, who had died in such a lamentable
      manner and so far away from home. Had she left no friends, no relations
      behind her? What had her infancy been? What had been her life? Whence had
      she come thither alone, a wanderer, lost like a dog driven from home? What
      secrets of sufferings and of despair were sealed up in that
      unprepossessing body, in that poor body whose outward appearance had
      driven from her all affection, all love?

“How many unhappy beings there are! I felt that there weighed upon
      that human creature the eternal injustice of implacable nature! It was all
      over with her, without her ever having experienced, perhaps, that which
      sustains the greatest outcasts to wit, the hope of being loved once!
      Otherwise why should she thus have concealed herself, fled from the face
      of others? Why did she love everything so tenderly and so passionately,
      everything living that was not a man?

“I recognized the fact that she believed in a God, and that she
      hoped to receive compensation from the latter for all the miseries she had
      endured. She would now disintegrate and become, in turn, a plant. She
      would blossom in the sun, the cattle would browse on her leaves, the birds
      would bear away the seeds, and through these changes she would become
      again human flesh. But that which is called the soul had been extinguished
      at the bottom of the dark well. She suffered no longer. She had given her
      life for that of others yet to come.

“Hours passed away in this silent and sinister communion with the
      dead. A pale light at length announced the dawn of a new day; then a red
      ray streamed in on the bed, making a bar of light across the coverlet and
      across her hands. This was the hour she had so much loved. The awakened
      birds began to sing in the trees.

“I opened the window to its fullest extent and drew back the
      curtains that the whole heavens might look in upon us, and, bending over
      the icy corpse, I took in my hands the mutilated head and slowly, without
      terror or disgust, I imprinted a kiss, a long kiss, upon those lips which
      had never before been kissed.”

Leon Chenal remained silent. The women wept. We heard on the box seat the
      Count d''Atraille blowing his nose from time to time. The coachman alone
      had gone to sleep. The horses, who no longer felt the sting of the whip,
      had slackened their pace and moved along slowly. The drag, hardly
      advancing at all, seemed suddenly torpid, as if it had been freighted with
      sorrow.

The former soldier, Mederic Rompel, familiarly called Mederic by the
      country folks, left the post office of Roily-le-Tors at the usual hour.
      After passing through the village with his long stride, he cut across the
      meadows of Villaume and reached the bank of the Brindille, following the
      path along the water''s edge to the village of Carvelin, where he commenced
      to deliver his letters. He walked quickly, following the course of the
      narrow river, which frothed, murmured and boiled in its grassy bed beneath
      an arch of willows.

Mederic went on without stopping, with only this thought in his mind:
      “My first letter is for the Poivron family, then I have one for
      Monsieur Renardet; so I must cross the wood.”

His blue blouse, fastened round his waist by a black leather belt, moved
      in a quick, regular fashion above the green hedge of willow trees, and his
      stout stick of holly kept time with his steady tread.

He crossed the Brindille on a bridge consisting of a tree trunk, with a
      handrail of rope, fastened at either end to a stake driven into the
      ground.

The wood, which belonged to Monsieur Renardet, the mayor of Carvelin and
      the largest landowner in the district, consisted of huge old trees,
      straight as pillars and extending for about half a league along the left
      bank of the stream which served as a boundary to this immense dome of
      foliage. Alongside the water large shrubs had grown up in the sunlight,
      but under the trees one found nothing but moss, thick, soft and yielding,
      from which arose, in the still air, an odor of dampness and of dead wood.

Mederic slackened his pace, took off his black cap adorned with red lace
      and wiped his forehead, for it was by this time hot in the meadows, though
      it was not yet eight o''clock in the morning.

He had just recovered from the effects of the heat and resumed his quick
      pace when he noticed at the foot of a tree a knife, a child''s small knife.
      When he picked it up he discovered a thimble and also a needlecase not far
      away.

Having taken up these objects, he thought: “I''ll entrust them to the
      mayor,” and he resumed his journey, but now he kept his eyes open,
      expecting to find something else.

All of a sudden he stopped short, as if he had struck against a wooden
      barrier. Ten paces in front of him lay stretched on her back on the moss a
      little girl, perfectly nude, her face covered with a handkerchief. She was
      about twelve years old.

Meredic advanced on tiptoe, as if he apprehended some danger, and he
      glanced toward the spot uneasily.

What was this? No doubt she was asleep. Then he reflected that a person
      does not go to sleep naked at half-past seven in the morning under the
      cool trees. So, then, she must be dead, and he must be face to face with a
      crime. At this thought a cold shiver ran through his frame, although he
      was an old soldier. And then a murder was such a rare thing in the
      country, and, above all, the murder of a child, that he could not believe
      his eyes. But she had no wound-nothing save a spot of blood on her leg.
      How, then, had she been killed?

He stopped close to her and gazed at her, while he leaned on his stick.
      Certainly he must know her, for he knew all the inhabitants of the
      district; but, not being able to get a look at her face, he could not
      guess her name. He stooped forward in order to take off the handkerchief
      which covered her face, then paused, with outstretched hand, restrained by
      an idea that occurred to him.

Had he the right to disarrange anything in the condition of the corpse
      before the official investigation? He pictured justice to himself as a
      kind of general whom nothing escapes and who attaches as much importance
      to a lost button as to the stab of a knife in the stomach. Perhaps under
      this handkerchief evidence could be found to sustain a charge of murder;
      in fact, if such proof were there it might lose its value if touched by an
      awkward hand.

Then he raised himself with the intention of hastening toward the mayor''s
      residence, but again another thought held him back. If the little girl
      were still alive, by any chance, he could not leave her lying there in
      this way. He sank on his knees very gently, a little distance from her,
      through precaution, and extended his hand toward her foot. It was icy
      cold, with the terrible coldness of death which leaves us no longer in
      doubt. The letter carrier, as he touched her, felt his heart in his mouth,
      as he said himself afterward, and his mouth parched. Rising up abruptly,
      he rushed off under the trees toward Monsieur Renardet''s house.

He walked on faster than ever, with his stick under his arm, his hands
      clenched and his head thrust forward, while his leathern bag, filled with
      letters and newspapers, kept flapping at his side.

The mayor''s residence was at the end of the wood which served as a park,
      and one side of it was washed by the Brindille.

It was a big square house of gray stone, very old, and had stood many a
      siege in former days, and at the end of it was a huge tower, twenty metres
      high, rising out of the water.

From the top of this fortress one could formerly see all the surrounding
      country. It was called the Fox''s tower, without any one knowing exactly
      why; and from this appellation, no doubt, had come the name Renardet,
      borne by the owners of this fief, which had remained in the same family,
      it was said, for more than two hundred years. For the Renardets formed
      part of the upper middle class, all but noble, to be met with so often in
      the province before the Revolution.

Mederic was recognized as a man of standing and authority, and they
      understood that something serious had happened.

As soon as word was brought to Monsieur Renardet, he ordered the postman
      to be sent up to him. Pale and out of breath, with his cap in his hand,
      Mederic found the mayor seated at a long table covered with scattered
      papers.

He was a large, tall man, heavy and red-faced, strong as an ox, and was
      greatly liked in the district, although of an excessively violent
      disposition. Almost forty years old and a widower for the past six months,
      he lived on his estate like a country gentleman. His choleric temperament
      had often brought him into trouble from which the magistrates of
      Roily-le-Tors, like indulgent and prudent friends, had extricated him. Had
      he not one day thrown the conductor of the diligence from the top of his
      seat because he came near running over his retriever, Micmac? Had he not
      broken the ribs of a gamekeeper who abused him for having, gun in hand,
      passed through a neighbor''s property? Had he not even caught by the collar
      the sub-prefect, who stopped over in the village during an administrative
      circuit, called by Monsieur Renardet an electioneering circuit, for he was
      opposed to the government, in accordance with family traditions.

“By God, I''d make a bet it is little Louise Roque! I have just
      learned that she did not go home to her mother last night. Where did you
      find her?”

The postman described the spot, gave full details and offered to conduct
      the mayor to the place.

“No, I don''t need you. Send the watchman, the mayor''s secretary and
      the doctor to me at once, and resume your rounds. Quick, quick, go and
      tell them to meet me in the wood.”

The letter carrier, a man used to discipline, obeyed and withdrew, angry
      and grieved at not being able to be present at the investigation.

The mayor, in his turn, prepared to go out, took his big soft hat and
      paused for a few seconds on the threshold of his abode. In front of him
      stretched a wide sward, in which were three large beds of flowers in full
      bloom, one facing the house and the others at either side of it. Farther
      on the outlying trees of the wood rose skyward, while at the left, beyond
      the Brindille, which at that spot widened into a pond, could be seen long
      meadows, an entirely green flat sweep of country, intersected by trenches
      and hedges of pollard willows.

To the right, behind the stables, the outhouses and all the buildings
      connected with the property, might be seen the village, which was wealthy,
      being mainly inhabited by cattle breeders.

Renardet slowly descended the steps in front of his house, and, turning to
      the left, gained the water''s edge, which he followed at a slow pace, his
      hand behind his back. He walked on, with bent head, and from time to time
      glanced round in search of the persons he had sent for.

When he stood beneath the trees he stopped, took off his hat and wiped his
      forehead as Mederic had done, for the burning sun was darting its fiery
      rays on the earth. Then the mayor resumed his journey, stopped once more
      and retraced his steps. Suddenly, stooping down, he steeped his
      handkerchief in the stream that glided along at his feet and spread it
      over his head, under his hat. Drops of water flowed down his temples over
      his ears, which were always purple, over his strong red neck, and made
      their way, one after the other, under his white shirt collar.

And the doctor appeared under the trees. He was a thin little man, an
      ex-military surgeon, who passed in the neighborhood for a very skillful
      practitioner. He limped, having been wounded while in the service, and had
      to use a stick to assist him in walking.

Next came the watchman and the mayor''s secretary, who, having been sent
      for at the same time, arrived together. They looked scared, and hurried
      forward, out of breath, walking and running alternately to hasten their
      progress, and moving their arms up and down so vigorously that they seemed
      to do more work with them than with their legs.

Far ahead of them under the trees they saw something white on which the
      sun gleamed down through the branches. As they approached they gradually
      distinguished a human form lying there, its head toward the river, the
      face covered and the arms extended as though on a crucifix.

“I am fearfully warm,” said the mayor, and stooping down, he
      again soaked his handkerchief in the water and placed it round his
      forehead.

The doctor hastened his steps, interested by the discovery. As soon as
      they were near the corpse, he bent down to examine it without touching it.
      He had put on his pince-nez, as one does in examining some curious object,
      and turned round very quietly.

“Violated and murdered, as we shall prove presently. This little
      girl, moreover, is almost a woman—look at her throat.”

The doctor lightly drew away the handkerchief which covered her face,
      which looked black, frightful, the tongue protruding, the eyes bloodshot.
      He went on:

“Strangled with the hands without leaving any special trace, neither
      the mark of the nails nor the imprint of the fingers. Quite right. It is
      little Louise Roque, sure enough!”

“There''s nothing for me to do. She''s been dead for the last hour at
      least. We must give notice of the matter to the authorities.”

Renardet, standing up, with his hands behind his back, kept staring with a
      stony look at the little body exposed to view on the grass. He murmured:

“Do you, Principe” (this was his secretary), “go and
      find those clothes for me along the stream. You, Maxime” (this was
      the watchman), “hurry on toward Rouy-le-Tors and bring with you the
      magistrate with the gendarmes. They must be here within an hour. You
      understand?”

“Who knows? Any one is capable of that. Every one in particular and
      nobody in general. No matter, it must be some prowler, some workman out of
      employment. Since we have become a Republic we meet only this kind of
      person along the roads.”

“And without a wife. Having neither a good supper nor a good bed, he
      became reckless. You can''t tell how many men there may be in the world
      capable of a crime at a given moment. Did you know that this little girl
      had disappeared?”

And with the end of his stick he touched one after the other the stiffened
      fingers of the corpse, resting on them as on the keys of a piano.

“Yes, the mother came last night to look for me about nine o''clock,
      the child not having come home at seven to supper. We looked for her along
      the roads up to midnight, but we did not think of the wood. However, we
      needed daylight to carry out a thorough search.”

They remained standing beside the corpse of the young girl, so pale on the
      dark moss. A big blue fly was walking over the body with his lively, jerky
      movements. The two men kept watching this wandering speck.

“How pretty it is, a fly on the skin! The ladies of the last century
      had good reason to paste them on their faces. Why has this fashion gone
      out?”

But, all of a sudden, he turned round, surprised by a shrill noise. A
      woman in a cap and blue apron was running toward them under the trees. It
      was the mother, La Roque. As soon as she saw Renardet she began to shriek:

“My little girl! Where''s my little girl?” so distractedly that
      she did not glance down at the ground. Suddenly she saw the corpse,
      stopped short, clasped her hands and raised both her arms while she
      uttered a sharp, heartrending cry—the cry of a wounded animal. Then
      she rushed toward the body, fell on her knees and snatched away the
      handkerchief that covered the face. When she saw that frightful
      countenance, black and distorted, she rose to her feet with a shudder,
      then sinking to the ground, face downward, she pressed her face against
      the ground and uttered frightful, continuous screams on the thick moss.

Her tall, thin frame, with its close-clinging dress, was palpitating,
      shaken with spasms. One could see her bony ankles and her dried-up calves
      covered with coarse blue stockings shaking horribly. She was digging the
      soil with her crooked fingers, as though she were trying to make a hole in
      which to hide herself.

Renardet felt a strange sensation. Then he gave vent to a sort of loud
      sneeze, and, drawing his handkerchief from his pocket, he began to weep
      internally, coughing, sobbing and blowing his nose noisily.

The man, knowing that the mayor would not brook opposition, set forth
      again with hesitating steps, casting a timid side glance at the corpse.

Distant voices were heard under the trees, a confused sound, the noise of
      an approaching crowd, for Mederic had, in the course of his rounds,
      carried the news from door to door. The people of the neighborhood, dazed
      at first, had gossiped about it in the street, from one threshold to
      another. Then they gathered together. They talked over, discussed and
      commented on the event for some minutes and had now come to see for
      themselves.

They arrived in groups, a little faltering and uneasy through fear of the
      first impression of such a scene on their minds. When they saw the body
      they stopped, not daring to advance, and speaking low. Then they grew
      bolder, went on a few steps, stopped again, advanced once more, and
      presently formed around the dead girl, her mother, the doctor and Renardet
      a close circle, restless and noisy, which crowded forward at the sudden
      impact of newcomers. And now they touched the corpse. Some of them even
      bent down to feel it with their fingers. The doctor kept them back. But
      the mayor, waking abruptly out of his torpor, flew int
