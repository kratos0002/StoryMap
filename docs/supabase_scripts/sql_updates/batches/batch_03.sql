Under none of the accredited
ghostly circumstances, and environed by none of the conventional
ghostly surroundings, did I first make acquaintance with the
house which is the subject of this Christmas piece.  I saw
it in the daylight, with the sun upon it.  There was no
wind, no rain, no lightning, no thunder, no awful or unwonted
circumstance, of any kind, to heighten its effect.  More
than that: I had come to it direct from a railway station: it was
not more than a mile distant from the railway station; and, as I
stood outside the house, looking back upon the way I had come, I
could see the goods train running smoothly along the embankment
in the valley.  I will not say that everything was utterly
commonplace, because I doubt if anything can be that, except to
utterly commonplace people—and there my vanity steps in;
but, I will take it on myself to say that anybody might see the
house as I saw it, any fine autumn morning.

I was travelling towards London out of the North, intending to
stop by the way, to look at the house.  My health required a
temporary residence in the country; and a friend of mine who knew
that, and who had happened to drive past the house, had written
to me to suggest it as a likely place.  I had got into the
train at midnight, and had fallen asleep, and had woke up and had
sat looking out of window at the brilliant Northern Lights in the
sky, and had fallen asleep again, and had woke up again to find
the night gone, with the usual discontented conviction on me that
I hadn’t been to sleep at all;—upon which question,
in the first imbecility of that condition, I am ashamed to
believe that I would have done wager by battle with the p. 122man who sat
opposite me.  That opposite man had had, through the
night—as that opposite man always has—several legs
too many, and all of them too long.  In addition to this
unreasonable conduct (which was only to be expected of him), he
had had a pencil and a pocket-book, and had been perpetually
listening and taking notes.  It had appeared to me that
these aggravating notes related to the jolts and bumps of the
carriage, and I should have resigned myself to his taking them,
under a general supposition that he was in the civil-engineering
way of life, if he had not sat staring straight over my head
whenever he listened.  He was a goggle-eyed gentleman of a
perplexed aspect, and his demeanour became unbearable.

It was a cold, dead morning (the sun not being up yet), and
when I had out-watched the paling light of the fires of the iron
country, and the curtain of heavy smoke that hung at once between
me and the stars and between me and the day, I turned to my
fellow-traveller and said:

“I beg your pardon, sir, but do you observe
anything particular in me?”  For, really, he appeared
to be taking down, either my travelling-cap or my hair, with a
minuteness that was a liberty.

The goggle-eyed gentleman withdrew his eyes from behind me, as
if the back of the carriage were a hundred miles off, and said,
with a lofty look of compassion for my insignificance:

At first I was alarmed, for an Express lunatic and no
communication with the guard, is a serious position.  The
thought came to my relief that the gentleman might be what is
popularly called a Rapper: one of a sect for (some of) whom I
have the highest respect, but whom I don’t believe
in.  I was going to ask him the question, when he took the
bread out of my mouth.

“You will excuse me,” said the gentleman
contemptuously, “if I am too much in advance of common
humanity to trouble myself at all about it.  I have passed
the night—as indeed I pass the whole of my time
now—in spiritual intercourse.”

“The conferences of the night began,” continued
the gentleman, turning several leaves of his note-book,
“with this message: ‘Evil communications corrupt good
manners.’”

I could only repeat my rather snappish “O!” and
ask if I might be favoured with the last communication.

“‘A bird in the hand,’” said the
gentleman, reading his last entry with great solemnity,
“‘is worth two in the Bosh.’”

The gentleman then informed me that the spirit of Socrates had
delivered this special revelation in the course of the
night.  “My friend, I hope you are pretty well. 
There are two in this railway carriage.  How do you
do?  There are seventeen thousand four hundred and
seventy-nine spirits here, but you cannot see them. 
Pythagoras is here.  He is not at liberty to mention it, but
hopes you like travelling.”  Galileo likewise had
dropped in, with this scientific intelligence.  “I am
glad to see you, amico.  Come sta?  Water
will freeze when it is cold enough. 
Addio!”  In the course of the night, also, the
following phenomena had occurred.  Bishop Butler had
insisted on spelling his name, “Bubler,” for which
offence against orthography and good manners he had been
dismissed as out of temper.  John Milton (suspected of
wilful mystification) had repudiated the authorship of Paradise
Lost, and had introduced, as joint authors of that poem, two
Unknown gentlemen, respectively named Grungers and
Scadgingtone.  And Prince Arthur, nephew of King John of
England, had described himself as tolerably comfortable in the
seventh circle, where he was learning to paint on velvet, under
the direction of Mrs. Trimmer and Mary Queen of Scots.

If this should meet the eye of the gentleman who favoured me
with these disclosures, I trust he will excuse my confessing that
the sight of the rising sun, and the contemplation of the
magnificent Order of the vast Universe, made me impatient of
them.  In a word, I was so impatient of them, that I was
mightily glad to get out at the next station, and to exchange
these clouds and vapours for the free air of Heaven.

By that time it was a beautiful morning.  As I walked
away among such leaves as had already fallen from the golden,
brown, and russet trees; and as I looked around me on the wonders
of Creation, and thought of the steady, unchanging, and
harmonious laws by which they are sustained; the
gentleman’s spiritual intercourse seemed to me as poor a
piece of journey-work as ever this world saw.  In which
heathen state of mind, I came within view of the house, and
stopped to examine it attentively.

It was a solitary house, standing in a sadly neglected garden:
a pretty even square of some two acres.  It was a house of
about the time of George the Second; as stiff, as cold, as
formal, and in as bad taste, as could possibly be desired by the
most loyal admirer of the whole quartet of Georges.  It was
uninhabited, but had, within a year or two, been cheaply repaired
to render it habitable; I say cheaply, because the work had been
done in a surface manner, and was already decaying as to the
paint and plaster, though the colours were fresh.  A
lop-sided board drooped over the garden wall, announcing that it
was “to let on very reasonable terms, well p.
124furnished.”  It was much too closely and
heavily shadowed by trees, and, in particular, there were six
tall poplars before the front windows, which were excessively
melancholy, and the site of which had been extremely ill
chosen.

It was easy to see that it was an avoided house—a house
that was shunned by the village, to which my eye was guided by a
church spire some half a mile off—a house that nobody would
take.  And the natural inference was, that it had the
reputation of being a haunted house.

No period within the four-and-twenty hours of day and night is
so solemn to me, as the early morning.  In the summer-time,
I often rise very early, and repair to my room to do a
day’s work before breakfast, and I am always on those
occasions deeply impressed by the stillness and solitude around
me.  Besides that there is something awful in the being
surrounded by familiar faces asleep—in the knowledge that
those who are dearest to us and to whom we are dearest, are
profoundly unconscious of us, in an impassive state, anticipative
of that mysterious condition to which we are all
tending—the stopped life, the broken threads of yesterday,
the deserted seat, the closed book, the unfinished but abandoned
occupation, all are images of Death.  The tranquillity of
the hour is the tranquillity of Death.  The colour and the
chill have the same association.  Even a certain air that
familiar household objects take upon them when they first emerge
from the shadows of the night into the morning, of being newer,
and as they used to be long ago, has its counterpart in the
subsidence of the worn face of maturity or age, in death, into
the old youthful look.  Moreover, I once saw the apparition
of my father, at this hour.  He was alive and well, and
nothing ever came of it, but I saw him in the daylight, sitting
with his back towards me, on a seat that stood beside my
bed.  His head was resting on his hand, and whether he was
slumbering or grieving, I could not discern.  Amazed to see
him there, I sat up, moved my position, leaned out of bed, and
watched him.  As he did not move, I spoke to him more than
once.  As he did not move then, I became alarmed and laid my
hand upon his shoulder, as I thought—and there was no such
thing.

For all these reasons, and for others less easily and briefly
statable, I find the early morning to be my most ghostly
time.  Any house would be more or less haunted, to me, in
the early morning; and a haunted house could scarcely address me
to greater advantage than then.

I walked on into the village, with the desertion of this house
upon my mind, and I found the landlord of the little inn, sanding
his door-step.  I bespoke breakfast, and broached the
subject of the house.

p.
125“Well!” cried the landlord, in an outburst
of frankness that had the appearance of
desperation—“I wouldn’t sleep in it.”

“If I wanted to have all the bells in a house ring, with
nobody to ring ’em; and all the doors in a house bang, with
nobody to bang ’em; and all sorts of feet treading about,
with no feet there; why, then,” said the landlord,
“I’d sleep in that house.”

The landlord looked at me again, and then, with his former
appearance of desperation, called down his stable-yard for
“Ikey!”

The call produced a high-shouldered young fellow, with a round
red face, a short crop of sandy hair, a very broad humorous
mouth, a turned-up nose, and a great sleeved waistcoat of purple
bars, with mother-of-pearl buttons, that seemed to be growing
upon him, and to be in a fair way—if it were not
pruned—of covering his head and overunning his boots.

“Perkins?  Bless you, Perkins wouldn’t go
a-nigh the place.  No!” observed the young man, with
considerable feeling; “he an’t overwise, an’t
Perkins, but he an’t such a fool as that.”

“Well!” said Ikey, holding up his cap with one
hand while he scratched his head with the other, “they say,
in general, that she was murdered, and the howl he ’ooted
the while.”

This very concise summary of the facts was all I could learn,
except that a young man, as hearty and likely a young man as ever
I see, had been took with fits and held down in ’em, after
seeing the hooded woman.  Also, that a personage, dimly
described as “a hold chap, a p. 126sort of one-eyed tramp, answering to
the name of Joby, unless you challenged him as Greenwood, and
then he said, ‘Why not? and even if so, mind your own
business,’” had encountered the hooded woman, a
matter of five or six times.  But, I was not materially
assisted by these witnesses: inasmuch as the first was in
California, and the last was, as Ikey said (and he was confirmed
by the landlord), Anywheres.

Now, although I regard with a hushed and solemn fear, the
mysteries, between which and this state of existence is
interposed the barrier of the great trial and change that fall on
all the things that live; and although I have not the audacity to
pretend that I know anything of them; I can no more reconcile the
mere banging of doors, ringing of bells, creaking of boards, and
such-like insignificances, with the majestic beauty and pervading
analogy of all the Divine rules that I am permitted to
understand, than I had been able, a little while before, to yoke
the spiritual intercourse of my fellow-traveller to the chariot
of the rising sun.  Moreover, I had lived in two haunted
houses—both abroad.  In one of these, an old Italian
palace, which bore the reputation of being very badly haunted
indeed, and which had recently been twice abandoned on that
account, I lived eight months, most tranquilly and pleasantly:
notwithstanding that the house had a score of mysterious
bedrooms, which were never used, and possessed, in one large room
in which I sat reading, times out of number at all hours, and
next to which I slept, a haunted chamber of the first
pretensions.  I gently hinted these considerations to the
landlord.  And as to this particular house having a bad
name, I reasoned with him, Why, how many things had bad names
undeservedly, and how easy it was to give bad names, and did he
not think that if he and I were persistently to whisper in the
village that any weird-looking, old drunken tinker of the
neighbourhood had sold himself to the Devil, he would come in
time to be suspected of that commercial venture!  All this
wise talk was perfectly ineffective with the landlord, I am bound
to confess, and was as dead a failure as ever I made in my
life.

To cut this part of the story short, I was piqued about the
haunted house, and was already half resolved to take it. 
So, after breakfast, I got the keys from Perkins’s
brother-in-law (a whip and harness maker, who keeps the Post
Office, and is under submission to a most rigorous wife of the
Doubly Seceding Little Emmanuel persuasion), and went up to the
house, attended by my landlord and by Ikey.

Within, I found it, as I had expected, transcendently
dismal.  The slowly changing shadows waved on it from the
heavy trees, were doleful in the last degree; the house was
ill-placed, ill-built, ill-planned, and ill-fitted.  It was
damp, it was not free from dry rot, there was a flavour of rats
in it, and it was the gloomy victim of that indescribable decay
which settles on all the work of man’s hands whenever
it’s not turned to man’s account.  The kitchens
and offices p.
127were too large, and too remote from each other. 
Above stairs and below, waste tracts of passage intervened
between patches of fertility represented by rooms; and there was
a mouldy old well with a green growth upon it, hiding like a
murderous trap, near the bottom of the back-stairs, under the
double row of bells.  One of these bells was labelled, on a
black ground in faded white letters, Master B.  This, they told me, was the
bell that rang the most.

I was rather struck by the prompt dexterity with which this
young man pitched his fur cap at the bell, and rang it
himself.  It was a loud, unpleasant bell, and made a very
disagreeable sound.  The other bells were inscribed
according to the names of the rooms to which their wires were
conducted: as “Picture Room,” “Double
Room,” “Clock Room,” and the like. 
Following Master B.’s bell to its source I found that young
gentleman to have had but indifferent third-class accommodation
in a triangular cabin under the cock-loft, with a corner
fireplace which Master B. must have been exceedingly small if he
were ever able to warm himself at, and a corner chimney-piece
like a pyramidal staircase to the ceiling for Tom Thumb. 
The papering of one side of the room had dropped down bodily,
with fragments of plaster adhering to it, and almost blocked up
the door.  It appeared that Master B., in his spiritual
condition, always made a point of pulling the paper down. 
Neither the landlord nor Ikey could suggest why he made such a
fool of himself.

Except that the house had an immensely large rambling loft at
top, I made no other discoveries.  It was moderately well
furnished, but sparely.  Some of the furniture—say, a
third—was as old as the house; the rest was of various
periods within the last half-century.  I was referred to a
corn-chandler in the market-place of the county town to treat for
the house.  I went that day, and I took it for six
months.

It was just the middle of October when I moved in with my
maiden sister (I venture to call her eight-and-thirty, she is so
very handsome, sensible, and engaging).  We took with us, a
deaf stable-man, my bloodhound Turk, two women servants, and a
young person called an Odd Girl.  I have reason to record of
the attendant last enumerated, who was one of the Saint
Lawrence’s Union Female Orphans, that she was a fatal
mistake and a disastrous engagement.

The year was dying early, the leaves were falling fast, it was
a raw cold day when we took possession, and the gloom of the
house was most depressing.  The cook (an amiable woman, but
of a weak turn of intellect) burst into tears on beholding the
kitchen, and requested that her silver watch might be delivered
over to her sister (2 Tuppintock’s Gardens, Liggs’s
Walk, Clapham Rise), in the event of anything happening to her
from the damp.  Streaker, the housemaid, feigned p.
128cheerfulness, but was the greater martyr.  The Odd
Girl, who had never been in the country, alone was pleased, and
made arrangements for sowing an acorn in the garden outside the
scullery window, and rearing an oak.

We went, before dark, through all the natural—as opposed
to supernatural—miseries incidental to our state. 
Dispiriting reports ascended (like the smoke) from the basement
in volumes, and descended from the upper rooms.  There was
no rolling-pin, there was no salamander (which failed to surprise
me, for I don’t know what it is), there was nothing in the
house, what there was, was broken, the last people must have
lived like pigs, what could the meaning of the landlord be? 
Through these distresses, the Odd Girl was cheerful and
exemplary.  But within four hours after dark we had got into
a supernatural groove, and the Odd Girl had seen
“Eyes,” and was in hysterics.

My sister and I had agreed to keep the haunting strictly to
ourselves, and my impression was, and still is, that I had not
left Ikey, when he helped to unload the cart, alone with the
women, or any one of them, for one minute.  Nevertheless, as
I say, the Odd Girl had “seen Eyes” (no other
explanation could ever be drawn from her), before nine, and by
ten o’clock had had as much vinegar applied to her as would
pickle a handsome salmon.

I leave a discerning public to judge of my feelings, when,
under these untoward circumstances, at about half-past ten
o’clock Master B.’s bell began to ring in a most
infuriated manner, and Turk howled until the house resounded with
his lamentations!

I hope I may never again be in a state of mind so unchristian
as the mental frame in which I lived for some weeks, respecting
the memory of Master B.  Whether his bell was rung by rats,
or mice, or bats, or wind, or what other accidental vibration, or
sometimes by one cause, sometimes another, and sometimes by
collusion, I don’t know; but, certain it is, that it did
ring two nights out of three, until I conceived the happy idea of
twisting Master B.’s neck—in other words, breaking
his bell short off—and silencing that young gentleman, as
to my experience and belief, for ever.

But, by that time, the Odd Girl had developed such improving
powers of catalepsy, that she had become a shining example of
that very inconvenient disorder.  She would stiffen, like a
Guy Fawkes endowed with unreason, on the most irrelevant
occasions.  I would address the servants in a lucid manner,
pointing out to them that I had painted Master B.’s room
and balked the paper, and taken Master B.’s bell away and
balked the ringing, and if they could suppose that that
confounded boy had lived and died, to clothe himself with no
better behaviour than would most unquestionably have brought him
and the sharpest particles of a birch-broom into close
acquaintance in the present imperfect state of existence, could
they also suppose a mere poor human being, such as I was, capable
by p. 129those
contemptible means of counteracting and limiting the powers of
the disembodied spirits of the dead, or of any spirits?—I
say I would become emphatic and cogent, not to say rather
complacent, in such an address, when it would all go for nothing
by reason of the Odd Girl’s suddenly stiffening from the
toes upward, and glaring among us like a parochial
petrifaction.

Streaker, the housemaid, too, had an attribute of a most
discomfiting nature.  I am unable to say whether she was of
an unusually lymphatic temperament, or what else was the matter
with her, but this young woman became a mere Distillery for the
production of the largest and most transparent tears I ever met
with.  Combined with these characteristics, was a peculiar
tenacity of hold in those specimens, so that they didn’t
fall, but hung upon her face and nose.  In this condition,
and mildly and deplorably shaking her head, her silence would
throw me more heavily than the Admirable Crichton could have done
in a verbal disputation for a purse of money.  Cook,
likewise, always covered me with confusion as with a garment, by
neatly winding up the session with the protest that the Ouse was
wearing her out, and by meekly repeating her last wishes
regarding her silver watch.

As to our nightly life, the contagion of suspicion and fear
was among us, and there is no such contagion under the sky. 
Hooded woman?  According to the accounts, we were in a
perfect Convent of hooded women.  Noises?  With that
contagion downstairs, I myself have sat in the dismal parlour,
listening, until I have heard so many and such strange noises,
that they would have chilled my blood if I had not warmed it by
dashing out to make discoveries.  Try this in bed, in the
dead of the night: try this at your own comfortable fire-side, in
the life of the night.  You can fill any house with noises,
if you will, until you have a noise for every nerve in your
nervous system.

I repeat; the contagion of suspicion and fear was among us,
and there is no such contagion under the sky.  The women
(their noses in a chronic state of excoriation from
smelling-salts) were always primed and loaded for a swoon, and
ready to go off with hair-triggers.  The two elder detached
the Odd Girl on all expeditions that were considered doubly
hazardous, and she always established the reputation of such
adventures by coming back cataleptic.  If Cook or Streaker
went overhead after dark, we knew we should presently hear a bump
on the ceiling; and this took place so constantly, that it was as
if a fighting man were engaged to go about the house,
administering a touch of his art which I believe is called The
Auctioneer, to every domestic he met with.

It was in vain to do anything.  It was in vain to be
frightened, for the moment in one’s own person, by a real
owl, and then to show the owl.  It was in vain to discover,
by striking an accidental discord on the piano, that Turk always
howled at particular notes and combinations.  p. 130It was in
vain to be a Rhadamanthus with the bells, and if an unfortunate
bell rang without leave, to have it down inexorably and silence
it.  It was in vain to fire up chimneys, let torches down
the well, charge furiously into suspected rooms and
recesses.  We changed servants, and it was no better. 
The new set ran away, and a third set came, and it was no
better.  At last, our comfortable housekeeping got to be so
disorganised and wretched, that I one night dejectedly said to my
sister: “Patty, I begin to despair of our getting people to
go on with us here, and I think we must give this up.”

My sister, who is a woman of immense spirit, replied,
“No, John, don’t give it up.  Don’t be
beaten, John.  There is another way.”

“John,” returned my sister, “if we are not
to be driven out of this house, and that for no reason whatever,
that is apparent to you or me, we must help ourselves and take
the house wholly and solely into our own hands.”

Like most people in my grade of life, I had never thought of
the possibility of going on without those faithful
obstructions.  The notion was so new to me when suggested,
that I looked very doubtful.  “We know they come here
to be frightened and infect one another, and we know they are
frightened and do infect one another,” said my sister.

(The deaf stable-man.  I kept him in my service, and
still keep him, as a phenomenon of moroseness not to be matched
in England.)

“To be sure, John,” assented my sister;
“except Bottles.  And what does that go to
prove?  Bottles talks to nobody, and hears nobody unless he
is absolutely roared at, and what alarm has Bottles ever given,
or taken!  None.”

This was perfectly true; the individual in question having
retired, every night at ten o’clock, to his bed over the
coach-house, with no other company than a pitchfork and a pail of
water.  That the pail of water would have been over me, and
the pitchfork through me, if I had put myself without
announcement in Bottles’s way after that minute, I had
deposited in my own mind as a fact worth remembering. 
Neither had Bottles ever taken the least notice of any of our
many uproars.  An imperturbable and speechless man, he had
sat at his supper, with Streaker present in a swoon, and the Odd
Girl marble, and had only put another potato in his cheek, or
profited by the general misery to help himself to beefsteak
pie.

“And so,” continued my sister, “I exempt
Bottles.  And considering, John, that the house is too
large, and perhaps too lonely, to be kept well in hand by
Bottles, you, and me, I propose that we cast about among our
friends for a certain selected number of the most reliable and
willing—form a Society here for three months—wait
upon ourselves p.
131and one another—live cheerfully and
socially—and see what happens.”

I was so charmed with my sister, that I embraced her on the
spot, and went into her plan with the greatest ardour.

We were then in the third week of November; but, we took our
measures so vigorously, and were so well seconded by the friends
in whom we confided, that there was still a week of the month
unexpired, when our party all came down together merrily, and
mustered in the haunted house.

I will mention, in this place, two small changes that I made
while my sister and I were yet alone.  It occurring to me as
not improbable that Turk howled in the house at night, partly
because he wanted to get out of it, I stationed him in his kennel
outside, but unchained; and I seriously warned the village that
any man who came in his way must not expect to leave him without
a rip in his own throat.  I then casually asked Ikey if he
were a judge of a gun?  On his saying, “Yes, sir, I
knows a good gun when I sees her,” I begged the favour of
his stepping up to the house and looking at mine.

“She’s a true one, sir,” said Ikey,
after inspecting a double-barrelled rifle that I bought in New
York a few years ago.  “No mistake about her,
sir.”

“Ikey!” said I, shaking hands with him warmly: I
may say affectionately; “if there is any truth in these
ghost-stories, the greatest service I can do you, is, to fire at
that figure.  And I promise you, by Heaven and earth, I will
do it with this gun if I see it again!”

The young man thanked me, and took his leave with some little
precipitation, after declining a glass of liquor.  I
imparted my secret to him, because I had never quite forgotten
his throwing his cap at the bell; because I had, on another
occasion, noticed something very like a fur cap, lying not far
from the bell, one night when it had burst out ringing; and
because I had remarked that we were at our ghostliest whenever he
came up in the evening to comfort the servants.  Let me do
Ikey no injustice.  He was afraid of the house, and believed
in its being haunted; and yet he would play false on the haunting
side, so surely as he got an opportunity.  The Odd
Girl’s case was exactly similar.  She went about the
house in a state of real terror, and yet lied monstrously and
wilfully, and invented many of the alarms she spread, and made
many of the sounds we heard.  I had had my eye on the two,
and I know it.  It is not necessary for me, here, to account
for this preposterous state of mind; I content myself with
remarking that it is familiarly known to every intelligent man
who p. 132has
had fair medical, legal, or other watchful experience; that it is
as well established and as common a state of mind as any with
which observers are acquainted; and that it is one of the first
elements, above all others, rationally to be suspected in, and
strictly looked for, and separated from, any question of this
kind.

To return to our party.  The first thing we did when we
were all assembled, was, to draw lots for bedrooms.  That
done, and every bedroom, and, indeed, the whole house, having
been minutely examined by the whole body, we allotted the various
household duties, as if we had been on a gipsy party, or a
yachting party, or a hunting party, or were shipwrecked.  I
then recounted the floating rumours concerning the hooded lady,
the owl, and Master B.: with others, still more filmy, which had
floated about during our occupation, relative to some ridiculous
old ghost of the female gender who went up and down, carrying the
ghost of a round table; and also to an impalpable Jackass, whom
nobody was ever able to catch.  Some of these ideas I really
believe our people below had communicated to one another in some
diseased way, without conveying them in words.  We then
gravely called one another to witness, that we were not there to
be deceived, or to deceive—which we considered pretty much
the same thing—and that, with a serious sense of
responsibility, we would be strictly true to one another, and
would strictly follow out the truth.  The understanding was
established, that any one who heard unusual noises in the night,
and who wished to trace them, should knock at my door; lastly,
that on Twelfth Night, the last night of holy Christmas, all our
individual experiences since that then present hour of our coming
together in the haunted house, should be brought to light for the
good of all; and that we would hold our peace on the subject till
then, unless on some remarkable provocation to break silence.

First—to get my sister and myself out of the
way—there were we two.  In the drawing of lots, my
sister drew her own room, and I drew Master B.’s. 
Next, there was our first cousin John Herschel, so called after
the great astronomer: than whom I suppose a better man at a
telescope does not breathe.  With him, was his wife: a
charming creature to whom he had been married in the previous
spring.  I thought it (under the circumstances) rather
imprudent to bring her, because there is no knowing what even a
false alarm may do at such a time; but I suppose he knew his own
business best, and I must say that if she had been my
wife, I never could have left her endearing and bright face
behind.  They drew the Clock Room.  Alfred Starling, an
uncommonly agreeable young fellow of eight-and-twenty for whom I
have the greatest liking, was in the Double Room; mine, usually,
and designated by that name from having a dressing-room within
it, with two large and cumbersome windows, which no wedges
I was ever able to make, would keep from shaking, in any
weather, p.
133wind or no wind.  Alfred is a young fellow who
pretends to be “fast” (another word for loose, as I
understand the term), but who is much too good and sensible for
that nonsense, and who would have distinguished himself before
now, if his father had not unfortunately left him a small
independence of two hundred a year, on the strength of which his
only occupation in life has been to spend six.  I am in
hopes, however, that his Banker may break, or that he may enter
into some speculation guaranteed to pay twenty per cent.; for, I
am convinced that if he could only be ruined, his fortune is
made.  Belinda Bates, bosom friend of my sister, and a most
intellectual, amiable, and delightful girl, got the Picture
Room.  She has a fine genius for poetry, combined with real
business earnestness, and “goes in”—to use an
expression of Alfred’s—for Woman’s mission,
Woman’s rights, Woman’s wrongs, and everything that
is woman’s with a capital W, or is not and ought to be, or
is and ought not to be.  “Most praiseworthy, my dear,
and Heaven prosper you!” I whispered to her on the first
night of my taking leave of her at the Picture-Room door,
“but don’t overdo it.  And in respect of the
great necessity there is, my darling, for more employments being
within the reach of Woman than our civilisation has as yet
assigned to her, don’t fly at the unfortunate men, even
those men who are at first sight in your way, as if they were the
natural oppressors of your sex; for, trust me, Belinda, they do
sometimes spend their wages among wives and daughters, sisters,
mothers, aunts, and grandmothers; and the play is, really, not
all Wolf and Red Riding-Hood, but has other parts in
it.”  However, I digress.

Belinda, as I have mentioned, occupied the Picture Room. 
We had but three other chambers: the Corner Room, the Cupboard
Room, and the Garden Room.  My old friend, Jack Governor,
“slung his hammock,” as he called it, in the Corner
Room.  I have always regarded Jack as the finest-looking
sailor that ever sailed.  He is gray now, but as handsome as
he was a quarter of a century ago—nay, handsomer.  A
portly, cheery, well-built figure of a broad-shouldered man, with
a frank smile, a brilliant dark eye, and a rich dark
eyebrow.  I remember those under darker hair, and they look
all the better for their silver setting.  He has been
wherever his Union namesake flies, has Jack, and I have met old
shipmates of his, away in the Mediterranean and on the other side
of the Atlantic, who have beamed and brightened at the casual
mention of his name, and have cried, “You know Jack
Governor?  Then you know a prince of men!”  That
he is!  And so unmistakably a naval officer, that if you
were to meet him coming out of an Esquimaux snow-hut in
seal’s skin, you would be vaguely persuaded he was in full
naval uniform.

Jack once had that bright clear eye of his on my sister; but,
it fell out that he married another lady and took her to South
America, where she died.  This was a dozen years ago or
more.  He brought down with him to our haunted house a
little cask of salt beef; for, he p. 134is always convinced that all salt
beef not of his own pickling, is mere carrion, and invariably,
when he goes to London, packs a piece in his portmanteau. 
He had also volunteered to bring with him one “Nat
Beaver,” an old comrade of his, captain of a
merchantman.  Mr. Beaver, with a thick-set wooden face and
figure, and apparently as hard as a block all over, proved to be
an intelligent man, with a world of watery experiences in him,
and great practical knowledge.  At times, there was a
curious nervousness about him, apparently the lingering result of
some old illness; but, it seldom lasted many minutes.  He
got the Cupboard Room, and lay there next to Mr. Undery, my
friend and solicitor: who came down, in an amateur capacity,
“to go through with it,” as he said, and who plays
whist better than the whole Law List, from the red cover at the
beginning to the red cover at the end.

I never was happier in my life, and I believe it was the
universal feeling among us.  Jack Governor, always a man of
wonderful resources, was Chief Cook, and made some of the best
dishes I ever ate, including unapproachable curries.  My
sister was pastrycook and confectioner.  Starling and I were
Cook’s Mate, turn and turn about, and on special occasions
the chief cook “pressed” Mr. Beaver.  We had a
great deal of out-door sport and exercise, but nothing was
neglected within, and there was no ill-humour or misunderstanding
among us, and our evenings were so delightful that we had at
least one good reason for being reluctant to go to bed.

We had a few night alarms in the beginning.  On the first
night, I was knocked up by Jack with a most wonderful
ship’s lantern in his hand, like the gills of some monster
of the deep, who informed me that he “was going aloft to
the main truck,” to have the weathercock down.  It was
a stormy night and I remonstrated; but Jack called my attention
to its making a sound like a cry of despair, and said somebody
would be “hailing a ghost” presently, if it
wasn’t done.  So, up to the top of the house, where I
could hardly stand for the wind, we went, accompanied by Mr.
Beaver; and there Jack, lantern and all, with Mr. Beaver after
him, swarmed up to the top of a cupola, some two dozen feet above
the chimneys, and stood upon nothing particular, coolly knocking
the weathercock off, until they both got into such good spirits
with the wind and the height, that I thought they would never
come down.  Another night, they turned out again, and had a
chimney-cowl off.  Another night, they cut a sobbing and
gulping water-pipe away.  Another night, they found out
something else.  On several occasions, they both, in the
coolest manner, simultaneously dropped out of their respective
bedroom windows, hand over hand by their counterpanes, to
“overhaul” something mysterious in the garden.

The engagement among us was faithfully kept, and nobody
revealed anything.  All we knew was, if any one’s room
were haunted, no one looked the worse for it.

When I established myself in the
triangular garret which had gained so distinguished a reputation,
my thoughts naturally turned to Master B.  My speculations
about him were uneasy and manifold.  Whether his Christian
name was Benjamin, Bissextile (from his having been born in Leap
Year), Bartholomew, or Bill.  Whether the initial letter
belonged to his family name, and that was Baxter, Black, Brown,
Barker, Buggins, Baker, or Bird.  Whether he was a
foundling, and had been baptized B.  Whether he was a
lion-hearted boy, and B. was short for Briton, or for Bull. 
Whether he could possibly have been kith and kin to an
illustrious lady who brightened my own childhood, and had come of
the blood of the brilliant Mother Bunch?

With these profitless meditations I tormented myself
much.  I also carried the mysterious letter into the
appearance and pursuits of the deceased; wondering whether he
dressed in Blue, wore Boots (he couldn’t have been Bald),
was a boy of Brains, liked Books, was good at Bowling, had any
skill as a Boxer, even in his Buoyant Boyhood Bathed from a
Bathing-machine at Bognor, Bangor, Bournemouth, Brighton, or
Broadstairs, like a Bounding Billiard Ball?

It was not long before I remarked that I never by any hazard
had a dream of Master B., or of anything belonging to him. 
But, the instant I awoke from sleep, at whatever hour of the
night, my thoughts took him up, and roamed away, trying to attach
his initial letter to something that would fit it and keep it
quiet.

For six nights, I had been worried thus in Master B.’s
room, when I began to perceive that things were going wrong.

The first appearance that presented itself was early in the
morning when it was but just daylight and no more.  I was
standing shaving at my glass, when I suddenly discovered, to my
consternation and amazement, that I was shaving—not
myself—I am fifty—but a boy.  Apparently Master
B.!

I trembled and looked over my shoulder; nothing there.  I
looked again in the glass, and distinctly saw the features and
expression of a boy, who was shaving, not to get rid of a beard,
but to get one.  Extremely troubled in my mind, I took a few
turns in the room, and went back to the looking-glass, resolved
to steady my hand and complete the operation in which I had been
disturbed.  Opening my eyes, which I had shut while
recovering my firmness, I now met in the glass, looking straight
at me, the eyes of a young man of four or five and twenty. 
Terrified by this new ghost, I closed my eyes, and made a strong
effort to recover myself.  Opening them again, I saw,
shaving his cheek in the glass, my father, who has long been
dead.  Nay, I even saw my grandfather too, whom I never did
see in my life.

p.
136Although naturally much affected by these remarkable
visitations, I determined to keep my secret, until the time
agreed upon for the present general disclosure.  Agitated by
a multitude of curious thoughts, I retired to my room, that
night, prepared to encounter some new experience of a spectral
character.  Nor was my preparation needless, for, waking
from an uneasy sleep at exactly two o’clock in the morning,
what were my feelings to find that I was sharing my bed with the
skeleton of Master B.!

I sprang up, and the skeleton sprang up also.  I then
heard a plaintive voice saying, “Where am I?  What is
become of me?” and, looking hard in that direction,
perceived the ghost of Master B.

The young spectre was dressed in an obsolete fashion: or
rather, was not so much dressed as put into a case of inferior
pepper-and-salt cloth, made horrible by means of shining
buttons.  I observed that these buttons went, in a double
row, over each shoulder of the young ghost, and appeared to
descend his back.  He wore a frill round his neck.  His
right hand (which I distinctly noticed to be inky) was laid upon
his stomach; connecting this action with some feeble pimples on
his countenance, and his general air of nausea, I concluded this
ghost to be the ghost of a boy who had habitually taken a great
deal too much medicine.

“Where am I?” said the little spectre, in a
pathetic voice.  “And why was I born in the Calomel
days, and why did I have all that Calomel given me?”

“Where is my little sister,” said the ghost,
“and where my angelic little wife, and where is the boy I
went to school with?”

I entreated the phantom to be comforted, and above all things
to take heart respecting the loss of the boy he went to school
with.  I represented to him that probably that boy never
did, within human experience, come out well, when
discovered.  I urged that I myself had, in later life,
turned up several boys whom I went to school with, and none of
them had at all answered.  I expressed my humble belief that
that boy never did answer.  I represented that he was a
mythic character, a delusion, and a snare.  I recounted how,
the last time I found him, I found him at a dinner party behind a
wall of white cravat, with an inconclusive opinion on every
possible subject, and a power of silent boredom absolutely
Titanic.  I related how, on the strength of our having been
together at “Old Doylance’s,” he had asked
himself to breakfast with me (a social offence of the largest
magnitude); how, fanning my weak embers of belief in
Doylance’s boys, I had let him in; and how, he had proved
to be a fearful wanderer about the earth, pursuing the race of
Adam with inexplicable notions concerning the currency, and with
a proposition that the Bank of England should, on pain of being
abolished, instantly strike off and circulate, God knows how many
thousand millions of ten-and-sixpenny notes.

p. 137The
ghost heard me in silence, and with a fixed stare. 
“Barber!” it apostrophised me when I had
finished.

“Condemned,” said the ghost, “to shave a
constant change of customers—now, me—now, a young
man—now, thyself as thou art—now, thy
father—now, thy grandfather; condemned, too, to lie down
with a skeleton every night, and to rise with it every
morning—”

I had felt, even before the words were uttered, that I was
under a spell to pursue the phantom.  I immediately did so,
and was in Master B.’s room no longer.

Most people know what long and fatiguing night journeys had
been forced upon the witches who used to confess, and who, no
doubt, told the exact truth—particularly as they were
always assisted with leading questions, and the Torture was
always ready.  I asseverate that, during my occupation of
Master B.’s room, I was taken by the ghost that haunted it,
on expeditions fully as long and wild as any of those. 
Assuredly, I was presented to no shabby old man with a
goat’s horns and tail (something between Pan and an old
clothesman), holding conventional receptions, as stupid as those
of real life and less decent; but, I came upon other things which
appeared to me to have more meaning.

Confident that I speak the truth and shall be believed, I
declare without hesitation that I followed the ghost, in the
first instance on a broom-stick, and afterwards on a
rocking-horse.  The very smell of the animal’s
paint—especially when I brought it out, by making him
warm—I am ready to swear to.  I followed the ghost,
afterwards, in a hackney coach; an institution with the peculiar
smell of which, the present generation is unacquainted, but to
which I am again ready to swear as a combination of stable, dog
with the mange, and very old bellows.  (In this, I appeal to
previous generations to confirm or refute me.)  I pursued
the phantom, on a headless donkey: at least, upon a donkey who
was so interested in the state of his stomach that his head was
always down there, investigating it; on ponies, expressly born to
kick up behind; on roundabouts and swings, from fairs; in the
first cab—another forgotten institution where the fare
regularly got into bed, and was tucked up with the driver.

Not to trouble you with a detailed account of all my travels
in pursuit of the ghost of Master B., which were longer and more
wonderful than those of Sinbad the Sailor, I will confine myself
to one experience from which you may judge of many.

I was marvellously changed.  I was myself, yet not
myself.  I was conscious of something within me, which has
been the same all through my life, and which I have always
recognised under all its phases and varieties as never altering,
and yet I was not the I who had gone to bed in Master B.’s
room.  I had the smoothest of faces and the p. 138shortest of
legs, and I had taken another creature like myself, also with the
smoothest of faces and the shortest of legs, behind a door, and
was confiding to him a proposition of the most astounding
nature.

The other creature assented warmly.  He had no notion of
respectability, neither had I.  It was the custom of the
East, it was the way of the good Caliph Haroun Alraschid (let me
have the corrupted name again for once, it is so scented with
sweet memories!), the usage was highly laudable, and most worthy
of imitation.  “O, yes!  Let us,” said the
other creature with a jump, “have a Seraglio.”

It was not because we entertained the faintest doubts of the
meritorious character of the Oriental establishment we proposed
to import, that we perceived it must be kept a secret from Miss
Griffin.  It was because we knew Miss Griffin to be bereft
of human sympathies, and incapable of appreciating the greatness
of the great Haroun.  Mystery impenetrably shrouded from
Miss Griffin then, let us entrust it to Miss Bule.

We were ten in Miss Griffin’s establishment by Hampstead
Ponds; eight ladies and two gentlemen.  Miss Bule, whom I
judge to have attained the ripe age of eight or nine, took the
lead in society.  I opened the subject to her in the course
of the day, and proposed that she should become the
Favourite.

Miss Bule, after struggling with the diffidence so natural to,
and charming in, her adorable sex, expressed herself as flattered
by the idea, but wished to know how it was proposed to provide
for Miss Pipson?  Miss Bule—who was understood to have
vowed towards that young lady, a friendship, halves, and no
secrets, until death, on the Church Service and Lessons complete
in two volumes with case and lock—Miss Bule said she could
not, as the friend of Pipson, disguise from herself, or me, that
Pipson was not one of the common.

Now, Miss Pipson, having curly hair and blue eyes (which was
my idea of anything mortal and feminine that was called Fair), I
promptly replied that I regarded Miss Pipson in the light of a
Fair Circassian.

[The other creature had already fallen into the second male
place in the State, and was set apart for Grand Vizier.  He
afterwards resisted this disposal of events, but had his hair
pulled until he yielded.]

“Zobeide, no,” I replied; “you will ever be
the favourite Sultana; the first place in my heart, and on my
throne, will be ever yours.”

p. 139Miss
Bule, upon that assurance, consented to propound the idea to her
seven beautiful companions.  It occurring to me, in the
course of the same day, that we knew we could trust a grinning
and good-natured soul called Tabby, who was the serving drudge of
the house, and had no more figure than one of the beds, and upon
whose face there was always more or less black-lead, I slipped
into Miss Bule’s hand after supper, a little note to that
effect; dwelling on the black-lead as being in a manner deposited
by the finger of Providence, pointing Tabby out for Mesrour, the
celebrated chief of the Blacks of the Hareem.

There were difficulties in the formation of the desired
institution, as there are in all combinations.  The other
creature showed himself of a low character, and, when defeated in
aspiring to the throne, pretended to have conscientious scruples
about prostrating himself before the Caliph; wouldn’t call
him Commander of the Faithful; spoke of him slightingly and
inconsistently as a mere “chap;” said he, the other
creature, “wouldn’t play”—Play!—and
was otherwise coarse and offensive.  This meanness of
disposition was, however, put down by the general indignation of
an united Seraglio, and I became blessed in the smiles of eight
of the fairest of the daughters of men.

The smiles could only be bestowed when Miss Griffin was
looking another way, and only then in a very wary manner, for
there was a legend among the followers of the Prophet that she
saw with a little round ornament in the middle of the pattern on
the back of her shawl.  But every day after dinner, for an
hour, we were all together, and then the Favourite and the rest
of the Royal Hareem competed who should most beguile the leisure
of the Serene Haroun reposing from the cares of State—which
were generally, as in most affairs of State, of an arithmetical
character, the Commander of the Faithful being a fearful boggler
at a sum.

On these occasions, the devoted Mesrour, chief of the Blacks
of the Hareem, was always in attendance (Miss Griffin usually
ringing for that officer, at the same time, with great
vehemence), but never acquitted himself in a manner worthy of his
historical reputation.  In the first place, his bringing a
broom into the Divan of the Caliph, even when Haroun wore on his
shoulders the red robe of anger (Miss Pipson’s pelisse),
though it might be got over for the moment, was never to be quite
satisfactorily accounted for.  In the second place, his
breaking out into grinning exclamations of “Lork you
pretties!” was neither Eastern nor respectful.  In the
third place, when specially instructed to say
“Bismillah!” he always said
“Hallelujah!”  This officer, unlike his class,
was too good-humoured altogether, kept his mouth open far too
wide, expressed approbation to an incongruous extent, and even
once—it was on the occasion of the purchase of the Fair
Circassian for five hundred thousand purses of gold, and cheap,
too—embraced the Slave, the Favourite, and the Caliph, all
round.  p.
140(Parenthetically let me say God bless Mesrour, and may
there have been sons and daughters on that tender bosom,
softening many a hard day since!)

Miss Griffin was a model of propriety, and I am at a loss to
imagine what the feelings of the virtuous woman would have been,
if she had known, when she paraded us down the Hampstead Road two
and two, that she was walking with a stately step at the head of
Polygamy and Mahomedanism.  I believe that a mysterious and
terrible joy with which the contemplation of Miss Griffin, in
this unconscious state, inspired us, and a grim sense prevalent
among us that there was a dreadful power in our knowledge of what
Miss Griffin (who knew all things that could be learnt out of
book) didn’t know, were the main-spring of the preservation
of our secret.  It was wonderfully kept, but was once upon
the verge of self-betrayal.  The danger and escape occurred
upon a Sunday.  We were all ten ranged in a conspicuous part
of the gallery at church, with Miss Griffin at our head—as
we were every Sunday—advertising the establishment in an
unsecular sort of way—when the description of Solomon in
his domestic glory happened to be read.  The moment that
monarch was thus referred to, conscience whispered me,
“Thou, too, Haroun!”  The officiating minister
had a cast in his eye, and it assisted conscience by giving him
the appearance of reading personally at me.  A crimson
blush, attended by a fearful perspiration, suffused my
features.  The Grand Vizier became more dead than alive, and
the whole Seraglio reddened as if the sunset of Bagdad shone
direct upon their lovely faces.  At this portentous time the
awful Griffin rose, and balefully surveyed the children of
Islam.  My own impression was, that Church and State had
entered into a conspiracy with Miss Griffin to expose us, and
that we should all be put into white sheets, and exhibited in the
centre aisle.  But, so Westerly—if I may be allowed
the expression as opposite to Eastern associations—was Miss
Griffin’s sense of rectitude, that she merely suspected
Apples, and we were saved.

I have called the Seraglio, united.  Upon the question,
solely, whether the Commander of the Faithful durst exercise a
right of kissing in that sanctuary of the palace, were its
peerless inmates divided.  Zobeide asserted a counter-right
in the Favourite to scratch, and the fair Circassian put her
face, for refuge, into a green baize bag, originally designed for
books.  On the other hand, a young antelope of transcendent
beauty from the fruitful plains of Camden Town (whence she had
been brought, by traders, in the half-yearly caravan that crossed
the intermediate desert after the holidays), held more liberal
opinions, but stipulated for limiting the benefit of them to that
dog, and son of a dog, the Grand Vizier—who had no rights,
and was not in question.  At length, the difficulty was
compromised by the installation of a very youthful slave as
Deputy.  She, raised upon a stool, officially received upon
her cheeks the salutes intended by the p. 141gracious
Haroun for other Sultanas, and was privately rewarded from the
coffers of the Ladies of the Hareem.

And now it was, at the full height of enjoyment of my bliss,
that I became heavily troubled.  I began to think of my
mother, and what she would say to my taking home at Midsummer
eight of the most beautiful of the daughters of men, but all
unexpected.  I thought of the number of beds we made up at
our house, of my father’s income, and of the baker, and my
despondency redoubled.  The Seraglio and malicious Vizier,
divining the cause of their Lord’s unhappiness, did their
utmost to augment it.  They professed unbounded fidelity,
and declared that they would live and die with him.  Reduced
to the utmost wretchedness by these protestations of attachment,
I lay awake, for hours at a time, ruminating on my frightful
lot.  In my despair, I think I might have taken an early
opportunity of falling on my knees before Miss Griffin, avowing
my resemblance to Solomon, and praying to be dealt with according
to the outraged laws of my country, if an unthought-of means of
escape had not opened before me.

One day, we were out walking, two and two—on which
occasion the Vizier had his usual instructions to take note of
the boy at the turnpike, and if he profanely gazed (which he
always did) at the beauties of the Hareem, to have him bowstrung
in the course of the night—and it happened that our hearts
were veiled in gloom.  An unaccountable action on the part
of the antelope had plunged the State into disgrace.  That
charmer, on the representation that the previous day was her
birthday, and that vast treasures had been sent in a hamper for
its celebration (both baseless assertions), had secretly but most
pressingly invited thirty-five neighbouring princes and
princesses to a ball and supper: with a special stipulation that
they were “not to be fetched till twelve.”  This
wandering of the antelope’s fancy, led to the surprising
arrival at Miss Griffin’s door, in divers equipages and
under various escorts, of a great company in full dress, who were
deposited on the top step in a flush of high expectancy, and who
were dismissed in tears.  At the beginning of the double
knocks attendant on these ceremonies, the antelope had retired to
a back attic, and bolted herself in; and at every new arrival,
Miss Griffin had gone so much more and more distracted, that at
last she had been seen to tear her front.  Ultimate
capitulation on the part of the offender, had been followed by
solitude in the linen-closet, bread and water and a lecture to
all, of vindictive length, in which Miss Griffin had used
expressions: Firstly, “I believe you all of you knew of
it;” Secondly, “Every one of you is as wicked as
another;” Thirdly, “A pack of little
wretches.”

Under these circumstances, we were walking drearily along; and
I especially, with my Moosulmaun responsibilities heavy on me,
was in a very low state of mind; when a strange man accosted Miss
Griffin, and, after walking on at her side for a little while and
talking with her, looked at me.  Supposing him to be a
minion of the law, and that p. 142my hour was come, I instantly ran
away, with the general purpose of making for Egypt.

The whole Seraglio cried out, when they saw me making off as
fast as my legs would carry me (I had an impression that the
first turning on the left, and round by the public-house, would
be the shortest way to the Pyramids), Miss Griffin screamed after
me, the faithless Vizier ran after me, and the boy at the
turnpike dodged me into a corner, like a sheep, and cut me
off.  Nobody scolded me when I was taken and brought back;
Miss Griffin only said, with a stunning gentleness, This was very
curious!  Why had I run away when the gentleman looked at
me?

If I had had any breath to answer with, I dare say I should
have made no answer; having no breath, I certainly made
none.  Miss Griffin and the strange man took me between
them, and walked me back to the palace in a sort of state; but
not at all (as I couldn’t help feeling, with astonishment)
in culprit state.

When we got there, we went into a room by ourselves, and Miss
Griffin called in to her assistance, Mesrour, chief of the dusky
guards of the Hareem.  Mesrour, on being whispered to, began
to shed tears.  “Bless you, my precious!” said
that officer, turning to me; “your Pa’s took bitter
bad!”

“Lord temper the wind to you, my lamb!” said the
good Mesrour, kneeling down, that I might have a comforting
shoulder for my head to rest on, “your Pa’s
dead!”

Haroun Alraschid took to flight at the words; the Seraglio
vanished; from that moment, I never again saw one of the eight of
the fairest of the daughters of men.

I was taken home, and there was Debt at home as well as Death,
and we had a sale there.  My own little bed was so
superciliously looked upon by a Power unknown to me, hazily
called “The Trade,” that a brass coal-scuttle, a
roasting-jack, and a birdcage, were obliged to be put into it to
make a Lot of it, and then it went for a song.  So I heard
mentioned, and I wondered what song, and thought what a dismal
song it must have been to sing!

Then, I was sent to a great, cold, bare, school of big boys;
where everything to eat and wear was thick and clumpy, without
being enough; where everybody, large and small, was cruel; where
the boys knew all about the sale, before I got there, and asked
me what I had fetched, and who had bought me, and hooted at me,
“Going, going, gone!”  I never whispered in that
wretched place that I had been Haroun, or had had a Seraglio:
for, I knew that if I mentioned my reverses, I should be so
worried, that I should have to drown myself in the muddy pond
near the playground, which looked like the beer.

Ah me, ah me!  No other ghost has haunted the boy’s
room, my friends, since I have occupied it, than the ghost of my
own childhood, the ghost of my own innocence, the ghost of my own
airy belief.  p.
143Many a time have I pursued the phantom: never with this
man’s stride of mine to come up with it, never with these
man’s hands of mine to touch it, never more to this
man’s heart of mine to hold it in its purity.  And
here you see me working out, as cheerfully and thankfully as I
may, my doom of shaving in the glass a constant change of
customers, and of lying down and rising up with the skeleton
allotted to me for my mortal companion.

I have always noticed a prevalent
want of courage, even among persons of superior intelligence and
culture, as to imparting their own psychological experiences when
those have been of a strange sort.  Almost all men are
afraid that what they could relate in such wise would find no
parallel or response in a listener’s internal life, and
might be suspected or laughed at.  A truthful traveller, who
should have seen some extraordinary creature in the likeness of a
sea-serpent, would have no fear of mentioning it; but the same
traveller, having had some singular presentiment, impulse, vagary
of thought, vision (so-called), dream, or other remarkable mental
impression, would hesitate considerably before he would own to
it.  To this reticence I attribute much of the obscurity in
which such subjects are involved.  We do not habitually
communicate our experiences of these subjective things as we do
our experiences of objective creation.  The consequence is,
that the general stock of experience in this regard appears
exceptional, and really is so, in respect of being miserably
imperfect.

In what I am going to relate, I have no intention of setting
up, opposing, or supporting, any theory whatever.  I know
the history of the Bookseller of Berlin, I have studied the case
of the wife of a late Astronomer Royal as related by Sir David
Brewster, and I have followed the minutest details of a much more
remarkable case of Spectral Illusion occurring within my private
circle of friends.  It may be necessary to state as to this
last, that the sufferer (a lady) was in no degree, however
distant, related to me.  A mistaken assumption on that head
might suggest an explanation of a part of my own case,—p. 304but only a
part,—which would be wholly without foundation.  It
cannot be referred to my inheritance of any developed
peculiarity, nor had I ever before any at all similar experience,
nor have I ever had any at all similar experience since.

It does not signify how many years ago, or how few, a certain
murder was committed in England, which attracted great
attention.  We hear more than enough of murderers as they
rise in succession to their atrocious eminence, and I would bury
the memory of this particular brute, if I could, as his body was
buried, in Newgate Jail.  I purposely abstain from giving
any direct clue to the criminal’s individuality.

When the murder was first discovered, no suspicion
fell—or I ought rather to say, for I cannot be too precise
in my facts, it was nowhere publicly hinted that any suspicion
fell—on the man who was afterwards brought to trial. 
As no reference was at that time made to him in the newspapers,
it is obviously impossible that any description of him can at
that time have been given in the newspapers.  It is
essential that this fact be remembered.

Unfolding at breakfast my morning paper, containing the
account of that first discovery, I found it to be deeply
interesting, and I read it with close attention.  I read it
twice, if not three times.  The discovery had been made in a
bedroom, and, when I laid down the paper, I was aware of a
flash—rush—flow—I do not know what to call
it,—no word I can find is satisfactorily
descriptive,—in which I seemed to see that bedroom passing
through my room, like a picture impossibly painted on a running
river.  Though almost instantaneous in its passing, it was
perfectly clear; so clear that I distinctly, and with a sense of
relief, observed the absence of the dead body from the bed.

It was in no romantic place that I had this curious sensation,
but in chambers in Piccadilly, very near to the corner of St.
James’s Street.  It was entirely new to me.  I
was in my easy-chair at the moment, and the sensation was
accompanied with a peculiar shiver which started the chair from
its position.  (But it is to be noted that the chair ran
easily on castors.)  I went to one of the windows (there are
two in the room, and the room is on the second floor) to refresh
my eyes with the moving objects down in Piccadilly.  It was
a bright autumn morning, and the street was sparkling and
cheerful.  The wind was high.  As I looked out, it
brought down from the Park a quantity of fallen leaves, which a
gust took, and whirled into a spiral pillar.  As the pillar
fell and the leaves dispersed, I saw two men on the opposite side
of the way, going from West to East.  They were one behind
the other.  The foremost man often looked back over his
shoulder.  The second man followed him, at a distance of
some thirty paces, with his right hand menacingly raised. 
First, the singularity and steadiness of this threatening gesture
in so public a thoroughfare attracted my attention; and next, the
more remarkable circumstance that nobody heeded it.  Both
men threaded their way among the p. 305other passengers with a smoothness
hardly consistent even with the action of walking on a pavement;
and no single creature, that I could see, gave them place,
touched them, or looked after them.  In passing before my
windows, they both stared up at me.  I saw their two faces
very distinctly, and I knew that I could recognise them
anywhere.  Not that I had consciously noticed anything very
remarkable in either face, except that the man who went first had
an unusually lowering appearance, and that the face of the man
who followed him was of the colour of impure wax.

I am a bachelor, and my valet and his wife constitute my whole
establishment.  My occupation is in a certain Branch Bank,
and I wish that my duties as head of a Department were as light
as they are popularly supposed to be.  They kept me in town
that autumn, when I stood in need of change.  I was not ill,
but I was not well.  My reader is to make the most that can
be reasonably made of my feeling jaded, having a depressing sense
upon me of a monotonous life, and being “slightly
dyspeptic.”  I am assured by my renowned doctor that
my real state of health at that time justifies no stronger
description, and I quote his own from his written answer to my
request for it.

As the circumstances of the murder, gradually unravelling,
took stronger and stronger possession of the public mind, I kept
them away from mine by knowing as little about them as was
possible in the midst of the universal excitement.  But I
knew that a verdict of Wilful Murder had been found against the
suspected murderer, and that he had been committed to Newgate for
trial.  I also knew that his trial had been postponed over
one Sessions of the Central Criminal Court, on the ground of
general prejudice and want of time for the preparation of the
defence.  I may further have known, but I believe I did not,
when, or about when, the Sessions to which his trial stood
postponed would come on.

My sitting-room, bedroom, and dressing-room, are all on one
floor.  With the last there is no communication but through
the bedroom.  True, there is a door in it, once
communicating with the staircase; but a part of the fitting of my
bath has been—and had then been for some years—fixed
across it.  At the same period, and as a part of the same
arrangement,—the door had been nailed up and canvased
over.

I was standing in my bedroom late one night, giving some
directions to my servant before he went to bed.  My face was
towards the only available door of communication with the
dressing-room, and it was closed.  My servant’s back
was towards that door.  While I was speaking to him, I saw
it open, and a man look in, who very earnestly and mysteriously
beckoned to me.  That man was the man who had gone second of
the two along Piccadilly, and whose face was of the colour of
impure wax.

The figure, having beckoned, drew back, and closed the
door.  With no longer pause than was made by my crossing the
bedroom, I p.
306opened the dressing-room door, and looked in.  I
had a lighted candle already in my hand.  I felt no inward
expectation of seeing the figure in the dressing-room, and I did
not see it there.

Conscious that my servant stood amazed, I turned round to him,
and said: “Derrick, could you believe that in my cool
senses I fancied I saw a —”  As I there laid my
hand upon his breast, with a sudden start he trembled violently,
and said, “O Lord, yes, sir!  A dead man
beckoning!”

Now I do not believe that this John Derrick, my trusty and
attached servant for more than twenty years, had any impression
whatever of having seen any such figure, until I touched
him.  The change in him was so startling, when I touched
him, that I fully believe he derived his impression in some
occult manner from me at that instant.

I bade John Derrick bring some brandy, and I gave him a dram,
and was glad to take one myself.  Of what had preceded that
night’s phenomenon, I told him not a single word. 
Reflecting on it, I was absolutely certain that I had never seen
that face before, except on the one occasion in Piccadilly. 
Comparing its expression when beckoning at the door with its
expression when it had stared up at me as I stood at my window, I
came to the conclusion that on the first occasion it had sought
to fasten itself upon my memory, and that on the second occasion
it had made sure of being immediately remembered.

I was not very comfortable that night, though I felt a
certainty, difficult to explain, that the figure would not
return.  At daylight I fell into a heavy sleep, from which I
was awakened by John Derrick’s coming to my bedside with a
paper in his hand.

This paper, it appeared, had been the subject of an
altercation at the door between its bearer and my servant. 
It was a summons to me to serve upon a Jury at the forthcoming
Sessions of the Central Criminal Court at the Old Bailey.  I
had never before been summoned on such a Jury, as John Derrick
well knew.  He believed—I am not certain at this hour
whether with reason or otherwise—that that class of Jurors
were customarily chosen on a lower qualification than mine, and
he had at first refused to accept the summons.  The man who
served it had taken the matter very coolly.  He had said
that my attendance or non-attendance was nothing to him; there
the summons was; and I should deal with it at my own peril, and
not at his.

For a day or two I was undecided whether to respond to this
call, or take no notice of it.  I was not conscious of the
slightest mysterious bias, influence, or attraction, one way or
other.  Of that I am as strictly sure as of every other
statement that I make here.  Ultimately I decided, as a
break in the monotony of my life, that I would go.

The appointed morning was a raw morning in the month of
November.  There was a dense brown fog in Piccadilly, and it
became positively black and in the last degree oppressive East of
Temple Bar.  I found the passages and staircases of the
Court-House p.
307flaringly lighted with gas, and the Court itself
similarly illuminated.  I think that, until I was
conducted by officers into the Old Court and saw its crowded
state, I did not know that the Murderer was to be tried that
day.  I think that, until I was so helped into the
Old Court with considerable difficulty, I did not know into which
of the two Courts sitting my summons would take me.  But
this must not be received as a positive assertion, for I am not
completely satisfied in my mind on either point.

I took my seat in the place appropriated to Jurors in waiting,
and I looked about the Court as well as I could through the cloud
of fog and breath that was heavy in it.  I noticed the black
vapour hanging like a murky curtain outside the great windows,
and I noticed the stifled sound of wheels on the straw or tan
that was littered in the street; also, the hum of the people
gathered there, which a shrill whistle, or a louder song or hail
than the rest, occasionally pierced.  Soon afterwards the
Judges, two in number, entered, and took their seats.  The
buzz in the Court was awfully hushed.  The direction was
given to put the Murderer to the bar.  He appeared
there.  And in that same instant I recognised in him the
first of the two men who had gone down Piccadilly.

If my name had been called then, I doubt if I could have
answered to it audibly.  But it was called about sixth or
eighth in the panel, and I was by that time able to say,
“Here!”  Now, observe.  As I stepped into
the box, the prisoner, who had been looking on attentively, but
with no sign of concern, became violently agitated, and beckoned
to his attorney.  The prisoner’s wish to challenge me
was so manifest, that it occasioned a pause, during which the
attorney, with his hand upon the dock, whispered with his client,
and shook his head.  I afterwards had it from that
gentleman, that the prisoner’s first affrighted words to
him were, “At all hazards, challenge that
man!”  But that, as he would give no reason for
it, and admitted that he had not even known my name until he
heard it called and I appeared, it was not done.

Both on the ground already explained, that I wish to avoid
reviving the unwholesome memory of that Murderer, and also
because a detailed account of his long trial is by no means
indispensable to my narrative, I shall confine myself closely to
such incidents in the ten days and nights during which we, the
Jury, were kept together, as directly bear on my own curious
personal experience.  It is in that, and not in the
Murderer, that I seek to interest my reader.  It is to that,
and not to a page of the Newgate Calendar, that I beg
attention.

I was chosen Foreman of the Jury.  On the second morning
of the trial, after evidence had been taken for two hours (I
heard the church clocks strike), happening to cast my eyes over
my brother jurymen, I found an inexplicable difficulty in
counting them.  I counted them several times, yet always
with the same difficulty.  In short, I made them one too
many.

p. 308I
touched the brother jurymen whose place was next me, and I
whispered to him, “Oblige me by counting us.” 
He looked surprised by the request, but turned his head and
counted. “Why,” says he, suddenly, “we are
Thirt—; but no, it’s not possible.  No.  We
are twelve.”

According to my counting that day, we were always right in
detail, but in the gross we were always one too many.  There
was no appearance—no figure—to account for it; but I
had now an inward foreshadowing of the figure that was surely
coming.

The Jury were housed at the London Tavern.  We all slept
in one large room on separate tables, and we were constantly in
the charge and under the eye of the officer sworn to hold us in
safe-keeping.  I see no reason for suppressing the real name
of that officer.  He was intelligent, highly polite, and
obliging, and (I was glad to hear) much respected in the
City.  He had an agreeable presence, good eyes, enviable
black whiskers, and a fine sonorous voice.  His name was Mr.
Harker.

When we turned into our twelve beds at night, Mr.
Harker’s bed was drawn across the door.  On the night
of the second day, not being disposed to lie down, and seeing Mr.
Harker sitting on his bed, I went and sat beside him, and offered
him a pinch of snuff.  As Mr. Harker’s hand touched
mine in taking it from my box, a peculiar shiver crossed him, and
he said, “Who is this?”

Following Mr. Harker’s eyes, and looking along the room,
I saw again the figure I expected,—the second of the two
men who had gone down Piccadilly.  I rose, and advanced a
few steps; then stopped, and looked round at Mr. Harker.  He
was quite unconcerned, laughed, and said in a pleasant way,
“I thought for a moment we had a thirteenth juryman,
without a bed.  But I see it is the moonlight.”

Making no revelation to Mr. Harker, but inviting him to take a
walk with me to the end of the room, I watched what the figure
did.  It stood for a few moments by the bedside of each of
my eleven brother jurymen, close to the pillow.  It always
went to the right-hand side of the bed, and always passed out
crossing the foot of the next bed.  It seemed, from the
action of the head, merely to look down pensively at each
recumbent figure.  It took no notice of me, or of my bed,
which was that nearest to Mr. Harker’s.  It seemed to
go out where the moonlight came in, through a high window, as by
an aërial flight of stairs.

Next morning at breakfast, it appeared that everybody present
had dreamed of the murdered man last night, except myself and Mr.
Harker.

I now felt as convinced that the second man who had gone down
Piccadilly was the murdered man (so to speak), as if it had been
borne into my comprehension by his immediate testimony.  But
even this took place, and in a manner for which I was not at all
prepared.

On the fifth day of the trial, when the case for the
prosecution was p.
309drawing to a close, a miniature of the murdered man,
missing from his bedroom upon the discovery of the deed, and
afterwards found in a hiding-place where the Murderer had been
seen digging, was put in evidence.  Having been identified
by the witness under examination, it was handed up to the Bench,
and thence handed down to be inspected by the Jury.  As an
officer in a black gown was making his way with it across to me,
the figure of the second man who had gone down Piccadilly
impetuously started from the crowd, caught the miniature from the
officer, and gave it to me with his own hands, at the same time
saying, in a low and hollow tone,—before I saw the
miniature, which was in a locket,—“I was younger
then, and my face was not then drained of
blood.”  It also came between me and the brother
juryman to whom I would have given the miniature, and between him
and the brother juryman to whom he would have given it, and so
passed it on through the whole of our number, and back into my
possession.  Not one of them, however, detected this.

At table, and generally when we were shut up together in Mr.
Harker’s custody, we had from the first naturally discussed
the day’s proceedings a good deal.  On that fifth day,
the case for the prosecution being closed, and we having that
side of the question in a completed shape before us, our
discussion was more animated and serious.  Among our number
was a vestryman,—the densest idiot I have ever seen at
large,—who met the plainest evidence with the most
preposterous objections, and who was sided with by two flabby
parochial parasites; all the three impanelled from a district so
delivered over to Fever that they ought to have been upon their
own trial for five hundred Murders.  When these mischievous
blockheads were at their loudest, which was towards midnight,
while some of us were already preparing for bed, I again saw the
murdered man.  He stood grimly behind them, beckoning to
me.  On my going towards them, and striking into the
conversation, he immediately retired.  This was the
beginning of a separate series of appearances, confined to that
long room in which we were confined.  Whenever a knot of my
brother jurymen laid their heads together, I saw the head of the
murdered man among theirs.  Whenever their comparison of
notes was going against him, he would solemnly and irresistibly
beckon to me.

It will be borne in mind that down to the production of the
miniature, on the fifth day of the trial, I had never seen the
Appearance in Court.  Three changes occurred now that we
entered on the case for the defence.  Two of them I will
mention together, first.  The figure was now in Court
continually, and it never there addressed itself to me, but
always to the person who was speaking at the time.  For
instance: the throat of the murdered man had been cut straight
across.  In the opening speech for the defence, it was
suggested that the deceased might have cut his own throat. 
At that very moment, the figure, with its throat in the dreadful
condition p.
310referred to (this it had concealed before), stood at
the speaker’s elbow, motioning across and across its
windpipe, now with the right hand, now with the left, vigorously
suggesting to the speaker himself the impossibility of such a
wound having been self-inflicted by either hand.  For
another instance: a witness to character, a woman, deposed to the
prisoner’s being the most amiable of mankind.  The
figure at that instant stood on the floor before her, looking her
full in the face, and pointing out the prisoner’s evil
countenance with an extended arm and an outstretched finger.

The third change now to be added impressed me strongly as the
most marked and striking of all.  I do not theorise upon it;
I accurately state it, and there leave it.  Although the
Appearance was not itself perceived by those whom it addressed,
its coming close to such persons was invariably attended by some
trepidation or disturbance on their part.  It seemed to me
as if it were prevented, by laws to which I was not amenable,
from fully revealing itself to others, and yet as if it could
invisibly, dumbly, and darkly overshadow their minds.  When
the leading counsel for the defence suggested that hypothesis of
suicide, and the figure stood at the learned gentleman’s
elbow, frightfully sawing at its severed throat, it is undeniable
that the counsel faltered in his speech, lost for a few seconds
the thread of his ingenious discourse, wiped his forehead with
his handkerchief, and turned extremely pale.  When the
witness to character was confronted by the Appearance, her eyes
most certainly did follow the direction of its pointed finger,
and rest in great hesitation and trouble upon the
prisoner’s face.  Two additional illustrations will
suffice.  On the eighth day of the trial, after the pause
which was every day made early in the afternoon for a few
minutes’ rest and refreshment, I came back into Court with
the rest of the Jury some little time before the return of the
Judges.  Standing up in the box and looking about me, I
thought the figure was not there, until, chancing to raise my
eyes to the gallery, I saw it bending forward, and leaning over a
very decent woman, as if to assure itself whether the Judges had
resumed their seats or not.  Immediately afterwards that
woman screamed, fainted, and was carried out.  So with the
venerable, sagacious, and patient Judge who conducted the
trial.  When the case was over, and he settled himself and
his papers to sum up, the murdered man, entering by the
Judges’ door, advanced to his Lordship’s desk, and
looked eagerly over his shoulder at the pages of his notes which
he was turning.  A change came over his Lordship’s
face; his hand stopped; the peculiar shiver, that I knew so well,
passed over him; he faltered, “Excuse me, gentlemen, for a
few moments.  I am somewhat oppressed by the vitiated
air;” and did not recover until he had drunk a glass of
water.

Through all the monotony of six of those interminable ten
days,—the same Judges and others on the bench, the same
Murderer in the dock, the same lawyers at the table, the same
tones of question and p. 311answer rising to the roof of the
court, the same scratching of the Judge’s pen, the same
ushers going in and out, the same lights kindled at the same hour
when there had been any natural light of day, the same foggy
curtain outside the great windows when it was foggy, the same
rain pattering and dripping when it was rainy, the same footmarks
of turnkeys and prisoner day after day on the same sawdust, the
same keys locking and unlocking the same heavy
doors,—through all the wearisome monotony which made me
feel as if I had been Foreman of the Jury for a vast period of
time, and Piccadilly had flourished coevally with Babylon, the
murdered man never lost one trace of his distinctness in my eyes,
nor was he at any moment less distinct than anybody else.  I
must not omit, as a matter of fact, that I never once saw the
Appearance which I call by the name of the murdered man look at
the Murderer.  Again and again I wondered, “Why does
he not?”  But he never did.

Nor did he look at me, after the production of the miniature,
until the last closing minutes of the trial arrived.  We
retired to consider, at seven minutes before ten at night. 
The idiotic vestryman and his two parochial parasites gave us so
much trouble that we twice returned into Court to beg to have
certain extracts from the Judge’s notes re-read.  Nine
of us had not the smallest doubt about those passages, neither, I
believe, had any one in the Court; the dunder-headed triumvirate,
having no idea but obstruction, disputed them for that very
reason.  At length we prevailed, and finally the Jury
returned into Court at ten minutes past twelve.

The murdered man at that time stood directly opposite the
Jury-box, on the other side of the Court.  As I took my
place, his eyes rested on me with great attention; he seemed
satisfied, and slowly shook a great gray veil, which he carried
on his arm for the first time, over his head and whole
form.  As I gave in our verdict, “Guilty,” the
veil collapsed, all was gone, and his place was empty.

The Murderer, being asked by the Judge, according to usage,
whether he had anything to say before sentence of Death should be
passed upon him, indistinctly muttered something which was
described in the leading newspapers of the following day as
“a few rambling, incoherent, and half-audible words, in
which he was understood to complain that he had not had a fair
trial, because the Foreman of the Jury was prepossessed against
him.”  The remarkable declaration that he really made
was this: “My Lord, I knew I was a doomed
man, when the Foreman of my Jury came into the
box.  My Lord, I knew he would never let me
off, because, before I was taken, he somehow
got to my bedside in the night, woke me, and put a
rope round my neck.”

When he heard a voice thus calling to him, he was standing at
the door of his box, with a flag in his hand, furled round its
short pole.  One would have thought, considering the nature
of the ground, that he could not have doubted from what quarter
the voice came; but instead of looking up to where I stood on the
top of the steep cutting nearly over his head, he turned himself
about, and looked down the Line.  There was something
remarkable in his manner of doing so, though I could not have
said for my life what.  But I know it was remarkable enough
to attract my notice, even though his figure was foreshortened
and shadowed, down in the deep trench, and mine was high above
him, so steeped in the glow of an angry sunset, that I had shaded
my eyes with my hand before I saw him at all.

From looking down the Line, he turned himself about again,
and, raising his eyes, saw my figure high above him.

He looked up at me without replying, and I looked down at him
without pressing him too soon with a repetition of my idle
question.  Just then there came a vague vibration in the
earth and air, quickly changing into a violent pulsation, and an
oncoming rush that caused me to start back, as though it had
force to draw me down.  When such vapour as rose to my
height from this rapid train had passed me, and was skimming away
over the landscape, I looked down again, and saw him refurling
the flag he had shown while the train went by.

I repeated my inquiry.  After a pause, during which he
seemed to regard me with fixed attention, he motioned with his
rolled-up flag towards a point on my level, some two or three
hundred yards distant.  I called down to him, “All
right!” and made for that point.  There, by dint of
looking closely about me, I found a rough zigzag descending path
notched out, which I followed.

The cutting was extremely deep, and unusually
precipitate.  It was made through a clammy stone, that
became oozier and wetter as I went down.  For these reasons,
I found the way long enough to give me time to recall a singular
air of reluctance or compulsion with which he had pointed out the
path.

When I came down low enough upon the zigzag descent to see him
again, I saw that he was standing between the rails on the way by
p. 313which
the train had lately passed, in an attitude as if he were waiting
for me to appear.  He had his left hand at his chin, and
that left elbow rested on his right hand, crossed over his
breast.  His attitude was one of such expectation and
watchfulness that I stopped a moment, wondering at it.

I resumed my downward way, and stepping out upon the level of
the railroad, and drawing nearer to him, saw that he was a dark,
sallow man, with a dark beard and rather heavy eyebrows. 
His post was in as solitary and dismal a place as ever I
saw.  On either side, a dripping-wet wall of jagged stone,
excluding all view but a strip of sky; the perspective one way
only a crooked prolongation of this great dungeon; the shorter
perspective in the other direction terminating in a gloomy red
light, and the gloomier entrance to a black tunnel, in whose
massive architecture there was a barbarous, depressing, and
forbidding air.  So little sunlight ever found its way to
this spot, that it had an earthy, deadly smell; and so much cold
wind rushed through it, that it struck chill to me, as if I had
left the natural world.

Before he stirred, I was near enough to him to have touched
him.  Not even then removing his eyes from mine, he stepped
back one step, and lifted his hand.

This was a lonesome post to occupy (I said), and it had
riveted my attention when I looked down from up yonder.  A
visitor was a rarity, I should suppose; not an unwelcome rarity,
I hoped?  In me, he merely saw a man who had been shut up
within narrow limits all his life, and who, being at last set
free, had a newly-awakened interest in these great works. 
To such purpose I spoke to him; but I am far from sure of the
terms I used; for, besides that I am not happy in opening any
conversation, there was something in the man that daunted me.

He directed a most curious look towards the red light near the
tunnel’s mouth, and looked all about it, as if something
were missing from it, and then looked at me.

The monstrous thought came into my mind, as I perused the
fixed eyes and the saturnine face, that this was a spirit, not a
man.  I have speculated since, whether there may have been
infection in his mind.

In my turn, I stepped back.  But in making the action, I
detected in his eyes some latent fear of me.  This put the
monstrous thought to flight.

“My good fellow, what should I do there?  However,
be that as it may, I never was there, you may swear.”

His manner cleared, like my own.  He replied to my
remarks with readiness, and in well-chosen words.  Had he
much to do there?  Yes; that was to say, he had enough
responsibility to bear; but exactness and watchfulness were what
was required of him, and of actual work—manual
labour—he had next to none.  To change that signal, to
trim those lights, and to turn this iron handle now and then, was
all he had to do under that head.  Regarding those many long
and lonely hours of which I seemed to make so much, he could only
say that the routine of his life had shaped itself into that
form, and he had grown used to it.  He had taught himself a
language down here,—if only to know it by sight, and to
have formed his own crude ideas of its pronunciation, could be
called learning it.  He had also worked at fractions and
decimals, and tried a little algebra; but he was, and had been as
a boy, a poor hand at figures.  Was it necessary for him
when on duty always to remain in that channel of damp air, and
could he never rise into the sunshine from between those high
stone walls?  Why, that depended upon times and
circumstances.  Under some conditions there would be less
upon the Line than under others, and the same held good as to
certain hours of the day and night.  In bright weather, he
did choose occasions for getting a little above these lower
shadows; but, being at all times liable to be called by his
electric bell, and at such times listening for it with redoubled
anxiety, the relief was less than I would suppose.

He took me into his box, where there was a fire, a desk for an
official book in which he had to make certain entries, a
telegraphic instrument with its dial, face, and needles, and the
little bell of which he had spoken.  On my trusting that he
would excuse the remark that he had been well educated, and (I
hoped I might say without offence) perhaps educated above that
station, he observed that instances of slight incongruity in such
wise would rarely be found wanting among large bodies of men;
that he had heard it was so in workhouses, in the police force,
even in that last desperate resource, the army; and that he knew
it was so, more or less, in any great railway staff.  He had
been, when young (if I could believe it, sitting in that
hut,—he scarcely could), a student of natural philosophy,
and had attended lectures; but he had run wild, misused his
opportunities, gone down, and never risen again.  He had no
complaint to offer about that.  He had made his bed, and he
lay upon it.  It was far too late to make another.

All that I have here condensed he said in a quiet manner, with
his grave, dark regards divided between me and the fire.  He
threw in the word, “Sir,” from time to time, and
especially when he referred p. 315to his youth,—as though to
request me to understand that he claimed to be nothing but what I
found him.  He was several times interrupted by the little
bell, and had to read off messages, and send replies.  Once
he had to stand without the door, and display a flag as a train
passed, and make some verbal communication to the driver. 
In the discharge of his duties, I observed him to be remarkably
exact and vigilant, breaking off his discourse at a syllable, and
remaining silent until what he had to do was done.

In a word, I should have set this man down as one of the
safest of men to be employed in that capacity, but for the
circumstance that while he was speaking to me he twice broke off
with a fallen colour, turned his face towards the little bell
when it did NOT ring, opened the
door of the hut (which was kept shut to exclude the unhealthy
damp), and looked out towards the red light near the mouth of the
tunnel.  On both of those occasions, he came back to the
fire with the inexplicable air upon him which I had remarked,
without being able to define, when we were so far asunder.

“I believe I used to be so,” he rejoined, in the
low voice in which he had first spoken; “but I am troubled,
sir, I am troubled.”

He would have recalled the words if he could.  He had
said them, however, and I took them up quickly.

“It is very difficult to impart, sir.  It is very,
very difficult to speak of.  If ever you make me another
visit, I will try to tell you.”

He thanked me, and went out at the door with me. 
“I’ll show my white light, sir,” he said, in
his peculiar low voice, “till you have found the way
up.  When you have found it, don’t call out!  And
when you are at the top, don’t call out!”

“And when you come down to-morrow night, don’t
call out!  Let me ask you a parting question.  What
made you cry, ‘Halloa!  Below there!’
to-night?”

He wished me good-night, and held up his light.  I walked
by the side of the down Line of rails (with a very disagreeable
sensation of a train coming behind me) until I found the
path.  It was easier to mount than to descend, and I got
back to my inn without any adventure.

Punctual to my appointment, I placed my foot on the first
notch of the zigzag next night, as the distant clocks were
striking eleven.  He was waiting for me at the bottom, with
his white light on.  “I have not called out,” I
said, when we came close together; “may I speak
now?”  “By all means, sir.” 
“Good-night, then, and here’s my hand.” 
“Good-night, sir, and here’s mine.”  With
that we walked side by side to his box, entered it, closed the
door, and sat down by the fire.

“I have made up my mind, sir,” he began, bending
forward as soon as we were seated, and speaking in a tone but a
little above a whisper, “that you shall not have to ask me
twice what troubles me.  I took you for some one else
yesterday evening.  That troubles me.”

“I don’t know.  I never saw the face. 
The left arm is across the face, and the right arm is
waved,—violently waved.  This way.”

I followed his action with my eyes, and it was the action of
an arm gesticulating, with the utmost passion and vehemence,
“For God’s sake, clear the way!”

“One moonlight night,” said the man, “I was
sitting here, when I heard a voice cry, ‘Halloa! 
Below there!’  I started up, looked from that door,
and saw this Some one else standing by the red light near the
tunnel, waving as I just now showed you.  The voice seemed
hoarse with shouting, and it cried, ‘Look out!  Look
out!’  And then again, ‘Halloa!  Below
there!  Look out!’  I caught up my lamp, turned
it on red, and ran towards the figure, calling,
‘What’s wrong?  What has happened? 
Where?’  It stood just outside the blackness of the
tunnel.  I advanced so close upon it that I wondered at its
keeping the sleeve across its eyes.  I ran right up at it,
and had my hand stretched out to pull the sleeve away, when it
was gone.”

“No.  I ran on into the tunnel, five hundred
yards.  I stopped, and held my lamp above my head, and saw
the figures of the measured distance, and saw the wet stains
stealing down the walls and trickling p. 317through the arch.  I ran out
again faster than I had run in (for I had a mortal abhorrence of
the place upon me), and I looked all round the red light with my
own red light, and I went up the iron ladder to the gallery atop
of it, and I came down again, and ran back here.  I
telegraphed both ways, ‘An alarm has been given.  Is
anything wrong?’  The answer came back, both ways,
‘All well.’”

Resisting the slow touch of a frozen finger tracing out my
spine, I showed him how that this figure must be a deception of
his sense of sight; and how that figures, originating in disease
of the delicate nerves that minister to the functions of the eye,
were known to have often troubled patients, some of whom had
become conscious of the nature of their affliction, and had even
proved it by experiments upon themselves.  “As to an
imaginary cry,” said I, “do but listen for a moment
to the wind in this unnatural valley while we speak so low, and
to the wild harp it makes of the telegraph wires.”

That was all very well, he returned, after we had sat
listening for a while, and he ought to know something of the wind
and the wires,—he who so often passed long winter nights
there, alone and watching.  But he would beg to remark that
he had not finished.

“Within six hours after the Appearance, the memorable
accident on this Line happened, and within ten hours the dead and
wounded were brought along through the tunnel over the spot where
the figure had stood.”

A disagreeable shudder crept over me, but I did my best
against it.  It was not to be denied, I rejoined, that this
was a remarkable coincidence, calculated deeply to impress his
mind.  But it was unquestionable that remarkable
coincidences did continually occur, and they must be taken into
account in dealing with such a subject.  Though to be sure I
must admit, I added (for I thought I saw that he was going to
bring the objection to bear upon me), men of common sense did not
allow much for coincidences in making the ordinary calculations
of life.

“This,” he said, again laying his hand upon my
arm, and glancing over his shoulder with hollow eyes, “was
just a year ago.  Six or seven months passed, and I had
recovered from the surprise and shock, when one morning, as the
day was breaking, I, standing at the door, looked towards the red
light, and saw the spectre again.”  He stopped, with a
fixed look at me.

p. 318Once
more I followed his action with my eyes.  It was an action
of mourning.  I have seen such an attitude in stone figures
on tombs.

“I came in and sat down, partly to collect my thoughts,
partly because it had turned me faint.  When I went to the
door again, daylight was above me, and the ghost was
gone.”

“That very day, as a train came out of the tunnel, I
noticed, at a carriage window on my side, what looked like a
confusion of hands and heads, and something waved.  I saw it
just in time to signal the driver, Stop!  He shut off, and
put his brake on, but the train drifted past here a hundred and
fifty yards or more.  I ran after it, and, as I went along,
heard terrible screams and cries.  A beautiful young lady
had died instantaneously in one of the compartments, and was
brought in here, and laid down on this floor between
us.”

I could think of nothing to say, to any purpose, and my mouth
was very dry.  The wind and the wires took up the story with
a long lamenting wail.

He resumed.  “Now, sir, mark this, and judge how my
mind is troubled.  The spectre came back a week ago. 
Ever since, it has been there, now and again, by fits and
starts.”

He repeated, if possible with increased passion and vehemence,
that former gesticulation of, “For God’s sake, clear
the way!”

Then he went on.  “I have no peace or rest for
it.  It calls to me, for many minutes together, in an
agonised manner, ‘Below there!  Look out!  Look
out!’  It stands waving to me.  It rings my
little bell—”

I caught at that.  “Did it ring your bell yesterday
evening when I was here, and you went to the door?”

“Why, see,” said I, “how your imagination
misleads you.  My eyes were on the bell, and my ears were
open to the bell, and if I am a living man, it did NOT ring at those times.  No, nor at
any other time, except when it was rung in the natural course of
physical things by the station communicating with you.”

He shook his head. “I have never made a mistake as to
that yet, sir.  I have never confused the spectre’s
ring with the man’s.  The ghost’s ring is a
strange vibration in the bell that it derives from p. 319nothing
else, and I have not asserted that the bell stirs to the
eye.  I don’t wonder that you failed to hear it. 
But I heard it.”

He bit his under lip as though he were somewhat unwilling, but
arose.  I opened the door, and stood on the step, while he
stood in the doorway.  There was the Danger-light. 
There was the dismal mouth of the tunnel.  There were the
high, wet stone walls of the cutting.  There were the stars
above them.

“Do you see it?” I asked him, taking particular
note of his face.  His eyes were prominent and strained, but
not very much more so, perhaps, than my own had been when I had
directed them earnestly towards the same spot.

We went in again, shut the door, and resumed our seats. 
I was thinking how best to improve this advantage, if it might be
called one, when he took up the conversation in such a
matter-of-course way, so assuming that there could be no serious
question of fact between us, that I felt myself placed in the
weakest of positions.

“By this time you will fully understand, sir,” he
said, “that what troubles me so dreadfully is the question,
What does the spectre mean?”

“What is its warning against?” he said,
ruminating, with his eyes on the fire, and only by times turning
them on me.  “What is the danger?  Where is the
danger?  There is danger overhanging somewhere on the
Line.  Some dreadful calamity will happen.  It is not
to be doubted this third time, after what has gone before. 
But surely this is a cruel haunting of me.  What can I
do?”

“If I telegraph Danger, on either side of me, or on
both, I can give no reason for it,” he went on, wiping the
palms of his hands.  “I should get into trouble, and
do no good.  They would think I was mad.  This is the
way it would work,—Message: ‘Danger!  Take
care!’  Answer: ‘What Danger? 
Where?’  Message: ‘Don’t know.  But,
for God’s sake, take care!’  They would displace
me.  What else could they do?”

His pain of mind was most pitiable to see.  It was the
mental torture of a conscientious man, oppressed beyond endurance
by an unintelligible responsibility involving life.

“When it first stood under the Danger-light,” he
went on, putting his dark hair back from his head, and drawing
his hands outward p.
320across and across his temples in an extremity of
feverish distress, “why not tell me where that accident was
to happen,—if it must happen?  Why not tell me how it
could be averted,—if it could have been averted?  When
on its second coming it hid its face, why not tell me, instead,
‘She is going to die.  Let them keep her at
home’?  If it came, on those two occasions, only to
show me that its warnings were true, and so to prepare me for the
third, why not warn me plainly now?  And I, Lord help
me!  A mere poor signal-man on this solitary station! 
Why not go to somebody with credit to be believed, and power to
act?”

When I saw him in this state, I saw that for the poor
man’s sake, as well as for the public safety, what I had to
do for the time was to compose his mind.  Therefore, setting
aside all question of reality or unreality between us, I
represented to him that whoever thoroughly discharged his duty
must do well, and that at least it was his comfort that he
understood his duty, though he did not understand these
confounding Appearances.  In this effort I succeeded far
better than in the attempt to reason him out of his
conviction.  He became calm; the occupations incidental to
his post as the night advanced began to make larger demands on
his attention: and I left him at two in the morning.  I had
offered to stay through the night, but he would not hear of
it.

That I more than once looked back at the red light as I
ascended the pathway, that I did not like the red light, and that
I should have slept but poorly if my bed had been under it, I see
no reason to conceal.  Nor did I like the two sequences of
the accident and the dead girl.  I see no reason to conceal
that either.

But what ran most in my thoughts was the consideration how
ought I to act, having become the recipient of this
disclosure?  I had proved the man to be intelligent,
vigilant, painstaking, and exact; but how long might he remain
so, in his state of mind?  Though in a subordinate position,
still he held a most important trust, and would I (for instance)
like to stake my own life on the chances of his continuing to
execute it with precision?

Unable to overcome a feeling that there would be something
treacherous in my communicating what he had told me to his
superiors in the Company, without first being plain with himself
and proposing a middle course to him, I ultimately resolved to
offer to accompany him (otherwise keeping his secret for the
present) to the wisest medical practitioner we could hear of in
those parts, and to take his opinion.  A change in his time
of duty would come round next night, he had apprised me, and he
would be off an hour or two after sunrise, and on again soon
after sunset.  I had appointed to return accordingly.

Next evening was a lovely evening, and I walked out early to
enjoy it.  The sun was not yet quite down when I traversed
the field-path near the top of the deep cutting.  I would
extend my walk for an p. 321hour, I said to myself, half an hour
on and half an hour back, and it would then be time to go to my
signal-man’s box.

Before pursuing my stroll, I stepped to the brink, and
mechanically looked down, from the point from which I had first
seen him.  I cannot describe the thrill that seized upon me,
when, close at the mouth of the tunnel, I saw the appearance of a
man, with his left sleeve across his eyes, passionately waving
his right arm.

The nameless horror that oppressed me passed in a moment, for
in a moment I saw that this appearance of a man was a man indeed,
and that there was a little group of other men, standing at a
short distance, to whom he seemed to be rehearsing the gesture he
made.  The Danger-light was not yet lighted.  Against
its shaft, a little low hut, entirely new to me, had been made of
some wooden supports and tarpaulin.  It looked no bigger
than a bed.

With an irresistible sense that something was
wrong,—with a flashing self-reproachful fear that fatal
mischief had come of my leaving the man there, and causing no one
to be sent to overlook or correct what he did,—I descended
the notched path with all the speed I could make.

“You will recognise him, sir, if you knew him,”
said the man who spoke for the others, solemnly uncovering his
own head, and raising an end of the tarpaulin, “for his
face is quite composed.”

“O, how did this happen, how did this happen?” I
asked, turning from one to another as the hut closed in
again.

“He was cut down by an engine, sir.  No man in
England knew his work better.  But somehow he was not clear
of the outer rail.  It was just at broad day.  He had
struck the light, and had the lamp in his hand.  As the
engine came out of the tunnel, his back was towards her, and she
cut him down.  That man drove her, and was showing how it
happened.  Show the gentleman, Tom.”

“Coming round the curve in the tunnel, sir,” he
said, “I saw him at the end, like as if I saw him down a
perspective-glass.  There was no time to check speed, and I
knew him to be very careful.  As he didn’t seem to
take heed of the whistle, I shut it off when we were running down
upon him, and called to him as loud as I could call.”

“Ah! it was a dreadful time, sir.  I never left off
calling to him.  p. 322I put this arm before my eyes not to
see, and I waved this arm to the last; but it was no
use.”

Without prolonging the narrative to dwell on any one of its
curious circumstances more than on any other, I may, in closing
it, point out the coincidence that the warning of the
Engine-Driver included, not only the words which the unfortunate
Signal-man had repeated to me as haunting him, but also the words
which I myself—not he—had attached, and that only in
my own mind, to the gesticulation he had imitated.

-- Update content for 'The Lady with the Dog'
UPDATE stories SET original_text = 'IT was said that a new person had appeared on the sea-front: a lady with
a little dog. Dmitri Dmitritch Gurov, who had by then been a fortnight
at Yalta, and so was fairly at home there, had begun to take an interest
in new arrivals. Sitting in Verney''s pavilion, he saw, walking on the
sea-front, a fair-haired young lady of medium height, wearing a bÃ©ret;
a white Pomeranian dog was running behind her.

And afterwards he met her in the public gardens and in the square
several times a day. She was walking alone, always wearing the same
bÃ©ret, and always with the same white dog; no one knew who she was,
and every one called her simply "the lady with the dog."

"If she is here alone without a husband or friends, it wouldn''t be amiss
to make her acquaintance," Gurov reflected.

He was under forty, but he had a daughter already twelve years old, and
two sons at school. He had been married young, when he was a student in
his second year, and by now his wife seemed half as old again as he. She
was a tall, erect woman with dark eyebrows, staid and dignified, and, as
she said of herself, intellectual. She read a great deal, used phonetic
spelling, called her husband, not Dmitri, but Dimitri, and he secretly
considered her unintelligent, narrow, inelegant, was afraid of her, and
did not like to be at home. He had begun being unfaithful to her long
ago—had been unfaithful to her often, and, probably on that account,
almost always spoke ill of women, and when they were talked about in his
presence, used to call them "the lower race."

It seemed to him that he had been so schooled by bitter experience that
he might call them what he liked, and yet he could not get on for two
days together without "the lower race." In the society of men he was
bored and not himself, with them he was cold and uncommunicative; but
when he was in the company of women he felt free, and knew what to say
to them and how to behave; and he was at ease with them even when he was
silent. In his appearance, in his character, in his whole nature, there
was something attractive and elusive which allured women and disposed
them in his favour; he knew that, and some force seemed to draw him,
too, to them.

Experience often repeated, truly bitter experience, had taught him long
ago that with decent people, especially Moscow people—always slow to
move and irresolute—every intimacy, which at first so agreeably
diversifies life and appears a light and charming adventure, inevitably
grows into a regular problem of extreme intricacy, and in the long run
the situation becomes unbearable. But at every fresh meeting with an
interesting woman this experience seemed to slip out of his memory, and
he was eager for life, and everything seemed simple and amusing.

One evening he was dining in the gardens, and the lady in the bÃ©ret
came up slowly to take the next table. Her expression, her gait, her
dress, and the way she did her hair told him that she was a lady, that
she was married, that she was in Yalta for the first time and alone, and
that she was dull there.... The stories told of the immorality in such
places as Yalta are to a great extent untrue; he despised them, and knew
that such stories were for the most part made up by persons who would
themselves have been glad to sin if they had been able; but when the
lady sat down at the next table three paces from him, he remembered
these tales of easy conquests, of trips to the mountains, and the
tempting thought of a swift, fleeting love affair, a romance with an
unknown woman, whose name he did not know, suddenly took possession of
him.

He beckoned coaxingly to the Pomeranian, and when the dog came up to him
he shook his finger at it. The Pomeranian growled: Gurov shook his
finger at it again.

"May I give him a bone?" he asked; and when she nodded he asked
courteously, "Have you been long in Yalta?"

"That''s only the fashion to say it is dull here. A provincial will live
in Belyov or Zhidra and not be dull, and when he comes here it''s ''Oh,
the dulness! Oh, the dust!'' One would think he came from Grenada."

She laughed. Then both continued eating in silence, like strangers, but
after dinner they walked side by side; and there sprang up between them
the light jesting conversation of people who are free and satisfied, to
whom it does not matter where they go or what they talk about. They
walked and talked of the strange light on the sea: the water was of a
soft warm lilac hue, and there was a golden streak from the moon upon
it. They talked of how sultry it was after a hot day. Gurov told her
that he came from Moscow, that he had taken his degree in Arts, but had
a post in a bank; that he had trained as an opera-singer, but had given
it up, that he owned two houses in Moscow.... And from her he learnt
that she had grown up in Petersburg, but had lived in S—— since her
marriage two years before, that she was staying another month in Yalta,
and that her husband, who needed a holiday too, might perhaps come and
fetch her. She was not sure whether her husband had a post in a Crown
Department or under the Provincial Council—and was amused by her own
ignorance. And Gurov learnt, too, that she was called Anna Sergeyevna.

Afterwards he thought about her in his room at the hotel—thought she
would certainly meet him next day; it would be sure to happen. As he got
into bed he thought how lately she had been a girl at school, doing
lessons like his own daughter; he recalled the diffidence, the
angularity, that was still manifest in her laugh and her manner of
talking with a stranger. This must have been the first time in her life
she had been alone in surroundings in which she was followed, looked at,
and spoken to merely from a secret motive which she could hardly fail to
guess. He recalled her slender, delicate neck, her lovely grey eyes.

A week had passed since they had made acquaintance. It was a holiday. It
was sultry indoors, while in the street the wind whirled the dust round
and round, and blew people''s hats off. It was a thirsty day, and Gurov
often went into the pavilion, and pressed Anna Sergeyevna to have syrup
and water or an ice. One did not know what to do with oneself.

In the evening when the wind had dropped a little, they went out on the
groyne to see the steamer come in. There were a great many people
walking about the harbour; they had gathered to welcome some one,
bringing bouquets. And two peculiarities of a well-dressed Yalta crowd
were very conspicuous: the elderly ladies were dressed like young ones,
and there were great numbers of generals.

Owing to the roughness of the sea, the steamer arrived late, after the
sun had set, and it was a long time turning about before it reached the
groyne. Anna Sergeyevna looked through her lorgnette at the steamer and
the passengers as though looking for acquaintances, and when she turned
to Gurov her eyes were shining. She talked a great deal and asked
disconnected questions, forgetting next moment what she had asked; then
she dropped her lorgnette in the crush.

The festive crowd began to disperse; it was too dark to see people''s
faces. The wind had completely dropped, but Gurov and Anna Sergeyevna
still stood as though waiting to see some one else come from the
steamer. Anna Sergeyevna was silent now, and sniffed the flowers without
looking at Gurov.

Then he looked at her intently, and all at once put his arm round her
and kissed her on the lips, and breathed in the moisture and the
fragrance of the flowers; and he immediately looked round him, anxiously
wondering whether any one had seen them.

The room was close and smelt of the scent she had bought at the Japanese
shop. Gurov looked at her and thought: "What different people one meets
in the world!" From the past he preserved memories of careless,
good-natured women, who loved cheerfully and were grateful to him for
the happiness he gave them, however brief it might be; and of women like
his wife who loved without any genuine feeling, with superfluous
phrases, affectedly, hysterically, with an expression that suggested
that it was not love nor passion, but something more significant; and of
two or three others, very beautiful, cold women, on whose faces he had
caught a glimpse of a rapacious expression—an obstinate desire to
snatch from life more than it could give, and these were capricious,
unreflecting, domineering, unintelligent women not in their first youth,
and when Gurov grew cold to them their beauty excited his hatred, and
the lace on their linen seemed to him like scales.

But in this case there was still the diffidence, the angularity of
inexperienced youth, an awkward feeling; and there was a sense of
consternation as though some one had suddenly knocked at the door. The
attitude of Anna Sergeyevna—"the lady with the dog"—to what had
happened was somehow peculiar, very grave, as though it were her
fall—so it seemed, and it was strange and inappropriate. Her face
dropped and faded, and on both sides of it her long hair hung down
mournfully; she mused in a dejected attitude like "the woman who was a
sinner" in an old-fashioned picture.

There was a water-melon on the table. Gurov cut himself a slice and
began eating it without haste. There followed at least half an hour of
silence.

Anna Sergeyevna was touching; there was about her the purity of a good,
simple woman who had seen little of life. The solitary candle burning on
the table threw a faint light on her face, yet it was clear that she was
very unhappy.

"Forgiven? No. I am a bad, low woman; I despise myself and don''t attempt
to justify myself. It''s not my husband but myself I have deceived. And
not only just now; I have been deceiving myself for a long time. My
husband may be a good, honest man, but he is a flunkey! I don''t know
what he does there, what his work is, but I know he is a flunkey! I was
twenty when I was married to him. I have been tormented by curiosity; I
wanted something better. ''There must be a different sort of life,'' I
said to myself. I wanted to live! To live, to live!... I was fired by
curiosity ... you don''t understand it, but, I swear to God, I could not
control myself; something happened to me: I could not be restrained. I
told my husband I was ill, and came here.... And here I have been
walking about as though I were dazed, like a mad creature; ... and now I
have become a vulgar, contemptible woman whom any one may despise."

Gurov felt bored already, listening to her. He was irritated by the
naÃ¯ve tone, by this remorse, so unexpected and inopportune; but for the
tears in her eyes, he might have thought she was jesting or playing a
part.

"Believe me, believe me, I beseech you ..." she said. "I love a pure,
honest life, and sin is loathsome to me. I don''t know what I am doing.
Simple people say: ''The Evil One has beguiled me.'' And I may say of
myself now that the Evil One has beguiled me."

He looked at her fixed, scared eyes, kissed her, talked softly and
affectionately, and by degrees she was comforted, and her gaiety
returned; they both began laughing.

Afterwards when they went out there was not a soul on the sea-front. The
town with its cypresses had quite a deathlike air, but the sea still
broke noisily on the shore; a single barge was rocking on the waves, and
a lantern was blinking sleepily on it.

"I found out your surname in the hall just now: it was written on the
board—Von Diderits," said Gurov. "Is your husband a German?"

At Oreanda they sat on a seat not far from the church, looked down at
the sea, and were silent. Yalta was hardly visible through the morning
mist; white clouds stood motionless on the mountain-tops. The leaves did
not stir on the trees, grasshoppers chirruped, and the monotonous hollow
sound of the sea rising up from below, spoke of the peace, of the
eternal sleep awaiting us. So it must have sounded when there was no
Yalta, no Oreanda here; so it sounds now, and it will sound as
indifferently and monotonously when we are all no more. And in this
constancy, in this complete indifference to the life and death of each
of us, there lies hid, perhaps, a pledge of our eternal salvation, of
the unceasing movement of life upon earth, of unceasing progress towards
perfection. Sitting beside a young woman who in the dawn seemed so
lovely, soothed and spellbound in these magical surroundings—the sea,
mountains, clouds, the open sky—Gurov thought how in reality everything
is beautiful in this world when one reflects: everything except what we
think or do ourselves when we forget our human dignity and the higher
aims of our existence.

A man walked up to them—probably a keeper—looked at them and walked
away. And this detail seemed mysterious and beautiful, too. They saw a
steamer come from Theodosia, with its lights out in the glow of dawn.

Then they met every day at twelve o''clock on the sea-front, lunched and
dined together, went for walks, admired the sea. She complained that she
slept badly, that her heart throbbed violently; asked the same
questions, troubled now by jealousy and now by the fear that he did not
respect her sufficiently. And often in the square or gardens, when there
was no one near them, he suddenly drew her to him and kissed her
passionately. Complete idleness, these kisses in broad daylight while he
looked round in dread of some one''s seeing them, the heat, the smell of
the sea, and the continual passing to and fro before him of idle,
well-dressed, well-fed people, made a new man of him; he told Anna
Sergeyevna how beautiful she was, how fascinating. He was impatiently
passionate, he would not move a step away from her, while she was often
pensive and continually urged him to confess that he did not respect
her, did not love her in the least, and thought of her as nothing but a
common woman. Rather late almost every evening they drove somewhere out
of town, to Oreanda or to the waterfall; and the expedition was always a
success, the scenery invariably impressed them as grand and beautiful.

They were expecting her husband to come, but a letter came from him,
saying that there was something wrong with his eyes, and he entreated
his wife to come home as quickly as possible. Anna Sergeyevna made haste
to go.

She went by coach and he went with her. They were driving the whole day.
When she had got into a compartment of the express, and when the second
bell had rung, she said:

"I shall remember you ... think of you," she said. "God be with you; be
happy. Don''t remember evil against me. We are parting forever—it must
be so, for we ought never to have met. Well, God be with you."

The train moved off rapidly, its lights soon vanished from sight, and a
minute later there was no sound of it, as though everything had
conspired together to end as quickly as possible that sweet delirium,
that madness. Left alone on the platform, and gazing into the dark
distance, Gurov listened to the chirrup of the grasshoppers and the hum
of the telegraph wires, feeling as though he had only just waked up. And
he thought, musing, that there had been another episode or adventure in
his life, and it, too, was at an end, and nothing was left of it but a
memory.... He was moved, sad, and conscious of a slight remorse. This
young woman whom he would never meet again had not been happy with him;
he was genuinely warm and affectionate with her, but yet in his manner,
his tone, and his caresses there had been a shade of light irony, the
coarse condescension of a happy man who was, besides, almost twice her
age. All the time she had called him kind, exceptional, lofty; obviously
he had seemed to her different from what he really was, so he had
unintentionally deceived her....

At home in Moscow everything was in its winter routine; the stoves were
heated, and in the morning it was still dark when the children were
having breakfast and getting ready for school, and the nurse would light
the lamp for a short time. The frosts had begun already. When the first
snow has fallen, on the first day of sledge-driving it is pleasant to
see the white earth, the white roofs, to draw soft, delicious breath,
and the season brings back the days of one''s youth. The old limes and
birches, white with hoar-frost, have a good-natured expression; they are
nearer to one''s heart than cypresses and palms, and near them one
doesn''t want to be thinking of the sea and the mountains.

Gurov was Moscow born; he arrived in Moscow on a fine frosty day, and
when he put on his fur coat and warm gloves, and walked along Petrovka,
and when on Saturday evening he heard the ringing of the bells, his
recent trip and the places he had seen lost all charm for him. Little by
little he became absorbed in Moscow life, greedily read three newspapers
a day, and declared he did not read the Moscow papers on principle! He
already felt a longing to go to restaurants, clubs, dinner-parties,
anniversary celebrations, and he felt flattered at entertaining
distinguished lawyers and artists, and at playing cards with a professor
at the doctors'' club. He could already eat a whole plateful of salt fish
and cabbage.

In another month, he fancied, the image of Anna Sergeyevna would be
shrouded in a mist in his memory, and only from time to time would visit
him in his dreams with a touching smile as others did. But more than a
month passed, real winter had come, and everything was still clear in
his memory as though he had parted with Anna Sergeyevna only the day
before. And his memories glowed more and more vividly. When in the
evening stillness he heard from his study the voices of his children,
preparing their lessons, or when he listened to a song or the organ at
the restaurant, or the storm howled in the chimney, suddenly everything
would rise up in his memory: what had happened on the groyne, and the
early morning with the mist on the mountains, and the steamer coming
from Theodosia, and the kisses. He would pace a long time about his
room, remembering it all and smiling; then his memories passed into
dreams, and in his fancy the past was mingled with what was to come.
Anna Sergeyevna did not visit him in dreams, but followed him about
everywhere like a shadow and haunted him. When he shut his eyes he saw
her as though she were living before him, and she seemed to him
lovelier, younger, tenderer than she was; and he imagined himself finer
than he had been in Yalta. In the evenings she peeped out at him from
the bookcase, from the fireplace, from the corner—he heard her
breathing, the caressing rustle of her dress. In the street he watched
the women, looking for some one like her.

He was tormented by an intense desire to confide his memories to some
one. But in his home it was impossible to talk of his love, and he had
no one outside; he could not talk to his tenants nor to any one at the
bank. And what had he to talk of? Had he been in love, then? Had there
been anything beautiful, poetical, or edifying or simply interesting in
his relations with Anna Sergeyevna? And there was nothing for him but to
talk vaguely of love, of woman, and no one guessed what it meant; only
his wife twitched her black eyebrows, and said:

One evening, coming out of the doctors'' club with an official with whom
he had been playing cards, he could not resist saying:

These words, so ordinary, for some reason moved Gurov to indignation,
and struck him as degrading and unclean. What savage manners, what
people! What senseless nights, what uninteresting, uneventful days! The
rage for card-playing, the gluttony, the drunkenness, the continual talk
always about the same thing. Useless pursuits and conversations always
about the same things absorb the better part of one''s time, the better
part of one''s strength, and in the end there is left a life grovelling
and curtailed, worthless and trivial, and there is no escaping or
getting away from it—just as though one were in a madhouse or a prison.

Gurov did not sleep all night, and was filled with indignation. And he
had a headache all next day. And the next night he slept badly; he sat
up in bed, thinking, or paced up and down his room. He was sick of his
children, sick of the bank; he had no desire to go anywhere or to talk
of anything.

In the holidays in December he prepared for a journey, and told his wife
he was going to Petersburg to do something in the interests of a young
friend—and he set off for S——. What for? He did not very well know
himself. He wanted to see Anna Sergeyevna and to talk with her—to
arrange a meeting, if possible.

He reached S—— in the morning, and took the best room at the hotel, in
which the floor was covered with grey army cloth, and on the table was
an inkstand, grey with dust and adorned with a figure on horseback, with
its hat in its hand and its head broken off. The hotel porter gave him
the necessary information; Von Diderits lived in a house of his own in
Old Gontcharny Street—it was not far from the hotel: he was rich and
lived in good style, and had his own horses; every one in the town knew
him. The porter pronounced the name "Dridirits."

Gurov went without haste to Old Gontcharny Street and found the house.
Just opposite the house stretched a long grey fence adorned with nails.

"One would run away from a fence like that," thought Gurov, looking from
the fence to the windows of the house and back again.

He considered: to-day was a holiday, and the husband would probably be
at home. And in any case it would be tactless to go into the house and
upset her. If he were to send her a note it might fall into her
husband''s hands, and then it might ruin everything. The best thing was
to trust to chance. And he kept walking up and down the street by the
fence, waiting for the chance. He saw a beggar go in at the gate and
dogs fly at him; then an hour later he heard a piano, and the sounds
were faint and indistinct. Probably it was Anna Sergeyevna playing. The
front door suddenly opened, and an old woman came out, followed by the
familiar white Pomeranian. Gurov was on the point of calling to the dog,
but his heart began beating violently, and in his excitement he could
not remember the dog''s name.

He walked up and down, and loathed the grey fence more and more, and by
now he thought irritably that Anna Sergeyevna had forgotten him, and was
perhaps already amusing herself with some one else, and that that was
very natural in a young woman who had nothing to look at from morning
till night but that confounded fence. He went back to his hotel room and
sat for a long while on the sofa, not knowing what to do, then he had
dinner and a long nap.

"How stupid and worrying it is!" he thought when he woke and looked at
the dark windows: it was already evening. "Here I''ve had a good sleep
for some reason. What shall I do in the night?"

He sat on the bed, which was covered by a cheap grey blanket, such as
one sees in hospitals, and he taunted himself in his vexation:

That morning at the station a poster in large letters had caught his
eye. "The Geisha" was to be performed for the first time. He thought of
this and went to the theatre.

The theatre was full. As in all provincial theatres, there was a fog
above the chandelier, the gallery was noisy and restless; in the front
row the local dandies were standing up before the beginning of the
performance, with their hands behind them; in the Governor''s box the
Governor''s daughter, wearing a boa, was sitting in the front seat, while
the Governor himself lurked modestly behind the curtain with only his
hands visible; the orchestra was a long time tuning up; the stage
curtain swayed. All the time the audience were coming in and taking
their seats Gurov looked at them eagerly.

Anna Sergeyevna, too, came in. She sat down in the third row, and when
Gurov looked at her his heart contracted, and he understood clearly that
for him there was in the whole world no creature so near, so precious,
and so important to him; she, this little woman, in no way remarkable,
lost in a provincial crowd, with a vulgar lorgnette in her hand, filled
his whole life now, was his sorrow and his joy, the one happiness that
he now desired for himself, and to the sounds of the inferior orchestra,
of the wretched provincial violins, he thought how lovely she was. He
thought and dreamed.

A young man with small side-whiskers, tall and stooping, came in with
Anna Sergeyevna and sat down beside her; he bent his head at every step
and seemed to be continually bowing. Most likely this was the husband
whom at Yalta, in a rush of bitter feeling, she had called a flunkey.
And there really was in his long figure, his side-whiskers, and the
small bald patch on his head, something of the flunkey''s obsequiousness;
his smile was sugary, and in his buttonhole there was some badge of
distinction like the number on a waiter.

During the first interval the husband went away to smoke; she remained
alone in her stall. Gurov, who was sitting in the stalls, too, went up
to her and said in a trembling voice, with a forced smile:

She glanced at him and turned pale, then glanced again with horror,
unable to believe her eyes, and tightly gripped the fan and the
lorgnette in her hands, evidently struggling with herself not to faint.
Both were silent. She was sitting, he was standing, frightened by her
confusion and not venturing to sit down beside her. The violins and the
flute began tuning up. He felt suddenly frightened; it seemed as though
all the people in the boxes were looking at them. She got up and went
quickly to the door; he followed her, and both walked senselessly along
passages, and up and down stairs, and figures in legal, scholastic, and
civil service uniforms, all wearing badges, flitted before their eyes.
They caught glimpses of ladies, of fur coats hanging on pegs; the
draughts blew on them, bringing a smell of stale tobacco. And Gurov,
whose heart was beating violently, thought:

And at that instant he recalled how when he had seen Anna Sergeyevna off
at the station he had thought that everything was over and they would
never meet again. But how far they were still from the end!

"How you have frightened me!" she said, breathing hard, still pale and
overwhelmed. "Oh, how you have frightened me! I am half dead. Why have
you come? Why?"

"But do understand, Anna, do understand ..." he said hastily in a low
voice. "I entreat you to understand...."

She looked at him with dread, with entreaty, with love; she looked at
him intently, to keep his features more distinctly in her memory.

"I am so unhappy," she went on, not heeding him. "I have thought of
nothing but you all the time; I live only in the thought of you. And I
wanted to forget, to forget you; but why, oh, why, have you come?"

On the landing above them two schoolboys were smoking and looking down,
but that was nothing to Gurov; he drew Anna Sergeyevna to him, and began
kissing her face, her cheeks, and her hands.

"What are you doing, what are you doing!" she cried in horror, pushing
him away. "We are mad. Go away to-day; go away at once.... I beseech you
by all that is sacred, I implore you.... There are people coming this
way!"

"You must go away," Anna Sergeyevna went on in a whisper. "Do you hear,
Dmitri Dmitritch? I will come and see you in Moscow. I have never been
happy; I am miserable now, and I never, never shall be happy, never!
Don''t make me suffer still more! I swear I''ll come to Moscow. But now
let us part. My precious, good, dear one, we must part!"

She pressed his hand and began rapidly going downstairs, looking round
at him, and from her eyes he could see that she really was unhappy.
Gurov stood for a little while, listened, then, when all sound had died
away, he found his coat and left the theatre.

And Anna Sergeyevna began coming to see him in Moscow. Once in two or
three months she left S——, telling her husband that she was going to
consult a doctor about an internal complaint—and her husband believed
her, and did not believe her. In Moscow she stayed at the Slaviansky
Bazaar hotel, and at once sent a man in a red cap to Gurov. Gurov went
to see her, and no one in Moscow knew of it.

Once he was going to see her in this way on a winter morning (the
messenger had come the evening before when he was out). With him walked
his daughter, whom he wanted to take to school: it was on the way. Snow
was falling in big wet flakes.

"It''s three degrees above freezing-point, and yet it is snowing," said
Gurov to his daughter. "The thaw is only on the surface of the earth;
there is quite a different temperature at a greater height in the
atmosphere."

He explained that, too. He talked, thinking all the while that he was
going to see her, and no living soul knew of it, and probably never
would know. He had two lives: one, open, seen and known by all who cared
to know, full of relative truth and of relative falsehood, exactly like
the lives of his friends and acquaintances; and another life running its
course in secret. And through some strange, perhaps accidental,
conjunction of circumstances, everything that was essential, of interest
and of value to him, everything in which he was sincere and did not
deceive himself, everything that made the kernel of his life, was hidden
from other people; and all that was false in him, the sheath in which he
hid himself to conceal the truth—such, for instance, as his work in the
bank, his discussions at the club, his "lower race," his presence with
his wife at anniversary festivities—all that was open. And he judged of
others by himself, not believing in what he saw, and always believing
that every man had his real, most interesting life under the cover of
secrecy and under the cover of night. All personal life rested on
secrecy, and possibly it was partly on that account that civilised man
was so nervously anxious that personal privacy should be respected.

After leaving his daughter at school, Gurov went on to the Slaviansky
Bazaar. He took off his fur coat below, went upstairs, and softly
knocked at the door. Anna Sergeyevna, wearing his favourite grey dress,
exhausted by the journey and the suspense, had been expecting him since
the evening before. She was pale; she looked at him, and did not smile,
and he had hardly come in when she fell on his breast. Their kiss was
slow and prolonged, as though they had not met for two years.

She could not speak; she was crying. She turned away from him, and
pressed her handkerchief to her eyes.

Then he rang and asked for tea to be brought him, and while he drank his
tea she remained standing at the window with her back to him. She was
crying from emotion, from the miserable consciousness that their life
was so hard for them; they could only meet in secret, hiding themselves
from people, like thieves! Was not their life shattered?

It was evident to him that this love of theirs would not soon be over,
that he could not see the end of it. Anna Sergeyevna grew more and more
attached to him. She adored him, and it was unthinkable to say to her
that it was bound to have an end some day; besides, she would not have
believed it!

He went up to her and took her by the shoulders to say something
affectionate and cheering, and at that moment he saw himself in the
looking-glass.

His hair was already beginning to turn grey. And it seemed strange to
him that he had grown so much older, so much plainer during the last few
years. The shoulders on which his hands rested were warm and quivering.
He felt compassion for this life, still so warm and lovely, but probably
already not far from beginning to fade and wither like his own. Why did
she love him so much? He always seemed to women different from what he
was, and they loved in him not himself, but the man created by their
imagination, whom they had been eagerly seeking all their lives; and
afterwards, when they noticed their mistake, they loved him all the
same. And not one of them had been happy with him. Time passed, he had
made their acquaintance, got on with them, parted, but he had never once
loved; it was anything you like, but not love.

And only now when his head was grey he had fallen properly, really in
love—for the first time in his life.

Anna Sergeyevna and he loved each other like people very close and akin,
like husband and wife, like tender friends; it seemed to them that fate
itself had meant them for one another, and they could not understand why
he had a wife and she a husband; and it was as though they were a pair
of birds of passage, caught and forced to live in different cages. They
forgave each other for what they were ashamed of in their past, they
forgave everything in the present, and felt that this love of theirs had
changed them both.

In moments of depression in the past he had comforted himself with any
arguments that came into his mind, but now he no longer cared for
arguments; he felt profound compassion, he wanted to be sincere and
tender....

"Don''t cry, my darling," he said. "You''ve had your cry; that''s
enough.... Let us talk now, let us think of some plan."

Then they spent a long while taking counsel together, talked of how to
avoid the necessity for secrecy, for deception, for living in different
towns and not seeing each other for long at a time. How could they be
free from this intolerable bondage?

And it seemed as though in a little while the solution would be found,
and then a new and splendid life would begin; and it was clear to both
of them that they had still a long, long road before them, and that the
most complicated and difficult part of it was only just beginning.

THE Professor received a telegram from the Lyalikovs'' factory; he was
asked to come as quickly as possible. The daughter of some Madame
Lyalikov, apparently the owner of the factory, was ill, and that was all
that one could make out of the long, incoherent telegram. And the
Professor did not go himself, but sent instead his assistant, Korolyov.

It was two stations from Moscow, and there was a drive of three miles
from the station. A carriage with three horses had been sent to the
station to meet Korolyov; the coachman wore a hat with a peacock''s
feather on it, and answered every question in a loud voice like a
soldier: "No, sir!" "Certainly, sir!"

It was Saturday evening; the sun was setting, the workpeople were coming
in crowds from the factory to the station, and they bowed to the
carriage in which Korolyov was driving. And he was charmed with the
evening, the farmhouses and villas on the road, and the birch-trees, and
the quiet atmosphere all around, when the fields and woods and the sun
seemed preparing, like the workpeople now on the eve of the holiday, to
rest, and perhaps to pray....

He was born and had grown up in Moscow; he did not know the country, and
he had never taken any interest in factories, or been inside one, but he
had happened to read about factories, and had been in the houses of
manufacturers and had talked to them; and whenever he saw a factory far
or near, he always thought how quiet and peaceable it was outside, but
within there was always sure to be impenetrable ignorance and dull
egoism on the side of the owners, wearisome, unhealthy toil on the side
of the workpeople, squabbling, vermin, vodka. And now when the
workpeople timidly and respectfully made way for the carriage, in their
faces, their caps, their walk, he read physical impurity, drunkenness,
nervous exhaustion, bewilderment.

They drove in at the factory gates. On each side he caught glimpses of
the little houses of workpeople, of the faces of women, of quilts and
linen on the railings. "Look out!" shouted the coachman, not pulling up
the horses. It was a wide courtyard without grass, with five immense
blocks of buildings with tall chimneys a little distance one from
another, warehouses and barracks, and over everything a sort of grey
powder as though from dust. Here and there, like oases in the desert,
there were pitiful gardens, and the green and red roofs of the houses in
which the managers and clerks lived. The coachman suddenly pulled up the
horses, and the carriage stopped at the house, which had been newly
painted grey; here was a flower garden, with a lilac bush covered with
dust, and on the yellow steps at the front door there was a strong smell
of paint.

"Please come in, doctor," said women''s voices in the passage and the
entry, and at the same time he heard sighs and whisperings. "Pray walk
in.... We''ve been expecting you so long ... we''re in real trouble. Here,
this way."

Madame Lyalikov—a stout elderly lady wearing a black silk dress with
fashionable sleeves, but, judging from her face, a simple uneducated
woman—looked at the doctor in a flutter, and could not bring herself to
hold out her hand to him; she did not dare. Beside her stood a personage
with short hair and a pince-nez; she was wearing a blouse of many
colours, and was very thin and no longer young. The servants called her
Christina Dmitryevna, and Korolyov guessed that this was the governess.
Probably, as the person of most education in the house, she had been
charged to meet and receive the doctor, for she began immediately, in
great haste, stating the causes of the illness, giving trivial and
tiresome details, but without saying who was ill or what was the matter.

The doctor and the governess were sitting talking while the lady of the
house stood motionless at the door, waiting. From the conversation
Korolyov learned that the patient was Madame Lyalikov''s only daughter
and heiress, a girl of twenty, called Liza; she had been ill for a long
time, and had consulted various doctors, and the previous night she had
suffered till morning from such violent palpitations of the heart, that
no one in the house had slept, and they had been afraid she might die.

"She has been, one may say, ailing from a child," said Christina
Dmitryevna in a sing-song voice, continually wiping her lips with her
hand. "The doctors say it is nerves; when she was a little girl she was
scrofulous, and the doctors drove it inwards, so I think it may be due
to that."

They went to see the invalid. Fully grown up, big and tall, but ugly
like her mother, with the same little eyes and disproportionate breadth
of the lower part of the face, lying with her hair in disorder, muffled
up to the chin, she made upon Korolyov at the first minute the
impression of a poor, destitute creature, sheltered and cared for here
out of charity, and he could hardly believe that this was the heiress of
the five huge buildings.

He mentioned his name and pressed her hand, a large, cold, ugly hand;
she sat up, and, evidently accustomed to doctors, let herself be
sounded, without showing the least concern that her shoulders and chest
were uncovered.

"I have palpitations of the heart," she said, "It was so awful all
night.... I almost died of fright! Do give me something."

"The heart is all right," he said; "it''s all going on satisfactorily;
everything is in good order. Your nerves must have been playing pranks a
little, but that''s so common. The attack is over by now, one must
suppose; lie down and go to sleep."

At that moment a lamp was brought into the bed-room. The patient screwed
up her eyes at the light, then suddenly put her hands to her head and
broke into sobs. And the impression of a destitute, ugly creature
vanished, and Korolyov no longer noticed the little eyes or the heavy
development of the lower part of the face. He saw a soft, suffering
expression which was intelligent and touching: she seemed to him
altogether graceful, feminine, and simple; and he longed to soothe her,
not with drugs, not with advice, but with simple, kindly words. Her
mother put her arms round her head and hugged her. What despair, what
grief was in the old woman''s face! She, her mother, had reared her and
brought her up, spared nothing, and devoted her whole life to having her
daughter taught French, dancing, music: had engaged a dozen teachers for
her; had consulted the best doctors, kept a governess. And now she could
not make out the reason of these tears, why there was all this misery,
she could not understand, and was bewildered; and she had a guilty,
agitated, despairing expression, as though she had omitted something
very important, had left something undone, had neglected to call in
somebody—and whom, she did not know.

"Lizanka, you are crying again ... again," she said, hugging her
daughter to her. "My own, my darling, my child, tell me what it is! Have
pity on me! Tell me."

"Come, give over; it''s no use crying," he said kindly. "Why, there is
nothing in the world that is worth those tears. Come, we won''t cry;
that''s no good...."

"Our doctor at the factory gave her kalibromati," said the governess,
"but I notice it only makes her worse. I should have thought that if she
is given anything for the heart it ought to be drops.... I forget the
name.... Convallaria, isn''t it?"

And there followed all sorts of details. She interrupted the doctor,
preventing his speaking, and there was a look of effort on her face, as
though she supposed that, as the woman of most education in the house,
she was duty bound to keep up a conversation with the doctor, and on no
other subject but medicine.

"I find nothing special the matter," he said, addressing the mother as
he went out of the bedroom. "If your daughter is being attended by the
factory doctor, let him go on attending her. The treatment so far has
been perfectly correct, and I see no reason for changing your doctor.
Why change? It''s such an ordinary trouble; there''s nothing seriously
wrong."

He spoke deliberately as he put on his gloves, while Madame Lyalikov
stood without moving, and looked at him with her tearful eyes.

"And can''t you stay?" she asked, and tears trickled down her cheeks
again. "I am ashamed to trouble you, but if you would be so good.... For
God''s sake," she went on in an undertone, glancing towards the door, "do
stay to-night with us! She is all I have ... my only daughter.... She
frightened me last night; I can''t get over it.... Don''t go away, for
goodness'' sake!..."

He wanted to tell her that he had a great deal of work in Moscow, that
his family were expecting him home; it was disagreeable to him to spend
the evening and the whole night in a strange house quite needlessly; but
he looked at her face, heaved a sigh, and began taking off his gloves
without a word.

All the lamps and candles were lighted in his honour in the drawing-room
and the dining-room. He sat down at the piano and began turning over the
music. Then he looked at the pictures on the walls, at the portraits.
The pictures, oil-paintings in gold frames, were views of the Crimea—a
stormy sea with a ship, a Catholic monk with a wineglass; they were all
dull, smooth daubs, with no trace of talent in them. There was not a
single good-looking face among the portraits, nothing but broad
cheekbones and astonished-looking eyes. Lyalikov, Liza''s father, had a
low forehead and a self-satisfied expression; his uniform sat like a
sack on his bulky plebeian figure; on his breast was a medal and a Red
Cross Badge. There was little sign of culture, and the luxury was
senseless and haphazard, and was as ill fitting as that uniform. The
floors irritated him with their brilliant polish, the lustres on the
chandelier irritated him, and he was reminded for some reason of the
story of the merchant who used to go to the baths with a medal on his
neck....

He heard a whispering in the entry; some one was softly snoring. And
suddenly from outside came harsh, abrupt, metallic sounds, such as
Korolyov had never heard before, and which he did not understand now;
they roused strange, unpleasant echoes in his soul.

"I believe nothing would induce me to remain here to live ..." he
thought, and went back to the music-books again.

He went into supper. The table was large and laid with a vast number of
dishes and wines, but there were only two to supper: himself and
Christina Dmitryevna. She drank Madeira, ate rapidly, and talked,
looking at him through her pince-nez:

"Our workpeople are very contented. We have performances at the factory
every winter; the workpeople act themselves. They have lectures with a
magic lantern, a splendid tea-room, and everything they want. They are
very much attached to us, and when they heard that Lizanka was worse
they had a service sung for her. Though they have no education, they
have their feelings, too."

"Not one. Pyotr Nikanoritch died a year and a half ago, and left us
alone. And so there are the three of us. In the summer we live here, and
in winter we live in Moscow, in Polianka. I have been living with them
for eleven years—as one of the family."

At supper they served sterlet, chicken rissoles, and stewed fruit; the
wines were expensive French wines.

"Please don''t stand on ceremony, doctor," said Christina Dmitryevna,
eating and wiping her mouth with her fist, and it was evident she found
her life here exceedingly pleasant. "Please have some more."

After supper the doctor was shown to his room, where a bed had been made
up for him, but he did not feel sleepy. The room was stuffy and it smelt
of paint; he put on his coat and went out.

It was cool in the open air; there was already a glimmer of dawn, and
all the five blocks of buildings, with their tall chimneys, barracks,
and warehouses, were distinctly outlined against the damp air. As it was
a holiday, they were not working, and the windows were dark, and in only
one of the buildings was there a furnace burning; two windows were
crimson, and fire mixed with smoke came from time to time from the
chimney. Far away beyond the yard the frogs were croaking and the
nightingales singing.

Looking at the factory buildings and the barracks, where the workpeople
were asleep, he thought again what he always thought when he saw a
factory. They may have performances for the workpeople, magic lanterns,
factory doctors, and improvements of all sorts, but, all the same, the
workpeople he had met that day on his way from the station did not look
in any way different from those he had known long ago in his childhood,
before there were factory performances and improvements. As a doctor
accustomed to judging correctly of chronic complaints, the radical cause
of which was incomprehensible and incurable, he looked upon factories as
something baffling, the cause of which also was obscure and not
removable, and all the improvements in the life of the factory hands he
looked upon not as superfluous, but as comparable with the treatment of
incurable illnesses.

"There is something baffling in it, of course ..." he thought, looking
at the crimson windows. "Fifteen hundred or two thousand workpeople are
working without rest in unhealthy surroundings, making bad cotton goods,
living on the verge of starvation, and only waking from this nightmare
at rare intervals in the tavern; a hundred people act as overseers, and
the whole life of that hundred is spent in imposing fines, in abuse, in
injustice, and only two or three so-called owners enjoy the profits,
though they don''t work at all, and despise the wretched cotton. But what
are the profits, and how do they enjoy them? Madame Lyalikov and her
daughter are unhappy—it makes one wretched to look at them; the only
one who enjoys her life is Christina Dmitryevna, a stupid, middle-aged
maiden lady in pince-nez. And so it appears that all these five blocks
of buildings are at work, and inferior cotton is sold in the Eastern
markets, simply that Christina Dmitryevna may eat sterlet and drink
Madeira."

Suddenly there came a strange noise, the same sound Korolyov had heard
before supper. Some one was striking on a sheet of metal near one of the
buildings; he struck a note, and then at once checked the vibrations, so
that short, abrupt, discordant sounds were produced, rather like "Dair
... dair ... dair...." Then there was half a minute of stillness, and
from another building there came sounds equally abrupt and unpleasant,
lower bass notes: "Drin ... drin ... drin ..." Eleven times. Evidently
it was the watchman striking the hour. Near the third building he heard:
"Zhuk ... zhuk ... zhuk...." And so near all the buildings, and then
behind the barracks and beyond the gates. And in the stillness of the
night it seemed as though these sounds were uttered by a monster with
crimson eyes—the devil himself, who controlled the owners and the
work-people alike, and was deceiving both.

Here the nightingales and the frogs could be heard more distinctly, and
one could feel it was a night in May. From the station came the noise of
a train; somewhere in the distance drowsy cocks were crowing; but, all
the same, the night was still, the world was sleeping tranquilly. In a
field not far from the factory there could be seen the framework of a
house and heaps of building material.

"The only person who feels happy here is the governess, and the factory
hands are working for her gratification. But that''s only apparent: she
is only the figurehead. The real person, for whom everything is being
done, is the devil."

And he thought about the devil, in whom he did not believe, and he
looked round at the two windows where the fires were gleaming. It seemed
to him that out of those crimson eyes the devil himself was looking at
him—that unknown force that had created the mutual relation of the
strong and the weak, that coarse blunder which one could never correct.
The strong must hinder the weak from living—such was the law of
Nature; but only in a newspaper article or in a school book was that
intelligible and easily accepted. In the hotchpotch which was everyday
life, in the tangle of trivialities out of which human relations were
woven, it was no longer a law, but a logical absurdity, when the strong
and the weak were both equally victims of their mutual relations,
unwillingly submitting to some directing force, unknown, standing
outside life, apart from man.

So thought Korolyov, sitting on the planks, and little by little he was
possessed by a feeling that this unknown and mysterious force was really
close by and looking at him. Meanwhile the east was growing paler, time
passed rapidly; when there was not a soul anywhere near, as though
everything were dead, the five buildings and their chimneys against the
grey background of the dawn had a peculiar look—not the same as by day;
one forgot altogether that inside there were steam motors, electricity,
telephones, and kept thinking of lake-dwellings, of the Stone Age,
feeling the presence of a crude, unconscious force....

And again there came the sound: "Dair ... dair ... dair ... dair ..."
twelve times. Then there was stillness, stillness for half a minute, and
at the other end of the yard there rang out.

"Zhuk ... zhuk ..." there resounded from a third place, abruptly,
sharply, as though with annoyance—"Zhuk ... zhuk...."

And it took four minutes to strike twelve. Then there was a hush; and
again it seemed as though everything were dead.

Korolyov sat a little longer, then went to the house, but sat up for a
good while longer. In the adjoining rooms there was whispering, there
was a sound of shuffling slippers and bare feet.

He went out to have a look at the patient. By now it was quite light in
the rooms, and a faint glimmer of sunlight, piercing through the morning
mist, quivered on the floor and on the wall of the drawing-room. The
door of Liza''s room was open, and she was sitting in a low chair beside
her bed, with her hair down, wearing a dressing-gown and wrapped in a
shawl. The blinds were down on the windows.

"You are not asleep," he said. "It''s beautiful weather outside. It''s
spring. The nightingales are singing, and you sit in the dark and think
of something."

She listened and looked into his face; her eyes were sorrowful and
intelligent, and it was evident she wanted to say something to him.

At that moment the watchman in the yard began striking two o''clock. They
heard: "Dair ... dair ..." and she shuddered.

"I don''t know. Everything here worries me," she answered, and pondered.
"Everything worries me. I hear sympathy in your voice; it seemed to me
as soon as I saw you that I could tell you all about it."

"I want to tell you of my opinion. It seems to me that I have no
illness, but that I am weary and frightened, because it is bound to be
so and cannot be otherwise. Even the healthiest person can''t help being
uneasy if, for instance, a robber is moving about under his window. I am
constantly being doctored," she went on, looking at her knees, and she
gave a shy smile. "I am very grateful, of course, and I do not deny that
the treatment is a benefit; but I should like to talk, not with a
doctor, but with some intimate friend who would understand me and would
convince me that I was right or wrong."

"I am lonely. I have a mother; I love her, but, all the same, I am
lonely. That''s how it happens to be.... Lonely people read a great deal,
but say little and hear little. Life for them is mysterious; they are
mystics and often see the devil where he is not. Lermontov''s Tamara was
lonely and she saw the devil."

"Yes. You see, my whole time is free from morning till night. I read by
day, and by night my head is empty; instead of thoughts there are
shadows in it."

She smiled again, raised her eyes to the doctor, and looked at him so
sorrowfully, so intelligently; and it seemed to him that she trusted
him, and that she wanted to speak frankly to him, and that she thought
the same as he did. But she was silent, perhaps waiting for him to
speak.

And he knew what to say to her. It was clear to him that she needed as
quickly as possible to give up the five buildings and the million if she
had it—to leave that devil that looked out at night; it was clear to
him, too, that she thought so herself, and was only waiting for some one
she trusted to confirm her.

But he did not know how to say it. How? One is shy of asking men under
sentence what they have been sentenced for; and in the same way it is
awkward to ask very rich people what they want so much money for, why
they make such a poor use of their wealth, why they don''t give it up,
even when they see in it their unhappiness; and if they begin a
conversation about it themselves, it is usually embarrassing, awkward,
and long.

"You in the position of a factory owner and a wealthy heiress are
dissatisfied; you don''t believe in your right to it; and here now you
can''t sleep. That, of course, is better than if you were satisfied,
slept soundly, and thought everything was satisfactory. Your
sleeplessness does you credit; in any case, it is a good sign. In
reality, such a conversation as this between us now would have been
unthinkable for our parents. At night they did not talk, but slept
sound; we, our generation, sleep badly, are restless, but talk a great
deal, and are always trying to settle whether we are right or not. For
our children or grandchildren that question—whether they are right or
not—will have been settled. Things will be clearer for them than for
us. Life will be good in fifty years'' time; it''s only a pity we shall
not last out till then. It would be interesting to have a peep at it."

"Where?... Why, where they like," said Korolyov; and he laughed. "There
are lots of places a good, intelligent person can go to."

"The sun has risen, though," he said. "It is time you were asleep.
Undress and sleep soundly. Very glad to have made your acquaintance," he
went on, pressing her hand. "You are a good, interesting woman.
Good-night!"

In the morning when the carriage was brought round they all came out on
to the steps to see him off. Liza, pale and exhausted, was in a white
dress as though for a holiday, with a flower in her hair; she looked at
him, as yesterday, sorrowfully and intelligently, smiled and talked, and
all with an expression as though she wanted to tell him something
special, important—him alone. They could hear the larks trilling and
the church bells pealing. The windows in the factory buildings were
sparkling gaily, and, driving across the yard and afterwards along the
road to the station, Korolyov thought neither of the workpeople nor of
lake dwellings, nor of the devil, but thought of the time, perhaps close
at hand, when life would be as bright and joyous as that still Sunday
morning; and he thought how pleasant it was on such a morning in the
spring to drive with three horses in a good carriage, and to bask in the
sunshine.

MASHENKA PAVLETSKY, a young girl who had only just finished her studies
at a boarding school, returning from a walk to the house of the
Kushkins, with whom she was living as a governess, found the household
in a terrible turmoil. Mihailo, the porter who opened the door to her,
was excited and red as a crab.

"Madame Kushkin is in a fit, most likely, or else she has quarrelled
with her husband," thought Mashenka.

In the hall and in the corridor she met maid-servants. One of them was
crying. Then Mashenka saw, running out of her room, the master of the
house himself, Nikolay Sergeitch, a little man with a flabby face and a
bald head, though he was not old. He was red in the face and twitching
all over. He passed the governess without noticing her, and throwing up
his arms, exclaimed:

Mashenka went into her room, and then, for the first time in her life,
it was her lot to experience in all its acuteness the feeling that is so
familiar to persons in dependent positions, who eat the bread of the
rich and powerful, and cannot speak their minds. There was a search
going on in her room. The lady of the house, Fedosya Vassilyevna, a
stout, broad-shouldered, uncouth woman with thick black eyebrows, a
faintly perceptible moustache, and red hands, who was exactly like a
plain, illiterate cook in face and manners, was standing, without her
cap on, at the table, putting back into Mashenka''s workbag balls of
wool, scraps of materials, and bits of paper.... Evidently the
governess''s arrival took her by surprise, since, on looking round and
seeing the girl''s pale and astonished face, she was a little taken
aback, and muttered:

And saying something more, Madame Kushkin rustled her long skirts and
went out. Mashenka looked round her room with wondering eyes, and,
unable to understand it, not knowing what to think, shrugged her
shoulders, and turned cold with dismay. What had Fedosya Vassilyevna
been looking for in her work-bag? If she really had, as she said, caught
her sleeve in it and upset everything, why had Nikolay Sergeitch dashed
out of her room so excited and red in the face? Why was one drawer of
the table pulled out a little way? The money-box, in which the governess
put away ten kopeck pieces and old stamps, was open. They had opened it,
but did not know how to shut it, though they had scratched the lock all
over. The whatnot with her books on it, the things on the table, the
bed—all bore fresh traces of a search. Her linen-basket, too. The linen
had been carefully folded, but it was not in the same order as Mashenka
had left it when she went out. So the search had been thorough, most
thorough. But what was it for? Why? What had happened? Mashenka
remembered the excited porter, the general turmoil which was still going
on, the weeping servant-girl; had it not all some connection with the
search that had just been made in her room? Was not she mixed up in
something dreadful? Mashenka turned pale, and feeling cold all over,
sank on to her linen-basket.

"They''ve been searching every one, miss. They''ve searched all my things,
too. They stripped us all naked and searched us.... God knows, miss, I
never went near her toilet-table, let alone touching the brooch. I shall
say the same at the police-station."

"A brooch has been stolen, I tell you. The mistress has been rummaging
in everything with her own hands. She even searched Mihailo, the porter,
herself. It''s a perfect disgrace! Nikolay Sergeitch simply looks on and
cackles like a hen. But you''ve no need to tremble like that, miss. They
found nothing here. You''ve nothing to be afraid of if you didn''t take
the brooch."

"But, Liza, it''s vile ... it''s insulting," said Mashenka, breathless
with indignation. "It''s so mean, so low! What right had she to suspect
me and to rummage in my things?"

"You are living with strangers, miss," sighed Liza. "Though you are a
young lady, still you are ... as it were ... a servant.... It''s not like
living with your papa and mamma."

Mashenka threw herself on the bed and sobbed bitterly. Never in her life
had she been subjected to such an outrage, never had she been so deeply
insulted.... She, well-educated, refined, the daughter of a teacher, was
suspected of theft; she had been searched like a street-walker! She
could not imagine a greater insult. And to this feeling of resentment
was added an oppressive dread of what would come next. All sorts of
absurd ideas came into her mind. If they could suspect her of theft,
then they might arrest her, strip her naked, and search her, then lead
her through the street with an escort of soldiers, cast her into a cold,
dark cell with mice and woodlice, exactly like the dungeon in which
Princess Tarakanov was imprisoned. Who would stand up for her? Her
parents lived far away in the provinces; they had not the money to come
to her. In the capital she was as solitary as in a desert, without
friends or kindred. They could do what they liked with her.

"I will go to all the courts and all the lawyers," Mashenka thought,
trembling. "I will explain to them, I will take an oath.... They will
believe that I could not be a thief!"

Mashenka remembered that under the sheets in her basket she had some
sweetmeats, which, following the habits of her schooldays, she had put
in her pocket at dinner and carried off to her room. She felt hot all
over, and was ashamed at the thought that her little secret was known to
the lady of the house; and all this terror, shame, resentment, brought
on an attack of palpitation of the heart, which set up a throbbing in
her temples, in her heart, and deep down in her stomach.

Mashenka brushed her hair, wiped her face with a wet towel, and went
into the dining-room. There they had already begun dinner. At one end of
the table sat Fedosya Vassilyevna with a stupid, solemn, serious face;
at the other end Nikolay Sergeitch. At the sides there were the visitors
and the children. The dishes were handed by two footmen in swallowtails
and white gloves. Every one knew that there was an upset in the house,
that Madame Kushkin was in trouble, and every one was silent. Nothing
was heard but the sound of munching and the rattle of spoons on the
plates.

"I ordered that, Fenya," Nikolay Sergeitch hastened to observe. "I
wanted some fish. If you don''t like it, ma chÃ¨re, don''t let them serve
it. I just ordered it...."

Fedosya Vassilyevna did not like dishes that she had not ordered
herself, and now her eyes filled with tears.

"Come, don''t let us agitate ourselves," Mamikov, her household doctor,
observed in a honeyed voice, just touching her arm, with a smile as
honeyed. "We are nervous enough as it is. Let us forget the brooch!
Health is worth more than two thousand roubles!"

"It''s not the two thousand I regret," answered the lady, and a big tear
rolled down her cheek. "It''s the fact itself that revolts me! I cannot
put up with thieves in my house. I don''t regret it—I regret nothing;
but to steal from me is such ingratitude! That''s how they repay me for
my kindness...."

They all looked into their plates, but Mashenka fancied after the lady''s
words that every one was looking at her. A lump rose in her throat; she
began crying and put her handkerchief to her lips.

And she got up from the table, scraping her chair awkwardly, and went
out quickly, still more overcome with confusion.

"It''s beyond everything!" said Nikolay Sergeitch, frowning. "What need
was there to search her room? How out of place it was!"

"I don''t say she took the brooch," said Fedosya Vassilyevna, "but can
you answer for her? To tell the truth, I haven''t much confidence in
these learned paupers."

"It really was unsuitable, Fenya.... Excuse me, Fenya, but you''ve no
kind of legal right to make a search."

"I know nothing about your laws. All I know is that I''ve lost my brooch.
And I will find the brooch!" She brought her fork down on the plate with
a clatter, and her eyes flashed angrily. "And you eat your dinner, and
don''t interfere in what doesn''t concern you!"

Nikolay Sergeitch dropped his eyes mildly and sighed. Meanwhile
Mashenka, reaching her room, flung herself on her bed. She felt now
neither alarm nor shame, but she felt an intense longing to go and slap
the cheeks of this hard, arrogant, dull-witted, prosperous woman.

Lying on her bed she breathed into her pillow and dreamed of how nice it
would be to go and buy the most expensive brooch and fling it into the
face of this bullying woman. If only it were God''s will that Fedosya
Vassilyevna should come to ruin and wander about begging, and should
taste all the horrors of poverty and dependence, and that Mashenka, whom
she had insulted, might give her alms! Oh, if only she could come in for
a big fortune, could buy a carriage, and could drive noisily past the
windows so as to be envied by that woman!

But all these were only dreams, in reality there was only one thing left
to do—to get away as quickly as possible, not to stay another hour in
this place. It was true it was terrible to lose her place, to go back to
her parents, who had nothing; but what could she do? Mashenka could not
bear the sight of the lady of the house nor of her little room; she felt
stifled and wretched here. She was so disgusted with Fedosya
Vassilyevna, who was so obsessed by her illnesses and her supposed
aristocratic rank, that everything in the world seemed to have become
coarse and unattractive because this woman was living in it. Mashenka
jumped up from the bed and began packing.

"May I come in?" asked Nikolay Sergeitch at the door; he had come up
noiselessly to the door, and spoke in a soft, subdued voice. "May I?"

He came in and stood still near the door. His eyes looked dim and his
red little nose was shiny. After dinner he used to drink beer, and the
fact was perceptible in his walk, in his feeble, flabby hands.

"I am packing. Forgive me, Nikolay Sergeitch, but I cannot remain in
your house. I feel deeply insulted by this search!"

"I understand.... Only you are wrong to go. Why should you? They''ve
searched your things, but you ... what does it matter to you? You will
be none the worse for it."

Mashenka was silent and went on packing. Nikolay Sergeitch pinched his
moustache, as though wondering what he should say next, and went on in
an ingratiating voice:

"I understand, of course, but you must make allowances. You know my wife
is nervous, headstrong; you mustn''t judge her too harshly."

"If you are so offended," Nikolay Sergeitch went on, "well, if you like,
I''m ready to apologise. I ask your pardon."

Mashenka made no answer, but only bent lower over her box. This
exhausted, irresolute man was of absolutely no significance in the
household. He stood in the pitiful position of a dependent and
hanger-on, even with the servants, and his apology meant nothing either.

"H''m!... You say nothing! That''s not enough for you. In that case, I
will apologise for my wife. In my wife''s name.... She behaved
tactlessly, I admit it as a gentleman...."

"Then you want me to have it rankling here, under my heart.... You want
my conscience to torment me...."

"I know it''s not your fault, Nikolay Sergeitch," said Mashenka, looking
him full in the face with her big tear-stained eyes. "Why should you
worry yourself?"

Mashenka shook her head. Nikolay Sergeitch stopped at the window and
drummed on the pane with his finger-tips.

"Such misunderstandings are simply torture to me," he said. "Why, do you
want me to go down on my knees to you, or what? Your pride is wounded,
and here you''ve been crying and packing up to go; but I have pride, too,
and you do not spare it! Or do you want me to tell you what I would not
tell as Confession? Do you? Listen; you want me to tell you what I won''t
tell the priest on my deathbed?"

"I took my wife''s brooch," Nikolay Sergeitch said quickly. "Is that
enough now? Are you satisfied? Yes, I ... took it.... But, of course, I
count on your discretion.... For God''s sake, not a word, not half a hint
to any one!"

Mashenka, amazed and frightened, went on packing; she snatched her
things, crumpled them up, and thrust them anyhow into the box and the
basket. Now, after this candid avowal on the part of Nikolay Sergeitch,
she could not remain another minute, and could not understand how she
could have gone on living in the house before.

"And it''s nothing to wonder at," Nikolay Sergeitch went on after a
pause. "It''s an everyday story! I need money, and she ... won''t give it
to me. It was my father''s money that bought this house and everything,
you know! It''s all mine, and the brooch belonged to my mother, and ...
it''s all mine! And she took it, took possession of everything.... I
can''t go to law with her, you''ll admit.... I beg you most earnestly,
overlook it ... stay on. Tout comprendre, tout pardonner. Will you
stay?"

"Well, God bless you!" sighed Nikolay Sergeitch, sitting down on the
stool near the box. "I must own I like people who still can feel
resentment, contempt, and so on. I could sit here forever and look at
your indignant face.... So you won''t stay, then? I understand.... It''s
bound to be so ... Yes, of course.... It''s all right for you, but for
me—wo-o-o-o!... I can''t stir a step out of this cellar. I''d go off to
one of our estates, but in every one of them there are some of my wife''s
rascals ... stewards, experts, damn them all! They mortgage and
remortgage.... You mustn''t catch fish, must keep off the grass, mustn''t
break the trees."

"Then you won''t stay?" asked Nikolay Sergeitch, getting up quickly and
going towards the door. "You might as well stay, really. In the evenings
I could come and have a talk with you. Eh? Stay! If you go, there won''t
be a human face left in the house. It''s awful!"

Nikolay Sergeitch''s pale, exhausted face besought her, but Mashenka
shook her head, and with a wave of his hand he went out.

WHEN visitors to the provincial town S—— complained of the dreariness
and monotony of life, the inhabitants of the town, as though defending
themselves, declared that it was very nice in S——, that there was a
library, a theatre, a club; that they had balls; and, finally, that
there were clever, agreeable, and interesting families with whom one
could make acquaintance. And they used to point to the family of the
Turkins as the most highly cultivated and talented.

This family lived in their own house in the principal street, near the
Governor''s. Ivan Petrovitch Turkin himself—a stout, handsome, dark man
with whiskers—used to get up amateur performances for benevolent
objects, and used to take the part of an elderly general and cough very
amusingly. He knew a number of anecdotes, charades, proverbs, and was
fond of being humorous and witty, and he always wore an expression from
which it was impossible to tell whether he were joking or in earnest.
His wife, Vera Iosifovna—a thin, nice-looking lady who wore a
pince-nez—used to write novels and stories, and was very fond of
reading them aloud to her visitors. The daughter, Ekaterina Ivanovna, a
young girl, used to play on the piano. In short, every member of the
family had a special talent. The Turkins welcomed visitors, and
good-humouredly displayed their talents with genuine simplicity. Their
stone house was roomy and cool in summer; half of the windows looked
into a shady old garden, where nightingales used to sing in the spring.
When there were visitors in the house, there was a clatter of knives in
the kitchen and a smell of fried onions in the yard—and that was always
a sure sign of a plentiful and savoury supper to follow.

And as soon as Dmitri Ionitch Startsev was appointed the district
doctor, and took up his abode at Dyalizh, six miles from S——, he, too,
was told that as a cultivated man it was essential for him to make the
acquaintance of the Turkins. In the winter he was introduced to Ivan
Petrovitch in the street; they talked about the weather, about the
theatre, about the cholera; an invitation followed. On a holiday in the
spring—it was Ascension Day—after seeing his patients, Startsev set
off for town in search of a little recreation and to make some
purchases. He walked in a leisurely way (he had not yet set up his
carriage), humming all the time:

In town he dined, went for a walk in the gardens, then Ivan
Petrovitch''s invitation came into his mind, as it were of itself,
and he decided to call on the Turkins and see what sort of people
they were.

"How do you do, if you please?" said Ivan Petrovitch, meeting him
on the steps. "Delighted, delighted to see such an agreeable visitor.
Come along; I will introduce you to my better half. I tell him,
Verotchka," he went on, as he presented the doctor to his wife—"I
tell him that he has no human right to sit at home in a hospital;
he ought to devote his leisure to society. Oughtn''t he, darling?"

"Sit here," said Vera Iosifovna, making her visitor sit down beside
her. "You can dance attendance on me. My husband is jealous—he
is an Othello; but we will try and behave so well that he will
notice nothing."

"Ah, you spoilt chicken!" Ivan Petrovitch muttered tenderly, and
he kissed her on the forehead. "You have come just in the nick of
time," he said, addressing the doctor again. "My better half has
written a ''hugeous'' novel, and she is going to read it aloud to-day."

Startsev was introduced to Ekaterina Ivanovna, a girl of eighteen,
very much like her mother, thin and pretty. Her expression was still
childish and her figure was soft and slim; and her developed girlish
bosom, healthy and beautiful, was suggestive of spring, real spring.

Then they drank tea with jam, honey, and sweetmeats, and with very
nice cakes, which melted in the mouth. As the evening came on, other
visitors gradually arrived, and Ivan Petrovitch fixed his laughing
eyes on each of them and said:

Then they all sat down in the drawing-room with very serious faces,
and Vera Iosifovna read her novel. It began like this: "The frost
was intense...." The windows were wide open; from the kitchen
came the clatter of knives and the smell of fried onions.... It
was comfortable in the soft deep arm-chair; the lights had such a
friendly twinkle in the twilight of the drawing-room, and at the
moment on a summer evening when sounds of voices and laughter floated
in from the street and whiffs of lilac from the yard, it was difficult
to grasp that the frost was intense, and that the setting sun was
lighting with its chilly rays a solitary wayfarer on the snowy
plain. Vera Iosifovna read how a beautiful young countess founded
a school, a hospital, a library, in her village, and fell in love
with a wandering artist; she read of what never happens in real
life, and yet it was pleasant to listen—it was comfortable, and
such agreeable, serene thoughts kept coming into the mind, one had
no desire to get up.

One hour passed, another. In the town gardens close by a band was
playing and a chorus was singing. When Vera Iosifovna shut her
manuscript book, the company was silent for five minutes, listening
to "Lutchina" being sung by the chorus, and the song gave what was
not in the novel and is in real life.

"No," she answered. "I never publish. I write it and put it away
in my cupboard. Why publish?" she explained. "We have enough to
live on."

The lid of the piano was raised and the music lying ready was opened.
Ekaterina Ivanovna sat down and banged on the piano with both hands,
and then banged again with all her might, and then again and again;
her shoulders and bosom shook. She obstinately banged on the same
notes, and it sounded as if she would not leave off until she had
hammered the keys into the piano. The drawing-room was filled with
the din; everything was resounding; the floor, the ceiling, the
furniture.... Ekaterina Ivanovna was playing a difficult passage,
interesting simply on account of its difficulty, long and monotonous,
and Startsev, listening, pictured stones dropping down a steep hill
and going on dropping, and he wished they would leave off dropping;
and at the same time Ekaterina Ivanovna, rosy from the violent
exercise, strong and vigorous, with a lock of hair falling over her
forehead, attracted him very much. After the winter spent at Dyalizh
among patients and peasants, to sit in a drawing-room, to watch
this young, elegant, and, in all probability, pure creature, and
to listen to these noisy, tedious but still cultured sounds, was
so pleasant, so novel....

"Well, Kitten, you have played as never before," said Ivan Petrovitch,
with tears in his eyes, when his daughter had finished and stood
up. "Die, Denis; you won''t write anything better."

All flocked round her, congratulated her, expressed astonishment,
declared that it was long since they had heard such music, and she
listened in silence with a faint smile, and her whole figure was
expressive of triumph.

"Splendid," said Startsev, too, carried away by the general enthusiasm.
"Where have you studied?" he asked Ekaterina Ivanovna. "At the
Conservatoire?"

"No, I am only preparing for the Conservatoire, and till now have
been working with Madame Zavlovsky."

"Oh, no," Vera Iosifovna answered for her, "We have teachers for
her at home; there might be bad influences at the high school or a
boarding school, you know. While a young girl is growing up, she
ought to be under no influence but her mother''s."

And at supper it was Ivan Petrovitch who displayed his talents.
Laughing only with his eyes, he told anecdotes, made epigrams, asked
ridiculous riddles and answered them himself, talking the whole
time in his extraordinary language, evolved in the course of prolonged
practice in witticism and evidently now become a habit: "Badsome,"
"Hugeous," "Thank you most dumbly," and so on.

But that was not all. When the guests, replete and satisfied, trooped
into the hall, looking for their coats and sticks, there bustled
about them the footman Pavlusha, or, as he was called in the family,
Pava—a lad of fourteen with shaven head and chubby cheeks.

He went to a restaurant and drank some beer, then set off to walk
home to Dyalizh; he walked all the way singing:

On going to bed, he felt not the slightest fatigue after the six miles''
walk. On the contrary, he felt as though he could with pleasure have
walked another twenty.

Startsev kept meaning to go to the Turkins'' again, but there was a great
deal of work in the hospital, and he was unable to find free time. In
this way more than a year passed in work and solitude. But one day a
letter in a light blue envelope was brought him from the town.

Vera Iosifovna had been suffering for some time from migraine, but now
since Kitten frightened her every day by saying that she was going away
to the Conservatoire, the attacks began to be more frequent. All the
doctors of the town had been at the Turkins''; at last it was the
district doctor''s turn. Vera Iosifovna wrote him a touching letter in
which she begged him to come and relieve her sufferings. Startsev went,
and after that he began to be often, very often at the Turkins''.... He
really did something for Vera Iosifovna, and she was already telling all
her visitors that he was a wonderful and exceptional doctor. But it was
not for the sake of her migraine that he visited the Turkins'' now....

It was a holiday. Ekaterina Ivanovna finished her long, wearisome
exercises on the piano. Then they sat a long time in the dining-room,
drinking tea, and Ivan Petrovitch told some amusing story. Then there
was a ring and he had to go into the hall to welcome a guest; Startsev
took advantage of the momentary commotion, and whispered to Ekaterina
Ivanovna in great agitation:

She shrugged her shoulders, as though perplexed and not knowing what he
wanted of her, but she got up and went.

"You play the piano for three or four hours," he said, following her;
"then you sit with your mother, and there is no possibility of speaking
to you. Give me a quarter of an hour at least, I beseech you."

Autumn was approaching, and it was quiet and melancholy in the old
garden; the dark leaves lay thick in the walks. It was already beginning
to get dark early.

"I haven''t seen you for a whole week," Startsev went on, "and if you
only knew what suffering it is! Let us sit down. Listen to me."

They had a favourite place in the garden; a seat under an old spreading
maple. And now they sat down on this seat.

"I have not seen you for a whole week; I have not heard you for so long.
I long passionately, I thirst for your voice. Speak."

She fascinated him by her freshness, the naÃ¯ve expression of her eyes
and cheeks. Even in the way her dress hung on her, he saw something
extraordinarily charming, touching in its simplicity and naÃ¯ve grace;
and at the same time, in spite of this naÃ¯vetÃ©, she seemed to him
intelligent and developed beyond her years. He could talk with her about
literature, about art, about anything he liked; could complain to her of
life, of people, though it sometimes happened in the middle of serious
conversation she would laugh inappropriately or run away into the house.
Like almost all girls of her neighbourhood, she had read a great deal
(as a rule, people read very little in S——, and at the lending library
they said if it were not for the girls and the young Jews, they might as
well shut up the library). This afforded Startsev infinite delight; he
used to ask her eagerly every time what she had been reading the last
few days, and listened enthralled while she told him.

"Where are you going?" cried Startsev in horror, as she suddenly got up
and walked towards the house. "I must talk to you; I want to explain
myself.... Stay with me just five minutes, I supplicate you!"

She stopped as though she wanted to say something, then awkwardly thrust
a note into his hand, ran home and sat down to the piano again.

It was clear: Kitten was playing a prank. Who would seriously dream of
making an appointment at night in the cemetery far out of the town, when
it might have been arranged in the street or in the town gardens? And
was it in keeping with him—a district doctor, an intelligent, staid
man—to be sighing, receiving notes, to hang about cemeteries, to do
silly things that even schoolboys think ridiculous nowadays? What would
this romance lead to? What would his colleagues say when they heard of
it? Such were Startsev''s reflections as he wandered round the tables at
the club, and at half-past ten he suddenly set off for the cemetery.

By now he had his own pair of horses, and a coachman called Panteleimon,
in a velvet waistcoat. The moon was shining. It was still warm, warm as
it is in autumn. Dogs were howling in the suburb near the
slaughter-house. Startsev left his horses in one of the side-streets at
the end of the town, and walked on foot to the cemetery.

"We all have our oddities," he thought. "Kitten is odd, too; and—who
knows?—perhaps she is not joking, perhaps she will come"; and he
abandoned himself to this faint, vain hope, and it intoxicated him.

He walked for half a mile through the fields; the cemetery showed as a
dark streak in the distance, like a forest or a big garden. The wall of
white stone came into sight, the gate.... In the moonlight he could read
on the gate: "The hour cometh." Startsev went in at the little gate, and
before anything else he saw the white crosses and monuments on both
sides of the broad avenue, and the black shadows of them and the
poplars; and for a long way round it was all white and black, and the
slumbering trees bowed their branches over the white stones. It seemed
as though it were lighter here than in the fields; the maple-leaves
stood out sharply like paws on the yellow sand of the avenue and on the
stones, and the inscriptions on the tombs could be clearly read. For the
first moments Startsev was struck now by what he saw for the first time
in his life, and what he would probably never see again; a world not
like anything else, a world in which the moonlight was as soft and
beautiful, as though slumbering here in its cradle, where there was no
life, none whatever; but in every dark poplar, in every tomb, there was
felt the presence of a mystery that promised a life peaceful, beautiful,
eternal. The stones and faded flowers, together with the autumn scent of
the leaves, all told of forgiveness, melancholy, and peace.

All was silence around; the stars looked down from the sky in the
profound stillness, and Startsev''s footsteps sounded loud and out of
place, and only when the church clock began striking and he imagined
himself dead, buried there for ever, he felt as though some one were
looking at him, and for a moment he thought that it was not peace and
tranquillity, but stifled despair, the dumb dreariness of
non-existence....

Demetti''s tomb was in the form of a shrine with an angel at the top. The
Italian opera had once visited S—— and one of the singers had died;
she had been buried here, and this monument put up to her. No one in the
town remembered her, but the lamp at the entrance reflected the
moonlight, and looked as though it were burning.

There was no one, and, indeed, who would come here at midnight? But
Startsev waited, and as though the moonlight warmed his passion, he
waited passionately, and, in imagination, pictured kisses and embraces.
He sat near the monument for half an hour, then paced up and down the
side avenues, with his hat in his hand, waiting and thinking of the many
women and girls buried in these tombs who had been beautiful and
fascinating, who had loved, at night burned with passion, yielding
themselves to caresses. How wickedly Mother Nature jested at man''s
expense, after all! How humiliating it was to recognise it!

Startsev thought this, and at the same time he wanted to cry out that he
wanted love, that he was eager for it at all costs. To his eyes they
were not slabs of marble, but fair white bodies in the moonlight; he saw
shapes hiding bashfully in the shadows of the trees, felt their warmth,
and the languor was oppressive....

And as though a curtain were lowered, the moon went behind a cloud, and
suddenly all was darkness. Startsev could scarcely find the gate—by now
it was as dark as it is on an autumn night. Then he wandered about for
an hour and a half, looking for the side-street in which he had left his
horses.

The following evening he went to the Turkins'' to make an offer. But it
turned out to be an inconvenient moment, as Ekaterina Ivanovna was in
her own room having her hair done by a hair-dresser. She was getting
ready to go to a dance at the club.

He had to sit a long time again in the dining-room drinking tea. Ivan
Petrovitch, seeing that his visitor was bored and preoccupied, drew some
notes out of his waistcoat pocket, read a funny letter from a German
steward, saying that all the ironmongery was ruined and the plasticity
was peeling off the walls.

After a sleepless night, he found himself in a state of stupefaction, as
though he had been given something sweet and soporific to drink; there
was fog in his soul, but joy and warmth, and at the same time a sort of
cold, heavy fragment of his brain was reflecting:

"Stop before it is too late! Is she the match for you? She is spoilt,
whimsical, sleeps till two o''clock in the afternoon, while you are a
deacon''s son, a district doctor...."

"Besides, if you marry her," the fragment went on, "then her relations
will make you give up the district work and live in the town."

"After all," he thought, "if it must be the town, the town it must be.
They will give a dowry; we can establish ourselves suitably."

At last Ekaterina Ivanovna came in, dressed for the ball, with a low
neck, looking fresh and pretty; and Startsev admired her so much, and
went into such ecstasies, that he could say nothing, but simply stared
at her and laughed.

She began saying good-bye, and he—he had no reason for staying now—got
up, saying that it was time for him to go home; his patients were
waiting for him.

"Well, there''s no help for that," said Ivan Petrovitch. "Go, and you
might take Kitten to the club on the way."

It was spotting with rain; it was very dark, and they could only tell
where the horses were by Panteleimon''s husky cough. The hood of the
carriage was put up.

"I stand upright; you lie down right; he lies all right," said Ivan
Petrovitch as he put his daughter into the carriage.

"I was at the cemetery yesterday," Startsev began. "How ungenerous and
merciless it was on your part!..."

Ekaterina Ivanovna, pleased at having so cleverly taken in a man who was
in love with her, and at being the object of such intense love, burst
out laughing and suddenly uttered a shriek of terror, for, at that very
minute, the horses turned sharply in at the gate of the club, and the
carriage almost tilted over. Startsev put his arm round Ekaterina
Ivanovna''s waist; in her fright she nestled up to him, and he could not
restrain himself, and passionately kissed her on the lips and on the
chin, and hugged her more tightly.

And a minute later she was not in the carriage, and a policeman near the
lighted entrance of the club shouted in a detestable voice to
Panteleimon:

Startsev drove home, but soon afterwards returned. Attired in another
man''s dress suit and a stiff white tie which kept sawing at his neck and
trying to slip away from the collar, he was sitting at midnight in the
club drawing-room, and was saying with enthusiasm to Ekaterina Ivanovna.

"Ah, how little people know who have never loved! It seems to me that no
one has ever yet written of love truly, and I doubt whether this tender,
joyful, agonising feeling can be described, and any one who has once
experienced it would not attempt to put it into words. What is the use
of preliminaries and introductions? What is the use of unnecessary fine
words? My love is immeasurable. I beg, I beseech you," Startsev brought
out at last, "be my wife!"

"Dmitri Ionitch," said Ekaterina Ivanovna, with a very grave face, after
a moment''s thought—"Dmitri Ionitch, I am very grateful to you for the
honour. I respect you, but ..." she got up and continued standing, "but,
forgive me, I cannot be your wife. Let us talk seriously. Dmitri
Ionitch, you know I love art beyond everything in life. I adore music; I
love it frantically; I have dedicated my whole life to it. I want to be
an artist; I want fame, success, freedom, and you want me to go on
living in this town, to go on living this empty, useless life, which has
become insufferable to me. To become a wife—oh, no, forgive me! One
must strive towards a lofty, glorious goal, and married life would put
me in bondage for ever. Dmitri Ionitch" (she faintly smiled as she
pronounced his name; she thought of "Alexey Feofilaktitch")—"Dmitri
Ionitch, you are a good, clever, honourable man; you are better than any
one...." Tears came into her eyes. "I feel for you with my whole heart,
but ... but you will understand...."

Startsev''s heart left off throbbing uneasily. Going out of the club into
the street, he first of all tore off the stiff tie and drew a deep
breath. He was a little ashamed and his vanity was wounded—he had not
expected a refusal—and could not believe that all his dreams, his hopes
and yearnings, had led him up to such a stupid end, just as in some
little play at an amateur performance, and he was sorry for his feeling,
for that love of his, so sorry that he felt as though he could have
burst into sobs or have violently belaboured Panteleimon''s broad back
with his umbrella.

For three days he could not get on with anything, he could not eat nor
sleep; but when the news reached him that Ekaterina Ivanovna had gone
away to Moscow to enter the Conservatoire, he grew calmer and lived as
before.

Afterwards, remembering sometimes how he had wandered about the cemetery
or how he had driven all over the town to get a dress suit, he stretched
lazily and said:

Four years had passed. Startsev already had a large practice in the
town. Every morning he hurriedly saw his patients at Dyalizh, then he
drove in to see his town patients. By now he drove, not with a pair, but
with a team of three with bells on them, and he returned home late at
night. He had grown broader and stouter, and was not very fond of
walking, as he was somewhat asthmatic. And Panteleimon had grown stout,
too, and the broader he grew, the more mournfully he sighed and
complained of his hard luck: he was sick of driving! Startsev used to
visit various households and met many people, but did not become
intimate with any one. The inhabitants irritated him by their
conversation, their views of life, and even their appearance. Experience
taught him by degrees that while he played cards or lunched with one of
these people, the man was a peaceable, friendly, and even intelligent
human being; that as soon as one talked of anything not eatable, for
instance, of politics or science, he would be completely at a loss, or
would expound a philosophy so stupid and ill-natured that there was
nothing else to do but wave one''s hand in despair and go away. Even when
Startsev tried to talk to liberal citizens, saying, for instance, that
humanity, thank God, was progressing, and that one day it would be
possible to dispense with passports and capital punishment, the liberal
citizen would look at him askance and ask him mistrustfully: "Then any
one could murder any one he chose in the open street?" And when, at tea
or supper, Startsev observed in company that one should work, and that
one ought not to live without working, every one took this as a
reproach, and began to get angry and argue aggressively. With all that,
the inhabitants did nothing, absolutely nothing, and took no interest in
anything, and it was quite impossible to think of anything to say. And
Startsev avoided conversation, and confined himself to eating and
playing vint; and when there was a family festivity in some household
and he was invited to a meal, then he sat and ate in silence, looking at
his plate.

And everything that was said at the time was uninteresting, unjust, and
stupid; he felt irritated and disturbed, but held his tongue, and,
because he sat glumly silent and looked at his plate, he was nicknamed
in the town "the haughty Pole," though he never had been a Pole.

All such entertainments as theatres and concerts he declined, but he
played vint every evening for three hours with enjoyment. He had
another diversion to which he took imperceptibly, little by little: in
the evening he would take out of his pockets the notes he had gained by
his practice, and sometimes there were stuffed in his pockets
notes—yellow and green, and smelling of scent and vinegar and incense
and fish oil—up to the value of seventy roubles; and when they amounted
to some hundreds he took them to the Mutual Credit Bank and deposited
the money there to his account.

He was only twice at the Turkins'' in the course of the four years after
Ekaterina Ivanovna had gone away, on each occasion at the invitation of
Vera Iosifovna, who was still undergoing treatment for migraine. Every
summer Ekaterina Ivanovna came to stay with her parents, but he did not
once see her; it somehow never happened.

But now four years had passed. One still, warm morning a letter was
brought to the hospital. Vera Iosifovna wrote to Dmitri Ionitch that she
was missing him very much, and begged him to come and see them, and to
relieve her sufferings; and, by the way, it was her birthday. Below was
a postscript: "I join in mother''s request.—K."

Vera Iosifovna, white-haired and looking much older, shook Startsev''s
hand, sighed affectedly, and said:

"You don''t care to pay attentions to me, doctor. You never come and see
us; I am too old for you. But now some one young has come; perhaps she
will be more fortunate."

And Kitten? She had grown thinner, paler, had grown handsomer and more
graceful; but now she was Ekaterina Ivanovna, not Kitten; she had lost
the freshness and look of childish naÃ¯vetÃ©. And in her expression and
manners there was something new—guilty and diffident, as though she did
not feel herself at home here in the Turkins'' house.

"How many summers, how many winters!" she said, giving Startsev her
hand, and he could see that her heart was beating with excitement; and
looking at him intently and curiously, she went on: "How much stouter
you are! You look sunburnt and more manly, but on the whole you have
changed very little."

Now, too, he thought her attractive, very attractive, but there was
something lacking in her, or else something superfluous—he could not
himself have said exactly what it was, but something prevented him from
feeling as before. He did not like her pallor, her new expression, her
faint smile, her voice, and soon afterwards he disliked her clothes,
too, the low chair in which she was sitting; he disliked something in
the past when he had almost married her. He thought of his love, of the
dreams and the hopes which had troubled him four years before—and he
felt awkward.

They had tea with cakes. Then Vera Iosifovna read aloud a novel; she
read of things that never happen in real life, and Startsev listened,
looked at her handsome grey head, and waited for her to finish.

"People are not stupid because they can''t write novels, but because they
can''t conceal it when they do," he thought.

Then Ekaterina Ivanovna played long and noisily on the piano, and when
she finished she was profusely thanked and warmly praised.

She looked at him, and evidently expected him to ask her to go into the
garden, but he remained silent.

"Let us have a talk," she said, going up to him. "How are you getting
on? What are you doing? How are things? I have been thinking about you
all these days," she went on nervously. "I wanted to write to you,
wanted to come myself to see you at Dyalizh. I quite made up my mind to
go, but afterwards I thought better of it. God knows what your attitude
is towards me now; I have been looking forward to seeing you to-day with
such emotion. For goodness'' sake let us go into the garden."

They went into the garden and sat down on the seat under the old maple,
just as they had done four years before. It was dark.

"I feel so excited!" said Ekaterina Ivanovna, and she hid her face in
her hands. "But don''t pay attention to it. I am so happy to be at home;
I am so glad to see every one. I can''t get used to it. So many memories!
I thought we should talk without stopping till morning."

Now he saw her face near, her shining eyes, and in the darkness she
looked younger than in the room, and even her old childish expression
seemed to have come back to her. And indeed she was looking at him with
naÃ¯ve curiosity, as though she wanted to get a closer view and
understanding of the man who had loved her so ardently, with such
tenderness, and so unsuccessfully; her eyes thanked him for that love.
And he remembered all that had been, every minute detail; how he had
wandered about the cemetery, how he had returned home in the morning
exhausted, and he suddenly felt sad and regretted the past. A warmth
began glowing in his heart.

"Do you remember how I took you to the dance at the club?" he asked. "It
was dark and rainy then ..."

"Ech!" he said with a sigh. "You ask how I am living. How do we live
here? Why, not at all. We grow old, we grow stout, we grow slack. Day
after day passes; life slips by without colour, without expressions,
without thoughts.... In the daytime working for gain, and in the evening
the club, the company of card-players, alcoholic, raucous-voiced
gentlemen whom I can''t endure. What is there nice in it?"

"Well, you have work—a noble object in life. You used to be so fond of
talking of your hospital. I was such a queer girl then; I imagined
myself such a great pianist. Nowadays all young ladies play the piano,
and I played, too, like everybody else, and there was nothing special
about me. I am just such a pianist as my mother is an authoress. And of
course I didn''t understand you then, but afterwards in Moscow I often
thought of you. I thought of no one but you. What happiness to be a
district doctor; to help the suffering; to be serving the people! What
happiness!" Ekaterina Ivanovna repeated with enthusiasm. "When I thought
of you in Moscow, you seemed to me so ideal, so lofty...."

Startsev thought of the notes he used to take out of his pockets in the
evening with such pleasure, and the glow in his heart was quenched.

"You are the best man I''ve known in my life," she went on. "We will see
each other and talk, won''t we? Promise me. I am not a pianist; I am not
in error about myself now, and I will not play before you or talk of
music."

When they had gone into the house, and when Startsev saw in the
lamplight her face, and her sad, grateful, searching eyes fixed upon
him, he felt uneasy and thought again:

"You have no human right to go before supper," said Ivan Petrovitch as
he saw him off. "It''s extremely perpendicular on your part. Well, now,
perform!" he added, addressing Pava in the hall.

Pava, no longer a boy, but a young man with moustaches, threw himself
into an attitude, flung up his arm, and said in a tragic voice:

All this irritated Startsev. Getting into his carriage, and looking at
the dark house and garden which had once been so precious and so dear,
he thought of everything at once—Vera Iosifovna''s novels and Kitten''s
noisy playing, and Ivan Petrovitch''s jokes and Pava''s tragic posturing,
and thought if the most talented people in the town were so futile, what
must the town be?

"You don''t come and see us—why?" she wrote to him. "I am afraid that
you have changed towards us. I am afraid, and I am terrified at the very
thought of it. Reassure me; come and tell me that everything is well.

"Tell them, my good fellow, that I can''t come to-day; I am very busy.
Say I will come in three days or so."

But three days passed, a week passed; he still did not go. Happening
once to drive past the Turkins'' house, he thought he must go in, if only
for a moment, but on second thoughts ... did not go in.

Several more years have passed. Startsev has grown stouter still, has
grown corpulent, breathes heavily, and already walks with his head
thrown back. When stout and red in the face, he drives with his bells
and his team of three horses, and Panteleimon, also stout and red in the
face with his thick beefy neck, sits on the box, holding his arms
stiffly out before him as though they were made of wood, and shouts to
those he meets: "Keep to the ri-i-ight!" it is an impressive picture;
one might think it was not a mortal, but some heathen deity in his
chariot. He has an immense practice in the town, no time to breathe, and
already has an estate and two houses in the town, and he is looking out
for a third more profitable; and when at the Mutual Credit Bank he is
told of a house that is for sale, he goes to the house without ceremony,
and, marching through all the rooms, regardless of half-dressed women
and children who gaze at him in amazement and alarm, he prods at the
doors with his stick, and says:

He has a great deal to do, but still he does not give up his work as
district doctor; he is greedy for gain, and he tries to be in all places
at once. At Dyalizh and in the town he is called simply "Ionitch":
"Where is Ionitch off to?" or "Should not we call in Ionitch to a
consultation?"

Probably because his throat is covered with rolls of fat, his voice has
changed; it has become thin and sharp. His temper has changed, too: he
has grown ill-humoured and irritable. When he sees his patients he is
usually out of temper; he impatiently taps the floor with his stick, and
shouts in his disagreeable voice:

During all the years he had lived at Dyalizh his love for Kitten had
been his one joy, and probably his last. In the evenings he plays vint
at the club, and then sits alone at a big table and has supper. Ivan,
the oldest and most respectable of the waiters, serves him, hands him
Lafitte No. 17, and every one at the club—the members of the committee,
the cook and waiters—know what he likes and what he doesn''t like and do
their very utmost to satisfy him, or else he is sure to fly into a rage
and bang on the floor with his stick.

And the Turkins? Ivan Petrovitch has grown no older; he is not changed
in the least, and still makes jokes and tells anecdotes as of old. Vera
Iosifovna still reads her novels aloud to her visitors with eagerness
and touching simplicity. And Kitten plays the piano for four hours every
day. She has grown visibly older, is constantly ailing, and every autumn
goes to the Crimea with her mother. When Ivan Petrovitch sees them off
at the station, he wipes his tears as the train starts, and shouts:

IT is, as a rule, after losing heavily at cards or after a drinking-bout
when an attack of dyspepsia is setting in that Stepan Stepanitch Zhilin
wakes up in an exceptionally gloomy frame of mind. He looks sour,
rumpled, and dishevelled; there is an expression of displeasure on his
grey face, as though he were offended or disgusted by something. He
dresses slowly, sips his Vichy water deliberately, and begins walking
about the rooms.

"I should like to know what b-b-beast comes in here and does not shut
the door!" he grumbles angrily, wrapping his dressing-gown about him and
spitting loudly. "Take away that paper! Why is it lying about here? We
keep twenty servants, and the place is more untidy than a pot-house. Who
was that ringing? Who the devil is that?"

"I am not scolding; I am speaking. You might find something to do, my
dear, instead of sitting with your hands in your lap trying to pick a
quarrel. Upon my word, women are beyond my comprehension! Beyond my
comprehension! How can they waste whole days doing nothing? A man works
like an ox, like a b-beast, while his wife, the partner of his life,
sits like a pretty doll, sits and does nothing but watch for an
opportunity to quarrel with her husband by way of diversion. It''s time
to drop these schoolgirlish ways, my dear. You are not a schoolgirl, not
a young lady; you are a wife and mother! You turn away? Aha! It''s not
agreeable to listen to the bitter truth!"

"What if I have? Is that anybody''s business? Am I obliged to give an
account of my doings to any one? It''s my own money I lose, I suppose?
What I spend as well as what is spent in this house belongs to me—me.
Do you hear? To me!"

And so on, all in the same style. But at no other time is Stepan
Stepanitch so reasonable, virtuous, stern or just as at dinner, when all
his household are sitting about him. It usually begins with the soup.
After swallowing the first spoonful Zhilin suddenly frowns and puts down
his spoon.

"One must have the taste of a pig to eat hogwash like that! There''s too
much salt in it; it smells of dirty rags ... more like bugs than
onions.... It''s simply revolting, Anfissa Ivanovna," he says, addressing
the midwife. "Every day I give no end of money for housekeeping.... I
deny myself everything, and this is what they provide for my dinner! I
suppose they want me to give up the office and go into the kitchen to do
the cooking myself."

"Oh, you think so?" says Zhilin, looking at her angrily from under his
eyelids. "Every one to his taste, of course. It must be confessed our
tastes are very different, Varvara Vassilyevna. You, for instance, are
satisfied with the behaviour of this boy" (Zhilin with a tragic gesture
points to his son Fedya); "you are delighted with him, while I ... I am
disgusted. Yes!"

Fedya, a boy of seven with a pale, sickly face, leaves off eating and
drops his eyes. His face grows paler still.

"Yes, you are delighted, and I am disgusted. Which of us is right, I
cannot say, but I venture to think as his father, I know my own son
better than you do. Look how he is sitting! Is that the way decently
brought up children sit? Sit properly."

Fedya tilts his chin up, cranes his neck, and fancies that he is holding
himself better. Tears come into his eyes.

"Eat your dinner! Hold your spoon properly! You wait. I''ll show you, you
horrid boy! Don''t dare to whimper! Look straight at me!"

"You won''t get off with that!" his parent persists. "If nobody else
cares to look after your bringing up, so be it; I must begin.... I won''t
let you be naughty and cry at dinner, my lad! Idiot! You must do your
duty! Do you understand? Do your duty! Your father works and you must
work, too! No one must eat the bread of idleness! You must be a man! A
m-man!"

"For God''s sake, leave off," says his wife in French. "Don''t nag at us
before outsiders, at least.... The old woman is all ears; and now,
thanks to her, all the town will hear of it."

"I am not afraid of outsiders," answers Zhilin in Russian. "Anfissa
Ivanovna sees that I am speaking the truth. Why, do you think I ought to
be pleased with the boy? Do you know what he costs me? Do you know, you
nasty boy, what you cost me? Or do you imagine that I coin money, that I
get it for nothing? Don''t howl! Hold your tongue! Do you hear what I
say? Do you want me to whip you, you young ruffian?"

"This is insufferable," says his mother, getting up from the table and
flinging down her dinner-napkin. "You never let us have dinner in peace!
Your bread sticks in my throat."

"Now she is offended," grumbles Zhilin, with a forced smile. "She''s been
spoilt.... That''s how it is, Anfissa Ivanovna; no one likes to hear the
truth nowadays.... It''s all my fault, it seems."

Several minutes of silence follow. Zhilin looks round at the plates, and
noticing that no one has yet touched their soup, heaves a deep sigh, and
stares at the flushed and uneasy face of the governess.

"Why don''t you eat, Varvara Vassilyevna?" he asks. "Offended, I suppose?
I see.... You don''t like to be told the truth. You must forgive me, it''s
my nature; I can''t be a hypocrite.... I always blurt out the plain
truth" (a sigh). "But I notice that my presence is unwelcome. No one can
eat or talk while I am here.... Well, you should have told me, and I
would have gone away.... I will go."

"After all that has passed here, you are free," he says to Fedya,
throwing back his head with dignity. "I won''t meddle in your bringing up
again. I wash my hands of it! I humbly apologise that as a father, from
a sincere desire for your welfare, I have disturbed you and your
mentors. At the same time, once for all I disclaim all responsibility
for your future...."

Fedya wails and sobs more loudly than ever. Zhilin turns with dignity to
the door and departs to his bedroom.

When he wakes from his after-dinner nap he begins to feel the stings of
conscience. He is ashamed to face his wife, his son, Anfissa Ivanovna,
and even feels very wretched when he recalls the scene at dinner, but
his amour-propre is too much for him; he has not the manliness to be
frank, and he goes on sulking and grumbling.

Waking up next morning, he feels in excellent spirits, and whistles
gaily as he washes. Going into the dining-room to breakfast, he finds
there Fedya, who, at the sight of his father, gets up and looks at him
helplessly.

"Well, young man?" Zhilin greets him good-humouredly, sitting down to
the table. "What have you got to tell me, young man? Are you all right?
Well, come, chubby; give your father a kiss."

With a pale, grave face Fedya goes up to his father and touches his
cheek with his quivering lips, then walks away and sits down in his
place without a word.

ANDREY VASSILITCH KOVRIN, who held a master''s degree at the University,
had exhausted himself, and had upset his nerves. He did not send for a
doctor, but casually, over a bottle of wine, he spoke to a friend who
was a doctor, and the latter advised him to spend the spring and summer
in the country. Very opportunely a long letter came from Tanya Pesotsky,
who asked him to come and stay with them at Borissovka. And he made up
his mind that he really must go.

To begin with—that was in April—he went to his own home, Kovrinka, and
there spent three weeks in solitude; then, as soon as the roads were in
good condition, he set off, driving in a carriage, to visit Pesotsky,
his former guardian, who had brought him up, and was a horticulturist
well known all over Russia. The distance from Kovrinka to Borissovka was
reckoned only a little over fifty miles. To drive along a soft road in
May in a comfortable carriage with springs was a real pleasure.

Pesotsky had an immense house with columns and lions, off which the
stucco was peeling, and with a footman in swallow-tails at the entrance.
The old park, laid out in the English style, gloomy and severe,
stretched for almost three-quarters of a mile to the river, and there
ended in a steep, precipitous clay bank, where pines grew with bare
roots that looked like shaggy paws; the water shone below with an
unfriendly gleam, and the peewits flew up with a plaintive cry, and
there one always felt that one must sit down and write a ballad. But
near the house itself, in the courtyard and orchard, which together with
the nurseries covered ninety acres, it was all life and gaiety even in
bad weather. Such marvellous roses, lilies, camellias; such tulips of
all possible shades, from glistening white to sooty black—such a wealth
of flowers, in fact, Kovrin had never seen anywhere as at Pesotsky''s. It
was only the beginning of spring, and the real glory of the flower-beds
was still hidden away in the hot-houses. But even the flowers along the
avenues, and here and there in the flower-beds, were enough to make one
feel, as one walked about the garden, as though one were in a realm of
tender colours, especially in the early morning when the dew was
glistening on every petal.

What was the decorative part of the garden, and what Pesotsky
contemptuously spoke of as rubbish, had at one time in his childhood
given Kovrin an impression of fairyland.

Every sort of caprice, of elaborate monstrosity and mockery at Nature
was here. There were espaliers of fruit-trees, a pear-tree in the shape
of a pyramidal poplar, spherical oaks and lime-trees, an apple-tree in
the shape of an umbrella, plum-trees trained into arches, crests,
candelabra, and even into the number 1862—the year when Pesotsky first
took up horticulture. One came across, too, lovely, graceful trees with
strong, straight stems like palms, and it was only by looking intently
that one could recognise these trees as gooseberries or currants. But
what made the garden most cheerful and gave it a lively air, was the
continual coming and going in it, from early morning till evening;
people with wheelbarrows, shovels, and watering-cans swarmed round the
trees and bushes, in the avenues and the flower-beds, like ants....

Kovrin arrived at Pesotsky''s at ten o''clock in the evening. He found
Tanya and her father, Yegor Semyonitch, in great anxiety. The clear
starlight sky and the thermometer foretold a frost towards morning, and
meanwhile Ivan Karlovitch, the gardener, had gone to the town, and they
had no one to rely upon. At supper they talked of nothing but the
morning frost, and it was settled that Tanya should not go to bed, and
between twelve and one should walk through the garden, and see that
everything was done properly, and Yegor Semyonitch should get up at
three o''clock or even earlier.

Kovrin sat with Tanya all the evening, and after midnight went out with
her into the garden. It was cold. There was a strong smell of burning
already in the garden. In the big orchard, which was called the
commercial garden, and which brought Yegor Semyonitch several thousand
clear profit, a thick, black, acrid smoke was creeping over the ground
and, curling around the trees, was saving those thousands from the
frost. Here the trees were arranged as on a chessboard, in straight and
regular rows like ranks of soldiers, and this severe pedantic
regularity, and the fact that all the trees were of the same size, and
had tops and trunks all exactly alike, made them look monotonous and
even dreary. Kovrin and Tanya walked along the rows where fires of dung,
straw, and all sorts of refuse were smouldering, and from time to time
they were met by labourers who wandered in the smoke like shadows. The
only trees in flower were the cherries, plums, and certain sorts of
apples, but the whole garden was plunged in smoke, and it was only near
the nurseries that Kovrin could breathe freely.

"Even as a child I used to sneeze from the smoke here," he said,
shrugging his shoulders, "but to this day I don''t understand how smoke
can keep off frost."

He laughed and took her arm. Her broad, very earnest face, chilled with
the frost, with her delicate black eyebrows, the turned-up collar of her
coat, which prevented her moving her head freely, and the whole of her
thin, graceful figure, with her skirts tucked up on account of the dew,
touched him.

"Good heavens! she is grown up," he said. "When I went away from here
last, five years ago, you were still a child. You were such a thin,
longlegged creature, with your hair hanging on your shoulders; you used
to wear short frocks, and I used to tease you, calling you a heron....
What time does!"

"Yes, five years!" sighed Tanya. "Much water has flowed since then. Tell
me, Andryusha, honestly," she began eagerly, looking him in the face:
"do you feel strange with us now? But why do I ask you? You are a man,
you live your own interesting life, you are somebody.... To grow apart
is so natural! But however that may be, Andryusha, I want you to think
of us as your people. We have a right to that."

"You were surprised this evening that we have so many of your
photographs. You know my father adores you. Sometimes it seems to me
that he loves you more than he does me. He is proud of you. You are a
clever, extraordinary man, you have made a brilliant career for
yourself, and he is persuaded that you have turned out like this because
he brought you up. I don''t try to prevent him from thinking so. Let
him."

Dawn was already beginning, and that was especially perceptible from the
distinctness with which the coils of smoke and the tops of the trees
began to stand out in the air.

"It''s time we were asleep, though," said Tanya, "and it''s cold, too."
She took his arm. "Thank you for coming, Andryusha. We have only
uninteresting acquaintances, and not many of them. We have only the
garden, the garden, the garden, and nothing else. Standards,
half-standards," she laughed. "Aports, Reinettes, Borovinkas, budded
stocks, grafted stocks.... All, all our life has gone into the garden. I
never even dream of anything but apples and pears. Of course, it is very
nice and useful, but sometimes one longs for something else for variety.
I remember that when you used to come to us for the summer holidays, or
simply a visit, it always seemed to be fresher and brighter in the
house, as though the covers had been taken off the lustres and the
furniture. I was only a little girl then, but yet I understood it."

She talked a long while and with great feeling. For some reason the idea
came into his head that in the course of the summer he might grow fond
of this little, weak, talkative creature, might be carried away and fall
in love; in their position it was so possible and natural! This thought
touched and amused him; he bent down to her sweet, preoccupied face and
hummed softly:

By the time they reached the house, Yegor Semyonitch had got up. Kovrin
did not feel sleepy; he talked to the old man and went to the garden
with him. Yegor Semyonitch was a tall, broad-shouldered, corpulent man,
and he suffered from asthma, yet he walked so fast that it was hard work
to hurry after him. He had an extremely preoccupied air; he was always
hurrying somewhere, with an expression that suggested that if he were
one minute late all would be ruined!

"Here is a business, brother ..." he began, standing still to take
breath. "On the surface of the ground, as you see, is frost; but if you
raise the thermometer on a stick fourteen feet above the ground, there
it is warm.... Why is that?"

"H''m!... One can''t know everything, of course.... However large the
intellect may be, you can''t find room for everything in it. I suppose
you still go in chiefly for philosophy?"

"Well, God bless you!..." said Yegor Semyonitch, meditatively stroking
his grey whiskers. "God bless you!... I am delighted about you ...
delighted, my boy...."

But suddenly he listened, and, with a terrible face, ran off and quickly
disappeared behind the trees in a cloud of smoke.

"Who tied this horse to an apple-tree?" Kovrin heard his despairing,
heart-rending cry. "Who is the low scoundrel who has dared to tie this
horse to an apple-tree? My God, my God! They have ruined everything;
they have spoilt everything; they have done everything filthy, horrible,
and abominable. The orchard''s done for, the orchard''s ruined. My God!"

"What is one to do with these accursed people?" he said in a tearful
voice, flinging up his hands. "Styopka was carting dung at night, and
tied the horse to an apple-tree! He twisted the reins round it, the
rascal, as tightly as he could, so that the bark is rubbed off in three
places. What do you think of that! I spoke to him and he stands like a
post and only blinks his eyes. Hanging is too good for him."

"Well, God bless you!... God bless you!..." he muttered. "I am very glad
you have come. Unutterably glad.... Thank you."

Then, with the same rapid step and preoccupied face, he made the round
of the whole garden, and showed his former ward all his greenhouses and
hot-houses, his covered-in garden, and two apiaries which he called the
marvel of our century.

While they were walking the sun rose, flooding the garden with brilliant
light. It grew warm. Foreseeing a long, bright, cheerful day, Kovrin
recollected that it was only the beginning of May, and that he had
before him a whole summer as bright, cheerful, and long; and suddenly
there stirred in his bosom a joyous, youthful feeling, such as he used
to experience in his childhood, running about in that garden. And he
hugged the old man and kissed him affectionately. Both of them, feeling
touched, went indoors and drank tea out of old-fashioned china cups,
with cream and satisfying krendels made with milk and eggs; and these
trifles reminded Kovrin again of his childhood and boyhood. The
delightful present was blended with the impressions of the past that
stirred within him; there was a tightness at his heart; yet he was
happy.

He waited till Tanya was awake and had coffee with her, went for a walk,
then went to his room and sat down to work. He read attentively, making
notes, and from time to time raised his eyes to look out at the open
windows or at the fresh, still dewy flowers in the vases on the table;
and again he dropped his eyes to his book, and it seemed to him as
though every vein in his body was quivering and fluttering with
pleasure.

In the country he led just as nervous and restless a life as in town. He
read and wrote a great deal, he studied Italian, and when he was out for
a walk, thought with pleasure that he would soon sit down to work again.
He slept so little that every one wondered at him; if he accidentally
dozed for half an hour in the daytime, he would lie awake all night,
and, after a sleepless night, would feel cheerful and vigorous as though
nothing had happened.

He talked a great deal, drank wine, and smoked expensive cigars. Very
often, almost every day, young ladies of neighbouring families would
come to the Pesotskys'', and would sing and play the piano with Tanya;
sometimes a young neighbour who was a good violinist would come, too.
Kovrin listened with eagerness to the music and singing, and was
exhausted by it, and this showed itself by his eyes closing and his head
falling to one side.

One day he was sitting on the balcony after evening tea, reading. At the
same time, in the drawing-room, Tanya taking soprano, one of the young
ladies a contralto, and the young man with his violin, were practising a
well-known serenade of Braga''s. Kovrin listened to the words—they were
Russian—and could not understand their meaning. At last, leaving his
book and listening attentively, he understood: a maiden, full of sick
fancies, heard one night in her garden mysterious sounds, so strange and
lovely that she was obliged to recognise them as a holy harmony which is
unintelligible to us mortals, and so flies back to heaven. Kovrin''s eyes
began to close. He got up, and in exhaustion walked up and down the
drawing-room, and then the dining-room. When the singing was over he
took Tanya''s arm, and with her went out on the balcony.

"I have been all day thinking of a legend," he said. "I don''t remember
whether I have read it somewhere or heard it, but it is a strange and
almost grotesque legend. To begin with, it is somewhat obscure. A
thousand years ago a monk, dressed in black, wandered about the desert,
somewhere in Syria or Arabia.... Some miles from where he was, some
fisherman saw another black monk, who was moving slowly over the surface
of a lake. This second monk was a mirage. Now forget all the laws of
optics, which the legend does not recognise, and listen to the rest.
From that mirage there was cast another mirage, then from that other a
third, so that the image of the black monk began to be repeated
endlessly from one layer of the atmosphere to another. So that he was
seen at one time in Africa, at another in Spain, then in Italy, then in
the Far North.... Then he passed out of the atmosphere of the earth, and
now he is wandering all over the universe, still never coming into
conditions in which he might disappear. Possibly he may be seen now in
Mars or in some star of the Southern Cross. But, my dear, the real point
on which the whole legend hangs lies in the fact that, exactly a
thousand years from the day when the monk walked in the desert, the
mirage will return to the atmosphere of the earth again and will appear
to men. And it seems that the thousand years is almost up.... According
to the legend, we may look out for the black monk to-day or to-morrow."

"But the most wonderful part of it all," laughed Kovrin, "is that I
simply cannot recall where I got this legend from. Have I read it
somewhere? Have I heard it? Or perhaps I dreamed of the black monk. I
swear I don''t remember. But the legend interests me. I have been
thinking about it all day."

Letting Tanya go back to her visitors, he went out of the house, and,
lost in meditation, walked by the flower-beds. The sun was already
setting. The flowers, having just been watered, gave forth a damp,
irritating fragrance. Indoors they began singing again, and in the
distance the violin had the effect of a human voice. Kovrin, racking his
brains to remember where he had read or heard the legend, turned slowly
towards the park, and unconsciously went as far as the river. By a
little path that ran along the steep bank, between the bare roots, he
went down to the water, disturbed the peewits there and frightened two
ducks. The last rays of the setting sun still threw light here and there
on the gloomy pines, but it was quite dark on the surface of the river.
Kovrin crossed to the other side by the narrow bridge. Before him lay a
wide field covered with young rye not yet in blossom. There was no
living habitation, no living soul in the distance, and it seemed as
though the little path, if one went along it, would take one to the
unknown, mysterious place where the sun had just gone down, and where
the evening glow was flaming in immensity and splendour.

"How open, how free, how still it is here!" thought Kovrin, walking
along the path. "And it feels as though all the world were watching me,
hiding and waiting for me to understand it...."

But then waves began running across the rye, and a light evening breeze
softly touched his uncovered head. A minute later there was another gust
of wind, but stronger—the rye began rustling, and he heard behind him
the hollow murmur of the pines. Kovrin stood still in amazement. From
the horizon there rose up to the sky, like a whirlwind or a waterspout,
a tall black column. Its outline was indistinct, but from the first
instant it could be seen that it was not standing still, but moving with
fearful rapidity, moving straight towards Kovrin, and the nearer it came
the smaller and the more distinct it was. Kovrin moved aside into the
rye to make way for it, and only just had time to do so.

A monk, dressed in black, with a grey head and black eyebrows, his arms
crossed over his breast, floated by him.... His bare feet did not touch
the earth. After he had floated twenty feet beyond him, he looked round
at Kovrin, and nodded to him with a friendly but sly smile. But what a
pale, fearfully pale, thin face! Beginning to grow larger again, he flew
across the river, collided noiselessly with the clay bank and pines, and
passing through them, vanished like smoke.

Without trying to explain to himself the strange apparition, glad that
he had succeeded in seeing so near and so distinctly, not only the
monk''s black garments, but even his face and eyes, agreeably excited, he
went back to the house.

In the park and in the garden people were moving about quietly, in the
house they were playing—so he alone had seen the monk. He had an
intense desire to tell Tanya and Yegor Semyonitch, but he reflected that
they would certainly think his words the ravings of delirium, and that
would frighten them; he had better say nothing.

He laughed aloud, sang, and danced the mazurka; he was in high spirits,
and all of them, the visitors and Tanya, thought he had a peculiar look,
radiant and inspired, and that he was very interesting.

After supper, when the visitors had gone, he went to his room and lay
down on the sofa: he wanted to think about the monk. But a minute later
Tanya came in.

"Here, Andryusha; read father''s articles," she said, giving him a bundle
of pamphlets and proofs. "They are splendid articles. He writes
capitally."

"Capitally, indeed!" said Yegor Semyonitch, following her and smiling
constrainedly; he was ashamed. "Don''t listen to her, please; don''t read
them! Though, if you want to go to sleep, read them by all means; they
are a fine soporific."

"I think they are splendid articles," said Tanya, with deep conviction.
"You read them, Andryusha, and persuade father to write oftener. He
could write a complete manual of horticulture."

Yegor Semyonitch gave a forced laugh, blushed, and began uttering the
phrases usually made use of by an embarrassed author. At last he began
to give way.

"In that case, begin with Gaucher''s article and these Russian articles,"
he muttered, turning over the pamphlets with a trembling hand, "or else
you won''t understand. Before you read my objections, you must know what
I am objecting to. But it''s all nonsense ... tiresome stuff. Besides, I
believe it''s bedtime."

"Yes, my boy ..." he began after a pause. "That''s how it is, my dear
lecturer. Here I write articles, and take part in exhibitions, and
receive medals.... Pesotsky, they say, has apples the size of a head,
and Pesotsky, they say, has made his fortune with his garden. In short,
''Kotcheby is rich and glorious.'' But one asks oneself: what is it all
for? The garden is certainly fine, a model. It''s not really a garden,
but a regular institution, which is of the greatest public importance
because it marks, so to say, a new era in Russian agriculture and
Russian industry. But, what''s it for? What''s the object of it?"

"I do not mean in that sense. I meant to ask: what will happen to the
garden when I die? In the condition in which you see it now, it would
not be maintained for one month without me. The whole secret of success
lies not in its being a big garden or a great number of labourers being
employed in it, but in the fact that I love the work. Do you understand?
I love it perhaps more than myself. Look at me; I do everything myself.
I work from morning to night: I do all the grafting myself, the pruning
myself, the planting myself. I do it all myself: when any one helps me I
am jealous and irritable till I am rude. The whole secret lies in loving
it—that is, in the sharp eye of the master; yes, and in the master''s
hands, and in the feeling that makes one, when one goes anywhere for an
hour''s visit, sit, ill at ease, with one''s heart far away, afraid that
something may have happened in the garden. But when I die, who will look
after it? Who will work? The gardener? The labourers? Yes? But I will
tell you, my dear fellow, the worst enemy in the garden is not a hare,
not a cockchafer, and not the frost, but any outside person."

"And Tanya?" asked Kovrin, laughing. "She can''t be more harmful than a
hare? She loves the work and understands it."

"Yes, she loves it and understands it. If after my death the garden goes
to her and she is the mistress, of course nothing better could be
wished. But if, which God forbid, she should marry," Yegor Semyonitch
whispered, and looked with a frightened look at Kovrin, "that''s just it.
If she marries and children come, she will have no time to think about
the garden. What I fear most is: she will marry some fine gentleman, and
he will be greedy, and he will let the garden to people who will run it
for profit, and everything will go to the devil the very first year! In
our work females are the scourge of God!"

"Perhaps it is egoism, but I tell you frankly: I don''t want Tanya to get
married. I am afraid of it! There is one young dandy comes to see us,
bringing his violin and scraping on it; I know Tanya will not marry him,
I know it quite well; but I can''t bear to see him! Altogether, my boy, I
am very queer. I know that."

Yegor Semyonitch got up and walked about the room in excitement, and it
was evident that he wanted to say something very important, but could
not bring himself to it.

"I am very fond of you, and so I am going to speak to you openly," he
decided at last, thrusting his hands into his pockets. "I deal plainly
with certain delicate questions, and say exactly what I think, and I
cannot endure so-called hidden thoughts. I will speak plainly: you are
the only man to whom I should not be afraid to marry my daughter. You
are a clever man with a good heart, and would not let my beloved work go
to ruin; and the chief reason is that I love you as a son, and I am
proud of you. If Tanya and you could get up a romance somehow,
then—well! I should be very glad and even happy. I tell you this
plainly, without mincing matters, like an honest man."

"If Tanya and you had a son, I would make a horticulturist of him," he
said, after a moment''s thought. "However, this is idle dreaming.
Goodnight."

Left alone, Kovrin settled himself more comfortably on the sofa and took
up the articles. The title of one was "On Intercropping"; of another, "A
few Words on the Remarks of Monsieur Z. concerning the Trenching of the
Soil for a New Garden"; a third, "Additional Matter concerning Grafting
with a Dormant Bud"; and they were all of the same sort. But what a
restless, jerky tone! What nervous, almost hysterical passion! Here was
an article, one would have thought, with most peaceable and impersonal
contents: the subject of it was the Russian Antonovsky Apple. But Yegor
Semyonitch began it with "Audiatur altera pars," and finished it with
"Sapienti sat"; and between these two quotations a perfect torrent of
venomous phrases directed "at the learned ignorance of our recognised
horticultural authorities, who observe Nature from the height of their
university chairs," or at Monsieur Gaucher, "whose success has been the
work of the vulgar and the dilettanti." And then followed an
inappropriate, affected, and insincere regret that peasants who stole
fruit and broke the branches could not nowadays be flogged.

"It is beautiful, charming, healthy work, but even in this there is
strife and passion," thought Kovrin, "I suppose that everywhere and in
all careers men of ideas are nervous, and marked by exaggerated
sensitiveness. Most likely it must be so."

He thought of Tanya, who was so pleased with Yegor Semyonitch''s
articles. Small, pale, and so thin that her shoulder-blades stuck out,
her eyes, wide and open, dark and intelligent, had an intent gaze, as
though looking for something. She walked like her father with a little
hurried step. She talked a great deal and was fond of arguing,
accompanying every phrase, however insignificant, with expressive
mimicry and gesticulation. No doubt she was nervous in the extreme.

Kovrin went on reading the articles, but he understood nothing of them,
and flung them aside. The same pleasant excitement with which he had
earlier in the evening danced the mazurka and listened to the music was
now mastering him again and rousing a multitude of thoughts. He got up
and began walking about the room, thinking about the black monk. It
occurred to him that if this strange, supernatural monk had appeared to
him only, that meant that he was ill and had reached the point of having
hallucinations. This reflection frightened him, but not for long.

"But I am all right, and I am doing no harm to any one; so there is no
harm in my hallucinations," he thought; and he felt happy again.

He sat down on the sofa and clasped his hands round his head.
Restraining the unaccountable joy which filled his whole being, he then
paced up and down again, and sat down to his work. But the thought that
he read in the book did not satisfy him. He wanted something gigantic,
unfathomable, stupendous. Towards morning he undressed and reluctantly
went to bed: he ought to sleep.

When he heard the footsteps of Yegor Semyonitch going out into the
garden, Kovrin rang the bell and asked the footman to bring him some
wine. He drank several glasses of Lafitte, then wrapped himself up, head
and all; his consciousness grew clouded and he fell asleep.

They quarrelled about something that morning. Tanya burst out crying and
went to her room. She would not come down to dinner nor to tea. At first
Yegor Semyonitch went about looking sulky and dignified, as though to
give every one to understand that for him the claims of justice and good
order were more important than anything else in the world; but he could
not keep it up for long, and soon sank into depression. He walked about
the park dejectedly, continually sighing: "Oh, my God! My God!" and at
dinner did not eat a morsel. At last, guilty and conscience-stricken, he
knocked at the locked door and called timidly:

The depression of the master and mistress was reflected in the whole
household, even in the labourers working in the garden. Kovrin was
absorbed in his interesting work, but at last he, too, felt dreary and
uncomfortable. To dissipate the general ill-humour in some way, he made
up his mind to intervene, and towards evening he knocked at Tanya''s
door. He was admitted.

"Fie, fie, for shame!" he began playfully, looking with surprise at
Tanya''s tear-stained, woebegone face, flushed in patches with crying.
"Is it really so serious? Fie, fie!"

"But if you knew how he tortures me!" she said, and floods of scalding
tears streamed from her big eyes. "He torments me to death," she went
on, wringing her hands. "I said nothing to him ... nothing ... I only
said that there was no need to keep ... too many labourers ... if we
could hire them by the day when we wanted them. You know ... you know
the labourers have been doing nothing for a whole week.... I ... I ...
only said that, and he shouted and ... said ... a lot of horrible
insulting things to me. What for?"

"There, there," said Kovrin, smoothing her hair. "You''ve quarrelled with
each other, you''ve cried, and that''s enough. You must not be angry for
long—that''s wrong ... all the more as he loves you beyond everything."

"He has ... has spoiled my whole life," Tanya went on, sobbing. "I hear
nothing but abuse and ... insults. He thinks I am of no use in the
house. Well! He is right. I shall go away to-morrow; I shall become a
telegraph clerk.... I don''t care...."

"Come, come, come.... You mustn''t cry, Tanya. You mustn''t, dear.... You
are both hot-tempered and irritable, and you are both to blame. Come
along; I will reconcile you."

Kovrin talked affectionately and persuasively, while she went on crying,
twitching her shoulders and wringing her hands, as though some terrible
misfortune had really befallen her. He felt all the sorrier for her
because her grief was not a serious one, yet she suffered extremely.
What trivialities were enough to make this little creature miserable for
a whole day, perhaps for her whole life! Comforting Tanya, Kovrin
thought that, apart from this girl and her father, he might hunt the
world over and would not find people who would love him as one of
themselves, as one of their kindred. If it had not been for those two he
might very likely, having lost his father and mother in early childhood,
never to the day of his death have known what was meant by genuine
affection and that naÃ¯ve, uncritical love which is only lavished on very
close blood relations; and he felt that the nerves of this weeping,
shaking girl responded to his half-sick, overstrained nerves like iron
to a magnet. He never could have loved a healthy, strong, rosy-cheeked
woman, but pale, weak, unhappy Tanya attracted him.

And he liked stroking her hair and her shoulders, pressing her hand and
wiping away her tears.... At last she left off crying. She went on for a
long time complaining of her father and her hard, insufferable life in
that house, entreating Kovrin to put himself in her place; then she
began, little by little, smiling, and sighing that God had given her
such a bad temper. At last, laughing aloud, she called herself a fool,
and ran out of the room.

When a little later Kovrin went into the garden, Yegor Semyonitch and
Tanya were walking side by side along an avenue as though nothing had
happened, and both were eating rye bread with salt on it, as both were
hungry.

Glad that he had been so successful in the part of peacemaker, Kovrin
went into the park. Sitting on a garden seat, thinking, he heard the
rattle of a carriage and a feminine laugh—visitors were arriving. When
the shades of evening began falling on the garden, the sounds of the
violin and singing voices reached him indistinctly, and that reminded
him of the black monk. Where, in what land or in what planet, was that
optical absurdity moving now?

Hardly had he recalled the legend and pictured in his imagination the
dark apparition he had seen in the rye-field, when, from behind a
pine-tree exactly opposite, there came out noiselessly, without the
slightest rustle, a man of medium height with uncovered grey head, all
in black, and barefooted like a beggar, and his black eyebrows stood out
conspicuously on his pale, death-like face. Nodding his head graciously,
this beggar or pilgrim came noiselessly to the seat and sat down, and
Kovrin recognised him as the black monk.

For a minute they looked at one another, Kovrin with amazement, and the
monk with friendliness, and, just as before, a little slyness, as though
he were thinking something to himself.

"But you are a mirage," said Kovrin. "Why are you here and sitting
still? That does not fit in with the legend."

"That does not matter," the monk answered in a low voice, not
immediately turning his face towards him. "The legend, the mirage, and I
are all the products of your excited imagination. I am a phantom."

"You can think as you like," said the monk, with a faint smile. "I exist
in your imagination, and your imagination is part of nature, so I exist
in nature."

"You have a very old, wise, and extremely expressive face, as though you
really had lived more than a thousand years," said Kovrin. "I did not
know that my imagination was capable of creating such phenomena. But why
do you look at me with such enthusiasm? Do you like me?"

"Yes, you are one of those few who are justly called the chosen of God.
You do the service of eternal truth. Your thoughts, your designs, the
marvellous studies you are engaged in, and all your life, bear the
Divine, the heavenly stamp, seeing that they are consecrated to the
rational and the beautiful—that is, to what is eternal."

"You said ''eternal truth.'' ... But is eternal truth of use to man and
within his reach, if there is no eternal life?"

"Yes, of course. A grand, brilliant future is in store for you men. And
the more there are like you on earth, the sooner will this future be
realised. Without you who serve the higher principle and live in full
understanding and freedom, mankind would be of little account;
developing in a natural way, it would have to wait a long time for the
end of its earthly history. You will lead it some thousands of years
earlier into the kingdom of eternal truth—and therein lies your supreme
service. You are the incarnation of the blessing of God, which rests
upon men."

"As of all life—enjoyment. True enjoyment lies in knowledge, and
eternal life provides innumerable and inexhaustible sources of
knowledge, and in that sense it has been said: ''In My Father''s house
there are many mansions.''"

"If only you knew how pleasant it is to hear you!" said Kovrin, rubbing
his hands with satisfaction.

"But I know that when you go away I shall be worried by the question of
your reality. You are a phantom, an hallucination. So I am mentally
deranged, not normal?"

"What if you are? Why trouble yourself? You are ill because you have
overworked and exhausted yourself, and that means that you have
sacrificed your health to the idea, and the time is near at hand when
you will give up life itself to it. What could be better? That is the
goal towards which all divinely endowed, noble natures strive."

"And are you sure that the men of genius, whom all men trust, did not
see phantoms, too? The learned say now that genius is allied to madness.
My friend, healthy and normal people are only the common herd.
Reflections upon the neurasthenia of the age, nervous exhaustion and
degeneracy, et cetera, can only seriously agitate those who place the
object of life in the present—that is, the common herd."

"Not everything the Greeks and the Romans said is true. Exaltation,
enthusiasm, ecstasy—all that distinguishes prophets, poets, martyrs for
the idea, from the common folk—is repellent to the animal side of
man—that is, his physical health. I repeat, if you want to be healthy
and normal, go to the common herd."

"Strange that you repeat what often comes into my mind," said Kovrin.
"It is as though you had seen and overheard my secret thoughts. But
don''t let us talk about me. What do you mean by ''eternal truth''?"

The monk did not answer. Kovrin looked at him and could not distinguish
his face. His features grew blurred and misty. Then the monk''s head and
arms disappeared; his body seemed merged into the seat and the evening
twilight, and he vanished altogether.

He went back to the house, light-hearted and happy. The little the monk
had said to him had flattered, not his vanity, but his whole soul, his
whole being. To be one of the chosen, to serve eternal truth, to stand
in the ranks of those who could make mankind worthy of the kingdom of
God some thousands of years sooner—that is, to free men from some
thousands of years of unnecessary struggle, sin, and suffering; to
sacrifice to the idea everything—youth, strength, health; to be ready
to die for the common weal—what an exalted, what a happy lot! He
recalled his past—pure, chaste, laborious; he remembered what he had
learned himself and what he had taught to others, and decided that there
was no exaggeration in the monk''s words.

"Are you here?" she said. "And we have been looking and looking for
you.... But what is the matter with you?" she asked in wonder, glancing
at his radiant, ecstatic face and eyes full of tears. "How strange you
are, Andryusha!"

"I am pleased, Tanya," said Kovrin, laying his hand on her shoulders. "I
am more than pleased: I am happy. Tanya, darling Tanya, you are an
extraordinary, nice creature. Dear Tanya, I am so glad, I am so glad!"

"I have just passed through an exalted, wonderful, unearthly moment. But
I can''t tell you all about it or you would call me mad and not believe
me. Let us talk of you. Dear, delightful Tanya! I love you, and am used
to loving you. To have you near me, to meet you a dozen times a day, has
become a necessity of my existence; I don''t know how I shall get on
without you when I go back home."

"Oh," laughed Tanya, "you will forget about us in two days. We are
humble people and you are a great man."

"No; let us talk in earnest!" he said. "I shall take you with me, Tanya.
Yes? Will you come with me? Will you be mine?"

"Come," said Tanya, and tried to laugh again, but the laugh would not
come, and patches of colour came into her face.

She began breathing quickly and walked very quickly, but not to the
house, but further into the park.

"I want a love that will dominate me altogether; and that love only you,
Tanya, can give me. I am happy! I am happy!"

She was overwhelmed, and huddling and shrinking together, seemed ten
years older all at once, while he thought her beautiful and expressed
his rapture aloud:

Learning from Kovrin that not only a romance had been got up, but that
there would even be a wedding, Yegor Semyonitch spent a long time in
pacing from one corner of the room to the other, trying to conceal his
agitation. His hands began trembling, his neck swelled and turned
purple, he ordered his racing droshky and drove off somewhere. Tanya,
seeing how he lashed the horse, and seeing how he pulled his cap over
his ears, understood what he was feeling, shut herself up in her room,
and cried the whole day.

In the hot-houses the peaches and plums were already ripe; the packing
and sending off of these tender and fragile goods to Moscow took a great
deal of care, work, and trouble. Owing to the fact that the summer was
very hot and dry, it was necessary to water every tree, and a great deal
of time and labour was spent on doing it. Numbers of caterpillars made
their appearance, which, to Kovrin''s disgust, the labourers and even
Yegor Semyonitch and Tanya squashed with their fingers. In spite of all
that, they had already to book autumn orders for fruit and trees, and to
carry on a great deal of correspondence. And at the very busiest time,
when no one seemed to have a free moment, the work of the fields carried
off more than half their labourers from the garden. Yegor Semyonitch,
sunburnt, exhausted, ill-humoured, galloped from the fields to the
garden and back again; cried that he was being torn to pieces, and that
he should put a bullet through his brains.

Then came the fuss and worry of the trousseau, to which the Pesotskys
attached a good deal of importance. Every one''s head was in a whirl from
the snipping of the scissors, the rattle of the sewing-machine, the
smell of hot irons, and the caprices of the dressmaker, a huffy and
nervous lady. And, as ill-luck would have it, visitors came every day,
who had to be entertained, fed, and even put up for the night. But all
this hard labour passed unnoticed as though in a fog. Tanya felt that
love and happiness had taken her unawares, though she had, since she was
fourteen, for some reason been convinced that Kovrin would marry her and
no one else. She was bewildered, could not grasp it, could not believe
herself.... At one minute such joy would swoop down upon her that she
longed to fly away to the clouds and there pray to God, at another
moment she would remember that in August she would have to part from her
home and leave her father; or, goodness knows why, the idea would occur
to her that she was worthless—insignificant and unworthy of a great man
like Kovrin—and she would go to her room, lock herself in, and cry
bitterly for several hours. When there were visitors, she would suddenly
fancy that Kovrin looked extraordinarily handsome, and that all the
women were in love with him and envying her, and her soul was filled
with pride and rapture, as though she had vanquished the whole world;
but he had only to smile politely at any young lady for her to be
trembling with jealousy, to retreat to her room—and tears again. These
new sensations mastered her completely; she helped her father
mechanically, without noticing peaches, caterpillars or labourers, or
how rapidly the time was passing.

It was almost the same with Yegor Semyonitch. He worked from morning
till night, was always in a hurry, was irritable, and flew into rages,
but all of this was in a sort of spellbound dream. It seemed as though
there were two men in him: one was the real Yegor Semyonitch, who was
moved to indignation, and clutched his head in despair when he heard of
some irregularity from Ivan Karlovitch the gardener; and another—not
the real one—who seemed as though he were half drunk, would interrupt a
business conversation at half a word, touch the gardener on the
shoulder, and begin muttering:

"Say what you like, there is a great deal in blood. His mother was a
wonderful woman, most high-minded and intelligent. It was a pleasure to
look at her good, candid, pure face; it was like the face of an angel.
She drew splendidly, wrote verses, spoke five foreign languages,
sang.... Poor thing! she died of consumption. The Kingdom of Heaven be
hers."

"When he was a boy and growing up in my house, he had the same angelic
face, good and candid. The way he looks and talks and moves is as soft
and elegant as his mother''s. And his intellect! We were always struck
with his intelligence. To be sure, it''s not for nothing he''s a Master of
Arts! It''s not for nothing! And wait a bit, Ivan Karlovitch, what will
he be in ten years'' time? He will be far above us!"

But at this point the real Yegor Semyonitch, suddenly coming to himself,
would make a terrible face, would clutch his head and cry:

"The devils! They have spoilt everything! They have ruined everything!
They have spoilt everything! The garden''s done for, the garden''s
ruined!"

Kovrin, meanwhile, worked with the same ardour as before, and did not
notice the general commotion. Love only added fuel to the flames. After
every talk with Tanya he went to his room, happy and triumphant, took up
his book or his manuscript with the same passion with which he had just
kissed Tanya and told her of his love. What the black monk had told him
of the chosen of God, of eternal truth, of the brilliant future of
mankind and so on, gave peculiar and extraordinary significance to his
work, and filled his soul with pride and the consciousness of his own
exalted consequence. Once or twice a week, in the park or in the house,
he met the black monk and had long conversations with him, but this did
not alarm him, but, on the contrary, delighted him, as he was now firmly
persuaded that such apparitions only visited the elect few who rise up
above their fellows and devote themselves to the service of the idea.

One day the monk appeared at dinner-time and sat in the dining-room
window. Kovrin was delighted, and very adroitly began a conversation
with Yegor Semyonitch and Tanya of what might be of interest to the
monk; the black-robed visitor listened and nodded his head graciously,
and Yegor Semyonitch and Tanya listened, too, and smiled gaily without
suspecting that Kovrin was not talking to them but to his hallucination.

Imperceptibly the fast of the Assumption was approaching, and soon after
came the wedding, which, at Yegor Semyonitch''s urgent desire, was
celebrated with "a flourish"—that is, with senseless festivities that
lasted for two whole days and nights. Three thousand roubles'' worth of
food and drink was consumed, but the music of the wretched hired band,
the noisy toasts, the scurrying to and fro of the footmen, the uproar
and crowding, prevented them from appreciating the taste of the
expensive wines and wonderful delicacies ordered from Moscow.

One long winter night Kovrin was lying in bed, reading a French novel.
Poor Tanya, who had headaches in the evenings from living in town, to
which she was not accustomed, had been asleep a long while, and, from
time to time, articulated some incoherent phrase in her restless dreams.

It struck three o''clock. Kovrin put out the light and lay down to sleep,
lay for a long time with his eyes closed, but could not get to sleep
because, as he fancied, the room was very hot and Tanya talked in her
sleep. At half-past four he lighted the candle again, and this time he
saw the black monk sitting in an arm-chair near the bed.

"Of fame," answered Kovrin. "In the French novel I have just been
reading, there is a description of a young savant, who does silly
things and pines away through worrying about fame. I can''t understand
such anxiety."

"Because you are wise. Your attitude towards fame is one of
indifference, as towards a toy which no longer interests you."

"Renown does not allure you now. What is there flattering, amusing, or
edifying in their carving your name on a tombstone, then time rubbing
off the inscription together with the gilding? Moreover, happily there
are too many of you for the weak memory of mankind to be able to retain
your names."

"Of course," assented Kovrin. "Besides, why should they be remembered?
But let us talk of something else. Of happiness, for instance. What is
happiness?"

When the clock struck five, he was sitting on the bed, dangling his feet
to the carpet, talking to the monk:

"In ancient times a happy man grew at last frightened of his happiness
—it was so great!—and to propitiate the gods he brought as a sacrifice
his favourite ring. Do you know, I, too, like Polykrates, begin to be
uneasy of my happiness. It seems strange to me that from morning to
night I feel nothing but joy; it fills my whole being and smothers all
other feelings. I don''t know what sadness, grief, or boredom is. Here I
am not asleep; I suffer from sleeplessness, but I am not dull. I say it
in earnest; I begin to feel perplexed."

"But why?" the monk asked in wonder. "Is joy a supernatural feeling?
Ought it not to be the normal state of man? The more highly a man is
developed on the intellectual and moral side, the more independent he
is, the more pleasure life gives him. Socrates, Diogenes, and Marcus
Aurelius, were joyful, not sorrowful. And the Apostle tells us: ''Rejoice
continually''; ''Rejoice and be glad.''"

"But will the gods be suddenly wrathful?" Kovrin jested; and he laughed.
"If they take from me comfort and make me go cold and hungry, it won''t
be very much to my taste."

Meanwhile Tanya woke up and looked with amazement and horror at her
husband. He was talking, addressing the arm-chair, laughing and
gesticulating; his eyes were gleaming, and there was something strange
in his laugh.

"Andryusha, whom are you talking to?" she asked, clutching the hand he
stretched out to the monk. "Andryusha! Whom?"

"Oh! Whom?" said Kovrin in confusion. "Why, to him.... He is sitting
here," he said, pointing to the black monk.

Tanya put her arm round her husband and held him tight, as though
protecting him from the apparition, and put her hand over his eyes.

"You are ill!" she sobbed, trembling all over. "Forgive me, my precious,
my dear one, but I have noticed for a long time that your mind is
clouded in some way.... You are mentally ill, Andryusha...."

Her trembling infected him, too. He glanced once more at the arm-chair,
which was now empty, felt a sudden weakness in his arms and legs, was
frightened, and began dressing.

"It''s nothing, Tanya; it''s nothing," he muttered, shivering. "I really
am not quite well ... it''s time to admit that."

"I have noticed it for a long time ... and father has noticed it," she
said, trying to suppress her sobs. "You talk to yourself, smile somehow
strangely ... and can''t sleep. Oh, my God, my God, save us!" she said in
terror. "But don''t be frightened, Andryusha; for God''s sake don''t be
frightened...."

She began dressing, too. Only now, looking at her, Kovrin realised the
danger of his position—realised the meaning of the black monk and his
conversations with him. It was clear to him now that he was mad.

Neither of them knew why they dressed and went into the dining-room: she
in front and he following her. There they found Yegor Semyonitch
standing in his dressing-gown and with a candle in his hand. He was
staying with them, and had been awakened by Tanya''s sobs.

"Don''t be frightened, Andryusha," Tanya was saying, shivering as though
in a fever; "don''t be frightened.... Father, it will all pass over ...
it will all pass over...."

Kovrin was too much agitated to speak. He wanted to say to his
father-in-law in a playful tone: "Congratulate me; it appears I have
gone out of my mind"; but he could only move his lips and smile
bitterly.

At nine o''clock in the morning they put on his jacket and fur coat,
wrapped him up in a shawl, and took him in a carriage to a doctor.

Summer had come again, and the doctor advised their going into the
country. Kovrin had recovered; he had left off seeing the black monk,
and he had only to get up his strength. Staying at his father-in-law''s,
he drank a great deal of milk, worked for only two hours out of the
twenty-four, and neither smoked nor drank wine.

On the evening before Elijah''s Day they had an evening service in the
house. When the deacon was handing the priest the censer the immense old
room smelt like a graveyard, and Kovrin felt bored. He went out into the
garden. Without noticing the gorgeous flowers, he walked about the
garden, sat down on a seat, then strolled about the park; reaching the
river, he went down and then stood lost in thought, looking at the
water. The sullen pines with their shaggy roots, which had seen him a
year before so young, so joyful and confident, were not whispering now,
but standing mute and motionless, as though they did not recognise him.
And, indeed, his head was closely cropped, his beautiful long hair was
gone, his step was lagging, his face was fuller and paler than last
summer.

He crossed by the footbridge to the other side. Where the year before
there had been rye the oats stood, reaped, and lay in rows. The sun had
set and there was a broad stretch of glowing red on the horizon, a sign
of windy weather next day. It was still. Looking in the direction from
which the year before the black monk had first appeared, Kovrin stood
for twenty minutes, till the evening glow had begun to fade....

When, listless and dissatisfied, he returned home the service was over.
Yegor Semyonitch and Tanya were sitting on the steps of the verandah,
drinking tea. They were talking of something, but, seeing Kovrin, ceased
at once, and he concluded from their faces that their talk had been
about him.

"No, it is not time yet ..." he said, sitting down on the bottom step.
"Drink it yourself; I don''t want it."

"Yes, a great deal of good!" Kovrin laughed. "I congratulate you: I have
gained a pound in weight since Friday." He pressed his head tightly in
his hands and said miserably: "Why, why have you cured me? Preparations
of bromide, idleness, hot baths, supervision, cowardly consternation at
every mouthful, at every step—all this will reduce me at last to
idiocy. I went out of my mind, I had megalomania; but then I was
cheerful, confident, and even happy; I was interesting and original. Now
I have become more sensible and stolid, but I am just like every one
else: I am—mediocrity; I am weary of life.... Oh, how cruelly you have
treated me!... I saw hallucinations, but what harm did that do to any
one? I ask, what harm did that do any one?"

"Goodness knows what you are saying!" sighed Yegor Semyonitch. "It''s
positively wearisome to listen to it."

The presence of other people, especially Yegor Semyonitch, irritated
Kovrin now; he answered him drily, coldly, and even rudely, never looked
at him but with irony and hatred, while Yegor Semyonitch was overcome
with confusion and cleared his throat guiltily, though he was not
conscious of any fault in himself. At a loss to understand why their
charming and affectionate relations had changed so abruptly, Tanya
huddled up to her father and looked anxiously in his face; she wanted to
understand and could not understand, and all that was clear to her was
that their relations were growing worse and worse every day, that of
late her father had begun to look much older, and her husband had grown
irritable, capricious, quarrelsome and uninteresting. She could not
laugh or sing; at dinner she ate nothing; did not sleep for nights
together, expecting something awful, and was so worn out that on one
occasion she lay in a dead faint from dinner-time till evening. During
the service she thought her father was crying, and now while the three
of them were sitting together on the terrace she made an effort not to
think of it.

"How fortunate Buddha, Mahomed, and Shakespeare were that their kind
relations and doctors did not cure them of their ecstasy and their
inspiration," said Kovrin. "If Mahomed had taken bromide for his nerves,
had worked only two hours out of the twenty-four, and had drunk milk,
that remarkable man would have left no more trace after him than his
dog. Doctors and kind relations will succeed in stupefying mankind, in
making mediocrity pass for genius and in bringing civilisation to ruin.
If only you knew," Kovrin said with annoyance, "how grateful I am to
you."

He felt intense irritation, and to avoid saying too much, he got up
quickly and went into the house. It was still, and the fragrance of the
tobacco plant and the marvel of Peru floated in at the open window. The
moonlight lay in green patches on the floor and on the piano in the big
dark dining-room. Kovrin remembered the raptures of the previous summer
when there had been the same scent of the marvel of Peru and the moon
had shone in at the window. To bring back the mood of last year he went
quickly to his study, lighted a strong cigar, and told the footman to
bring him some wine. But the cigar left a bitter and disgusting taste in
his mouth, and the wine had not the same flavour as it had the year
before. And so great is the effect of giving up a habit, the cigar and
the two gulps of wine made him giddy, and brought on palpitations of the
heart, so that he was obliged to take bromide.

"Father adores you. You are cross with him about something, and it is
killing him. Look at him; he is ageing, not from day to day, but from
hour to hour. I entreat you, Andryusha, for God''s sake, for the sake of
your dead father, for the sake of my peace of mind, be affectionate to
him."

"Because he is antipathetic to me, that''s all," said Kovrin carelessly;
and he shrugged his shoulders. "But we won''t talk about him: he is your
father."

"I can''t understand, I can''t," said Tanya, pressing her hands to her
temples and staring at a fixed point. "Something incomprehensible,
awful, is going on in the house. You have changed, grown unlike
yourself.... You, clever, extraordinary man as you are, are irritated
over trifles, meddle in paltry nonsense.... Such trivial things excite
you, that sometimes one is simply amazed and can''t believe that it is
you. Come, come, don''t be angry, don''t be angry," she went on, kissing
his hands, frightened of her own words. "You are clever, kind, noble.
You will be just to father. He is so good."

"He is not good; he is just good-natured. Burlesque old uncles like your
father, with well-fed, good-natured faces, extraordinarily hospitable
and queer, at one time used to touch me and amuse me in novels and in
farces and in life; now I dislike them. They are egoists to the marrow
of their bones. What disgusts me most of all is their being so well-fed,
and that purely bovine, purely hoggish optimism of a full stomach."

"This is torture," she said, and from her voice it was evident that she
was utterly exhausted, and that it was hard for her to speak. "Not one
moment of peace since the winter.... Why, it''s awful! My God! I am
wretched."

His face seemed to Tanya ugly and unpleasant. Hatred and an ironical
expression did not suit him. And, indeed, she had noticed before that
there was something lacking in his face, as though ever since his hair
had been cut his face had changed, too. She wanted to say something
wounding to him, but immediately she caught herself in this antagonistic
feeling, she was frightened and went out of the bedroom.

Kovrin received a professorship at the University. The inaugural address
was fixed for the second of December, and a notice to that effect was
hung up in the corridor at the University. But on the day appointed he
informed the students'' inspector, by telegram, that he was prevented by
illness from giving the lecture.

He had hÃ¦morrhage from the throat. He was often spitting blood, but it
happened two or three times a month that there was a considerable loss
of blood, and then he grew extremely weak and sank into a drowsy
condition. This illness did not particularly frighten him, as he knew
that his mother had lived for ten years or longer suffering from the
same disease, and the doctors assured him that there was no danger, and
had only advised him to avoid excitement, to lead a regular life, and to
speak as little as possible.

In January again his lecture did not take place owing to the same
reason, and in February it was too late to begin the course. It had to
be postponed to the following year.

By now he was living not with Tanya, but with another woman, who was two
years older than he was, and who looked after him as though he were a
baby. He was in a calm and tranquil state of mind; he readily gave in to
her, and when Varvara Nikolaevna—that was the name of his
friend—decided to take him to the Crimea, he agreed, though he had a
presentiment that no good would come of the trip.

They reached Sevastopol in the evening and stopped at an hotel to rest
and go on the next day to Yalta. They were both exhausted by the
journey. Varvara Nikolaevna had some tea, went to bed and was soon
asleep. But Kovrin did not go to bed. An hour before starting for the
station, he had received a letter from Tanya, and had not brought
himself to open it, and now it was lying in his coat pocket, and the
thought of it excited him disagreeably. At the bottom of his heart he
genuinely considered now that his marriage to Tanya had been a mistake.
He was glad that their separation was final, and the thought of that
woman who in the end had turned into a living relic, still walking about
though everything seemed dead in her except her big, staring,
intelligent eyes—the thought of her roused in him nothing but pity and
disgust with himself. The handwriting on the envelope reminded him how
cruel and unjust he had been two years before, how he had worked off his
anger at his spiritual emptiness, his boredom, his loneliness, and his
dissatisfaction with life by revenging himself on people in no way to
blame. He remembered, also, how he had torn up his dissertation and all
the articles he had written during his illness, and how he had thrown
them out of window, and the bits of paper had fluttered in the wind and
caught on the trees and flowers. In every line of them he saw strange,
utterly groundless pretension, shallow defiance, arrogance, megalomania;
and they made him feel as though he were reading a description of his
vices. But when the last manuscript had been torn up and sent flying out
of window, he felt, for some reason, suddenly bitter and angry; he went
to his wife and said a great many unpleasant things to her. My God, how
he had tormented her! One day, wanting to cause her pain, he told her
that her father had played a very unattractive part in their romance,
that he had asked him to marry her. Yegor Semyonitch accidentally
overheard this, ran into the room, and, in his despair, could not utter
a word, could only stamp and make a strange, bellowing sound as though
he had lost the power of speech, and Tanya, looking at her father, had
uttered a heart-rending shriek and had fallen into a swoon. It was
hideous.

All this came back into his memory as he looked at the familiar writing.
Kovrin went out on to the balcony; it was still warm weather and there
was a smell of the sea. The wonderful bay reflected the moonshine and
the lights, and was of a colour for which it was difficult to find a
name. It was a soft and tender blending of dark blue and green; in
places the water was like blue vitriol, and in places it seemed as
though the moonlight were liquefied and filling the bay instead of
water. And what harmony of colours, what an atmosphere of peace, calm,
and sublimity!

In the lower storey under the balcony the windows were probably open,
for women''s voices and laughter could be heard distinctly. Apparently
there was an evening party.

"My father is just dead. I owe that to you, for you have killed him. Our
garden is being ruined; strangers are managing it already—that is, the
very thing is happening that poor father dreaded. That, too, I owe to
you. I hate you with my whole soul, and I hope you may soon perish. Oh,
how wretched I am! Insufferable anguish is burning my soul.... My curses
on you. I took you for an extraordinary man, a genius; I loved you, and
you have turned out a madman...."

Kovrin could read no more, he tore up the letter and threw it away. He
was overcome by an uneasiness that was akin to terror. Varvara
Nikolaevna was asleep behind the screen, and he could hear her
breathing. From the lower storey came the sounds of laughter and women''s
voices, but he felt as though in the whole hotel there were no living
soul but him. Because Tanya, unhappy, broken by sorrow, had cursed him
in her letter and hoped for his perdition, he felt eerie and kept
glancing hurriedly at the door, as though he were afraid that the
uncomprehended force which two years before had wrought such havoc in
his life and in the life of those near him might come into the room and
master him once more.

He knew by experience that when his nerves were out of hand the best
thing for him to do was to work. He must sit down to the table and force
himself, at all costs, to concentrate his mind on some one thought. He
took from his red portfolio a manuscript containing a sketch of a small
work of the nature of a compilation, which he had planned in case he
should find it dull in the Crimea without work. He sat down to the table
and began working at this plan, and it seemed to him that his calm,
peaceful, indifferent mood was coming back. The manuscript with the
sketch even led him to meditation on the vanity of the world. He thought
how much life exacts for the worthless or very commonplace blessings it
can give a man. For instance, to gain, before forty, a university chair,
to be an ordinary professor, to expound ordinary and second-hand
thoughts in dull, heavy, insipid language—in fact, to gain the position
of a mediocre learned man, he, Kovrin, had had to study for fifteen
years, to work day and night, to endure a terrible mental illness, to
experience an unhappy marriage, and to do a great number of stupid and
unjust things which it would have been pleasant not to remember. Kovrin
recognised clearly, now, that he was a mediocrity, and readily resigned
himself to it, as he considered that every man ought to be satisfied
with what he is.

The plan of the volume would have soothed him completely, but the torn
letter showed white on the floor and prevented him from concentrating
his attention. He got up from the table, picked up the pieces of the
letter and threw them out of window, but there was a light wind blowing
from the sea, and the bits of paper were scattered on the windowsill.
Again he was overcome by uneasiness akin to terror, and he felt as
though in the whole hotel there were no living soul but himself.... He
went out on the balcony. The bay, like a living thing, looked at him
with its multitude of light blue, dark blue, turquoise and fiery eyes,
and seemed beckoning to him. And it really was hot and oppressive, and
it would not have been amiss to have a bathe.

Suddenly in the lower storey under the balcony a violin began playing,
and two soft feminine voices began singing. It was something familiar.
The song was about a maiden, full of sick fancies, who heard one night
in her garden mysterious sounds, so strange and lovely that she was
obliged to recognise them as a holy harmony which is unintelligible to
us mortals, and so flies back to heaven.... Kovrin caught his breath and
there was a pang of sadness at his heart, and a thrill of the sweet,
exquisite delight he had so long forgotten began to stir in his breast.

A tall black column, like a whirlwind or a waterspout, appeared on the
further side of the bay. It moved with fearful rapidity across the bay,
towards the hotel, growing smaller and darker as it came, and Kovrin
only just had time to get out of the way to let it pass.... The monk
with bare grey head, black eyebrows, barefoot, his arms crossed over his
breast, floated by him, and stood still in the middle of the room.

"Why did you not believe me?" he asked reproachfully, looking
affectionately at Kovrin. "If you had believed me then, that you were a
genius, you would not have spent these two years so gloomily and so
wretchedly."

Kovrin already believed that he was one of God''s chosen and a genius; he
vividly recalled his conversations with the monk in the past and tried
to speak, but the blood flowed from his throat on to his breast, and not
knowing what he was doing, he passed his hands over his breast, and his
cuffs were soaked with blood. He tried to call Varvara Nikolaevna, who
was asleep behind the screen; he made an effort and said:

He called Tanya, called to the great garden with the gorgeous flowers
sprinkled with dew, called to the park, the pines with their shaggy
roots, the rye-field, his marvellous learning, his youth, courage,
joy—called to life, which was so lovely. He saw on the floor near his
face a great pool of blood, and was too weak to utter a word, but an
unspeakable, infinite happiness flooded his whole being. Below, under
the balcony, they were playing the serenade, and the black monk
whispered to him that he was a genius, and that he was dying only
because his frail human body had lost its balance and could no longer
serve as the mortal garb of genius.

When Varvara Nikolaevna woke up and came out from behind the screen,
Kovrin was dead, and a blissful smile was set upon his face.

AT five o''clock one Sunday afternoon in summer, Volodya, a plain, shy,
sickly-looking lad of seventeen, was sitting in the arbour of the
Shumihins'' country villa, feeling dreary. His despondent thought flowed
in three directions. In the first place, he had next day, Monday, an
examination in mathematics; he knew that if he did not get through the
written examination on the morrow, he would be expelled, for he had
already been two years in the sixth form and had two and three-quarter
marks for algebra in his annual report. In the second place, his
presence at the villa of the Shumihins, a wealthy family with
aristocratic pretensions, was a continual source of mortification to his
amour-propre. It seemed to him that Madame Shumihin looked upon him
and his maman as poor relations and dependents, that they laughed at his
maman and did not respect her. He had on one occasion accidently
overheard Madame Shumihin, in the verandah, telling her cousin Anna
Fyodorovna that his maman still tried to look young and got herself
up, that she never paid her losses at cards, and had a partiality for
other people''s shoes and tobacco. Every day Volodya besought his maman
not to go to the Shumihins'', and drew a picture of the humiliating part
she played with these gentlefolk. He tried to persuade her, said rude
things, but she—a frivolous, pampered woman, who had run through two
fortunes, her own and her husband''s, in her time, and always gravitated
towards acquaintances of high rank—did not understand him, and twice a
week Volodya had to accompany her to the villa he hated.

In the third place, the youth could not for one instant get rid of a
strange, unpleasant feeling which was absolutely new to him.... It
seemed to him that he was in love with Anna Fyodorovna, the Shumihins''
cousin, who was staying with them. She was a vivacious, loud-voiced,
laughter-loving, healthy, and vigorous lady of thirty, with rosy cheeks,
plump shoulders, a plump round chin and a continual smile on her thin
lips. She was neither young nor beautiful—Volodya knew that perfectly
well; but for some reason he could not help thinking of her, looking at
her while she shrugged her plump shoulders and moved her flat back as
she played croquet, or after prolonged laughter and running up and down
stairs, sank into a low chair, and, half closing her eyes and gasping
for breath, pretended that she was stifling and could not breathe. She
was married. Her husband, a staid and dignified architect, came once a
week to the villa, slept soundly, and returned to town. Volodya''s
strange feeling had begun with his conceiving an unaccountable hatred
for the architect, and feeling relieved every time he went back to town.

Now, sitting in the arbour, thinking of his examination next day, and of
his maman, at whom they laughed, he felt an intense desire to see
Nyuta (that was what the Shumihins called Anna Fyodorovna), to hear her
laughter and the rustle of her dress.... This desire was not like the
pure, poetic love of which he read in novels and about which he dreamed
every night when he went to bed; it was strange, incomprehensible; he
was ashamed of it, and afraid of it as of something very wrong and
impure, something which it was disagreeable to confess even to himself.

"It''s not love," he said to himself. "One can''t fall in love with women
of thirty who are married. It is only a little intrigue.... Yes, an
intrigue...."

Pondering on the "intrigue," he thought of his uncontrollable shyness,
his lack of moustache, his freckles, his narrow eyes, and put himself in
his imagination side by side with Nyuta, and the juxtaposition seemed to
him impossible; then he made haste to imagine himself bold, handsome,
witty, dressed in the latest fashion.

When his dreams were at their height, as he sat huddled together and
looking at the ground in a dark corner of the arbour, he heard the sound
of light footsteps. Some one was coming slowly along the avenue. Soon
the steps stopped and something white gleamed in the entrance.

"Who is here?" asked Nyuta, going into the arbour. "Ah, it is you,
Volodya? What are you doing here? Thinking? And how can you go on
thinking, thinking, thinking?... That''s the way to go out of your mind!"

Volodya got up and looked in a dazed way at Nyuta. She had only just
come back from bathing. Over her shoulder there was hanging a sheet and
a rough towel, and from under the white silk kerchief on her head he
could see the wet hair sticking to her forehead. There was the cool damp
smell of the bath-house and of almond soap still hanging about her. She
was out of breath from running quickly. The top button of her blouse was
undone, so that the boy saw her throat and bosom.

"Why don''t you say something?" said Nyuta, looking Volodya up and down.
"It''s not polite to be silent when a lady talks to you. What a clumsy
seal you are though, Volodya! You always sit, saying nothing, thinking
like some philosopher. There''s not a spark of life or fire in you! You
are really horrid!... At your age you ought to be living, skipping, and
jumping, chattering, flirting, falling in love."

"He''s mute," said Nyuta, with wonder; "it is strange, really.... Listen!
Be a man! Come, you might smile at least! Phew, the horrid philosopher!"
she laughed. "But do you know, Volodya, why you are such a clumsy seal?
Because you don''t devote yourself to the ladies. Why don''t you? It''s
true there are no girls here, but there is nothing to prevent your
flirting with the married ladies! Why don''t you flirt with me, for
instance?"

"It''s only very proud people who are silent and love solitude," Nyuta
went on, pulling his hand away from his forehead. "You are proud,
Volodya. Why do you look at me like that from under your brows? Look me
straight in the face, if you please! Yes, now then, clumsy seal!"

Volodya made up his mind to speak. Wanting to smile, he twitched his
lower lip, blinked, and again put his hand to his forehead.

"What do I hear?" she sang, as prima-donnas sing at the opera when they
hear something awful. "What? What did you say? Say it again, say it
again...."

And without his will''s having any part in his action, without reflection
or understanding, he took half a step towards Nyuta and clutched her by
the arm. Everything was dark before his eyes, and tears came into them.
The whole world was turned into one big, rough towel which smelt of the
bathhouse.

Seeing that he was not prevented from holding her arm, Volodya glanced
at Nyuta''s laughing face, and clumsily, awkwardly, put both arms round
her waist, his hands meeting behind her back. He held her round the
waist with both arms, while, putting her hands up to her head, showing
the dimples in her elbows, she set her hair straight under the kerchief
and said in a calm voice:

"You must be tactful, polite, charming, and you can only become that
under feminine influence. But what a wicked, angry face you have! You
must talk, laugh.... Yes, Volodya, don''t be surly; you are young and
will have plenty of time for philosophising. Come, let go of me; I am
going. Let go."

Without effort she released her waist, and, humming something, walked
out of the arbour. Volodya was left alone. He smoothed his hair, smiled,
and walked three times to and fro across the arbour, then he sat down on
the bench and smiled again. He felt insufferably ashamed, so much so
that he wondered that human shame could reach such a pitch of acuteness
and intensity. Shame made him smile, gesticulate, and whisper some
disconnected words.

He was ashamed that he had been treated like a small boy, ashamed of his
shyness, and, most of all, that he had had the audacity to put his arms
round the waist of a respectable married woman, though, as it seemed to
him, he had neither through age nor by external quality, nor by social
position any right to do so.

He jumped up, went out of the arbour, and, without looking round, walked
into the recesses of the garden furthest from the house.

"Ah! only to get away from here as soon as possible," he thought,
clutching his head. "My God! as soon as possible."

The train by which Volodya was to go back with his maman was at
eight-forty. There were three hours before the train started, but he
would with pleasure have gone to the station at once without waiting for
his maman.

At eight o''clock he went to the house. His whole figure was expressive
of determination: what would be, would be! He made up his mind to go in
boldly, to look them straight in the face, to speak in a loud voice,
regardless of everything.

He crossed the terrace, the big hall and the drawing-room, and there
stopped to take breath. He could hear them in the dining-room, drinking
tea. Madame Shumihin, maman, and Nyuta were talking and laughing about
something.

"I assure you!" said Nyuta. "I could not believe my eyes! When he began
declaring his passion and—just imagine!—put his arms round my waist, I
should not have recognised him. And you know he has a way with him! When
he told me he was in love with me, there was something brutal in his
face, like a Circassian."

"Really!" gasped maman, going off into a peal of laughter. "Really!
How he does remind me of his father!"

"How could they talk of it aloud!" he wondered in agony, clasping his
hands and looking up to the sky in horror. "They talk aloud in cold
blood ... and maman laughed!... Maman! My God, why didst Thou give
me such a mother? Why?"

But he had to go to the house, come what might. He walked three times up
and down the avenue, grew a little calmer, and went into the house.

"I am sorry, it''s ... it''s time for me to go," he muttered, not raising
his eyes. "Maman, it''s eight o''clock!"

"You go alone, my dear," said his maman languidly. "I am staying the
night with Lili. Goodbye, my dear.... Let me make the sign of the cross
over you."

Saying good-bye after a fashion, without looking any one in the face,
Volodya went out of the dining-room. Ten minutes later he was walking
along the road to the station, and was glad of it. Now he felt neither
frightened nor ashamed; he breathed freely and easily.

About half a mile from the station, he sat down on a stone by the side
of the road, and gazed at the sun, which was half hidden behind a
barrow. There were lights already here and there at the station, and one
green light glimmered dimly, but the train was not yet in sight. It was
pleasant to Volodya to sit still without moving, and to watch the
evening coming little by little. The darkness of the arbour, the
footsteps, the smell of the bath-house, the laughter, and the waist—all
these rose with amazing vividness before his imagination, and all this
was no longer so terrible and important as before.

"It''s of no consequence.... She did not pull her hand away, and laughed
when I held her by the waist," he thought. "So she must have liked it.
If she had disliked it she would have been angry...."

And now Volodya felt sorry that he had not had more boldness there in
the arbour. He felt sorry that he was so stupidly going away, and he was
by now persuaded that if the same thing happened again he would be
bolder and look at it more simply.

And it would not be difficult for the opportunity to occur again. They
used to stroll about for a long time after supper at the Shumihins''. If
Volodya went for a walk with Nyuta in the dark garden, there would be an
opportunity!

"I will go back," he thought, "and will go by the morning train
to-morrow.... I will say I have missed the train."

And he turned back.... Madame Shumihin, Maman, Nyuta, and one of the
nieces were sitting on the verandah, playing vint. When Volodya told
them the lie that he had missed the train, they were uneasy that he
might be late for the examination day, and advised him to get up early.
All the while they were playing he sat on one side, greedily watching
Nyuta and waiting.... He already had a plan prepared in his mind: he
would go up to Nyuta in the dark, would take her by the hand, then would
embrace her; there would be no need to say anything, as both of them
would understand without words.

But after supper the ladies did not go for a walk in the garden, but
went on playing cards. They played till one o''clock at night, and then
broke up to go to bed.

"How stupid it all is!" Volodya thought with vexation as he got into
bed. "But never mind; I''ll wait till to-morrow ... to-morrow in the
arbour. It doesn''t matter...."

He did not attempt to go to sleep, but sat in bed, hugging his knees and
thinking. All thought of the examination was hateful to him. He had
already made up his mind that they would expel him, and that there was
nothing terrible about his being expelled. On the contrary, it was a
good thing—a very good thing, in fact. Next day he would be as free as
a bird; he would put on ordinary clothes instead of his school uniform,
would smoke openly, come out here, and make love to Nyuta when he liked;
and he would not be a schoolboy but "a young man." And as for the rest
of it, what is called a career, a future, that was clear; Volodya would
go into the army or the telegraph service, or he would go into a
chemist''s shop and work his way up till he was a dispenser.... There
were lots of callings. An hour or two passed, and he was still sitting
and thinking....

Towards three o''clock, when it was beginning to get light, the door
creaked cautiously and his maman came into the room.

"Aren''t you asleep?" she asked, yawning. "Go to sleep; I have only come
in for a minute.... I am only fetching the drops...."

She took a bottle of something out of the cupboard, went to the window,
read the label, and went away.

"Marya Leontyevna, those are not the drops!" Volodya heard a woman''s
voice, a minute later. "That''s convallaria, and Lili wants morphine. Is
your son asleep? Ask him to look for it...."

It was Nyuta''s voice. Volodya turned cold. He hurriedly put on his
trousers, flung his coat over his shoulders, and went to the door.

"Do you understand? Morphine," Nyuta explained in a whisper. "There must
be a label in Latin. Wake Volodya; he will find it."

Maman opened the door and Volodya caught sight of Nyuta. She was
wearing the same loose wrapper in which she had gone to bathe. Her hair
hung loose and disordered on her shoulders, her face looked sleepy and
dark in the half-light....

"Why, Volodya is not asleep," she said. "Volodya, look in the cupboard
for the morphine, there''s a dear! What a nuisance Lili is! She has
always something the matter."

Volodya went to the cupboard, knelt down, and began looking through the
bottles and boxes of medicine. His hands were trembling, and he had a
feeling in his chest and stomach as though cold waves were running all
over his inside. He felt suffocated and giddy from the smell of ether,
carbolic acid, and various drugs, which he quite unnecessarily snatched
up with his trembling fingers and spilled in so doing.

"In a minute.... Here, I believe this is morphine," said Volodya,
reading on one of the labels the word "morph...." "Here it is!"

Nyuta was standing in the doorway in such a way that one foot was in his
room and one was in the passage. She was tidying her hair, which was
difficult to put in order because it was so thick and long, and looked
absent-mindedly at Volodya. In her loose wrap, with her sleepy face and
her hair down, in the dim light that came into the white sky not yet lit
by the sun, she seemed to Volodya captivating, magnificent....
Fascinated, trembling all over, and remembering with relish how he had
held that exquisite body in his arms in the arbour, he handed her the
bottle and said:

He was silent and looked at her, then, just as in the arbour, he took
her hand, and she looked at him with a smile and waited for what would
happen next.

"Wait a little; I think somebody is coming. Oh, these schoolboys!" she
said in an undertone, going to the door and peeping out into the
passage. "No, there is no one to be seen...."

Then it seemed to Volodya that the room, Nyuta, the sunrise and
himself—all melted together in one sensation of acute, extraordinary,
incredible bliss, for which one might give up one''s whole life and face
eternal torments.... But half a minute passed and all that vanished.
Volodya saw only a fat, plain face, distorted by an expression of
repulsion, and he himself suddenly felt a loathing for what had
happened.

"I must go away, though," said Nyuta, looking at Volodya with disgust.
"What a wretched, ugly ... fie, ugly duckling!"

"''Ugly duckling'' ..." he thought after she had gone away. "I really am
ugly ... everything is ugly."

The sun was rising, the birds were singing loudly; he could hear the
gardener walking in the garden and the creaking of his wheelbarrow ...
and soon afterwards he heard the lowing of the cows and the sounds of
the shepherd''s pipe. The sunlight and the sounds told him that somewhere
in this world there is a pure, refined, poetical life. But where was it?
Volodya had never heard a word of it from his maman or any of the
people round about him.

Combing his hair before the looking-glass, and looking at his ugly face,
pale from his sleepless night, he thought:

Madame Shumihin and Nyuta waked up at one o''clock. Volodya heard Madame
Shumihin open her window with a bang, heard Nyuta go off into a peal of
laughter in reply to her coarse voice. He saw the door open and a string
of nieces and other toadies (among the latter was his maman) file into
lunch, caught a glimpse of Nyuta''s freshly washed laughing face, and,
beside her, the black brows and beard of her husband the architect, who
had just arrived.

Nyuta was wearing a Little Russian dress which did not suit her at all,
and made her look clumsy; the architect was making dull and vulgar
jokes. The rissoles served at lunch had too much onion in them—so it
seemed to Volodya. It also seemed to him that Nyuta laughed loudly on
purpose, and kept glancing in his direction to give him to understand
that the memory of the night did not trouble her in the least, and that
she was not aware of the presence at table of the "ugly duckling."

At four o''clock Volodya drove to the station with his maman. Foul
memories, the sleepless night, the prospect of expulsion from school,
the stings of conscience—all roused in him now an oppressive, gloomy
anger. He looked at maman''s sharp profile, at her little nose, and at
the raincoat which was a present from Nyuta, and muttered:

"Why do you powder? It''s not becoming at your age! You make yourself up,
don''t pay your debts at cards, smoke other people''s tobacco.... It''s
hateful! I don''t love you ... I don''t love you!"

He was insulting her, and she moved her little eyes about in alarm,
flung up her hands, and whispered in horror:

"What are you saying, my dear! Good gracious! the coachman will hear! Be
quiet or the coachman will hear! He can overhear everything."

"I don''t love you ... I don''t love you!" he went on breathlessly.
"You''ve no soul and no morals.... Don''t dare to wear that raincoat! Do
you hear? Or else I will tear it into rags...."

"And where is my father''s fortune? Where is your money? You have wasted
it all. I am not ashamed of being poor, but I am ashamed of having such
a mother.... When my schoolfellows ask questions about you, I always
blush."

In the train they had to pass two stations before they reached the town.
Volodya spent all the time on the little platform between two carriages
and shivered all over. He did not want to go into the compartment
because there the mother he hated was sitting. He hated himself, hated
the ticket collectors, the smoke from the engine, the cold to which he
attributed his shivering. And the heavier the weight on his heart, the
more strongly he felt that somewhere in the world, among some people,
there was a pure, honourable, warm, refined life, full of love,
affection, gaiety, and serenity.... He felt this and was so intensely
miserable that one of the passengers, after looking in his face
attentively, actually asked:

In the town maman and Volodya lived with Marya Petrovna, a lady of
noble rank, who had a large flat and let rooms to boarders. Maman had
two rooms, one with windows and two pictures in gold frames hanging on
the walls, in which her bed stood and in which she lived, and a little
dark room opening out of it in which Volodya lived. Here there was a
sofa on which he slept, and, except that sofa, there was no other
furniture; the rest of the room was entirely filled up with wicker
baskets full of clothes, cardboard hat-boxes, and all sorts of rubbish,
which maman preserved for some reason or other. Volodya prepared his
lessons either in his mother''s room or in the "general room," as the
large room in which the boarders assembled at dinner-time and in the
evening was called.

On reaching home he lay down on his sofa and put the quilt over him to
stop his shivering. The cardboard hat-boxes, the wicker baskets, and the
other rubbish, reminded him that he had not a room of his own, that he
had no refuge in which he could get away from his mother, from her
visitors, and from the voices that were floating up from the "general
room." The satchel and the books lying about in the corners reminded him
of the examination he had missed.... For some reason there came into his
mind, quite inappropriately, Mentone, where he had lived with his father
when he was seven years old; he thought of Biarritz and two little
English girls with whom he ran about on the sand.... He tried to recall
to his memory the colour of the sky, the sea, the height of the waves,
and his mood at the time, but he could not succeed. The English girls
flitted before his imagination as though they were living; all the rest
was a medley of images that floated away in confusion....

"No; it''s cold here," thought Volodya. He got up, put on his overcoat,
and went into the "general room."

There they were drinking tea. There were three people at the samovar:
maman; an old lady with tortoiseshell pince-nez, who gave music
lessons; and Avgustin Mihalitch, an elderly and very stout Frenchman,
who was employed at a perfumery factory.

"Oh, that''s of no consequence," said the Frenchman, with a broad smile.
"I will go for some bread myself at once. Oh, it''s nothing."

He laid his strong, pungent cigar in a conspicuous place, put on his hat
and went out. After he had gone away maman began telling the music
teacher how she had been staying at the Shumihins'', and how warmly they
welcomed her.

"Lili Shumihin is a relation of mine, you know," she said. "Her late
husband, General Shumihin, was a cousin of my husband. And she was a
Baroness Kolb by birth...."

He knew perfectly well that what his mother said was true; in what she
was saying about General Shumihin and about Baroness Kolb there was not
a word of lying, but nevertheless he felt that she was lying. There was
a suggestion of falsehood in her manner of speaking, in the expression
of her face, in her eyes, in everything.

"You are lying," repeated Volodya; and he brought his fist down on the
table with such force that all the crockery shook and maman''s tea was
spilt over. "Why do you talk about generals and baronesses? It''s all
lies!"

The music teacher was disconcerted, and coughed into her handkerchief,
affecting to sneeze, and maman began to cry.

He had been in the street already; he was ashamed to go to his
schoolfellows. Again, quite incongruously, he remembered the two little
English girls.... He paced up and down the "general room," and went into
Avgustin Mihalitch''s room. Here there was a strong smell of ethereal
oils and glycerine soap. On the table, in the window, and even on the
chairs, there were a number of bottles, glasses, and wineglasses
containing fluids of various colours. Volodya took up from the table a
newspaper, opened it and read the title Figaro ... There was a strong
and pleasant scent about the paper. Then he took a revolver from the
table....

"There, there! Don''t take any notice of it." The music teacher was
comforting maman in the next room. "He is young! Young people of his
age never restrain themselves. One must resign oneself to that."

"No, Yevgenya Andreyevna; he''s too spoilt," said maman in a singsong
voice. "He has no one in authority over him, and I am weak and can do
nothing. Oh, I am unhappy!"

Volodya put the muzzle of the revolver to his mouth, felt something like
a trigger or spring, and pressed it with his finger.... Then felt
something else projecting, and once more pressed it. Taking the muzzle
out of his mouth, he wiped it with the lapel of his coat, looked at the
lock. He had never in his life taken a weapon in his hand before....

Avgustin Mihalitch went into the "general room," and with a laugh began
telling them about something. Volodya put the muzzle in his mouth again,
pressed it with his teeth, and pressed something with his fingers. There
was a sound of a shot.... Something hit Volodya in the back of his head
with terrible violence, and he fell on the table with his face downwards
among the bottles and glasses. Then he saw his father, as in Mentone, in
a top-hat with a wide black band on it, wearing mourning for some lady,
suddenly seize him by both hands, and they fell headlong into a very
deep, dark pit.

THROUGH causes which it is not the time to go into in detail, I had to
enter the service of a Petersburg official called Orlov, in the capacity
of a footman. He was about five and thirty, and was called Georgy*
Ivanitch.

I entered this Orlov''s service on account of his father, a prominent
political man, whom I looked upon as a serious enemy of my cause. I
reckoned that, living with the son, I should—from the conversations I
should hear, and from the letters and papers I should find on the
table—learn every detail of the father''s plans and intentions.

As a rule at eleven o''clock in the morning the electric bell rang in my
footman''s quarters to let me know that my master was awake. When I went
into the bedroom with his polished shoes and brushed clothes, Georgy
Ivanitch would be sitting in his bed with a face that looked, not
drowsy, but rather exhausted by sleep, and he would gaze off in one
direction without any sign of satisfaction at having waked. I helped him
to dress, and he let me do it with an air of reluctance without speaking
or noticing my presence; then with his head wet with washing, smelling
of fresh scent, he used to go into the dining-room to drink his coffee.
He used to sit at the table, sipping his coffee and glancing through the
newspapers, while the maid Polya and I stood respectfully at the door
gazing at him. Two grown-up persons had to stand watching with the
gravest attention a third drinking coffee and munching rusks. It was
probably ludicrous and grotesque, but I saw nothing humiliating in
having to stand near the door, though I was quite as well born and well
educated as Orlov himself.

I was in the first stage of consumption, and was suffering from
something else, possibly even more serious than consumption. I don''t
know whether it was the effect of my illness or of an incipient change
in my philosophy of life of which I was not conscious at the time, but I
was, day by day, more possessed by a passionate, irritating longing for
ordinary everyday life. I yearned for mental tranquillity, health, fresh
air, good food. I was becoming a dreamer, and, like a dreamer, I did not
know exactly what I wanted. Sometimes I felt inclined to go into a
monastery, to sit there for days together by the window and gaze at the
trees and the fields; sometimes I fancied I would buy fifteen acres of
land and settle down as a country gentleman; sometimes I inwardly vowed
to take up science and become a professor at some provincial university.
I was a retired navy lieutenant; I dreamed of the sea, of our squadron,
and of the corvette in which I had made the cruise round the world. I
longed to experience again the indescribable feeling when, walking in
the tropical forest or looking at the sunset in the Bay of Bengal, one
is thrilled with ecstasy and at the same time homesick. I dreamed of
mountains, women, music, and, with the curiosity of a child, I looked
into people''s faces, listened to their voices. And when I stood at the
door and watched Orlov sipping his coffee, I felt not a footman, but a
man interested in everything in the world, even in Orlov.

In appearance Orlov was a typical Petersburger, with narrow shoulders, a
long waist, sunken temples, eyes of an indefinite colour, and scanty,
dingy-coloured hair, beard and moustaches. His face had a stale,
unpleasant look, though it was studiously cared for. It was particularly
unpleasant when he was asleep or lost in thought. It is not worth while
describing a quite ordinary appearance; besides, Petersburg is not
Spain, and a man''s appearance is not of much consequence even in love
affairs, and is only of value to a handsome footman or coachman. I have
spoken of Orlov''s face and hair only because there was something in his
appearance worth mentioning. When Orlov took a newspaper or book,
whatever it might be, or met people, whoever they be, an ironical smile
began to come into his eyes, and his whole countenance assumed an
expression of light mockery in which there was no malice. Before reading
or hearing anything he always had his irony in readiness, as a savage
has his shield. It was an habitual irony, like some old liquor brewed
years ago, and now it came into his face probably without any
participation of his will, as it were by reflex action. But of that
later.

Soon after midday he took his portfolio, full of papers, and drove to
his office. He dined away from home and returned after eight o''clock. I
used to light the lamp and candles in his study, and he would sit down
in a low chair with his legs stretched out on another chair, and,
reclining in that position, would begin reading. Almost every day he
brought in new books with him or received parcels of them from the
shops, and there were heaps of books in three languages, to say nothing
of Russian, which he had read and thrown away, in the corners of my room
and under my bed. He read with extraordinary rapidity. They say: "Tell
me what you read, and I''ll tell you who you are." That may be true, but
it was absolutely impossible to judge of Orlov by what he read. It was a
regular hotchpotch. Philosophy, French novels, political economy,
finance, new poets, and publications of the firm Posrednik*—and he
read it all with the same rapidity and with the same ironical expression
in his eyes.

* I.e., Tchertkov and others, publishers of Tolstoy, who issued good
literature for peasants'' reading.

After ten o''clock he carefully dressed, often in evening dress, very
rarely in his kammer-junker''s uniform, and went out, returning in the
morning.

Our relations were quiet and peaceful, and we never had any
misunderstanding. As a rule he did not notice my presence, and when he
talked to me there was no expression of irony on his face—he evidently
did not look upon me as a human being.

I only once saw him angry. One day—it was a week after I had entered
his service—he came back from some dinner at nine o''clock; his face
looked ill-humoured and exhausted. When I followed him into his study to
light the candles, he said to me:

I was offended, and was on the point of answering, and goodness knows
how it would have ended if Polya, who knew her master better than I did,
had not intervened.

"There really is a disagreeable smell," she said, raising her eyebrows.
"What can it be from? Stepan, open the pane in the drawing-room, and
light the fire."

With much bustle and many exclamations, she went through all the rooms,
rustling her skirts and squeezing the sprayer with a hissing sound. And
Orlov was still out of humour; he was obviously restraining himself not
to vent his ill-temper aloud. He was sitting at the table and rapidly
writing a letter. After writing a few lines he snorted angrily and tore
it up, then he began writing again.

"Go to Znamensky Street and deliver this letter to Zinaida Fyodorovna
Krasnovsky in person. But first ask the porter whether her husband
—that is, Mr. Krasnovsky—has returned yet. If he has returned, don''t
deliver the letter, but come back. Wait a minute!... If she asks whether
I have any one here, tell her that there have been two gentlemen here
since eight o''clock, writing something."

I drove to Znamensky Street. The porter told me that Mr. Krasnovsky had
not yet come in, and I made my way up to the third storey. The door was
opened by a tall, stout, drab-coloured flunkey with black whiskers, who
in a sleepy, churlish, and apathetic voice, such as only flunkeys use in
addressing other flunkeys, asked me what I wanted. Before I had time to
answer, a lady dressed in black came hurriedly into the hall. She
screwed up her eyes and looked at me.

She tore the letter open impatiently, and holding it in both hands, so
that I saw her sparkling diamond rings, she began reading. I made out a
pale face with soft lines, a prominent chin, and long dark lashes. From
her appearance I should not have judged the lady to be more than five
and twenty.

"Give him my thanks and my greetings," she said when she had finished
the letter. "Is there any one with Georgy Ivanitch?" she asked softly,
joyfully, and as though ashamed of her mistrust.

"Give him my greetings and thanks," she repeated, bending her head
sideways, and, reading the letter as she walked, she went noiselessly
out. I saw few women at that time, and this lady of whom I had a passing
glimpse made an impression on me. As I walked home I recalled her face
and the delicate fragrance about her, and fell to dreaming. By the time
I got home Orlov had gone out.

And so my relations with my employer were quiet and peaceful, but still
the unclean and degrading element which I so dreaded on becoming a
footman was conspicuous and made itself felt every day. I did not get on
with Polya. She was a well-fed and pampered hussy who adored Orlov
because he was a gentleman and despised me because I was a footman.
Probably, from the point of view of a real flunkey or cook, she was
fascinating, with her red cheeks, her turned-up nose, her coquettish
glances, and the plumpness, one might almost say fatness, of her person.
She powdered her face, coloured her lips and eyebrows, laced herself in,
and wore a bustle, and a bangle made of coins. She walked with little
ripping steps; as she walked she swayed, or, as they say, wriggled her
shoulders and back. The rustle of her skirts, the creaking of her stays,
the jingle her bangle and the vulgar smell of lip salve, toilet vinegar,
and scent stolen from her master, aroused in me whilst I was doing the
rooms with her in the morning a sensation as though I were taking part
with her in some abomination.

Either because I did not steal as she did, or because I displayed no
desire to become her lover, which she probably looked upon as an insult,
or perhaps because she felt that I was a man of a different order, she
hated me from the first day. My inexperience, my appearance—so unlike
a flunkey—and my illness, seemed to her pitiful and excited her
disgust. I had a bad cough at that time, and sometimes at night I
prevented her from sleeping, as our rooms were only divided by a wooden
partition, and every morning she said to me:

She so genuinely believed that I was hardly a human being, but something
infinitely below her, that, like the Roman matrons who were not ashamed
to bathe before their slaves, she sometimes went about in my presence in
nothing but her chemise.

Once when I was in a happy, dreamy mood, I asked her at dinner (we had
soup and roast meat sent in from a restaurant every day):

"Then," I went on, "you believe there will be a day of judgment, and
that we shall have to answer to God for every evil action?"

She gave me no reply, but simply made a contemptuous grimace, and,
looking that time at her cold eyes and over-fed expression, I realised
that for her complete and finished personality no God, no conscience, no
laws existed, and that if I had had to set fire to the house, to murder
or to rob, I could not have hired a better accomplice.

In my novel surroundings I felt very uncomfortable for the first week at
Orlov''s before I got used to being addressed as "thou," and being
constantly obliged to tell lies (saying "My master is not at home" when
he was). In my flunkey''s swallow-tail I felt as though I were in armour.
But I grew accustomed to it in time. Like a genuine footman, I waited at
table, tidied the rooms, ran and drove about on errands of all sorts.
When Orlov did not want to keep an appointment with Zinaida Fyodorovna,
or when he forgot that he had promised to go and see her, I drove to
Znamensky Street, put a letter into her hands and told a lie. And the
result of it all was quite different from what I had expected when I
became a footman. Every day of this new life of mine was wasted for me
and my cause, as Orlov never spoke of his father, nor did his visitors,
and all I could learn of the stateman''s doings was, as before, what I
could glean from the newspapers or from correspondence with my comrades.
The hundreds of notes and papers I used to find in the study and read
had not the remotest connection with what I was looking for. Orlov was
absolutely uninterested in his father''s political work, and looked as
though he had never heard of it, or as though his father had long been
dead.

I ordered a piece of roast beef from the restaurant and telephoned to
Eliseyev''s to send us caviare, cheese, oysters, and so on. I bought
playing-cards. Polya was busy all day getting ready the tea-things and
the dinner service. To tell the truth, this spurt of activity came as a
pleasant change in our idle life, and Thursdays were for us the most
interesting days.

Only three visitors used to come. The most important and perhaps the
most interesting was the one called Pekarsky—a tall, lean man of five
and forty, with a long hooked nose, with a big black beard, and a bald
patch on his head. His eyes were large and prominent, and his expression
was grave and thoughtful like that of a Greek philosopher. He was on the
board of management of some railway, and also had some post in a bank;
he was a consulting lawyer in some important Government institution, and
had business relations with a large number of private persons as a
trustee, chairman of committees, and so on. He was of quite a low grade
in the service, and modestly spoke of himself as a lawyer, but he had a
vast influence. A note or card from him was enough to make a celebrated
doctor, a director of a railway, or a great dignitary see any one
without waiting; and it was said that through his protection one might
obtain even a post of the Fourth Class, and get any sort of unpleasant
business hushed up. He was looked upon as a very intelligent man, but
his was a strange, peculiar intelligence. He was able to multiply 213 by
373 in his head instantaneously, or turn English pounds into German
marks without help of pencil or paper; he understood finance and railway
business thoroughly, and the machinery of Russian administration had no
secrets for him; he was a most skilful pleader in civil suits, and it
was not easy to get the better of him at law. But that exceptional
intelligence could not grasp many things which are understood even by
some stupid people. For instance, he was absolutely unable to understand
why people are depressed, why they weep, shoot themselves, and even kill
others; why they fret about things that do not affect them personally,
and why they laugh when they read Gogol or Shtchedrin.... Everything
abstract, everything belonging to the domain of thought and feeling, was
to him boring and incomprehensible, like music to one who has no ear. He
looked at people simply from the business point of view, and divided
them into competent and incompetent. No other classification existed for
him. Honesty and rectitude were only signs of competence. Drinking,
gambling, and debauchery were permissible, but must not be allowed to
interfere with business. Believing in God was rather stupid, but
religion ought be safeguarded, as the common people must have some
principle to restrain them, otherwise they would not work. Punishment is
only necessary as deterrent. There was no need to go away for holidays,
as it was just as nice in town. And so on. He was a widower and had no
children, but lived on a large scale, as though he had a family, and
paid three thousand roubles a year for his flat.

The second visitor, Kukushkin, an actual civil councillor though a young
man, was short, and was conspicuous for his extremely unpleasant
appearance, which was due to the disproportion between his fat, puffy
body and his lean little face. His lips were puckered up suavely, and
his little trimmed moustaches looked as though they had been fixed on
with glue. He was a man with the manners of a lizard. He did not walk,
but, as it were, crept along with tiny steps, squirming and sniggering,
and when he laughed he showed his teeth. He was a clerk on special
commissions, and did nothing, though he received a good salary,
especially in the summer, when special and lucrative jobs were found for
him. He was a man of personal ambition, not only to the marrow of his
bones, but more fundamentally—to the last drop of his blood; but even
in his ambitions he was petty and did not rely on himself, but was
building his career on the chance favour flung him by his superiors. For
the sake of obtaining some foreign decoration, or for the sake of having
his name mentioned in the newspapers as having been present at some
special service in the company of other great personages, he was ready
to submit to any kind of humiliation, to beg, to flatter, to promise. He
flattered Orlov and Pekarsky from cowardice, because he thought they
were powerful; he flattered Polya and me because we were in the service
of a powerful man. Whenever I took off his fur coat he tittered and
asked me: "Stepan, are you married?" and then unseemly vulgarities
followed—by way of showing me special attention. Kukushkin flattered
Orlov''s weaknesses, humoured his corrupted and blasÃ© ways; to please him
he affected malicious raillery and atheism, in his company criticised
persons before whom in other places he would slavishly grovel. When at
supper they talked of love and women, he pretended to be a subtle and
perverse voluptuary. As a rule, one may say, Petersburg rakes are fond
of talking of their abnormal tastes. Some young actual civil councillor
is perfectly satisfied with the embraces of his cook or of some unhappy
street-walker on the Nevsky Prospect, but to listen to him you would
think he was contaminated by all the vices of East and West combined,
that he was an honourary member of a dozen iniquitous secret societies
and was already marked by the police. Kukushkin lied about himself in an
unconscionable way, and they did not exactly disbelieve him, but paid
little heed to his incredible stories.

The third guest was Gruzin, the son of a worthy and learned general; a
man of Orlov''s age, with long hair, short-sighted eyes, and gold
spectacles. I remember his long white fingers, that looked like a
pianist''s; and, indeed, there was something of a musician, of a
virtuoso, about his whole figure. The first violins in orchestras look
just like that. He used to cough, suffered from migraine, and seemed
invalidish and delicate. Probably at home he was dressed and undressed
like a baby. He had finished at the College of Jurisprudence, and had at
first served in the Department of Justice, then he was transferred to
the Senate; he left that, and through patronage had received a post in
the Department of Crown Estates, and had soon afterwards given that up.
In my time he was serving in Orlov''s department; he was his head-clerk,
but he said that he should soon exchange into the Department of Justice
again. He took his duties and his shifting about from one post to
another with exceptional levity, and when people talked before him
seriously of grades in the service, decorations, salaries, he smiled
good-naturedly and repeated Prutkov''s aphorism: "It''s only in the
Government service you learn the truth." He had a little wife with a
wrinkled face, who was very jealous of him, and five weedy-looking
children. He was unfaithful to his wife, he was only fond of his
children when he saw them, and on the whole was rather indifferent to
his family, and made fun of them. He and his family existed on credit,
borrowing wherever they could at every opportunity, even from his
superiors in the office and porters in people''s houses. His was a flabby
nature; he was so lazy that he did not care what became of himself, and
drifted along heedless where or why he was going. He went where he was
taken. If he was taken to some low haunt, he went; if wine was set
before him, he drank—if it were not put before him, he abstained; if
wives were abused in his presence, he abused his wife, declaring she had
ruined his life—when wives were praised, he praised his and said quite
sincerely: "I am very fond of her, poor thing!" He had no fur coat and
always wore a rug which smelt of the nursery. When at supper he rolled
balls of bread and drank a great deal of red wine, absorbed in thought,
strange to say, I used to feel almost certain that there was something
in him of which perhaps he had a vague sense, though in the bustle and
vulgarity of his daily life he had not time to understand and appreciate
it. He played a little on the piano. Sometimes he would sit down at the
piano, play a chord or two, and begin singing softly:

The visitors usually arrived about ten o''clock. They played cards in
Orlov''s study, and Polya and I handed them tea. It was only on these
occasions that I could gauge the full sweetness of a flunkey''s life.
Standing for four or five hours at the door, watching that no one''s
glass should be empty, changing the ash-trays, running to the table to
pick up the chalk or a card when it was dropped, and, above all,
standing, waiting, being attentive without venturing to speak, to cough,
to smile—is harder, I assure you, is harder than the hardest of field
labour. I have stood on watch at sea for four hours at a stretch on
stormy winter nights, and to my thinking it is an infinitely easier
duty.

They used to play cards till two, sometimes till three o''clock at night,
and then, stretching, they would go into the dining-room to supper, or,
as Orlov said, for a snack of something. At supper there was
conversation. It usually began by Orlov''s speaking with laughing eyes of
some acquaintance, of some book he had lately been reading, of a new
appointment or Government scheme. Kukushkin, always ingratiating, would
fall into his tone, and what followed was to me, in my mood at that
time, a revolting exhibition. The irony of Orlov and his friends knew no
bounds, and spared no one and nothing. If they spoke of religion, it was
with irony; they spoke of philosophy, of the significance and object of
life—irony again, if any one began about the peasantry, it was with
irony.

There is in Petersburg a species of men whose specialty it is to jeer at
every aspect of life; they cannot even pass by a starving man or a
suicide without saying something vulgar. But Orlov and his friends did
not jeer or make jokes, they talked ironically. They used to say that
there was no God, and personality was completely lost at death; the
immortals only existed in the French Academy. Real good did not and
could not possibly exist, as its existence was conditional upon human
perfection, which was a logical absurdity. Russia was a country as poor
and dull as Persia. The intellectual class was hopeless; in Pekarsky''s
opinion the overwhelming majority in it were incompetent persons, good
for nothing. The people were drunken, lazy, thievish, and degenerate. We
had no science, our literature was uncouth, our commerce rested on
swindling—"No selling without cheating." And everything was in that
style, and everything was a subject for laughter.

Towards the end of supper the wine made them more good-humoured, and
they passed to more lively conversation. They laughed over Gruzin''s
family life, over Kukushkin''s conquests, or at Pekarsky, who had, they
said, in his account book one page headed Charity and another
Physiological Necessities. They said that no wife was faithful; that
there was no wife from whom one could not, with practice, obtain
caresses without leaving her drawing-room while her husband was sitting
in his study close by; that girls in their teens were perverted and knew
everything. Orlov had preserved a letter of a schoolgirl of fourteen: on
her way home from school she had "hooked an officer on the Nevsky," who
had, it appears, taken her home with him, and had only let her go late
in the evening; and she hastened to write about this to her school
friend to share her joy with her. They maintained that there was not and
never had been such a thing as moral purity, and that evidently it was
unnecessary; mankind had so far done very well without it. The harm done
by so-called vice was undoubtedly exaggerated. Vices which are punished
by our legal code had not prevented Diogenes from being a philosopher
and a teacher. CÃ¦sar and Cicero were profligates and at the same time
great men. Cato in his old age married a young girl, and yet he was
regarded as a great ascetic and a pillar of morality.

At three or four o''clock the party broke up or they went off together
out of town, or to Officers'' Street, to the house of a certain Varvara
Ossipovna, while I retired to my quarters, and was kept awake a long
while by coughing and headache.

Three weeks after I entered Orlov''s service—it was Sunday morning, I
remember—somebody rang the bell. It was not yet eleven, and Orlov was
still asleep. I went to open the door. You can imagine my astonishment
when I found a lady in a veil standing at the door on the landing.

From her voice I recognised Zinaida Fyodorovna, to whom I had taken
letters in Znamensky Street. I don''t remember whether I had time or
self-possession to answer her—I was taken aback at seeing her. And,
indeed, she did not need my answer. In a flash she had darted by me,
and, filling the hall with the fragrance of her perfume, which I
remember to this day, she went on, and her footsteps died away. For at
least half an hour afterwards I heard nothing. But again some one rang.
This time it was a smartly dressed girl, who looked like a maid in a
wealthy family, accompanied by our house porter. Both were out of
breath, carrying two trunks and a dress-basket.

And she went down without saying another word. All this was mysterious,
and made Polya, who had a deep admiration for the pranks of her betters,
smile slyly to herself; she looked as though she would like to say, "So
that''s what we''re up to," and she walked about the whole time on tiptoe.
At last we heard footsteps; Zinaida Fyodorovna came quickly into the
hall, and seeing me at the door of my room, said:

When I went in to Orlov with his clothes and his boots, he was sitting
on the bed with his feet on the bearskin rug. There was an air of
embarrassment about his whole figure. He did not notice me, and my
menial opinion did not interest him; he was evidently perturbed and
embarrassed before himself, before his inner eye. He dressed, washed,
and used his combs and brushes silently and deliberately, as though
allowing himself time to think over his position and to reflect, and
even from his back one could see he was troubled and dissatisfied with
himself.

They drank coffee together. Zinaida Fyodorovna poured out coffee for
herself and for Orlov, then she put her elbows on the table and laughed.

"I still can''t believe it," she said. "When one has been a long while on
one''s travels and reaches a hotel at last, it''s difficult to believe
that one hasn''t to go on. It is pleasant to breathe freely."

With the expression of a child who very much wants to be mischievous,
she sighed with relief and laughed again.

"You will excuse me," said Orlov, nodding towards the coffee. "Reading
at breakfast is a habit I can''t get over. But I can do two things at
once—read and listen."

"Read away.... You shall keep your habits and your freedom. But why do
you look so solemn? Are you always like that in the morning, or is it
only to-day? Aren''t you glad?"

"Why? You had plenty of time to prepare yourself for my descent upon
you. I''ve been threatening to come every day."

"I didn''t expect it myself, but that''s all the better. It''s all the
better, my dear. It''s best to have an aching tooth out and have done
with it."

"Oh, my dear," she said, closing her eyes, "all is well that ends well;
but before this happy ending, what suffering there has been! My laughing
means nothing; I am glad, I am happy, but I feel more like crying than
laughing. Yesterday I had to fight a regular battle," she went on in
French. "God alone knows how wretched I was. But I laugh because I can''t
believe in it. I keep fancying that my sitting here drinking coffee with
you is not real, but a dream."

Then, still speaking French, she described how she had broken with her
husband the day before and her eyes were alternately full of tears and
of laughter while she gazed with rapture at Orlov. She told him her
husband had long suspected her, but had avoided explanations; they had
frequent quarrels, and usually at the most heated moment he would
suddenly subside into silence and depart to his study for fear that in
his exasperation he might give utterance to his suspicions or she might
herself begin to speak openly. And she had felt guilty, worthless,
incapable of taking a bold and serious step, and that had made her hate
herself and her husband more every day, and she had suffered the
torments of hell. But the day before, when during a quarrel he had cried
out in a tearful voice, "My God, when will it end?" and had walked off
to his study, she had run after him like a cat after a mouse, and,
preventing him from shutting the door, she had cried that she hated him
with her whole soul. Then he let her come into the study and she had
told him everything, had confessed that she loved some one else, that
that some one else was her real, most lawful husband, and that she
thought it her true duty to go away to him that very day, whatever might
happen, if she were to be shot for it.

"There''s a very romantic streak in you," Orlov interrupted, keeping his
eyes fixed on the newspaper.

She laughed and went on talking without touching her coffee. Her cheeks
glowed and she was a little embarrassed by it, and she looked in
confusion at Polya and me. From what she went on to say I learnt that
her husband had answered her with threats, reproaches, and finally
tears, and that it would have been more accurate to say that she, and
not he, had been the attacking party.

"Yes, my dear, so long as I was worked up, everything went all right,"
she told Orlov; "but as night came on, my spirits sank. You don''t
believe in God, George, but I do believe a little, and I fear
retribution. God requires of us patience, magnanimity, self-sacrifice,
and here I am refusing to be patient and want to remodel my life to suit
myself. Is that right? What if from the point of view of God it''s wrong?
At two o''clock in the night my husband came to me and said: ''You dare
not go away. I''ll fetch you back through the police and make a scandal.''
And soon afterwards I saw him like a shadow at my door. ''Have mercy on
me! Your elopement may injure me in the service.'' Those words had a
coarse effect upon me and made me feel stiff all over. I felt as though
the retribution were beginning already; I began crying and trembling
with terror. I felt as though the ceiling would fall upon me, that I
should be dragged off to the police-station at once, that you would grow
cold to me—all sorts of things, in fact! I thought I would go into a
nunnery or become a nurse, and give up all thought of happiness, but
then I remembered that you loved me, and that I had no right to dispose
of myself without your knowledge; and everything in my mind was in a
tangle—I was in despair and did not know what to do or think. But the
sun rose and I grew happier. As soon as it was morning I dashed off to
you. Ah, what I''ve been through, dear one! I haven''t slept for two
nights!"

She was tired out and excited. She was sleepy, and at the same time she
wanted to talk endlessly, to laugh and to cry, and to go to a restaurant
to lunch that she might feel her freedom.

"You have a cosy flat, but I am afraid it may be small for the two of
us," she said, walking rapidly through all the rooms when they had
finished breakfast. "What room will you give me? I like this one because
it is next to your study."

At one o''clock she changed her dress in the room next to the study,
which from that time she called hers, and she went off with Orlov to
lunch. They dined, too, at a restaurant, and spent the long interval
between lunch and dinner in shopping. Till late at night I was opening
the door to messengers and errand-boys from the shops. They bought,
among other things, a splendid pier-glass, a dressing-table, a bedstead,
and a gorgeous tea service which we did not need. They bought a regular
collection of copper saucepans, which we set in a row on the shelf in
our cold, empty kitchen. As we were unpacking the tea service Polya''s
eyes gleamed, and she looked at me two or three times with hatred and
fear that I, not she, would be the first to steal one of these charming
cups. A lady''s writing-table, very expensive and inconvenient, came too.
It was evident that Zinaida Fyodorovna contemplated settling with us for
good, and meant to make the flat her home.

She came back with Orlov between nine and ten. Full of proud
consciousness that she had done something bold and out of the common,
passionately in love, and, as she imagined, passionately loved,
exhausted, looking forward to a sweet sound sleep, Zinaida Fyodorovna
was revelling in her new life. She squeezed her hands together in the
excess of her joy, declared that everything was delightful, and swore
that she would love Orlov for ever; and these vows, and the naÃ¯ve,
almost childish confidence that she too was deeply loved and would be
loved forever, made her at least five years younger. She talked charming
nonsense and laughed at herself.

"There''s no other blessing greater than freedom!" she said, forcing
herself to say something serious and edifying. "How absurd it is when
you think of it! We attach no value to our own opinion even when it is
wise, but tremble before the opinion of all sorts of stupid people. Up
to the last minute I was afraid of what other people would say, but as
soon as I followed my own instinct and made up my mind to go my own way,
my eyes were opened, I overcame my silly fears, and now I am happy and
wish every one could be as happy!"

But her thoughts immediately took another turn, and she began talking of
another flat, of wallpapers, horses, a trip to Switzerland and Italy.
Orlov was tired by the restaurants and the shops, and was still
suffering from the same uneasiness that I had noticed in the morning. He
smiled, but more from politeness than pleasure, and when she spoke of
anything seriously, he agreed ironically: "Oh, yes."

"There''s no need to be in a hurry over the kitchen arrangements," said
Orlov, looking at me coldly. "We must first move into another flat."

We had never had cooking done at home nor kept horses, because, as he
said, "he did not like disorder about him," and only put up with having
Polya and me in his flat from necessity. The so-called domestic hearth
with its everyday joys and its petty cares offended his taste as
vulgarity; to be with child, or to have children and talk about them,
was bad form, like a petty bourgeois. And I began to feel very curious
to see how these two creatures would get on together in one flat—she,
domestic and home-loving with her copper saucepans and her dreams of a
good cook and horses; and he, fond of saying to his friends that a
decent and orderly man''s flat ought, like a warship, to have nothing in
it superfluous—no women, no children, no rags, no kitchen utensils.

Then I will tell you what happened the following Thursday. That day
Zinaida Fyodorovna dined at Content''s or Donon''s. Orlov returned home
alone, and Zinaida Fyodorovna, as I learnt afterwards, went to the
Petersburg Side to spend with her old governess the time visitors were
with us. Orlov did not care to show her to his friends. I realised that
at breakfast, when he began assuring her that for the sake of her peace
of mind it was essential to give up his Thursday evenings.

He went in with a sly, oily look in his eyes, smiling mysteriously,
rubbing his hands, which were cold from the frost.

"I have the honour to congratulate you," he said to Orlov, shaking all
over with ingratiating, obsequious laughter. "May you increase and
multiply like the cedars of Lebanon."

The visitors went into the bedroom, and were extremely jocose on the
subject of a pair of feminine slippers, the rug that had been put down
between the two beds, and a grey dressing-jacket that hung at the foot
of the bedstead. They were amused that the obstinate man who despised
all the common place details of love had been caught in feminine snares
in such a simple and ordinary way.

"He who pointed the finger of scorn is bowing the knee in homage,"
Kukushkin repeated several times. He had, I may say in parenthesis, an
unpleasant habit of adorning his conversation with texts in Church
Slavonic. "Sh-sh!" he said as they went from the bedroom into the room
next to the study. "Sh-sh! Here Gretchen is dreaming of her Faust."

He went off into a peal of laughter as though he had said something very
amusing. I watched Gruzin, expecting that his musical soul would not
endure this laughter, but I was mistaken. His thin, good-natured face
beamed with pleasure. When they sat down to play cards, he, lisping and
choking with laughter, said that all that "dear George" wanted to
complete his domestic felicity was a cherry-wood pipe and a guitar.
Pekarsky laughed sedately, but from his serious expression one could see
that Orlov''s new love affair was distasteful to him. He did not
understand what had happened exactly.

Pekarsky combed his big beard with his fingers and sank into thought,
and he did not speak again till supper-time. When they were seated at
supper, he began deliberately, drawling every word:

"Altogether, excuse my saying so, I don''t understand either of you. You
might love each other and break the seventh commandment to your heart''s
content—that I understand. Yes, that''s comprehensible. But why make the
husband a party to your secrets? Was there any need for that?"

"Hm!...." Pekarsky mused. "Well, then, let me tell you this, my friend,"
he went on, evidently thinking hard: "if I ever marry again and you take
it into your head to seduce my wife, please do it so that I don''t notice
it. It''s much more honest to deceive a man than to break up his family
life and injure his reputation. I understand. You both imagine that in
living together openly you are doing something exceptionally honourable
and advanced, but I can''t agree with that ... what shall I call it?...
romantic attitude?"

Orlov made no reply. He was out of humour and disinclined to talk.
Pekarsky, still perplexed, drummed on the table with his fingers,
thought a little, and said:

"I don''t understand you, all the same. You are not a student and she is
not a dressmaker. You are both of you people with means. I should have
thought you might have arranged a separate flat for her."

"Turgenev teaches us in his novels that every exalted, noble-minded girl
should follow the man she loves to the ends of the earth, and should
serve his idea," said Orlov, screwing up his eyes ironically. "The ends
of the earth are poetic license; the earth and all its ends can be
reduced to the flat of the man she loves.... And so not to live in the
same flat with the woman who loves you is to deny her her exalted
vocation and to refuse to share her ideals. Yes, my dear fellow,
Turgenev wrote, and I have to suffer for it."

"What Turgenev has got to do with it I don''t understand," said Gruzin
softly, and he shrugged his shoulders. "Do you remember, George, how
in ''Three Meetings'' he is walking late in the evening somewhere in
Italy, and suddenly hears, ''Vieni pensando a me segretamente,''" Gruzin
hummed. "It''s fine."

"What next! Far from wishing it, I never imagined that this would ever
happen. When she said she was coming to live with me, I thought it was a
charming joke on her part."

"I couldn''t have wished for such a thing," said Orlov in the tone of a
man compelled to justify himself. "I am not a Turgenev hero, and if I
ever wanted to free Bulgaria I shouldn''t need a lady''s company. I look
upon love primarily as a necessity of my physical nature, degrading and
antagonistic to my spirit; it must either be satisfied with discretion
or renounced altogether, otherwise it will bring into one''s life
elements as unclean as itself. For it to be an enjoyment and not a
torment, I will try to make it beautiful and to surround it with a mass
of illusions. I should never go and see a woman unless I were sure
beforehand that she would be beautiful and fascinating; and I should
never go unless I were in the mood. And it is only in that way that we
succeed in deceiving one another, and fancying that we are in love and
happy. But can I wish for copper saucepans and untidy hair, or like to
be seen myself when I am unwashed or out of humour? Zinaida Fyodorovna
in the simplicity of her heart wants me to love what I have been
shunning all my life. She wants my flat to smell of cooking and washing
up; she wants all the fuss of moving into another flat, of driving about
with her own horses; she wants to count over my linen and to look after
my health; she wants to meddle in my personal life at every instant, and
to watch over every step; and at the same time she assures me genuinely
that my habits and my freedom will be untouched. She is persuaded that,
like a young couple, we shall very soon go for a honeymoon—that is,
she wants to be with me all the time in trains and hotels, while I like
to read on the journey and cannot endure talking in trains."

"What! Do you suppose she would understand me? Why, we think so
differently. In her opinion, to leave one''s papa and mamma or one''s
husband for the sake of the man one loves is the height of civic virtue,
while I look upon it as childish. To fall in love and run away with a
man to her means beginning a new life, while to my mind it means nothing
at all. Love and man constitute the chief interest of her life, and
possibly it is the philosophy of the unconscious at work in her. Try and
make her believe that love is only a simple physical need, like the need
of food or clothes; that it doesn''t mean the end of the world if wives
and husbands are unsatisfactory; that a man may be a profligate and a
libertine, and yet a man of honour and a genius; and that, on the other
hand, one may abstain from the pleasures of love and at the same time be
a stupid, vicious animal! The civilised man of to-day, even among the
lower classes—for instance, the French workman—spends ten sous on
dinner, five sous on his wine, and five or ten sous on woman, and
devotes his brain and nerves entirely to his work. But Zinaida
Fyodorovna assigns to love not so many sous, but her whole soul. I
might give her a talking to, but she would raise a wail in answer, and
declare in all sincerity that I had ruined her, that she had nothing
left to live for."

"But she is charming," said Kukushkin. "She is exquisite. Such women
imagine that they will be in love for ever, and abandon themselves with
tragic intensity."

"But one must keep a head on one''s shoulders," said Orlov; "one must be
reasonable. All experience gained from everyday life and handed down in
innumerable novels and plays, uniformly confirms the fact that adultery
and cohabitation of any sort between decent people never lasts longer
than two or at most three years, however great the love may have been at
the beginning. That she ought to know. And so all this business of
moving, of saucepans, hopes of eternal love and harmony, are nothing but
a desire to delude herself and me. She is charming and exquisite—who
denies it? But she has turned my life upside down; what I have regarded
as trivial and nonsensical till now she has forced me to raise to the
level of a serious problem; I serve an idol whom I have never looked
upon as God. She is charming—exquisite, but for some reason now when I
am going home, I feel uneasy, as though I expected to meet with
something inconvenient at home, such as workmen pulling the stove to
pieces and blocking up the place with heaps of bricks. In fact, I am no
longer giving up to love a sous, but part of my peace of mind and my
nerves. And that''s bad."

"And she doesn''t hear this villain!" sighed Kukushkin. "My dear sir," he
said theatrically, "I will relieve you from the burdensome obligation to
love that adorable creature! I will wrest Zinaida Fyodorovna from you!"

They all began talking of Kukushkin''s indefatigable energy in love
affairs, how irresistible he was to women, and what a danger he was to
husbands; and how the devil would roast him in the other world for his
immorality in this. He screwed up his eyes and remained silent, and when
the names of ladies of their acquaintance were mentioned, he held up his
little finger—as though to say they mustn''t give away other people''s
secrets.

His friends understood, and began to take their leave. I remember that
Gruzin, who was a little drunk, was wearisomely long in getting off. He
put on his coat, which was cut like children''s coats in poor families,
pulled up the collar, and began telling some long-winded story; then,
seeing he was not listened to, he flung the rug that smelt of the
nursery over one shoulder, and with a guilty and imploring face begged
me to find his hat.

"She is a dear, she won''t be angry. My dear chief, come along! It''s
glorious weather; there''s snow and frost.... Upon my word, you want
shaking up a bit; you are out of humour. I don''t know what the devil is
the matter with you...."

"Shall I get drunk? All right, I''ll come," said Orlov after some
hesitation. "Wait a minute; I''ll get some money."

He went into the study, and Gruzin slouched in, too, dragging his rug
after him. A minute later both came back into the hall. Gruzin, a little
drunk and very pleased, was crumpling a ten-rouble note in his hands.

"We''ll settle up to-morrow," he said. "And she is kind, she won''t be
cross.... She is my Lisotchka''s godmother; I am fond of her, poor thing!
Ah, my dear fellow!" he laughed joyfully, and pressing his forehead on
Pekarsky''s back. "Ah, Pekarsky, my dear soul! Advocatissimus—as dry as
a biscuit, but you bet he is fond of women...."

"Fat ones," said Orlov, putting on his fur coat. "But let us get off, or
we shall be meeting her on the doorstep."

Zinaida Fyodorovna had lost her gold watch, a present from her father.
This loss surprised and alarmed her. She spent half a day going through
the rooms, looking helplessly on all the tables and on all the windows.
But the watch had disappeared completely.

Only three days afterwards Zinaida Fyodorovna, on coming in, left her
purse in the hall. Luckily for me, on that occasion it was not I but
Polya who helped her off with her coat. When the purse was missed, it
could not be found in the hall.

"Strange," said Zinaida Fyodorovna in bewilderment. "I distinctly
remember taking it out of my pocket to pay the cabman ... and then I put
it here near the looking-glass. It''s very odd!"

I had not stolen it, but I felt as though I had stolen it and had been
caught in the theft. Tears actually came into my eyes. When they were
seated at dinner, Zinaida Fyodorovna said to Orlov in French:

"There seem to be spirits in the flat. I lost my purse in the hall
to-day, and now, lo and behold, it is on my table. But it''s not quite a
disinterested trick of the spirits. They took out a gold coin and twenty
roubles in notes."

"You are always losing something; first it''s your watch and then it''s
your money ..." said Orlov. "Why is it nothing of the sort ever happens
to me?"

A minute later Zinaida Fyodorovna had forgotten the trick played by the
spirits, and was telling with a laugh how the week before she had
ordered some notepaper and had forgotten to give her new address, and
the shop had sent the paper to her old home at her husband''s, who had to
pay twelve roubles for it. And suddenly she turned her eyes on Polya and
looked at her intently. She blushed as she did so, and was so confused
that she began talking of something else.

When I took in the coffee to the study, Orlov was standing with his back
to the fire and she was sitting in an arm-chair facing him.

"I am not in a bad temper at all," she was saying in French. "But I have
been putting things together, and now I see it clearly. I can give you
the day and the hour when she stole my watch. And the purse? There can
be no doubt about it. Oh!" she laughed as she took the coffee from me.
"Now I understand why I am always losing my handkerchiefs and gloves.
Whatever you say, I shall dismiss the magpie to-morrow and send Stepan
for my Sofya. She is not a thief and has not got such a repulsive
appearance."

"You are out of humour. To-morrow you will feel differently, and will
realise that you can''t discharge people simply because you suspect
them."

"It''s not suspicion; it''s certainty," said Zinaida Fyodorovna. "So long
as I suspected that unhappy-faced, poor-looking valet of yours, I said
nothing. It''s too bad of you not to believe me, George."

"If we think differently about anything, it doesn''t follow that I don''t
believe you. You may be right," said Orlov, turning round and flinging
his cigarette-end into the fire, "but there is no need to be excited
about it, anyway. In fact, I must say, I never expected my humble
establishment would cause you so much serious worry and agitation.
You''ve lost a gold coin: never mind—you may have a hundred of mine; but
to change my habits, to pick up a new housemaid, to wait till she is
used to the place—all that''s a tedious, tiring business and does not
suit me. Our present maid certainly is fat, and has, perhaps, a weakness
for gloves and handkerchiefs, but she is perfectly well behaved, well
trained, and does not shriek when Kukushkin pinches her."

"Yes, I am jealous," she repeated, and tears glistened in her eyes. "No,
it''s something worse ... which I find it difficult to find a name for."
She pressed her hands on her temples, and went on impulsively. "You men
are so disgusting! It''s horrible!"

"I''ve not seen it; I don''t know; but they say that you men begin with
housemaids as boys, and get so used to it that you feel no repugnance. I
don''t know, I don''t know, but I have actually read.... George, of
course you are right," she said, going up to Orlov and changing to a
caressing and imploring tone. "I really am out of humour to-day. But,
you must understand, I can''t help it. She disgusts me and I am afraid of
her. It makes me miserable to see her."

"Surely you can rise above such paltriness?" said Orlov, shrugging his
shoulders in perplexity, and walking away from the fire. "Nothing could
be simpler: take no notice of her, and then she won''t disgust you, and
you won''t need to make a regular tragedy out of a trifle."

I went out of the study, and I don''t know what answer Orlov received.
Whatever it was, Polya remained. After that Zinaida Fyodorovna never
applied to her for anything, and evidently tried to dispense with her
services. When Polya handed her anything or even passed by her, jingling
her bangle and rustling her skirts, she shuddered.

I believe that if Gruzin or Pekarsky had asked Orlov to dismiss Polya he
would have done so without the slightest hesitation, without troubling
about any explanations. He was easily persuaded, like all indifferent
people. But in his relations with Zinaida Fyodorovna he displayed for
some reason, even in trifles, an obstinacy which sometimes was almost
irrational. I knew beforehand that if Zinaida Fyodorovna liked anything,
it would be certain not to please Orlov. When on coming in from shopping
she made haste to show him with pride some new purchase, he would glance
at it and say coldly that the more unnecessary objects they had in the
flat, the less airy it would be. It sometimes happened that after
putting on his dress clothes to go out somewhere, and after saying
good-bye to Zinaida Fyodorovna, he would suddenly change his mind and
remain at home from sheer perversity. I used to think that he remained
at home then simply in order to feel injured.

"Why are you staying?" said Zinaida Fyodorovna, with a show of vexation,
though at the same time she was radiant with delight. "Why do you? You
are not accustomed to spending your evenings at home, and I don''t want
you to alter your habits on my account. Do go out as usual, if you don''t
want me to feel guilty."

With the air of a victim he stretched himself in his easy-chair in the
study, and shading his eyes with his hand, took up a book. But soon the
book dropped from his hand, he turned heavily in his chair, and again
screened his eyes as though from the sun. Now he felt annoyed that he
had not gone out.

"May I come in?" Zinaida Fyodorovna would say, coming irresolutely into
the study. "Are you reading? I felt dull by myself, and have come just
for a minute ... to have a peep at you."

I remember one evening she went in like that, irresolutely and
inappropriately, and sank on the rug at Orlov''s feet, and from her soft,
timid movements one could see that she did not understand his mood and
was afraid.

"You are always reading ..." she said cajolingly, evidently wishing to
flatter him. "Do you know, George, what is one of the secrets of your
success? You are very clever and well-read. What book have you there?"

Orlov answered. A silence followed for some minutes which seemed to me
very long. I was standing in the drawing-room, from which I could watch
them, and was afraid of coughing.

"There is something I wanted to tell you," said Zinaida Fyodorovna, and
she laughed; "shall I? Very likely you''ll laugh and say that I flatter
myself. You know I want, I want horribly to believe that you are staying
at home to-night for my sake ... that we might spend the evening
together. Yes? May I think so?"

"Do," he said, screening his eyes. "The really happy man is he who
thinks not only of what is, but of what is not."

"That was a long sentence which I did not quite understand. You mean
happy people live in their imagination. Yes, that''s true. I love to sit
in your study in the evening and let my thoughts carry me far, far
away.... It''s pleasant sometimes to dream. Let us dream aloud,
George."

"You are out of humour?" said Zinaida Fyodorovna, taking Orlov''s hand.
"Tell me why. When you are like that, I''m afraid. I don''t know whether
your head aches or whether you are angry with me...."

"Why have you changed?" she said softly. "Why are you never so tender or
so gay as you used to be at Znamensky Street? I''ve been with you almost
a month, but it seems to me as though we had not yet begun to live, and
have not yet talked of anything as we ought to. You always answer me
with jokes or else with a long cold lecture like a teacher. And there is
something cold in your jokes.... Why have you given up talking to me
seriously?"

"Let us talk of our life, of our future," said Zinaida Fyodorovna
dreamily. "I keep making plans for our life, plans and plans—and I
enjoy doing it so! George, I''ll begin with the question, when are you
going to give up your post?"

"My views?" Orlov repeated. "My views? In conviction and temperament I
am an ordinary official, one of Shtchedrin''s heroes. You take me for
something different, I venture to assure you."

"Not in the least. The service does not satisfy me, perhaps; but,
anyway, it is better for me than anything else. I am used to it, and in
it I meet men of my own sort; I am in my place there and find it
tolerable."

"Indeed? If I resign my post, take to dreaming aloud and letting myself
be carried away into another world, do you suppose that that world would
be less hateful to me than the service?"

"You are ready to libel yourself in order to contradict me." Zinaida
Fyodorovna was offended and got up. "I am sorry I began this talk."

"Why are you angry? I am not angry with you for not being an official.
Every one lives as he likes best."

"Why, do you live as you like best? Are you free? To spend your life
writing documents that are opposed to your own ideas," Zinaida
Fyodorovna went on, clasping her hands in despair: "to submit to
authority, congratulate your superiors at the New Year, and then cards
and nothing but cards: worst of all, to be working for a system which
must be distasteful to you—no, George, no! You should not make such
horrid jokes. It''s dreadful. You are a man of ideas, and you ought to be
working for your ideas and nothing else."

"Say simply that you don''t want to talk to me. You dislike me, that''s
all," said Zinaida Fyodorovna through her tears.

"Look here, my dear," said Orlov admonishingly, sitting up in his chair.
"You were pleased to observe yourself that I am a clever, well-read man,
and to teach one who knows does nothing but harm. I know very well all
the ideas, great and small, which you mean when you call me a man of
ideas. So if I prefer the service and cards to those ideas, you may be
sure I have good grounds for it. That''s one thing. Secondly, you have,
so far as I know, never been in the service, and can only have drawn
your ideas of Government service from anecdotes and indifferent novels.
So it would not be amiss for us to make a compact, once for all, not to
talk of things we know already or of things about which we are not
competent to speak."

"Why do you speak to me like that?" said Zinaida Fyodorovna, stepping
back as though in horror. "What for? George, for God''s sake, think
what you are saying!"

Her voice quivered and broke; she was evidently trying to restrain her
tears, but she suddenly broke into sobs.

"George, my darling, I am perishing!" she said in French, dropping
down before Orlov, and laying her head on his knees. "I am miserable, I
am exhausted. I can''t bear it, I can''t bear it.... In my childhood my
hateful, depraved stepmother, then my husband, now you ... you!... You
meet my mad love with coldness and irony.... And that horrible, insolent
servant," she went on, sobbing. "Yes, yes, I see: I am not your wife nor
your friend, but a woman you don''t respect because she has become your
mistress.... I shall kill myself!"

I had not expected that her words and her tears would make such an
impression on Orlov. He flushed, moved uneasily in his chair, and
instead of irony, his face wore a look of stupid, schoolboyish dismay.

"My darling, you misunderstood me," he muttered helplessly, touching her
hair and her shoulders. "Forgive me, I entreat you. I was unjust and I
hate myself."

"I insult you with my whining and complaints. You are a true, generous
... rare man—I am conscious of it every minute; but I''ve been horribly
depressed for the last few days ..."

"No, she must stay, George! Do you hear? I am not afraid of her
now.... One must rise above trifles and not imagine silly things. You
are right! You are a wonderful, rare person!"

She soon left off crying. With tears glistening on her eyelashes,
sitting on Orlov''s knee, she told him in a low voice something touching,
something like a reminiscence of childhood and youth. She stroked his
face, kissed him, and carefully examined his hands with the rings on
them and the charms on his watch-chain. She was carried away by what she
was saying, and by being near the man she loved, and probably because
her tears had cleared and refreshed her soul, there was a note of
wonderful candour and sincerity in her voice. And Orlov played with her
chestnut hair and kissed her hands, noiselessly pressing them to his
lips.

Then they had tea in the study, and Zinaida Fyodorovna read aloud some
letters. Soon after midnight they went to bed. I had a fearful pain in
my side that night, and I could not get warm or go to sleep till
morning. I could hear Orlov go from the bedroom into his study. After
sitting there about an hour, he rang the bell. In my pain and exhaustion
I forgot all the rules and conventions, and went to his study in my
night attire, barefooted. Orlov, in his dressing-gown and cap, was
standing in the doorway, waiting for me.

I was about to apologise, but suddenly broke into a violent cough, and
clutched at the side of the door to save myself from falling.

I believe it was the first time of our acquaintance that he addressed me
not in the singular—goodness knows why. Most likely, in my night
clothes and with my face distorted by coughing, I played my part poorly,
and was very little like a flunkey.

While hurriedly getting into my coat, I put up and lighted fresh
candles. He was sitting at the table, with feet stretched out on a low
chair, cutting a book.

I left him deeply engrossed, and the book did not drop out of his hands
as it had done in the evening.

Now that I am writing these lines I am restrained by that dread of
appearing sentimental and ridiculous, in which I have been trained from
childhood; when I want to be affectionate or to say anything tender, I
don''t know how to be natural. And it is that dread, together with lack
of practice, that prevents me from being able to express with perfect
clearness what was passing in my soul at that time.

I was not in love with Zinaida Fyodorovna, but in the ordinary human
feeling I had for her, there was far more youth, freshness, and
joyousness than in Orlov''s love.

As I worked in the morning, cleaning boots or sweeping the rooms, I
waited with a thrill at my heart for the moment when I should hear her
voice and her footsteps. To stand watching her as she drank her coffee
in the morning or ate her lunch, to hold her fur coat for her in the
hall, and to put the goloshes on her little feet while she rested her
hand on my shoulder; then to wait till the hall porter rang up for me,
to meet her at the door, cold, and rosy, powdered with the snow, to
listen to her brief exclamations about the frost or the cabman—if only
you knew how much all that meant to me! I longed to be in love, to have
a wife and child of my own. I wanted my future wife to have just such a
face, such a voice. I dreamed of it at dinner, and in the street when I
was sent on some errand, and when I lay awake at night. Orlov rejected
with disgust children, cooking, copper saucepans, and feminine
knicknacks and I gathered them all up, tenderly cherished them in my
dreams, loved them, and begged them of destiny. I had visions of a wife,
a nursery, a little house with garden paths....

I knew that if I did love her I could never dare hope for the miracle of
her returning my love, but that reflection did not worry me. In my
quiet, modest feeling akin to ordinary affection, there was no jealousy
of Orlov or even envy of him, since I realised that for a wreck like me
happiness was only to be found in dreams.

When Zinaida Fyodorovna sat up night after night for her George,
looking immovably at a book of which she never turned a page, or when
she shuddered and turned pale at Polya''s crossing the room, I suffered
with her, and the idea occurred to me to lance this festering wound as
quickly as possible by letting her know what was said here at supper on
Thursdays; but—how was it to be done? More and more often I saw her
tears. For the first weeks she laughed and sang to herself, even when
Orlov was not at home, but by the second month there was a mournful
stillness in our flat broken only on Thursday evenings.

She flattered Orlov, and to wring from him a counterfeit smile or kiss,
was ready to go on her knees to him, to fawn on him like a dog. Even
when her heart was heaviest, she could not resist glancing into a
looking-glass if she passed one and straightening her hair. It seemed
strange to me that she could still take an interest in clothes and go
into ecstasies over her purchases. It did not seem in keeping with her
genuine grief. She paid attention to the fashions and ordered expensive
dresses. What for? On whose account? I particularly remember one dress
which cost four hundred roubles. To give four hundred roubles for an
unnecessary, useless dress while women for their hard day''s work get
only twenty kopecks a day without food, and the makers of Venice and
Brussels lace are only paid half a franc a day on the supposition that
they can earn the rest by immorality! And it seemed strange to me that
Zinaida Fyodorovna was not conscious of it; it vexed me. But she had
only to go out of the house for me to find excuses and explanations for
everything, and to be waiting eagerly for the hall porter to ring for
me.

She treated me as a flunkey, a being of a lower order. One may pat a
dog, and yet not notice it; I was given orders and asked questions, but
my presence was not observed. My master and mistress thought it unseemly
to say more to me than is usually said to servants; if when waiting at
dinner I had laughed or put in my word in the conversation, they would
certainly have thought I was mad and have dismissed me. Zinaida
Fyodorovna was favourably disposed to me, all the same. When she was
sending me on some errand or explaining to me the working of a new lamp
or anything of that sort, her face was extraordinarily kind, frank, and
cordial, and her eyes looked me straight in the face. At such moments I
always fancied she remembered with gratitude how I used to bring her
letters to Znamensky Street. When she rang the bell, Polya, who
considered me her favourite and hated me for it, used to say with a
jeering smile:

Zinaida Fyodorovna considered me as a being of a lower order, and did
not suspect that if any one in the house were in a humiliating position
it was she. She did not know that I, a footman, was unhappy on her
account, and used to ask myself twenty times a day what was in store for
her and how it would all end. Things were growing visibly worse day by
day. After the evening on which they had talked of his official work,
Orlov, who could not endure tears, unmistakably began to avoid
conversation with her; whenever Zinaida Fyodorovna began to argue, or to
beseech him, or seemed on the point of crying, he seized some plausible
excuse for retreating to his study or going out. He more and more rarely
slept at home, and still more rarely dined there: on Thursdays he was
the one to suggest some expedition to his friends. Zinaida Fyodorovna
was still dreaming of having the cooking done at home, of moving to a
new flat, of travelling abroad, but her dreams remained dreams. Dinner
was sent in from the restaurant. Orlov asked her not to broach the
question of moving until after they had come back from abroad, and
apropos of their foreign tour, declared that they could not go till his
hair had grown long, as one could not go trailing from hotel to hotel
and serving the idea without long hair.

To crown it all, in Orlov''s absence, Kukushkin began calling at the flat
in the evening. There was nothing exceptional in his behaviour, but I
could never forget the conversation in which he had offered to cut Orlov
out. He was regaled with tea and red wine, and he used to titter and,
anxious to say something pleasant, would declare that a free union was
superior in every respect to legal marriage, and that all decent people
ought really to come to Zinaida Fyodorovna and fall at her feet.

Christmas was spent drearily in vague anticipations of calamity. On New
Year''s Eve Orlov unexpectedly announced at breakfast that he was being
sent to assist a senator who was on a revising commission in a certain
province.

"I don''t want to go, but I can''t find an excuse to get off," he said
with vexation. "I must go; there''s nothing for it."

"I am glad, really, you are going," she said after a moment''s thought.
"It will be a change for you. You will fall in love with some one on the
way, and tell me about it afterwards."

At every opportunity she tried to make Orlov feel that she did not
restrict his liberty in any way, and that he could do exactly as he
liked, and this artless, transparent strategy deceived no one, and only
unnecessarily reminded Orlov that he was not free.

Zinaida Fyodorovna wanted to see him off at the station, but he
dissuaded her, saying that he was not going to America, and not going to
be away five years, but only five days—possibly less.

The parting took place between seven and eight. He put one arm round
her, and kissed her on the lips and on the forehead.

"Be a good girl, and don''t be depressed while I am away," he said in a
warm, affectionate tone which touched even me. "God keep you!"

She looked greedily into his face, to stamp his dear features on her
memory, then she put her arms gracefully round his neck and laid her
head on his breast.

"Forgive me our misunderstandings," she said in French. "Husband and
wife cannot help quarrelling if they love each other, and I love you
madly. Don''t forget me.... Wire to me often and fully."

Orlov kissed her once more, and, without saying a word, went out in
confusion. When he heard the click of the lock as the door closed, he
stood still in the middle of the staircase in hesitation and glanced
upwards. It seemed to me that if a sound had reached him at that moment
from above, he would have turned back. But all was quiet. He
straightened his coat and went downstairs irresolutely.

The sledges had been waiting a long while at the door. Orlov got into
one, I got into the other with two portmanteaus. It was a hard frost and
there were fires smoking at the cross-roads. The cold wind nipped my
face and hands, and took my breath away as we drove rapidly along; and,
closing my eyes, I thought what a splendid woman she was. How she loved
him! Even useless rubbish is collected in the courtyards nowadays and
used for some purpose, even broken glass is considered a useful
commodity, but something so precious, so rare, as the love of a refined,
young, intelligent, and good woman is utterly thrown away and wasted.
One of the early sociologists regarded every evil passion as a force
which might by judicious management be turned to good, while among us
even a fine, noble passion springs up and dies away in impotence, turned
to no account, misunderstood or vulgarised. Why is it?

The sledges stopped unexpectedly. I opened my eyes and I saw that we had
come to a standstill in Sergievsky Street, near a big house where
Pekarsky lived. Orlov got out of the sledge and vanished into the entry.
Five minutes later Pekarsky''s footman came out, bareheaded, and, angry
with the frost, shouted to me:

At a complete loss, I went to the first storey. I had been to Pekarsky''s
flat before—that is, I had stood in the hall and looked into the
drawing-room, and, after the damp, gloomy street, it always struck me by
the brilliance of its picture-frames, its bronzes and expensive
furniture. To-day in the midst of this splendour I saw Gruzin,
Kukushkin, and, after a minute, Orlov.

"Look here, Stepan," he said, coming up to me. "I shall be staying here
till Friday or Saturday. If any letters or telegrams come, you must
bring them here every day. At home, of course you will say that I have
gone, and send my greetings. Now you can go."

When I reached home Zinaida Fyodorovna was lying on the sofa in the
drawing-room, eating a pear. There was only one candle burning in the
candelabra.

I went into my room and I, too, lay down. I had nothing to do, and I did
not want to read. I was not surprised and I was not indignant. I only
racked my brains to think why this deception was necessary. It is only
boys in their teens who deceive their mistresses like that. How was it
that a man who had thought and read so much could not imagine anything
more sensible? I must confess I had by no means a poor opinion of his
intelligence. I believe if he had had to deceive his minister or any
other influential person he would have put a great deal of skill and
energy into doing so; but to deceive a woman, the first idea that
occurred to him was evidently good enough. If it succeeded—well and
good; if it did not, there would be no harm done—he could tell some
other lie just as quickly and simply, with no mental effort.

At midnight when the people on the floor overhead were moving their
chairs and shouting hurrah to welcome the New Year, Zinaida Fyodorovna
rang for me from the room next to the study. Languid from lying down so
long, she was sitting at the table, writing something on a scrap of
paper.

"I must send a telegram," she said, with a smile. "Go to the station as
quick as you can and ask them to send it after him."

"May the New Year bring new happiness. Make haste and telegraph; I miss
you dreadfully. It seems an eternity. I am only sorry I can''t send a
thousand kisses and my very heart by telegraph. Enjoy yourself, my
darling.—ZINA."

The worst of it was that Orlov had thoughtlessly let Polya, too, into
the secret of his deception, telling her to bring his shirts to
Sergievsky Street. After that, she looked at Zinaida Fyodorovna with a
malignant joy and hatred I could not understand, and was never tired of
snorting with delight to herself in her own room and in the hall.

"She''s outstayed her welcome; it''s time she took herself off!" she would
say with zest. "She ought to realise that herself...."

She already divined by instinct that Zinaida Fyodorovna would not be
with us much longer, and, not to let the chance slip, carried off
everything she set her eyes on—smelling-bottles, tortoise-shell
hairpins, handkerchiefs, shoes! On the day after New Year''s Day, Zinaida
Fyodorovna summoned me to her room and told me in a low voice that she
missed her black dress. And then she walked through all the rooms, with
a pale, frightened, and indignant face, talking to herself:

At dinner she tried to help herself to soup, but could not—her hands
were trembling. Her lips were trembling, too. She looked helplessly at
the soup and at the little pies, waiting for the trembling to pass off,
and suddenly she could not resist looking at Polya.

"There''s no need for you to stay. You go away altogether," Zinaida
Fyodorovna went on, getting up in great agitation. "You may look out for
another place. You can go at once."

"You can take orders from me, too! I am mistress here!" said Zinaida
Fyodorovna, and she flushed crimson.

"You dare not stay here another minute!" cried Zinaida Fyodorovna, and
she struck the plate with her knife. "You are a thief! Do you hear?"

Zinaida Fyodorovna flung her dinner-napkin on the table, and with a
pitiful, suffering face, went quickly out of the room. Loudly sobbing
and wailing something indistinct, Polya, too, went away. The soup and
the grouse got cold. And for some reason all the restaurant dainties on
the table struck me as poor, thievish, like Polya. Two pies on a plate
had a particularly miserable and guilty air. "We shall be taken back to
the restaurant to-day," they seemed to be saying, "and to-morrow we
shall be put on the table again for some official or celebrated singer."

"She is a fine lady, indeed," I heard uttered in Polya''s room. "I could
have been a lady like that long ago, but I have some self-respect! We''ll
see which of us will be the first to go!"

Zinaida Fyodorovna rang the bell. She was sitting in her room, in the
corner, looking as though she had been put in the corner as a
punishment.

"Ask the porter; perhaps there is a telegram. And don''t leave the
house," she called after me. "I am afraid to be left alone."

After that I had to run down almost every hour to ask the porter whether
a telegram had come. I must own it was a dreadful time! To avoid seeing
Polya, Zinaida Fyodorovna dined and had tea in her own room; it was here
that she slept, too, on a short sofa like a half-moon, and she made her
own bed. For the first days I took the telegrams; but, getting no
answer, she lost her faith in me and began telegraphing herself. Looking
at her, I, too, began impatiently hoping for a telegram. I hoped he
would contrive some deception, would make arrangements, for instance,
that a telegram should be sent to her from some station. If he were too
much engrossed with cards or had been attracted by some other woman, I
thought that both Gruzin and Kukushkin would remind him of us. But our
expectations were vain. Five times a day I would go in to Zinaida
Fyodorovna, intending to tell her the truth. But her eyes looked piteous
as a fawn''s, her shoulders seemed to droop, her lips were moving, and I
went away again without saying a word. Pity and sympathy seemed to rob
me of all manliness. Polya, as cheerful and well satisfied with herself
as though nothing had happened, was tidying the master''s study and the
bedroom, rummaging in the cupboards, and making the crockery jingle, and
when she passed Zinaida Fyodorovna''s door, she hummed something and
coughed. She was pleased that her mistress was hiding from her. In the
evening she would go out somewhere, and rang at two or three o''clock in
the morning, and I had to open the door to her and listen to remarks
about my cough. Immediately afterwards I would hear another ring; I
would run to the room next to the study, and Zinaida Fyodorovna, putting
her head out of the door, would ask, "Who was it rung?" while she looked
at my hands to see whether I had a telegram.

When at last on Saturday the bell rang below and she heard the familiar
voice on the stairs, she was so delighted that she broke into sobs. She
rushed to meet him, embraced him, kissed him on the breast and sleeves,
said something one could not understand. The hall porter brought up the
portmanteaus; Polya''s cheerful voice was heard. It was as though some
one had come home for the holidays.

"Why didn''t you wire?" asked Zinaida Fyodorovna, breathless with joy.
"Why was it? I have been in misery; I don''t know how I''ve lived through
it.... Oh, my God!"

"It was very simple! I returned with the senator to Moscow the very
first day, and didn''t get your telegrams," said Orlov. "After dinner, my
love, I''ll give you a full account of my doings, but now I must sleep
and sleep.... I am worn out with the journey."

It was evident that he had not slept all night; he had probably been
playing cards and drinking freely. Zinaida Fyodorovna put him to bed,
and we all walked about on tiptoe all that day. The dinner went off
quite satisfactorily, but when they went into the study and had coffee
the explanation began. Zinaida Fyodorovna began talking of something
rapidly in a low voice; she spoke in French, and her words flowed like a
stream. Then I heard a loud sigh from Orlov, and his voice.

"My God!" he said in French. "Have you really nothing fresher to tell me
than this everlasting tale of your servant''s misdeeds?"

"But why is it she doesn''t rob me or say insulting things to me? Why is
it I never notice the maids nor the porters nor the footmen? My dear,
you are simply capricious and refuse to know your own mind.... I really
begin to suspect that you must be in a certain condition. When I offered
to let her go, you insisted on her remaining, and now you want me to
turn her away. I can be obstinate, too, in such cases. You want her to
go, but I want her to remain. That''s the only way to cure you of your
nerves."

"Oh, very well, very well," said Zinaida Fyodorovna in alarm. "Let us
say no more about that.... Let us put it off till to-morrow.... Now tell
me about Moscow.... What is going on in Moscow?"

After lunch next day—it was the seventh of January, St. John the
Baptist''s Day—Orlov put on his black dress coat and his decoration to
go to visit his father and congratulate him on his name day. He had to
go at two o''clock, and it was only half-past one when he had finished
dressing. What was he to do for that half-hour? He walked about the
drawing-room, declaiming some congratulatory verses which he had recited
as a child to his father and mother.

Zinaida Fyodorovna, who was just going out to a dressmaker''s or to the
shops, was sitting, listening to him with a smile. I don''t know how
their conversation began, but when I took Orlov his gloves, he was
standing before her with a capricious, beseeching face, saying:

"For God''s sake, in the name of everything that''s holy, don''t talk of
things that everybody knows! What an unfortunate gift our intellectual
thoughtful ladies have for talking with enthusiasm and an air of
profundity of things that every schoolboy is sick to death of! Ah, if
only you would exclude from our conjugal programme all these serious
questions! How grateful I should be to you!"

"I give you full liberty to be as liberal as you like, and quote from
any authors you choose, but make me one concession: don''t hold forth in
my presence on either of two subjects: the corruption of the upper
classes and the evils of the marriage system. Do understand me, at last.
The upper class is always abused in contrast with the world of
tradesmen, priests, workmen and peasants, Sidors and Nikitas of all
sorts. I detest both classes, but if I had honestly to choose between
the two, I should without hesitation, prefer the upper class, and there
would be no falsity or affectation about it, since all my tastes are in
that direction. Our world is trivial and empty, but at any rate we speak
French decently, read something, and don''t punch each other in the ribs
even in our most violent quarrels, while the Sidors and the Nikitas and
their worships in trade talk about ''being quite agreeable,'' ''in a
jiffy,'' ''blast your eyes,'' and display the utmost license of pothouse
manners and the most degrading superstition."

"Yes, but what of it? That''s not only to my discredit, but to theirs
too. They feed me and take off their caps to me, so it seems they have
not the intelligence and honesty to do otherwise. I don''t blame or
praise any one: I only mean that the upper class and the lower are as
bad as one another. My feelings and my intelligence are opposed to both,
but my tastes lie more in the direction of the former. Well, now for the
evils of marriage," Orlov went on, glancing at his watch. "It''s high
time for you to understand that there are no evils in the system itself;
what is the matter is that you don''t know yourselves what you want from
marriage. What is it you want? In legal and illegal cohabitation, in
every sort of union and cohabitation, good or bad, the underlying
reality is the same. You ladies live for that underlying reality alone:
for you it''s everything; your existence would have no meaning for you
without it. You want nothing but that, and you get it; but since you''ve
taken to reading novels you are ashamed of it: you rush from pillar to
post, you recklessly change your men, and to justify this turmoil you
have begun talking of the evils of marriage. So long as you can''t and
won''t renounce what underlies it all, your chief foe, your devil—so
long as you serve that slavishly, what use is there in discussing the
matter seriously? Everything you may say to me will be falsity and
affectation. I shall not believe you."

I went to find out from the hall porter whether the sledge was at the
door, and when I came back I found it had become a quarrel. As sailors
say, a squall had blown up.

"I see you want to shock me by your cynicism today," said Zinaida
Fyodorovna, walking about the drawing-room in great emotion. "It revolts
me to listen to you. I am pure before God and man, and have nothing to
repent of. I left my husband and came to you, and am proud of it. I
swear, on my honour, I am proud of it!"

"If you are a decent, honest man, you, too, ought to be proud of what I
did. It raises you and me above thousands of people who would like to do
as we have done, but do not venture through cowardice or petty prudence.
But you are not a decent man. You are afraid of freedom, and you mock
the promptings of genuine feeling, from fear that some ignoramus may
suspect you of being sincere. You are afraid to show me to your friends;
there''s no greater infliction for you than to go about with me in the
street.... Isn''t that true? Why haven''t you introduced me to your father
or your cousin all this time? Why is it? No, I am sick of it at last,"
cried Zinaida Fyodorovna, stamping. "I demand what is mine by right. You
must present me to your father."

"If you want to know him, go and present yourself. He receives visitors
every morning from ten till half-past."

"How base you are!" said Zinaida Fyodorovna, wringing her hands in
despair. "Even if you are not sincere, and are not saying what you
think, I might hate you for your cruelty. Oh, how base you are!"

"We keep going round and round and never reach the real point. The real
point is that you made a mistake, and you won''t acknowledge it aloud.
You imagined that I was a hero, and that I had some extraordinary ideas
and ideals, and it has turned out that I am a most ordinary official, a
cardplayer, and have no partiality for ideas of any sort. I am a worthy
representative of the rotten world from which you have run away because
you were revolted with its triviality and emptiness. Recognise it and be
just: don''t be indignant with me, but with yourself, as it is your
mistake, and not mine."

"Well, that''s all right, then. We''ve reached that point at last, thank
God. Now hear something more, if you please: I can''t rise to your
level—I am too depraved; you can''t descend to my level, either, for you
are too exalted. So there is only one thing left to do...."

"What?" Zinaida Fyodorovna asked quickly, holding her breath and turning
suddenly as white as a sheet of paper.

"Georgy, why are you torturing me?" Zinaida Fyodorovna said suddenly in
Russian in a breaking voice. "What is it for? Think of my misery...."

Orlov, afraid of tears, went quickly into his study, and I don''t know
why—whether it was that he wished to cause her extra pain, or whether
he remembered it was usually done in such cases—he locked the door
after him. She cried out and ran after him with a rustle of her skirt.

"What does this mean?" she cried, knocking at his door. "What ... what
does this mean?" she repeated in a shrill voice breaking with
indignation. "Ah, so this is what you do! Then let me tell you I hate
you, I despise you! Everything is over between us now."

I heard hysterical weeping mingled with laughter. Something small in the
drawing-room fell off the table and was broken. Orlov went out into the
hall by another door, and, looking round him nervously, he hurriedly put
on his great-coat and went out.

Half an hour passed, an hour, and she was still weeping. I remembered
that she had no father or mother, no relations, and here she was living
between a man who hated her and Polya, who robbed her—and how desolate
her life seemed to me! I do not know why, but I went into the
drawing-room to her. Weak and helpless, looking with her lovely hair
like an embodiment of tenderness and grace, she was in anguish, as
though she were ill; she was lying on a couch, hiding her face, and
quivering all over.

"No, there''s no need ... it''s nothing," she said, and she looked at me
with her tear-stained eyes. "I have a little headache.... Thank you."

I went out, and in the evening she was writing letter after letter, and
sent me out first to Pekarsky, then to Gruzin, then to Kukushkin, and
finally anywhere I chose, if only I could find Orlov and give him the
letter. Every time I came back with the letter she scolded me, entreated
me, thrust money into my hand—as though she were in a fever. And all
the night she did not sleep, but sat in the drawing-room, talking to
herself.

The first Thursday afterwards Orlov complained to his friends of the
intolerable life he led; he smoked a great deal, and said with
irritation:

"It is no life at all; it''s the rack. Tears, wailing, intellectual
conversations, begging for forgiveness, again tears and wailing; and the
long and the short of it is that I have no flat of my own now. I am
wretched, and I make her wretched. Surely I haven''t to live another
month or two like this? How can I? But yet I may have to."

"I''ve tried, but I can''t. One can boldly tell the truth, whatever it may
be, to an independent, rational man; but in this case one has to do with
a creature who has no will, no strength of character, and no logic. I
cannot endure tears; they disarm me. When she cries, I am ready to swear
eternal love and cry myself."

"She wants me, not the flat. But what''s the good of talking?" sighed
Orlov. "I only hear endless conversations, but no way out of my
position. It certainly is a case of ''being guilty without guilt.'' I
don''t claim to be a mushroom, but it seems I''ve got to go into the
basket. The last thing I''ve ever set out to be is a hero. I never could
endure Turgenev''s novels; and now, all of a sudden, as though to spite
me, I''ve heroism forced upon me. I assure her on my honour that I''m not
a hero at all, I adduce irrefutable proofs of the same, but she doesn''t
believe me. Why doesn''t she believe me? I suppose I really must have
something of the appearance of a hero."

A week after this conversation Orlov announced that he was again ordered
to attend the senator, and the same evening he went off with his
portmanteaus to Pekarsky.

An old man of sixty, in a long fur coat reaching to the ground, and a
beaver cap, was standing at the door.

At first I thought it was one of the moneylenders, Gruzin''s creditors,
who sometimes used to come to Orlov for small payments on account; but
when he came into the hall and flung open his coat, I saw the thick
brows and the characteristically compressed lips which I knew so well
from the photographs, and two rows of stars on the uniform. I recognised
him: it was Orlov''s father, the distinguished statesman.

I answered that Georgy Ivanitch was not at home. The old man pursed up
his lips tightly and looked into space, reflecting, showing me his
dried-up, toothless profile.

He left his goloshes in the hall, and, without taking off his long,
heavy fur coat, went into the study. There he sat down before the table,
and, before taking up the pen, for three minutes he pondered, shading
his eyes with his hand as though from the sun—exactly as his son did
when he was out of humour. His face was sad, thoughtful, with that look
of resignation which I have only seen on the faces of the old and
religious. I stood behind him, gazed at his bald head and at the hollow
at the nape of his neck, and it was clear as daylight to me that this
weak old man was now in my power. There was not a soul in the flat
except my enemy and me. I had only to use a little physical violence,
then snatch his watch to disguise the object of the crime, and to get
off by the back way, and I should have gained infinitely more than I
could have imagined possible when I took up the part of a footman. I
thought that I could hardly get a better opportunity. But instead of
acting, I looked quite unconcernedly, first at his bald patch and then
at his fur, and calmly meditated on this man''s relation to his only son,
and on the fact that people spoiled by power and wealth probably don''t
want to die....

He finished the letter and stood up. I still had time. I urged myself on
and clenched my fists, trying to wring out of my soul some trace of my
former hatred; I recalled what a passionate, implacable, obstinate hate
I had felt for him only a little while before.... But it is difficult to
strike a match against a crumbling stone. The sad old face and the cold
glitter of his stars roused in me nothing but petty, cheap, unnecessary
thoughts of the transitoriness of everything earthly, of the nearness of
death....

There could be no doubt about it: I had undergone a change; I had become
different. To convince myself, I began to recall the past, but at once I
felt uneasy, as though I had accidentally peeped into a dark, damp
corner. I remembered my comrades and friends, and my first thought was
how I should blush in confusion if ever I met any of them. What was I
now? What had I to think of and to do? Where was I to go? What was I
living for?

I could make nothing of it. I only knew one thing—that I must make
haste to pack my things and be off. Before the old man''s visit my
position as a flunkey had a meaning; now it was absurd. Tears dropped
into my open portmanteau; I felt insufferably sad; but how I longed to
live! I was ready to embrace and include in my short life every
possibility open to man. I wanted to speak, to read, and to hammer in
some big factory, and to stand on watch, and to plough. I yearned for
the Nevsky Prospect, for the sea and the fields—for every place to
which my imagination travelled. When Zinaida Fyodorovna came in, I
rushed to open the door for her, and with peculiar tenderness took off
her fur coat. The last time!

We had two other visitors that day besides the old man. In the evening
when it was quite dark, Gruzin came to fetch some papers for Orlov. He
opened the table-drawer, took the necessary papers, and, rolling them
up, told me to put them in the hall beside his cap while he went in to
see Zinaida Fyodorovna. She was lying on the sofa in the drawing-room,
with her arms behind her head. Five or six days had already passed since
Orlov went on his tour of inspection, and no one knew when he would be
back, but this time she did not send telegrams and did not expect them.
She did not seem to notice the presence of Polya, who was still living
with us. "So be it, then," was what I read on her passionless and very
pale face. Like Orlov, she wanted to be unhappy out of obstinacy. To
spite herself and everything in the world, she lay for days together on
the sofa, desiring and expecting nothing but evil for herself. Probably
she was picturing to herself Orlov''s return and the inevitable quarrels
with him; then his growing indifference to her, his infidelities; then
how they would separate; and perhaps these agonising thoughts gave her
satisfaction. But what would she have said if she found out the actual
truth?

"I love you, Godmother," said Gruzin, greeting her and kissing her hand.
"You are so kind! And so dear George has gone away," he lied. "He has
gone away, the rascal!"

"Let me spend an hour with you, my dear," he said. "I don''t want to go
home, and it''s too early to go to the Birshovs''. The Birshovs are
keeping their Katya''s birthday to-day. She is a nice child!"

I brought him a glass of tea and a decanter of brandy. He slowly and
with obvious reluctance drank the tea, and returning the glass to me,
asked timidly:

"To your health, my dear," he said to Zinaida Fyodorovna, and he tossed
off a glass of vodka. "My little girl, your godchild, sends you her
love. Poor child! she''s rickety. Ah, children, children!" he sighed.
"Whatever you may say, Godmother, it is nice to be a father. Dear
George can''t understand that feeling."

He drank some more. Pale and lean, with his dinner-napkin over his chest
like a little pinafore, he ate greedily, and raising his eyebrows, kept
looking guiltily, like a little boy, first at Zinaida Fyodorovna and
then at me. It seemed as though he would have begun crying if I had not
given him the grouse or the jelly. When he had satisfied his hunger he
grew more lively, and began laughingly telling some story about the
Birshov household, but perceiving that it was tiresome and that Zinaida
Fyodorovna was not laughing, he ceased. And there was a sudden feeling
of dreariness. After he had finished his dinner they sat in the
drawing-room by the light of a single lamp, and did not speak; it was
painful to him to lie to her, and she wanted to ask him something, but
could not make up her mind to. So passed half an hour. Gruzin glanced at
his watch.

Again they were silent. He sat down to the piano, struck one chord, then
began playing, and sang softly, "What does the coming day bring me?" but
as usual he got up suddenly and tossed his head.

"What shall I play?" he asked, shrugging his shoulders. "I have
forgotten everything. I''ve given it up long ago."

Looking at the ceiling as though trying to remember, he played two
pieces of Tchaikovsky with exquisite expression, with such warmth, such
insight! His face was just as usual—neither stupid nor intelligent—and
it seemed to me a perfect marvel that a man whom I was accustomed to see
in the midst of the most degrading, impure surroundings, was capable of
such purity, of rising to a feeling so lofty, so far beyond my reach.
Zinaida Fyodorovna''s face glowed, and she walked about the drawing-room
in emotion.

"Wait a bit, Godmother; if I can remember it, I will play you
something," he said; "I heard it played on the violoncello."

Beginning timidly and picking out the notes, and then gathering
confidence, he played Saint-SaÃ«ns''s "Swan Song." He played it through,
and then played it a second time.

"What am I to say?" he said, raising his eyebrows. "I love you and think
nothing but good of you. But if you wish that I should speak generally
about the question that interests you," he went on, rubbing his sleeve
near the elbow and frowning, "then, my dear, you know.... To follow
freely the promptings of the heart does not always give good people
happiness. To feel free and at the same time to be happy, it seems to
me, one must not conceal from oneself that life is coarse, cruel, and
merciless in its conservatism, and one must retaliate with what it
deserves—that is, be as coarse and as merciless in one''s striving for
freedom. That''s what I think."

"That''s beyond me," said Zinaida Fyodorovna, with a mournful smile. "I
am exhausted already. I am so exhausted that I wouldn''t stir a finger
for my own salvation."

He said this in jest, but after he had said it, tears glistened in
Zinaida Fyodorovna''s eyes and then in his.

"Well," he said, "we''ve been sitting and sitting, and now we must go.
Good-bye, dear Godmother. God give you health."

He kissed both her hands, and stroking them tenderly, said that he
should certainly come to see her again in a day or two. In the hall, as
he was putting on his overcoat, that was so like a child''s pelisse, he
fumbled long in his pockets to find a tip for me, but found nothing
there.

Zinaida Fyodorovna still walked about the room in her excitement. That
she was walking about and not still lying down was so much to the good.
I wanted to take advantage of this mood to speak to her openly and then
to go away, but I had hardly seen Gruzin out when I heard a ring. It was
Kukushkin.

"Is Georgy Ivanitch at home?" he said. "Has he come back? You say no?
What a pity! In that case, I''ll go in and kiss your mistress''s hand, and
so away. Zinaida Fyodorovna, may I come in?" he cried. "I want to kiss
your hand. Excuse my being so late."

He was not long in the drawing-room, not more than ten minutes, but I
felt as though he were staying a long while and would never go away. I
bit my lips from indignation and annoyance, and already hated Zinaida
Fyodorovna. "Why does she not turn him out?" I thought indignantly,
though it was evident that she was bored by his company.

When I held his fur coat for him he asked me, as a mark of special
good-will, how I managed to get on without a wife.

"But I don''t suppose you waste your time," he said, laughingly. "I''ve no
doubt Polya and you are as thick as thieves.... You rascal!"

In spite of my experience of life, I knew very little of mankind at that
time, and it is very likely that I often exaggerated what was of little
consequence and failed to observe what was important. It seemed to me it
was not without motive that Kukushkin tittered and flattered me. Could
it be that he was hoping that I, like a flunkey, would gossip in other
kitchens and servants'' quarters of his coming to see us in the evenings
when Orlov was away, and staying with Zinaida Fyodorovna till late at
night? And when my tittle-tattle came to the ears of his acquaintance,
he would drop his eyes in confusion and shake his little finger. And
would not he, I thought, looking at his little honeyed face, this very
evening at cards pretend and perhaps declare that he had already won
Zinaida Fyodorovna from Orlov?

That hatred which failed me at midday when the old father had come, took
possession of me now. Kukushkin went away at last, and as I listened to
the shuffle of his leather goloshes, I felt greatly tempted to fling
after him, as a parting shot, some coarse word of abuse, but I
restrained myself. And when the steps had died away on the stairs, I
went back to the hall, and, hardly conscious of what I was doing, took
up the roll of papers that Gruzin had left behind, and ran headlong
downstairs. Without cap or overcoat, I ran down into the street. It was
not cold, but big flakes of snow were falling and it was windy.

He stopped under a lamp-post and looked round with surprise. "Your
Excellency!" I said breathless, "your Excellency!"

And not able to think of anything to say, I hit him two or three times
on the face with the roll of paper. Completely at a loss, and hardly
wondering—I had so completely taken him by surprise—he leaned his back
against the lamp-post and put up his hands to protect his face. At that
moment an army doctor passed, and saw how I was beating the man, but he
merely looked at us in astonishment and went on. I felt ashamed and I
ran back to the house.

With my head wet from the snow, and gasping for breath, I ran to my
room, and immediately flung off my swallow-tails, put on a reefer jacket
and an overcoat, and carried my portmanteau out into the passage; I must
get away! But before going I hurriedly sat down and began writing to
Orlov:

"I leave you my false passport," I began. "I beg you to keep it as a
memento, you false man, you Petersburg official!

"To steal into another man''s house under a false name, to watch under
the mask of a flunkey this person''s intimate life, to hear everything,
to see everything in order later on, unasked, to accuse a man of
lying—all this, you will say, is on a level with theft. Yes, but I care
nothing for fine feelings now. I have endured dozens of your dinners and
suppers when you said and did what you liked, and I had to hear, to look
on, and be silent. I don''t want to make you a present of my silence.
Besides, if there is not a living soul at hand who dares to tell you the
truth without flattery, let your flunkey Stepan wash your magnificent
countenance for you."

The big windows with their dark curtains, the bed, the crumpled dress
coat on the floor, and my wet footprints, looked gloomy and forbidding.
And there was a peculiar stillness.

Possibly because I had run out into the street without my cap and
goloshes I was in a high fever. My face burned, my legs ached.... My
heavy head drooped over the table, and there was that kind of division
in my thought when every idea in the brain seemed dogged by its shadow.

"I am ill, weak, morally cast down," I went on; "I cannot write to you
as I should like to. From the first moment I desired to insult and
humiliate you, but now I do not feel that I have the right to do so. You
and I have both fallen, and neither of us will ever rise up again; and
even if my letter were eloquent, terrible, and passionate, it would
still seem like beating on the lid of a coffin: however one knocks upon
it, one will not wake up the dead! No efforts could warm your accursed
cold blood, and you know that better than I do. Why write? But my mind
and heart are burning, and I go on writing; for some reason I am moved
as though this letter still might save you and me. I am so feverish that
my thoughts are disconnected, and my pen scratches the paper without
meaning; but the question I want to put to you stands before me as clear
as though in letters of flame.

"Why I am prematurely weak and fallen is not hard to explain. Like
Samson of old, I have taken the gates of Gaza on my shoulders to carry
them to the top of the mountain, and only when I was exhausted, when
youth and health were quenched in me forever, I noticed that that burden
was not for my shoulders, and that I had deceived myself. I have been,
moreover, in cruel and continual pain. I have endured cold, hunger,
illness, and loss of liberty. Of personal happiness I know and have
known nothing. I have no home; my memories are bitter, and my conscience
is often in dread of them. But why have you fallen—you? What fatal,
diabolical causes hindered your life from blossoming into full flower?
Why, almost before beginning life, were you in such haste to cast off
the image and likeness of God, and to become a cowardly beast who backs
and scares others because he is afraid himself? You are afraid of
life—as afraid of it as an Oriental who sits all day on a cushion
smoking his hookah. Yes, you read a great deal, and a European coat fits
you well, but yet with what tender, purely Oriental, pasha-like care you
protect yourself from hunger, cold, physical effort, from pain and
uneasiness! How early your soul has taken to its dressing-gown! What a
cowardly part you have played towards real life and nature, with which
every healthy and normal man struggles! How soft, how snug, how warm,
how comfortable—and how bored you are! Yes, it is deathly boredom,
unrelieved by one ray of light, as in solitary confinement; but you try
to hide from that enemy, too, you play cards eight hours out of
twenty-four.

"And your irony? Oh, but how well I understand it! Free, bold, living
thought is searching and dominating; for an indolent, sluggish mind it
is intolerable. That it may not disturb your peace, like thousands of
your contemporaries, you made haste in youth to put it under bar and
bolt. Your ironical attitude to life, or whatever you like to call it,
is your armour; and your thought, fettered and frightened, dare not leap
over the fence you have put round it; and when you jeer at ideas which
you pretend to know all about, you are like the deserter fleeing from
the field of battle, and, to stifle his shame, sneering at war and at
valour. Cynicism stifles pain. In some novel of Dostoevsky''s an old man
tramples underfoot the portrait of his dearly loved daughter because he
had been unjust to her, and you vent your foul and vulgar jeers upon the
ideas of goodness and truth because you have not the strength to follow
them. You are frightened of every honest and truthful hint at your
degradation, and you purposely surround yourself with people who do
nothing but flatter your weaknesses. And you may well, you may well
dread the sight of tears!

"By the way, your attitude to women. Shamelessness has been handed down
to us in our flesh and blood, and we are trained to shamelessness; but
that is what we are men for—to subdue the beast in us. When you reached
manhood and all ideas became known to you, you could not have failed
to see the truth; you knew it, but you did not follow it; you were
afraid of it, and to deceive your conscience you began loudly assuring
yourself that it was not you but woman that was to blame, that she was
as degraded as your attitude to her. Your cold, scabrous anecdotes, your
coarse laughter, all your innumerable theories concerning the underlying
reality of marriage and the definite demands made upon it, concerning
the ten sous the French workman pays his woman; your everlasting
attacks on female logic, lying, weakness and so on—doesn''t it all look
like a desire at all costs to force woman down into the mud that she may
be on the same level as your attitude to her? You are a weak, unhappy,
unpleasant person!"

Zinaida Fyodorovna began playing the piano in the drawing-room, trying
to recall the song of Saint SaÃ«ns that Gruzin had played. I went and lay
on my bed, but remembering that it was time for me to go, I got up with
an effort and with a heavy, burning head went to the table again.

"But this is the question," I went on. "Why are we worn out? Why are we,
at first so passionate, so bold, so noble, and so full of faith, complete
bankrupts at thirty or thirty-five? Why does one waste in consumption,
another put a bullet through his brains, a third seeks forgetfulness in
vodka and cards, while the fourth tries to stifle his fear and misery by
cynically trampling underfoot the pure image of his fair youth? Why is
it that, having once fallen, we do not try to rise up again, and, losing
one thing, do not seek something else? Why is it?

"The thief hanging on the Cross could bring back the joy of life and the
courage of confident hope, though perhaps he had not more than an hour
to live. You have long years before you, and I shall probably not die so
soon as one might suppose. What if by a miracle the present turned out
to be a dream, a horrible nightmare, and we should wake up renewed,
pure, strong, proud of our righteousness? Sweet visions fire me, and I
am almost breathless with emotion. I have a terrible longing to live. I
long for our life to be holy, lofty, and majestic as the heavens above.
Let us live! The sun doesn''t rise twice a day, and life is not given us
again—clutch at what is left of your life and save it...."

I did not write another word. I had a multitude of thoughts in my mind,
but I could not connect them and get them on to paper. Without finishing
the letter, I signed it with my name and rank, and went into the study.
It was dark. I felt for the table and put the letter on it. I must have
stumbled against the furniture in the dark and made a noise.

For at least half a minute I fumbled at the door in the dark, feeling
for the handle; then I slowly opened it and walked into the
drawing-room. Zinaida Fyodorovna was lying on the couch, and raising
herself on her elbow, she looked towards me. Unable to bring myself to
speak, I walked slowly by, and she followed me with her eyes. I stood
for a little time in the dining-room and then walked by her again, and
she looked at me intently and with perplexity, even with alarm. At last
I stood still and said with an effort:

"He is not coming back," I repeated, and my heart beat violently. "He
will not come back, for he has not left Petersburg. He is staying at
Pekarsky''s."

She understood and believed me—I saw that from her sudden pallor, and
from the way she laid her arms upon her bosom in terror and entreaty. In
one instant all that had happened of late flashed through her mind; she
reflected, and with pitiless clarity she saw the whole truth. But at the
same time she remembered that I was a flunkey, a being of a lower
order.... A casual stranger, with hair ruffled, with face flushed with
fever, perhaps drunk, in a common overcoat, was coarsely intruding into
her intimate life, and that offended her. She said to me sternly:

"Oh, believe me!" I cried impetuously, holding out my hands to her. "I
am not a footman; I am as free as you."

I mentioned my name, and, speaking very rapidly that she might not
interrupt me or go away, explained to her who I was and why I was living
there. This new discovery struck her more than the first. Till then she
had hoped that her footman had lied or made a mistake or been silly, but
now after my confession she had no doubts left. From the expression of
her unhappy eyes and face, which suddenly lost its softness and beauty
and looked old, I saw that she was insufferably miserable, and that the
conversation would lead to no good; but I went on impetuously:

"The senator and the tour of inspection were invented to deceive you. In
January, just as now, he did not go away, but stayed at Pekarsky''s, and
I saw him every day and took part in the deception. He was weary of you,
he hated your presence here, he mocked at you.... If you could have
heard how he and his friends here jeered at you and your love, you would
not have remained here one minute! Go away from here! Go away."

Her eyes were full of tears, her lips were quivering, and her whole face
was strikingly pale and distorted with anger. Orlov''s coarse, petty
lying revolted her and seemed to her contemptible, ridiculous: she
smiled and I did not like that smile.

"Well," she repeated, passing her hand over her hair again, "so be it.
He imagines that I shall die of humiliation, and instead of that I am
... amused by it. There''s no need for him to hide." She walked away from
the piano and said, shrugging her shoulders: "There''s no need.... It
would have been simpler to have it out with me instead of keeping in
hiding in other people''s flats. I have eyes; I saw it myself long
ago.... I was only waiting for him to come back to have things out once
for all."

Then she sat down on a low chair by the table, and, leaning her head on
the arm of the sofa, wept bitterly. In the drawing-room there was only
one candle burning in the candelabra, and the chair where she was
sitting was in darkness; but I saw how her head and shoulders were
quivering, and how her hair, escaping from her combs, covered her neck,
her face, her arms.... Her quiet, steady weeping, which was not
hysterical but a woman''s ordinary weeping, expressed a sense of insult,
of wounded pride, of injury, and of something helpless, hopeless, which
one could not set right and to which one could not get used. Her tears
stirred an echo in my troubled and suffering heart; I forgot my illness
and everything else in the world; I walked about the drawing-room and
muttered distractedly:

"Is this life?... Oh, one can''t go on living like this, one can''t....
Oh, it''s madness, wickedness, not life."

"What humiliation!" she said through her tears. "To live together, to
smile at me at the very time when I was burdensome to him, ridiculous in
his eyes! Oh, how humiliating!"

She lifted up her head, and looking at me with tear-stained eyes through
her hair, wet with her tears, and pushing it back as it prevented her
seeing me, she asked:

"To these men you were laughable—you and your love and Turgenev; they
said your head was full of him. And if we both die at once in despair,
that will amuse them, too; they will make a funny anecdote of it and
tell it at your requiem service. But why talk of them?" I said
impatiently. "We must get away from here—I cannot stay here one minute
longer."

"Why do you talk like that? We had better consider together what we are
to do. Neither you nor I can stay here. Where do you intend to go?"

Suddenly there was a ring at the bell. My heart stood still. Could it be
Orlov, to whom perhaps Kukushkin had complained of me? How should we
meet? I went to open the door. It was Polya. She came in shaking the
snow off her pelisse, and went into her room without saying a word to
me. When I went back to the drawing-room, Zinaida Fyodorovna, pale as
death, was standing in the middle of the room, looking towards me with
big eyes.

"I will go away at once," she said. "Will you be kind and take me to the
Petersburg Side? What time is it now?"

When, a little afterwards, we went out of the house, it was dark and
deserted in the street. Wet snow was falling and a damp wind lashed in
one''s face. I remember it was the beginning of March; a thaw had set in,
and for some days past the cabmen had been driving on wheels. Under the
impression of the back stairs, of the cold, of the midnight darkness,
and the porter in his sheepskin who had questioned us before letting us
out of the gate, Zinaida Fyodorovna was utterly cast down and
dispirited. When we got into the cab and the hood was put up, trembling
all over, she began hurriedly saying how grateful she was to me.

"I do not doubt your good-will, but I am ashamed that you should be
troubled," she muttered. "Oh, I understand, I understand.... When Gruzin
was here to-day, I felt that he was lying and concealing something.
Well, so be it. But I am ashamed, anyway, that you should be troubled."

She still had her doubts. To dispel them finally, I asked the cabman to
drive through Sergievsky Street; stopping him at Pekarsky''s door, I got
out of the cab and rang. When the porter came to the door, I asked
aloud, that Zinaida Fyodorovna might hear, whether Georgy Ivanitch was
at home.

Then we drove on. The cab had no apron, the snow fell on us in big
flakes, and the wind, especially on the Neva, pierced us through and
through. I began to feel as though we had been driving for a long time,
that for ages we had been suffering, and that for ages I had been
listening to Zinaida Fyodorovna''s shuddering breath. In semi-delirium,
as though half asleep, I looked back upon my strange, incoherent life,
and for some reason recalled a melodrama, "The Parisian Beggars," which
I had seen once or twice in my childhood. And when to shake off that
semi-delirium I peeped out from the hood and saw the dawn, all the
images of the past, all my misty thoughts, for some reason, blended in
me into one distinct, overpowering thought: everything was irrevocably
over for Zinaida Fyodorovna and for me. This was as certain a conviction
as though the cold blue sky contained a prophecy, but a minute later I
was already thinking of something else and believed differently.

"What am I now?" said Zinaida Fyodorovna, in a voice husky with the cold
and the damp. "Where am I to go? What am I to do? Gruzin told me to go
into a nunnery. Oh, I would! I would change my dress, my face, my name,
my thoughts ... everything—everything, and would hide myself for ever.
But they will not take me into a nunnery. I am with child."

The cabman stopped at a wooden house of two storeys, painted a dark
colour. I rang. Taking from me her small light basket—the only luggage
we had brought with us—Zinaida Fyodorovna gave a wry smile and said:

It was a long while before the door was opened. After the third or
fourth ring a light gleamed in the windows, and there was a sound of
steps, coughing and whispering; at last the key grated in the lock, and
a stout peasant woman with a frightened red face appeared at the door.
Some distance behind her stood a thin little old woman with short grey
hair, carrying a candle in her hand. Zinaida Fyodorovna ran into the
passage and flung her arms round the old woman''s neck.

I handed the basket to the peasant woman. The door was closed, but still
I heard her sobs and the cry "Nina!"

I got into the cab and told the man to drive slowly to the Nevsky
Prospect. I had to think of a night''s lodging for myself.

Next day towards evening I went to see Zinaida Fyodorovna. She was
terribly changed. There were no traces of tears on her pale, terribly
sunken face, and her expression was different. I don''t know whether it
was that I saw her now in different surroundings, far from luxurious,
and that our relations were by now different, or perhaps that intense
grief had already set its mark upon her; she did not strike me as so
elegant and well dressed as before. Her figure seemed smaller; there was
an abruptness and excessive nervousness about her as though she were in
a hurry, and there was not the same softness even in her smile. I was
dressed in an expensive suit which I had bought during the day. She
looked first of all at that suit and at the hat in my hand, then turned
an impatient, searching glance upon my face as though studying it.

"Your transformation still seems to me a sort of miracle," she said.
"Forgive me for looking at you with such curiosity. You are an
extraordinary man, you know."

I told her again who I was, and why I was living at Orlov''s, and I told
her at greater length and in more detail than the day before. She
listened with great attention, and said without letting me finish:

"Everything there is over for me. You know, I could not refrain from
writing a letter. Here is the answer."

"I am not going to justify myself. But you must own that it was your
mistake, not mine. I wish you happiness, and beg you to make haste and
forget.

The trunks and baskets despatched by Orlov were standing in the passage,
and my poor little portmanteau was there beside them.

We were silent. She took the note and held it for a couple of minutes
before her eyes, and during that time her face wore the same haughty,
contemptuous, proud, and harsh expression as the day before at the
beginning of our explanation; tears came into her eyes—not timid,
bitter tears, but proud, angry tears.

"Listen," she said, getting up abruptly and moving away to the window
that I might not see her face. "I have made up my mind to go abroad with
you tomorrow."

"Accept me as a recruit. Have you read Balzac?" she asked suddenly,
turning round. "Have you? At the end of his novel ''PÃ¨re Goriot'' the hero
looks down upon Paris from the top of a hill and threatens the town:
''Now we shall settle our account,'' and after this he begins a new life.
So when I look out of the train window at Petersburg for the last time,
I shall say, ''Now we shall settle our account!''"

At Venice I had an attack of pleurisy. Probably I had caught cold in the
evening when we were rowing from the station to the Hotel Bauer. I had
to take to my bed and stay there for a fortnight. Every morning while I
was ill Zinaida Fyodorovna came from her room to drink coffee with me,
and afterwards read aloud to me French and Russian books, of which we
had bought a number at Vienna. These books were either long, long
familiar to me or else had no interest for me, but I had the sound of a
sweet, kind voice beside me, so that the meaning of all of them was
summed up for me in the one thing—I was not alone. She would go out for
a walk, come back in her light grey dress, her light straw hat, gay,
warmed by the spring sun; and sitting by my bed, bending low down over
me, would tell me something about Venice or read me those books—and I
was happy.

At night I was cold, ill, and dreary, but by day I revelled in life—I
can find no better expression for it. The brilliant warm sunshine
beating in at the open windows and at the door upon the balcony, the
shouts below, the splash of oars, the tinkle of bells, the prolonged
boom of the cannon at midday, and the feeling of perfect, perfect
freedom, did wonders with me; I felt as though I were growing strong,
broad wings which were bearing me God knows whither. And what charm,
what joy at times at the thought that another life was so close to mine!
that I was the servant, the guardian, the friend, the indispensable
fellow-traveller of a creature, young, beautiful, wealthy, but weak,
lonely, and insulted! It is pleasant even to be ill when you know that
there are people who are looking forward to your convalescence as to a
holiday. One day I heard her whispering behind the door with my doctor,
and then she came in to me with tear-stained eyes. It was a bad sign,
but I was touched, and there was a wonderful lightness in my heart.

But at last they allowed me to go out on the balcony. The sunshine and
the breeze from the sea caressed and fondled my sick body. I looked down
at the familiar gondolas, which glide with feminine grace smoothly and
majestically as though they were alive, and felt all the luxury of this
original, fascinating civilisation. There was a smell of the sea. Some
one was playing a stringed instrument and two voices were singing. How
delightful it was! How unlike it was to that Petersburg night when the
wet snow was falling and beating so rudely on our faces. If one looks
straight across the canal, one sees the sea, and on the wide expanse
towards the horizon the sun glittered on the water so dazzlingly that it
hurt one''s eyes to look at it. My soul yearned towards that lovely sea,
which was so akin to me and to which I had given up my youth. I longed
to live—to live—and nothing more.

A fortnight later I began walking freely. I loved to sit in the sun, and
to listen to the gondoliers without understanding them, and for hours
together to gaze at the little house where, they said, Desdemona
lived—a naÃ¯ve, mournful little house with a demure expression, as light
as lace, so light that it looked as though one could lift it from its
place with one hand. I stood for a long time by the tomb of Canova, and
could not take my eyes off the melancholy lion. And in the Palace of the
Doges I was always drawn to the corner where the portrait of the unhappy
Marino Faliero was painted over with black. "It is fine to be an artist,
a poet, a dramatist," I thought, "but since that is not vouchsafed to
me, if only I could go in for mysticism! If only I had a grain of some
faith to add to the unruffled peace and serenity that fills the soul!"

In the evening we ate oysters, drank wine, and went out in a gondola. I
remember our black gondola swayed softly in the same place while the
water faintly gurgled under it. Here and there the reflection of the
stars and the lights on the bank quivered and trembled. Not far from us
in a gondola, hung with coloured lanterns which were reflected in the
water, there were people singing. The sounds of guitars, of violins, of
mandolins, of men''s and women''s voices, were audible in the dark.
Zinaida Fyodorovna, pale, with a grave, almost stern face, was sitting
beside me, compressing her lips and clenching her hands. She was
thinking about something; she did not stir an eyelash, nor hear me. Her
face, her attitude, and her fixed, expressionless gaze, and her
incredibly miserable, dreadful, and icy-cold memories, and around her
the gondolas, the lights, the music, the song with its vigorous
passionate cry of "Jam-mo! Jam-mo!"—what contrasts in life! When she
sat like that, with tightly clasped hands, stony, mournful, I used to
feel as though we were both characters in some novel in the
old-fashioned style called "The Ill-fated," "The Abandoned," or
something of the sort. Both of us: she—the ill-fated, the abandoned;
and I—the faithful, devoted friend, the dreamer, and, if you like it, a
superfluous man, a failure capable of nothing but coughing and dreaming,
and perhaps sacrificing myself.

When we came in in the evening we always drank tea in her room and
talked. We did not shrink from touching on old, unhealed wounds—on the
contrary, for some reason I felt a positive pleasure in telling her
about my life at Orlov''s, or referring openly to relations which I knew
and which could not have been concealed from me.

"At moments I hated you," I said to her. "When he was capricious,
condescending, told you lies, I marvelled how it was you did not see,
did not understand, when it was all so clear! You kissed his hands, you
knelt to him, you flattered him ..."

"Can it have been so difficult to see through him? A fine sphinx! A
sphinx indeed—a kammer-junker! I reproach you for nothing, God
forbid," I went on, feeling I was coarse, that I had not the tact, the
delicacy which are so essential when you have to do with a
fellow-creature''s soul; in early days before I knew her I had not
noticed this defect in myself. "But how could you fail to see what he
was," I went on, speaking more softly and more diffidently, however.

"You mean to say you despise my past, and you are right," she said,
deeply stirred. "You belong to a special class of men who cannot be
judged by ordinary standards; your moral requirements are exceptionally
rigorous, and I understand you can''t forgive things. I understand you,
and if sometimes I say the opposite, it doesn''t mean that I look at
things differently from you; I speak the same old nonsense simply
because I haven''t had time yet to wear out my old clothes and
prejudices. I, too, hate and despise my past, and Orlov and my love....
What was that love? It''s positively absurd now," she said, going to the
window and looking down at the canal. "All this love only clouds the
conscience and confuses the mind. The meaning of life is to be found
only in one thing—fighting. To get one''s heel on the vile head of the
serpent and to crush it! That''s the meaning of life. In that alone or in
nothing."

I told her long stories of my past, and described my really astounding
adventures. But of the change that had taken place in me I did not say
one word. She always listened to me with great attention, and at
interesting places she rubbed her hands as though vexed that it had not
yet been her lot to experience such adventures, such joys and terrors.
Then she would suddenly fall to musing and retreat into herself, and I
could see from her face that she was not attending to me.

I closed the windows that looked out on the canal and asked whether we
should not have the fire lighted.

"No, never mind. I am not cold," she said, smiling listlessly. "I only
feel weak. Do you know, I fancy I have grown much wiser lately. I have
extraordinary, original ideas now. When I think of my past, of my life
then ... people in general, in fact, it is all summed up for me in the
image of my stepmother. Coarse, insolent, soulless, false, depraved, and
a morphia maniac too. My father, who was feeble and weak-willed, married
my mother for her money and drove her into consumption; but his second
wife, my stepmother, he loved passionately, insanely.... What I had to
put up with! But what is the use of talking! And so, as I say, it is all
summed up in her image.... And it vexes me that my stepmother is dead. I
should like to meet her now!"

"I don''t know," she answered with a laugh and a graceful movement of her
head. "Good-night. You must get well. As soon as you are well, we''ll
take up our work ... It''s time to begin."

And I went off to my room. So we spent a whole month. One grey morning
when we both stood at my window, looking at the clouds which were moving
up from the sea, and at the darkening canal, expecting every minute that
it would pour with rain, and when a thick, narrow streak of rain covered
the sea as though with a muslin veil, we both felt suddenly dreary. The
same day we both set off for Florence.

It was autumn, at Nice. One morning when I went into her room she was
sitting on a low chair, bent together and huddled up, with her legs
crossed and her face hidden in her hands. She was weeping bitterly, with
sobs, and her long, unbrushed hair fell on her knees. The impression of
the exquisite marvellous sea which I had only just seen and of which I
wanted to tell her, left me all at once, and my heart ached.

"What is it?" I asked; she took one hand from her face and motioned me
to go away. "What is it?" I repeated, and for the first time during our
acquaintance I kissed her hand.

"No, it''s nothing, nothing," she said quickly. "Oh, it''s nothing,
nothing.... Go away.... You see, I am not dressed."

I went out overwhelmed. The calm and serene mood in which I had been for
so long was poisoned by compassion. I had a passionate longing to fall
at her feet, to entreat her not to weep in solitude, but to share her
grief with me, and the monotonous murmur of the sea already sounded a
gloomy prophecy in my ears, and I foresaw fresh tears, fresh troubles,
and fresh losses in the future. "What is she crying about? What is it?"
I wondered, recalling her face and her agonised look. I remembered she
was with child. She tried to conceal her condition from other people,
and also from herself. At home she went about in a loose wrapper or in a
blouse with extremely full folds over the bosom, and when she went out
anywhere she laced herself in so tightly that on two occasions she
fainted when we were out. She never spoke to me of her condition, and
when I hinted that it might be as well to see a doctor, she flushed
crimson and said not a word.

"There, there," I said, seeing that she was ready to cry again. "We had
better go to the sea and have a talk."

"I can''t talk. Forgive me, I am in the mood now when one wants to be
alone. And, if you please, Vladimir Ivanitch, another time you want to
come into my room, be so good as to give a knock at the door."

That "be so good" had a peculiar, unfeminine sound. I went away. My
accursed Petersburg mood came back, and all my dreams were crushed and
crumpled up like leaves by the heat. I felt I was alone again and there
was no nearness between us. I was no more to her than that cobweb to
that palm-tree, which hangs on it by chance and which will be torn off
and carried away by the wind. I walked about the square where the band
was playing, went into the Casino; there I looked at overdressed and
heavily perfumed women, and every one of them glanced at me as though
she would say: "You are alone; that''s all right." Then I went out on the
terrace and looked for a long time at the sea. There was not one sail on
the horizon. On the left bank, in the lilac-coloured mist, there were
mountains, gardens, towers, and houses, the sun was sparkling over it
all, but it was all alien, indifferent, an incomprehensible tangle.

She used as before to come into my room in the morning to coffee, but we
no longer dined together, as she said she was not hungry; and she lived
only on coffee, tea, and various trifles such as oranges and caramels.

And we no longer had conversations in the evening. I don''t know why it
was like this. Ever since the day when I had found her in tears she had
treated me somehow lightly, at times casually, even ironically, and for
some reason called me "My good sir." What had before seemed to her
terrible, heroic, marvellous, and had stirred her envy and enthusiasm,
did not touch her now at all, and usually after listening to me, she
stretched and said:

It sometimes happened even that I did not see her for days together. I
would knock timidly and guiltily at her door and get no answer; I would
knock again—still silence.... I would stand near the door and listen;
then the chambermaid would pass and say coldly, "Madame est partie."
Then I would walk about the passages of the hotel, walk and walk....
English people, full-bosomed ladies, waiters in swallow-tails.... And as
I keep gazing at the long striped rug that stretches the whole length of
the corridor, the idea occurs to me that I am playing in the life of
this woman a strange, probably false part, and that it is beyond my
power to alter that part. I run to my room and fall on my bed, and think
and think, and can come to no conclusion; and all that is clear to me is
that I want to live, and that the plainer and the colder and the harder
her face grows, the nearer she is to me, and the more intensely and
painfully I feel our kinship. Never mind "My good sir," never mind her
light careless tone, never mind anything you like, only don''t leave me,
my treasure. I am afraid to be alone.

Then I go out into the corridor again, listen in a tremor.... I have no
dinner; I don''t notice the approach of evening. At last about eleven I
hear the familiar footstep, and at the turn near the stairs Zinaida
Fyodorovna comes into sight.

"Are you taking a walk?" she would ask as she passes me. "You had better
go out into the air.... Good-night!"

"Where? To Monte Carlo." She took ten gold coins out of her pocket and
said: "Look, my good sir; I have won. That''s at roulette."

I imagined her with a sick and morbid face, in her condition, tightly
laced, standing near the gaming-table in a crowd of cocottes, of old
women in their dotage who swarm round the gold like flies round the
honey. I remembered she had gone off to Monte Carlo for some reason in
secret from me.

"It''s not the question of what you lose," I said with annoyance. "Has it
never occurred to you while you were playing there that the glitter of
gold, all these women, young and old, the croupiers, all the
surroundings—that it is all a vile, loathsome mockery at the toiler''s
labour, at his bloody sweat?"

"If one doesn''t play, what is one to do here?" she asked. "The toiler''s
labour and his bloody sweat—all that eloquence you can put off till
another time; but now, since you have begun, let me go on. Let me ask
you bluntly, what is there for me to do here, and what am I to do?"

"What are you to do?" I said, shrugging my shoulders. "That''s a question
that can''t be answered straight off."

"I beg you to answer me honestly, Vladimir Ivanitch," she said, and her
face looked angry. "Once I have brought myself to ask you this question,
I am not going to listen to stock phrases. I am asking you," she went
on, beating her hand on the table, as though marking time, "what ought I
to do here? And not only here at Nice, but in general?"

"Vladimir Ivanitch," she said softly and breathlessly; it was hard for
her to speak—"Vladimir Ivanitch, if you do not believe in the cause
yourself, if you no longer think of going back to it, why ... why did
you drag me out of Petersburg? Why did you make me promises, why did you
rouse mad hopes? Your convictions have changed; you have become a
different man, and nobody blames you for it—our convictions are not
always in our power. But ... but, Vladimir Ivanitch, for God''s sake, why
are you not sincere?" she went on softly, coming up to me. "All these
months when I have been dreaming aloud, raving, going into raptures over
my plans, remodelling my life on a new pattern, why didn''t you tell me
the truth? Why were you silent or encouraged me by your stories, and
behaved as though you were in complete sympathy with me? Why was it? Why
was it necessary?"

"It''s difficult to acknowledge one''s bankruptcy," I said, turning round,
but not looking at her. "Yes, I have no faith; I am worn out. I have
lost heart.... It is difficult to be truthful—very difficult, and I
held my tongue. God forbid that any one should have to go through what I
have been through."

"Vladimir Ivanitch," she said, and took me by both hands, "you have been
through so much and seen so much of life, you know more than I do; think
seriously, and tell me, what am I to do? Teach me! If you haven''t the
strength to go forward yourself and take others with you, at least show
me where to go. After all, I am a living, feeling, thinking being. To
sink into a false position ... to play an absurd part ... is painful to
me. I don''t reproach you, I don''t blame you; I only ask you."

"There is more light in the world than you see through your window," I
answered. "And there are other people besides me, Zinaida Fyodorovna."

"And I want to say, too," I went on, "one can serve an idea in more than
one calling. If one has made a mistake and lost faith in one, one may
find another. The world of ideas is large and cannot be exhausted."

"The world of ideas!" she said, and she looked into my face
sarcastically. "Then we had better leave off talking. What''s the
use?..."

"The world of ideas!" she repeated. She threw her dinner-napkin aside,
and an expression of indignation and contempt came into her face. "All
your fine ideas, I see, lead up to one inevitable, essential step: I
ought to become your mistress. That''s what''s wanted. To be taken up with
ideas without being the mistress of an honourable, progressive man, is
as good as not understanding the ideas. One has to begin with that ...
that is, with being your mistress, and the rest will come of itself."

"I am in error?" she laughed. "Any one else might say that, but not you,
my dear sir! I may seem to you indelicate, cruel, but I don''t care: you
love me? You love me, don''t you?"

"Yes, shrug your shoulders!" she went on sarcastically. "When you were
ill I heard you in your delirium, and ever since these adoring eyes,
these sighs, and edifying conversations about friendship, about
spiritual kinship.... But the point is, why haven''t you been sincere?
Why have you concealed what is and talked about what isn''t? Had you said
from the beginning what ideas exactly led you to drag me from
Petersburg, I should have known. I should have poisoned myself then as I
meant to, and there would have been none of this tedious farce.... But
what''s the use of talking!"

"Oh, very well. What''s the use of talking! I don''t suspect you of
intentions, but of having no intentions. If you had any, I should have
known them by now. You had nothing but ideas and love. For the
present—ideas and love, and in prospect—me as your mistress. That''s in
the order of things both in life and in novels.... Here you abused him,"
she said, and she slapped the table with her hand, "but one can''t help
agreeing with him. He has good reasons for despising these ideas."

"Oh, very well. He is a coward and a liar, and deceived me. And you?
Excuse my frankness; what are you? He deceived me and left me to take my
chance in Petersburg, and you have deceived me and abandoned me here.
But he did not mix up ideas with his deceit, and you ..."

"For goodness'' sake, why are you saying this?" I cried in horror,
wringing my hands and going up to her quickly. "No, Zinaida Fyodorovna,
this is cynicism. You must not be so despairing; listen to me," I went
on, catching at a thought which flashed dimly upon me, and which seemed
to me might still save us both. "Listen. I have passed through so many
experiences in my time that my head goes round at the thought of them,
and I have realised with my mind, with my racked soul, that man finds
his true destiny in nothing if not in self-sacrificing love for his
neighbour. It is towards that we must strive, and that is our
destination! That is my faith!"

I wanted to go on to speak of mercy, of forgiveness, but there was an
insincere note in my voice, and I was embarrassed.

"I want to live!" I said genuinely. "To live, to live! I want peace,
tranquillity; I want warmth—this sea here—to have you near. Oh, how I
wish I could rouse in you the same thirst for life! You spoke just now
of love, but it would be enough for me to have you near, to hear your
voice, to watch the look in your face ...!"

"I imagine it is better to cut short this conversation," she said to me
from within. "Everything is over for me, and I want nothing.... What
more is there to say?"

I got up, took a turn from one end of the room to the other, and went
out into the corridor. When late at night I went to her door and
listened, I distinctly heard her crying.

Next morning the waiter, handing me my clothes, informed me, with a
smile, that the lady in number thirteen was confined. I dressed somehow,
and almost fainting with terror ran to Zinaida Fyodorovna. In her room I
found a doctor, a midwife, and an elderly Russian lady from Harkov,
called Darya Milhailovna. There was a smell of ether. I had scarcely
crossed the threshold when from the room where she was lying I heard a
low, plaintive moan, and, as though it had been wafted me by the wind
from Russia, I thought of Orlov, his irony, Polya, the Neva, the
drifting snow, then the cab without an apron, the prediction I had read
in the cold morning sky, and the despairing cry "Nina! Nina!"

I went in to see Zinaida Fyodorovna, feeling as though I were the father
of the child. She was lying with her eyes closed, looking thin and pale,
wearing a white cap edged with lace. I remember there were two
expressions on her face: one—cold, indifferent, apathetic; the other—a
look of childish helplessness given her by the white cap. She did not
hear me come in, or heard, perhaps, but did not pay attention. I stood,
looked at her, and waited.

But her face was contorted with pain; she opened her eyes and gazed at
the ceiling, as though wondering what was happening to her.... There was
a look of loathing on her face.

"Zinaida Fyodorovna." I spoke her name softly. She looked at me
indifferently, listlessly, and closed her eyes. I stood there a little
while, then went away.

At night, Darya Mihailovna informed me that the child, a girl, was born,
but that the mother was in a dangerous condition. Then I heard noise and
bustle in the passage. Darya Mihailovna came to me again and with a face
of despair, wringing her hands, said:

"Oh, this is awful! The doctor suspects that she has taken poison! Oh,
how badly Russians do behave here!"

Two years had passed. Circumstances had changed; I had come to
Petersburg again and could live here openly. I was no longer afraid of
being and seeming sentimental, and gave myself up entirely to the
fatherly, or rather idolatrous feeling roused in me by Sonya, Zinaida
Fyodorovna''s child. I fed her with my own hands, gave her her bath, put
her to bed, never took my eyes off her for nights together, and screamed
when it seemed to me that the nurse was just going to drop her. My
thirst for normal ordinary life became stronger and more acute as time
went on, but wider visions stopped short at Sonya, as though I had found
in her at last just what I needed. I loved the child madly. In her I saw
the continuation of my life, and it was not exactly that I fancied, but
I felt, I almost believed, that when I had cast off at last my long,
bony, bearded frame, I should go on living in those little blue eyes,
that silky flaxen hair, those dimpled pink hands which stroked my face
so lovingly and were clasped round my neck.

Sonya''s future made me anxious. Orlov was her father; in her birth
certificate she was called Krasnovsky, and the only person who knew of
her existence, and took interest in her—that is, I—was at death''s
door. I had to think about her seriously.

The day after I arrived in Petersburg I went to see Orlov. The door was
opened to me by a stout old fellow with red whiskers and no moustache,
who looked like a German. Polya, who was tidying the drawing-room, did
not recognise me, but Orlov knew me at once.

"Ah, Mr. Revolutionist!" he said, looking at me with curiosity, and
laughing. "What fate has brought you?"

He was not changed in the least: the same well-groomed, unpleasant face,
the same irony. And a new book was lying on the table just as of old,
with an ivory paper-knife thrust in it. He had evidently been reading
before I came in. He made me sit down, offered me a cigar, and with a
delicacy only found in well-bred people, concealing the unpleasant
feeling aroused by my face and my wasted figure, observed casually that
I was not in the least changed, and that he would have known me anywhere
in spite of my having grown a beard. We talked of the weather, of Paris.
To dispose as quickly as possible of the oppressive, inevitable
question, which weighed upon him and me, he asked:

"Yes, in childbirth. The doctor suspected another cause of death, but
... it is more comforting for you and for me to think that she died in
childbirth."

"Yes. And here everything is as it used to be—no changes," he said
briskly, seeing that I was looking about the room. "My father, as you
know, has left the service and is living in retirement; I am still in
the same department. Do you remember Pekarsky? He is just the same as
ever. Gruzin died of diphtheria a year ago.... Kukushkin is alive, and
often speaks of you. By the way," said Orlov, dropping his eyes with an
air of reserve, "when Kukushkin heard who you were, he began telling
every one you had attacked him and tried to murder him ... and that he
only just escaped with his life."

"Old servants do not forget their masters.... It''s very nice of you,"
said Orlov jocosely. "Will you have some wine and some coffee, though? I
will tell them to make some."

"I am not very fond of important matters, but I shall be glad to be of
service to you. What do you want?"

"You see," I began, growing agitated, "I have here with me Zinaida
Fyodorovna''s daughter.... Hitherto I have brought her up, but, as you
see, before many days I shall be an empty sound. I should like to die
with the thought that she is provided for."

Orlov coloured a little, frowned a little, and took a cursory and sullen
glance at me. He was unpleasantly affected, not so much by the
"important matter" as by my words about death, about becoming an empty
sound.

"Yes, it must be thought about," he said, screening his eyes as though
from the sun. "Thank you. You say it''s a girl?"

"Yes. Of course, it''s not a lap-dog, but a human being. I understand we
must consider it seriously. I am prepared to do my part, and am very
grateful to you."

"We must think about it," he said in a hollow voice, standing with his
back to me. "I shall go to Pekarsky''s to-day and will ask him to go to
Krasnovsky''s. I don''t think he will make much ado about consenting to
take the child."

"But, excuse me, I don''t see what Krasnovsky has got to do with it," I
said, also getting up and walking to a picture at the other end of the
room.

"Yes, he may be legally obliged to accept the child—I don''t know; but I
came to you, Georgy Ivanitch, not to discuss the legal aspect."

"Yes, yes, you are right," he agreed briskly. "I believe I am talking
nonsense. But don''t excite yourself. We will decide the matter to our
mutual satisfaction. If one thing won''t do, we''ll try another; and if
that won''t do, we''ll try a third—one way or another this delicate
question shall be settled. Pekarsky will arrange it all. Be so good as
to leave me your address and I will let you know at once what we decide.
Where are you living?"

"Oh, Lord, what a job it is to be the father of a little daughter! But
Pekarsky will arrange it all. He is a sensible man. Did you stay long in
Paris?"

We were silent. Orlov was evidently afraid I should begin talking of the
child again, and to turn my attention in another direction, said:

"You have probably forgotten your letter by now. But I have kept it. I
understand your mood at the time, and, I must own, I respect that
letter. ''Damnable cold blood,'' ''Asiatic,'' ''coarse laugh''—that was
charming and characteristic," he went on with an ironical smile. "And
the fundamental thought is perhaps near the truth, though one might
dispute the question endlessly. That is," he hesitated, "not dispute the
thought itself, but your attitude to the question—your temperament, so
to say. Yes, my life is abnormal, corrupted, of no use to any one, and
what prevents me from beginning a new life is cowardice—there you are
quite right. But that you take it so much to heart, are troubled, and
reduced to despair by it—that''s irrational; there you are quite wrong."

"A living man cannot help being troubled and reduced to despair when he
sees that he himself is going to ruin and others are going to ruin round
him."

"Who doubts it! I am not advocating indifference; all I ask for is an
objective attitude to life. The more objective, the less danger of
falling into error. One must look into the root of things, and try to
see in every phenomenon a cause of all the other causes. We have grown
feeble, slack—degraded, in fact. Our generation is entirely composed of
neurasthenics and whimperers; we do nothing but talk of fatigue and
exhaustion. But the fault is neither yours nor mine; we are of too
little consequence to affect the destiny of a whole generation. We must
suppose for that larger, more general causes with a solid raison
d''Ãªtre from the biological point of view. We are neurasthenics, flabby,
renegades, but perhaps it''s necessary and of service for generations
that will come after us. Not one hair falls from the head without the
will of the Heavenly Father—in other words, nothing happens by chance
in Nature and in human environment. Everything has its cause and is
inevitable. And if so, why should we worry and write despairing
letters?"

"That''s all very well," I said, thinking a little. "I believe it will be
easier and clearer for the generations to come; our experience will be
at their service. But one wants to live apart from future generations
and not only for their sake. Life is only given us once, and one wants
to live it boldly, with full consciousness and beauty. One wants to play
a striking, independent, noble part; one wants to make history so that
those generations may not have the right to say of each of us that we
were nonentities or worse.... I believe what is going on about us is
inevitable and not without a purpose, but what have I to do with that
inevitability? Why should my ego be lost?"

"Well, there''s no help for it," sighed Orlov, getting up and, as it
were, giving me to understand that our conversation was over.

"We''ve only been sitting here half an hour, and how many questions we
have settled, when you come to think of it!" said Orlov, seeing me into
the hall. "So I will see to that matter.... I will see Pekarsky
to-day.... Don''t be uneasy."

He stood waiting while I put on my coat, and was obviously relieved at
the feeling that I was going away.

The next day I got a letter from him. He congratulated me on the
satisfactory settlement of the question. Pekarsky knew a lady, he wrote,
who kept a school, something like a kindergarten, where she took quite
little children. The lady could be entirely depended upon, but before
concluding anything with her it would be as well to discuss the matter
with Krasnovsky—it was a matter of form. He advised me to see Pekarsky
at once and to take the birth certificate with me, if I had it. "Rest
assured of the sincere respect and devotion of your humble servant...."

I read this letter, and Sonya sat on the table and gazed at me
attentively without blinking, as though she knew her fate was being
decided.

IN the course of the manoeuvres the N—— cavalry regiment halted for a
night at the district town of K——. Such an event as the visit of
officers always has the most exciting and inspiring effect on the
inhabitants of provincial towns. The shopkeepers dream of getting rid of
the rusty sausages and "best brand" sardines that have been lying for
ten years on their shelves; the inns and restaurants keep open all
night; the Military Commandant, his secretary, and the local garrison
put on their best uniforms; the police flit to and fro like mad, while
the effect on the ladies is beyond all description.

The ladies of K——, hearing the regiment approaching, forsook their
pans of boiling jam and ran into the street. Forgetting their morning
deshabille and general untidiness, they rushed breathless with
excitement to meet the regiment, and listened greedily to the band
playing the march. Looking at their pale, ecstatic faces, one might have
thought those strains came from some heavenly choir rather than from a
military brass band.

What could this unknown regiment that came by chance to-day and would
depart at dawn to-morrow mean to them?

Afterwards, when the officers were standing in the middle of the square,
and, with their hands behind them, discussing the question of billets,
all the ladies were gathered together at the examining magistrate''s and
vying with one another in their criticisms of the regiment. They already
knew, goodness knows how, that the colonel was married, but not living
with his wife; that the senior officer''s wife had a baby born dead every
year; that the adjutant was hopelessly in love with some countess, and
had even once attempted suicide. They knew everything. When a
pock-marked soldier in a red shirt darted past the windows, they knew
for certain that it was Lieutenant Rymzov''s orderly running about the
town, trying to get some English bitter ale on tick for his master. They
had only caught a passing glimpse of the officers'' backs, but had
already decided that there was not one handsome or interesting man among
them.... Having talked to their hearts'' content, they sent for the
Military Commandant and the committee of the club, and instructed them
at all costs to make arrangements for a dance.

Their wishes were carried out. At nine o''clock in the evening the
military band was playing in the street before the club, while in the
club itself the officers were dancing with the ladies of K——. The
ladies felt as though they were on wings. Intoxicated by the dancing,
the music, and the clank of spurs, they threw themselves heart and soul
into making the acquaintance of their new partners, and quite forgot
their old civilian friends. Their fathers and husbands, forced
temporarily into the background, crowded round the meagre refreshment
table in the entrance hall. All these government cashiers, secretaries,
clerks, and superintendents—stale, sickly-looking, clumsy figures—were
perfectly well aware of their inferiority. They did not even enter the
ball-room, but contented themselves with watching their wives and
daughters in the distance dancing with the accomplished and graceful
officers.

Among the husbands was Shalikov, the tax-collector—a narrow, spiteful
soul, given to drink, with a big, closely cropped head, and thick,
protruding lips. He had had a university education; there had been a
time when he used to read progressive literature and sing students''
songs, but now, as he said of himself, he was a tax-collector and
nothing more.

He stood leaning against the doorpost, his eyes fixed on his wife, Anna
Pavlovna, a little brunette of thirty, with a long nose and a pointed
chin. Tightly laced, with her face carefully powdered, she danced
without pausing for breath—danced till she was ready to drop exhausted.
But though she was exhausted in body, her spirit was inexhaustible....
One could see as she danced that her thoughts were with the past, that
faraway past when she used to dance at the "College for Young Ladies,"
dreaming of a life of luxury and gaiety, and never doubting that her
husband was to be a prince or, at the worst, a baron.

It was not jealousy he was feeling. He was ill-humoured—first, because
the room was taken up with dancing and there was nowhere he could play a
game of cards; secondly, because he could not endure the sound of wind
instruments; and, thirdly, because he fancied the officers treated the
civilians somewhat too casually and disdainfully. But what above
everything revolted him and moved him to indignation was the expression
of happiness on his wife''s face.

"It makes me sick to look at her!" he muttered. "Going on for forty, and
nothing to boast of at any time, and she must powder her face and lace
herself up! And frizzing her hair! Flirting and making faces, and
fancying she''s doing the thing in style! Ugh! you''re a pretty figure,
upon my soul!"

"We are at a discount now.... We''re clumsy seals, unpolished provincial
bears, and she''s the queen of the ball! She has kept enough of her looks
to please even officers ... They''d not object to making love to her, I
dare say!"

During the mazurka the tax-collector''s face twitched with spite. A
black-haired officer with prominent eyes and Tartar cheekbones danced
the mazurka with Anna Pavlovna. Assuming a stern expression, he worked
his legs with gravity and feeling, and so crooked his knees that he
looked like a jack-a-dandy pulled by strings, while Anna Pavlovna, pale
and thrilled, bending her figure languidly and turning her eyes up,
tried to look as though she scarcely touched the floor, and evidently
felt herself that she was not on earth, not at the local club, but
somewhere far, far away—in the clouds. Not only her face but her whole
figure was expressive of beatitude.... The tax-collector could endure it
no longer; he felt a desire to jeer at that beatitude, to make Anna
Pavlovna feel that she had forgotten herself, that life was by no means
so delightful as she fancied now in her excitement....

"You wait; I''ll teach you to smile so blissfully," he muttered. "You are
not a boarding-school miss, you are not a girl. An old fright ought to
realise she is a fright!"

Petty feelings of envy, vexation, wounded vanity, of that small,
provincial misanthropy engendered in petty officials by vodka and a
sedentary life, swarmed in his heart like mice. Waiting for the end of
the mazurka, he went into the hall and walked up to his wife. Anna
Pavlovna was sitting with her partner, and, flirting her fan and
coquettishly dropping her eyelids, was describing how she used to dance
in Petersburg (her lips were pursed up like a rosebud, and she
pronounced "at home in PÃ¼tÃ¼rsburg").

Seeing her husband standing before her, Anna Pavlovna started as though
recalling the fact that she had a husband; then she flushed all over:
she felt ashamed that she had such a sickly-looking, ill-humoured,
ordinary husband.

"Nothing has happened, but I wish you to go home at once.... I wish it;
that''s enough, and without further talk, please."

Anna Pavlovna was not afraid of her husband, but she felt ashamed on
account of her partner, who was looking at her husband with surprise and
amusement. She got up and moved a little apart with her husband.

The tax-collector saw the look of beatitude gradually vanish from his
wife''s face, saw how ashamed and miserable she was—and he felt a little
happier.

At first Anna Pavlovna refused to hear of it, then she began entreating
her husband to let her stay just another half-hour; then, without
knowing why, she began to apologise, to protest—and all in a whisper,
with a smile, that the spectators might not suspect that she was having
a tiff with her husband. She began assuring him she would not stay long,
only another ten minutes, only five minutes; but the tax-collector stuck
obstinately to his point.

And as she talked to her husband Anna Pavlovna looked thinner, older,
plainer. Pale, biting her lips, and almost crying, she went out to the
entry and began putting on her things.

Coming out of the club, the husband and wife walked all the way home in
silence. The tax-collector walked behind his wife, and watching her
downcast, sorrowful, humiliated little figure, he recalled the look of
beatitude which had so irritated him at the club, and the consciousness
that the beatitude was gone filled his soul with triumph. He was pleased
and satisfied, and at the same time he felt the lack of something; he
would have liked to go back to the club and make every one feel dreary
and miserable, so that all might know how stale and worthless life is
when you walk along the streets in the dark and hear the slush of the
mud under your feet, and when you know that you will wake up next
morning with nothing to look forward to but vodka and cards. Oh, how
awful it is!

And Anna Pavlovna could scarcely walk.... She was still under the
influence of the dancing, the music, the talk, the lights, and the
noise; she asked herself as she walked along why God had thus afflicted
her. She felt miserable, insulted, and choking with hate as she listened
to her husband''s heavy footsteps. She was silent, trying to think of the
most offensive, biting, and venomous word she could hurl at her husband,
and at the same time she was fully aware that no word could penetrate
her tax-collector''s hide. What did he care for words? Her bitterest
enemy could not have contrived for her a more helpless position.

And meanwhile the band was playing and the darkness was full of the most
rousing, intoxicating dance-tunes.' WHERE id = 'cbd83e9f-3d67-42b4-b9b7-2f43b116e644';

“Gogol, Nikolai Vassilievitch. Born
in the government of Pultowa, March
31 (N.S.), 1809, died at Moscow, March
4 (N.S.), 1852. A Russian novelist
and dramatist. He was educated in a
public gymnasium at Pultowa, and
subsequently in the lyceum, then newly
established, at Niejinsk. In 1831 he
was appointed teacher of history at the
Patriotic Institution, a place which he
exchanged in 1834 for the professorship
of history in the University of St
Petersburg. This he resigned at the end
of a year and devoted himself entirely
to literature. In 1836 Gogol left
Russia. He lived most of the time in
Rome. In 1837 he wrote ‘Dead
Souls.’ In 1840 he went to Russia for
a short period in order to superintend
the publication of the first volume of
‘Dead Souls,’ and then returned to
Italy. In 1846 he returned to Russia
and fell into a state of fanatical mysticism.
One of his last acts was to
burn the manuscript of the concluding
portion of ‘Dead Souls,’ which he
considered harmful. He also wrote
‘The Mantle,’ ‘Evenings at the
Farm,’ ‘St Petersburg Stories,’ ‘Taras
Bulba,’ a tale of the Cossacks, ‘The
Revizor,’ a comedy, etc.”—From The
Century CyclopÃ¦dia of Names.

As a novel-writer and a dramatist, Gogol appears
to me to deserve a minute study, and if the
knowledge of Russian were more widely spread,
he could not fail to obtain in Europe a reputation
equal to that of the best English humorists.

A delicate and close observer, quick to detect
the absurd, bold in exposing, but inclined to
push his fun too far, Gogol is in the first place
a very lively satirist. He is merciless towards
fools and rascals, but he has only one weapon at
his disposal—irony. This is a weapon which is
too severe to use against the merely absurd, and
on the other hand it is not sharp enough for
the punishment of crime; and it is against crime
that Gogol too often uses it. His comic vein
is always too near the farcical, and his mirth is
hardly contagious. If sometimes he makes his
reader laugh, he still leaves in his mind a feeling
of bitterness and indignation; his satires do not
avenge society, they only make it angry.

As a painter of manners, Gogol excels in
familiar scenes. He is akin to Teniers and
 
Callot. We feel as though we had seen and lived
with his characters, for he shows us their eccentricities,
their nervous habits, their slightest
gestures. One lisps, another mispronounces his
words, and a third hisses because he has lost
a front tooth. Unfortunately Gogol is so absorbed
in this minute study of details that he too
often forgets to subordinate them to the main
action of the story. To tell the truth, there is
no ordered plan in his works, and—a strange
trait in an author who sets up as a realist—he
takes no care to preserve an atmosphere of
probability. His most carefully painted scenes
are clumsily connected—they begin and end
abruptly; often the author''s great carelessness
in construction destroys, as though wantonly, the
illusion produced by the truth of his descriptions
and the naturalness of his conversations.

The immortal master of this school of desultory
but ingenious and attractive story-tellers,
among whom Gogol is entitled to a high place,
is Rabelais, who cannot be too much admired
and studied, but to imitate whom nowadays
would, I think, be dangerous and difficult. In
spite of the indefinable grace of his obsolete
language, one can hardly read twenty pages of
Rabelais in succession. One soon wearies of
this eloquence, so original and so eloquent, but
the drift of which escapes every reader except
some Œdipuses like Le Duchat or Ãloi Johanneau.
 
Just as the observation of animalculÃ¦
under the microscope fatigues the eye, so does
the perusal of these brilliant pages tire the mind.
Possibly not a word of them is superfluous, but
possibly also they might be entirely eliminated
from the work of which they form part, without
sensibly detracting from its merit. The art of
choosing among the innumerable details which
nature offers us is, after all, much more difficult
than that of observing them with attention and
recording them with exactitude.

The Russian language, which is, as far as I
can judge, the richest of all the European family,
seems admirably adapted to express the most
delicate shades of thought. Possessed of a
marvellous conciseness and clearness, it can with
a single word call up several ideas, to express
which in another tongue whole phrases would
be necessary. French, assisted by Greek and
Latin, calling to its aid all its northern and
southern dialects—the language of Rabelais, in
fact, is the only one which can convey any idea
of this suppleness and this energy. One can
imagine that such an admirable instrument may
exercise a considerable influence on the mind of
a writer who is capable of handling it. He
naturally takes delight in the picturesqueness of
its expressions, just as a draughtsman with skill
and a good pencil will trace delicate contours.
An excellent gift, no doubt, but there are
 
few things which have not their disadvantages.
Elaborate execution is a considerable merit if it
is reserved for the chief parts of a work; but if it
is uniformly lavished on all the accessory parts
also, the whole produces, I fear, a monotonous
effect.

I have said that satire is, in my opinion, the
special characteristic of Gogol''s talent: he does
not see men or things in a bright light. That
does not mean that he is an unfaithful observer,
but his descriptions betray a certain preference
for the ugly and the sad elements in life.
Doubtless these two disagreeable elements are
only too easily found, and it is precisely for that
reason that they should not be investigated with
insatiable curiosity. We would form a terrible
idea of Russia—of “Holy Russia,” as her children
call her—if we only judged her by the pictures
which Gogol draws. His characters are
almost entirely confined to idiots, or scoundrels
who deserve to be hung. It is a well-known
defect of satirists to see everywhere the game
which they are hunting, and they should not be
taken too literally. Aristophanes vainly employed
his brilliant genius in blackening his contemporaries;
he cannot prevent us loving the
Athens of Pericles.

Gogol generally goes to the country districts
for his characters, imitating in this respect
Balzac, whose writings have undoubtedly influenced
 
him. The modern facility of communication
in Europe has brought about, among the
higher classes of all countries and the inhabitants
of the great cities, a conventional uniformity
of manners and customs, e.g. the dress-coat
and round hat. It is among the middle classes
remote from great towns that we must look
to-day for national characteristics and for original
characters. In the country, people still
maintain primitive habits and prejudices—things
which become rarer from day to day. The
Russian country gentlemen, who only journey to
St Petersburg once in a lifetime, and who, living
on their estates all the year round, eat much,
read little and hardly think at all—these are the
types to which Gogol is partial, or rather which
he pursues with his jests and sarcasms. Some
critics, I am told, reproach him for displaying
a kind of provincial patriotism. As a Little
Russian, he is said to have a predilection for
Little Russia over the rest of the Empire. For
my own part, I find him impartial enough or even
too general in his criticisms, and on the other
hand too severe on anyone whom he places under
the microscope of his observation. Pushkin was
accused, quite wrongly in my opinion, of scepticism,
immorality, and of belonging to the Satanic
school; however he discovered in an old country
manor his admirable Tatiana. One regrets that
Gogol has not been equally fortunate.

I do not know the dates of Gogol''s different
works, but I should be inclined to believe that his
short stories were the first in order of publication.
They seem to me to witness to a certain
vagueness in the author''s mind, as though he
were making experiments in order to ascertain
to what style of work his genius was best adapted.
He has produced an historical romance inspired
by the perusal of Sir Walter Scott, fantastic
legends, psychological studies, marked by a mixture
of sentimentality and grotesqueness. If my
conjecture is correct, he has been obliged to ask
himself for some time whether he should take as
his model Sterne, Walter Scott, Chamisso, or
Hoffmann. Later on he has done better in following
the path which he has himself traced out.
“Taras Bulba,” his historical romance, is an
animated and, as far as I know, correct picture
of the Zaporogues, that singular people whom
Voltaire briefly mentions in his “Life of Charles XII.”
In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
the Zaporogues played a great part in the
annals of Russia and of Poland; they then formed
a republic of soldiers, or rather of filibusters,
established on the islands of the Don, nominal
subjects sometimes of the Kings of Poland, sometimes
of the Grand Dukes of Moscow, sometimes
even of the Ottoman Porte. At bottom they
were extremely independent bandits, and ravaged
their neighbours'' territory with great impartiality.
 
They did not allow women to live in
their towns, which were a kind of nomad encampments;
it was there that the Cossack aspirants
to military glory went to be trained as
irregular troops. The most absolute equality
prevailed among the Zaporogues while at peace
in the marshes of the Don. Then the chiefs, or
atamans, when speaking to their subordinates
always took their caps off. But during an expedition,
on the contrary, their power was unlimited,
and disobedience to the captain of the
company (Ataman KotchevoÃ¯) was considered the
greatest of crimes.

Our filibusters of the seventeenth century have
many traits of resemblance to the Zaporogues,
and the histories of both preserve the remembrance
of prodigies of audacity and of horrible
cruelties. Taras Bulba is one of those heroes
with whom, as the student of Schiller said, one
can only have relations when holding a well-loaded
gun in one''s hand. I am one of those
who have a strong liking for bandits; not because
I like to meet them on my road, but because, in
spite of myself, the energy these men display in
struggling against the whole of society, extorts
from me an admiration of which I am ashamed.
Formerly I read with delight the lives of Morgan,
of Donnais, and of Mombars the destroyer, and
I would not be bored if I read them again.
However, there are bandits and bandits. Their
 
glory is greatly enhanced if they are of a recent
date. Actual bandits always cast into the shade
those of the melodrama, and the one who has
been more recently hung infallibly effaces the
fame of his predecessors. Nowadays neither
Mombars nor Taras Bulba can excite so much
interest as Mussoni, who last month sustained a
regular siege in a wolf''s den against five hundred
men, who had to attack him by sapping and
mining.

Gogol has made brilliantly coloured pictures
of his Zaporogues, which please by their very
grotesqueness; but sometimes it is too evident
that he has not drawn them from nature. Moreover,
these character-pictures are framed in such
a trivial and romantic setting that one regrets to
see them so ill-placed. The most prosaic story
would have suited them better than these melodramatic
scenes in which are accumulated tragic
incidents of famine, torture, etc. In short, one
feels that the author is not at ease on the ground
which he has chosen; his gait is awkward, and
the invariable irony of his style makes the
perusal of these melancholy incidents more painful.
This style which, in my opinion, is quite out
of place in some parts of “Taras Bulba,” is
much more appropriate in the “Viy,” or “King
of the Gnomes,” a tale of witchcraft, which
amuses and alarms at the same time. The
grotesque easily blends with the marvellous.
 
Recognising to the full the poetic side of his
subject, the author, while describing the savage
and strange customs of the old-time Cossacks
with his usual precision and exactitude, has easily
prepared the way for the introduction of an
element of uncanniness.

The receipt for a good, fantastic tale is well
known: begin with well-defined portraits of
eccentric characters, but such as to be within
the bounds of possibility, described with minute
realism. From the grotesque to the marvellous
the transition is imperceptible, and the reader
will find himself in the world of fantasy before
he perceives that he has left the real world far
behind him. I purposely avoid any attempt to
analyse “The King of the Gnomes”; the proper
time and place to read it is in the country, by the
fireside on a stormy autumn night. After the
dÃ©nouement, it will require a certain amount of
resolution to traverse long corridors to reach
one''s room, while the wind and the rain shake
the casements. Now that the fantastic style of
the Germans is a little threadbare, that of the
Cossacks will have novel charms, and in the first
place the merit of resembling nothing else—no
slight praise, I think.

The “Memoirs of a Madman” is simultaneously
a social satire, a sentimental story, and a
medico-legal study of the phenomena presented
by a brain which is becoming deranged. The
 
study, I believe, is carefully made and the process
carefully depicted, but I do not like this
class of writing; madness is one of those misfortunes
which arouse pity but which disgust at the
same time. Doubtless, by introducing a madman
in his story an author is sure of producing
an effect. It causes to vibrate a cord which is
always susceptible; but it is a cheap method, and
Gogol''s gifts are such as to be able to dispense
with having resort to such. The portrayal of
lunatics and dogs—both of whom can produce
an irresistible effect—should be left to tyros. It
is easy to extract tears from a reader by breaking
a poodle''s paw. Homer''s only excuse, in my
opinion, for making us weep at the mutual recognition
of the dog Argus and Ulysses, is because
he was, I think, the first to discover the resources
which the canine race offers to an author at a loss
for expedients.

I hasten to go on to a small masterpiece, “An
Old-time Household.” In a few pages Gogol
sketches for us the life of two honest old folk
living in the country. There is not a grain of
malice in their composition; they are cheated
and adored by their servants, and naÃ¯ve egoists
as they are, believe everyone is as happy as
themselves. The wife dies. The husband, who
only seemed born for merry-making, falls ill and
dies some months after his wife. We discover
that there was a heart in this mass of flesh. We
 
laugh and weep in turns while reading this
charming story, in which the art of the narrator
is disguised by simplicity. All is true and
natural; every detail is attractive and adds to the
general effect.

Translator''s Note.—The rest of MerimÃ©e''s
essay is occupied with analyses of Gogol''s “Dead
Souls” and “The Revisor,” and therefore is
not given here.

But it is perhaps better that I do not mention
which department it was. There are in the
whole of Russia no persons more sensitive than
Government officials. Each of them believes if
he is annoyed in any way, that the whole official
class is insulted in his person.

Recently an Isprawnik (country magistrate)—I
do not know of which town—is said to have
drawn up a report with the object of showing
that, ignoring Government orders, people were
speaking of Isprawniks in terms of contempt. In
order to prove his assertions, he forwarded with
his report a bulky work of fiction, in which on
about every tenth page an Isprawnik appeared
generally in a drunken condition.

In order therefore to avoid any unpleasantness,
I will not definitely indicate the department
in which the scene of my story is laid, and
will rather say “in a certain chancellery.”

Well, in a certain chancellery there was a
certain man who, as I cannot deny, was not of
an attractive appearance. He was short, had a
 
face marked with smallpox, was rather bald in
front, and his forehead and cheeks were deeply
lined with furrows—to say nothing of other
physical imperfections. Such was the outer
aspect of our hero, as produced by the St Petersburg
climate.

As regards his official rank—for with us
Russians the official rank must always be given—he
was what is usually known as a permanent
titular councillor, one of those unfortunate beings
who, as is well known, are made a butt of by
various authors who have the bad habit of
attacking people who cannot defend themselves.

Our hero''s family name was Bashmatchkin;
his baptismal name Akaki Akakievitch. Perhaps
the reader may think this name somewhat
strange and far-fetched, but he can be assured
that it is not so, and that circumstances so
arranged it that it was quite impossible to give
him any other name.

This happened in the following way. Akaki
Akakievitch was born, if I am not mistaken, on
the night of the 23rd of March. His deceased
mother, the wife of an official and a very good
woman, immediately made proper arrangements
for his baptism. When the time came,
she was lying on the bed before the door. At
her right hand stood the godfather, Ivan Ivanovitch
Jeroshkin, a very important person, who
was registrar of the senate; at her left, the godmother
 
Anna Semenovna Byelobrushkova, the
wife of a police inspector, a woman of rare
virtues.

Three names were suggested to the mother
from which to choose one for the child—Mokuja,
Sossuja, or Khozdazat.

In order to meet her wishes, the church calendar
was opened in another place, and the names
Triphiliy, Dula, and Varakhasiy were found.

“This is a punishment from heaven,” said the
mother. “What sort of names are these! I
never heard the like! If it had been Varadat
or Varukh, but Triphiliy and Varakhasiy!”

“Now I see,” said the mother, “this is
plainly fate. If there is no help for it, then he
had better take his father''s name, which was
Akaki.”

So the child was called Akaki Akakievitch.
It was baptised, although it wept and cried and
made all kinds of grimaces, as though it had a
presentiment that it would one day be a titular
councillor.

We have related all this so conscientiously that
the reader himself might be convinced that it
was impossible for the little Akaki to receive any
other name. When and how he entered the
chancellery and who appointed him, no one
 
could remember. However many of his superiors
might come and go, he was always seen in the
same spot, in the same attitude, busy with the
same work, and bearing the same title; so that
people began to believe he had come into the
world just as he was, with his bald forehead and
official uniform.

In the chancellery where he worked, no kind
of notice was taken of him. Even the office
attendants did not rise from their seats when he
entered, nor look at him; they took no more
notice than if a fly had flown through the room.
His superiors treated him in a coldly despotic
manner. The assistant of the head of the
department, when he pushed a pile of papers
under his nose, did not even say “Please copy
those,” or “There is something interesting for
you,” or make any other polite remark such as
well-educated officials are in the habit of doing.
But Akaki took the documents, without worrying
himself whether they had the right to hand them
over to him or not, and straightway set to work
to copy them.

His young colleagues made him the butt of
their ridicule and their elegant wit, so far as
officials can be said to possess any wit. They
did not scruple to relate in his presence various
tales of their own invention regarding his manner
of life and his landlady, who was seventy years
old. They declared that she beat him, and
 
inquired of him when he would lead her to the
marriage altar. Sometimes they let a shower
of scraps of paper fall on his head, and told him
they were snowflakes.

But Akaki Akakievitch made no answer to
all these attacks; he seemed oblivious of their
presence. His work was not affected in the
slightest degree; during all these interruptions
he did not make a single error in copying. Only
when the horse-play grew intolerable, when he
was held by the arm and prevented writing, he
would say “Do leave me alone! Why do you
always want to disturb me at work?” There
was something peculiarly pathetic in these words
and the way in which he uttered them.

One day it happened that when a young clerk,
who had been recently appointed to the chancellery,
prompted by the example of the others,
was playing him some trick, he suddenly seemed
arrested by something in the tone of Akaki''s
voice, and from that moment regarded the old
official with quite different eyes. He felt as though
some supernatural power drew him away from
the colleagues whose acquaintance he had made
here, and whom he had hitherto regarded as
well-educated, respectable men, and alienated
him from them. Long afterwards, when surrounded
by gay companions, he would see the
figure of the poor little councillor and hear the
words “Do leave me alone! Why will you
 
always disturb me at work?” Along with these
words, he also heard others: “Am I not your
brother?” On such occasions the young man
would hide his face in his hands, and think how
little humane feeling after all was to be found in
men''s hearts; how much coarseness and cruelty
was to be found even in the educated and those
who were everywhere regarded as good and
honourable men.

Never was there an official who did his
work so zealously as Akaki Akakievitch. “Zealously,”
do I say? He worked with a passionate
love of his task. While he copied official documents,
a world of varied beauty rose before
his eyes. His delight in copying was legible in
his face. To form certain letters afforded him
special satisfaction, and when he came to them
he was quite another man; he began to smile,
his eyes sparkled, and he pursed up his lips, so
that those who knew him could see by his face
which letters he was working at.

Had he been rewarded according to his zeal,
he would perhaps—to his own astonishment—have
been raised to the rank of civic councillor.
However, he was not destined, as his colleagues
expressed it, to wear a cross at his buttonhole,
but only to get hÃ¦morrhoids by leading a too
sedentary life.

For the rest, I must mention that on one
occasion he attracted a certain amount of attention.
 
A director, who was a kindly man and
wished to reward him for his long service,
ordered that he should be entrusted with a task
more important than the documents which he
usually had to copy. This consisted in preparing
a report for a court, altering the headings of
various documents, and here and there changing
the first personal pronoun into the third.

Akaki undertook the work; but it confused
and exhausted him to such a degree that the
sweat ran from his forehead and he at last
exclaimed: “No! Please give me again something
to copy.” From that time he was allowed
to continue copying to his life''s end.

Outside this copying nothing appeared to exist
for him. He did not even think of his clothes.
His uniform, which was originally green, had
acquired a reddish tint. The collar was so
narrow and so tight that his neck, although of
average length, stretched far out of it, and
appeared extraordinarily long, just like those of
the cats with movable heads, which are carried
about on trays and sold to the peasants in Russian
villages.

Something was always sticking to his clothes—a
piece of thread, a fragment of straw which had
been flying about, etc. Moreover he seemed
to have a special predilection for passing under
windows just when something not very clean was
being thrown out of them, and therefore he
 
constantly carried about on his hat pieces of
orange-peel and such refuse. He never took
any notice of what was going on in the streets,
in contrast to his colleagues who were always
watching people closely and whom nothing delighted
more than to see someone walking along
on the opposite pavement with a rent in his
trousers.

But Akaki Akakievitch saw nothing but the
clean, regular lines of his copies before him;
and only when he collided suddenly with a
horse''s nose, which blew its breath noisily in his
face, did the good man observe that he was not
sitting at his writing-table among his neat duplicates,
but walking in the middle of the street.

When he arrived home, he sat down at once
to supper, ate his cabbage-soup hurriedly, and
then, without taking any notice how it tasted, a
slice of beef with garlic, together with the flies
and any other trifles which happened to be
lying on it. As soon as his hunger was satisfied,
he set himself to write, and began to copy
the documents which he had brought home with
him. If he happened to have no official documents
to copy, he copied for his own satisfaction
political letters, not for their more or less grand
style but because they were directed to some
high personage.

When the grey St Petersburg sky is darkened
by the veil of night, and the whole of officialdom
 
has finished its dinner according to its gastronomical
inclinations or the depth of its purse—when
all recover themselves from the perpetual
scratching of bureaucratic pens, and all the cares
and business with which men so often needlessly
burden themselves, they devote the evening to
recreation. One goes to the theatre; another
roams about the streets, inspecting toilettes;
another whispers flattering words to some young
girl who has risen like a star in his modest official
circle. Here and there one visits a colleague in
his third or fourth story flat, consisting of two
rooms with an entrance-hall and kitchen, fitted
with some pretentious articles of furniture purchased
by many abstinences.

In short, at this time every official betakes himself
to some form of recreation—playing whist,
drinking tea, and eating cheap pastry or smoking
tobacco in long pipes. Some relate scandals
about great people, for in whatever situation of
life the Russian may be, he always likes to hear
about the aristocracy; others recount well-worn
but popular anecdotes, as for example that of the
commandant to whom it was reported that a
rogue had cut off the horse''s tail on the monument
of Peter the Great.

But even at this time of rest and recreation,
Akaki Akakievitch remained faithful to his habits.
No one could say that he had ever seen him in
any evening social circle. After he had written
 
as much as he wanted, he went to bed, and
thought of the joys of the coming day, and the
fine copies which God would give him to do.

So flowed on the peaceful existence of a man
who was quite content with his post and his income
of four hundred roubles a year. He might
perhaps have reached an extreme old age if one
of those unfortunate events had not befallen him,
which not only happen to titular but to actual
privy, court, and other councillors, and also to
persons who never give advice nor receive it.

In St Petersburg all those who draw a salary
of four hundred roubles or thereabouts have a
terrible enemy in our northern cold, although
some assert that it is very good for the health.
About nine o''clock in the morning, when the
clerks of the various departments betake themselves
to their offices, the cold nips their noses
so vigorously that most of them are quite bewildered.
If at this time even high officials so
suffer from the severity of the cold in their own
persons that the tears come into their eyes, what
must be the sufferings of the titular councillors,
whose means do not allow of their protecting
themselves against the rigour of winter? When
they have put on their light cloaks, they must
hurry through five or six streets as rapidly as
possible, and then in the porter''s lodge warm
themselves and wait till their frozen official
faculties have thawed.

For some time Akaki had been feeling on his
back and shoulders very sharp twinges of pain,
although he ran as fast as possible from his
dwelling to the office. After well considering the
matter, he came to the conclusion that these
were due to the imperfections of his cloak. In his
room he examined it carefully, and discovered
that in two or three places it had become so thin
as to be quite transparent, and that the lining
was much torn.

This cloak had been for a long time the standing
object of jests on the part of Akaki''s merciless
colleagues. They had even robbed it of the
noble name of “cloak,” and called it a cowl.
It certainly presented a remarkable appearance.
Every year the collar had grown smaller, for
every year the poor titular councillor had taken
a piece of it away in order to repair some other
part of the cloak; and these repairs did not look
as if they had been done by the skilled hand
of a tailor. They had been executed in a very
clumsy way and looked remarkably ugly.

After Akaki Akakievitch had ended his
melancholy examination, he said to himself that
he must certainly take his cloak to Petrovitch the
tailor, who lived high up in a dark den on the
fourth floor.

With his squinting eyes and pock-marked face,
Petrovitch certainly did not look as if he had the
honour to make frock-coats and trousers for
 
high officials—that is to say, when he was sober,
and not absorbed in more pleasant diversions.

I might dispense here with dwelling on this
tailor; but since it is the custom to portray the
physiognomy of every separate personage in a
tale, I must give a better or worse description
of Petrovitch. Formerly when he was a simple
serf in his master''s house, he was merely called
Gregor. When he became free, he thought he
ought to adorn himself with a new name, and
dubbed himself Petrovitch; at the same time he
began to drink lustily, not only on the high festivals
but on all those which are marked with a
cross in the calendar. By thus solemnly celebrating
the days consecrated by the Church, he
considered that he was remaining faithful to the
traditions of his childhood; and when he quarrelled
with his wife, he shouted that she was an
earthly minded creature and a German. Of this
lady we have nothing more to relate than that she
was the wife of Petrovitch, and that she did not
wear a kerchief but a cap on her head. For the
rest, she was not pretty; only the soldiers looked
at her as they passed, then they twirled their
moustaches and walked on, laughing.

Akaki Akakievitch accordingly betook himself
to the tailor''s attic. He reached it by a dark,
dirty, damp staircase, from which, as in all the
inhabited houses of the poorer class in St Petersburg,
exhaled an effluvia of spirits vexatious to
 
nose and eyes alike. As the titular councillor
climbed these slippery stairs, he calculated what
sum Petrovitch could reasonably ask for repairing
his cloak, and determined only to give him
a rouble.

The door of the tailor''s flat stood open in order
to provide an outlet for the clouds of smoke which
rolled from the kitchen, where Petrovitch''s wife
was just then cooking fish. Akaki, his eyes
smarting, passed through the kitchen without her
seeing him, and entered the room where the
tailor sat on a large, roughly made, wooden table,
his legs crossed like those of a Turkish pasha,
and, as is the custom of tailors, with bare feet.
What first arrested attention, when one approached
him, was his thumb nail, which was a
little misshapen but as hard and strong as the
shell of a tortoise. Round his neck were hung
several skeins of thread, and on his knees lay a
tattered coat. For some minutes he had been
trying in vain to thread his needle. He was first
of all angry with the gathering darkness, then
with the thread.

Akaki saw at once that he had come at an
inopportune moment. He wished he had found
Petrovitch at a more favourable time, when he
was enjoying himself—when, as his wife expressed
it, he was having a substantial ration of
 
brandy. At such times the tailor was extraordinarily
ready to meet his customer''s proposals
with bows and gratitude to boot. Sometimes
indeed his wife interfered in the transaction, and
declared that he was drunk and promised to do
the work at much too low a price; but if the
customer paid a trifle more, the matter was
settled.

Unfortunately for the titular councillor,
Petrovitch had just now not yet touched the
brandy flask. At such moments he was hard,
obstinate, and ready to demand an exorbitant
price.

Akaki foresaw this danger, and would gladly
have turned back again, but it was already too
late. The tailor''s single eye—for he was one-eyed—had
already noticed him, and Akaki
Akakievitch murmured involuntarily “Good
day, Petrovitch.”

“Welcome, sir,” answered the tailor, and
fastened his glance on the titular councillor''s
hand to see what he had in it.

We must here remark that the modest titular
councillor was in the habit of expressing his
thoughts only by prepositions, adverbs, or particles,
which never yielded a distinct meaning.
If the matter of which he spoke was a difficult
one, he could never finish the sentence he had
begun. So that when transacting business, he
 
generally entangled himself in the formula “Yes—it
is indeed true that——” Then he would
remain standing and forget what he wished to
say, or believe that he had said it.

“What do you want, sir?” asked Petrovitch,
scrutinising him from top to toe with a searching
look, and contemplating his collar, sleeves, coat,
buttons—in short his whole uniform, although
he knew them all very well, having made them
himself. That is the way of tailors whenever
they meet an acquaintance.

Then Akaki answered, stammering as usual,
“I want—Petrovitch—this cloak—you see—it is
still quite good, only a little dusty—and therefore
it looks a little old. It is, however, still quite
new, only that it is worn a little—there in the
back and here in the shoulder—and there are
three quite little splits. You see it is hardly
worth talking about; it can be thoroughly repaired
in a few minutes.”

Petrovitch took the unfortunate cloak, spread
it on the table, contemplated it in silence, and
shook his head. Then he stretched his hand
towards the window-sill for his snuff-box, a round
one with the portrait of a general on the lid. I
do not know whose portrait it was, for it had been
accidentally injured, and the ingenious tailor had
gummed a piece of paper over it.

After Petrovitch had taken a pinch of snuff, he
examined the cloak again, held it to the light, and
 
once more shook his head. Then he examined
the lining, took a second pinch of snuff, and at
last exclaimed, “No! that is a wretched rag!
It is beyond repair!”

“What!” he cried in the querulous tone of a
child. “Can this hole really not be repaired?
Look! Petrovitch; there are only two rents, and
you have enough pieces of cloth to mend them
with.”

“Yes, I have enough pieces of cloth; but how
should I sew them on? The stuff is quite worn
out; it won''t bear another stitch.”

“No, it won''t bear anything more; cloth after
all is only cloth, and in its present condition a
gust of wind might blow the wretched mantle into
tatters.”

“No!” answered Petrovitch decidedly.
“There is nothing more to be done with it; it is
completely worn out. It would be better if you
made yourself foot bandages out of it for the
winter; they are warmer than stockings. It was
the Germans who invented stockings for their
own profit.” Petrovitch never lost an opportunity
of having a hit at the Germans. “You
must certainly buy a new cloak,” he added.

“A new cloak?” exclaimed Akaki Akakievitch,
and it grew dark before his eyes. The
tailor''s work-room seemed to go round with him,
and the only object he could clearly distinguish
was the paper-patched general''s portrait on the
tailor''s snuff-box. “A new cloak!” he murmured,
as though half asleep. “But I have no
money.”

“About a hundred and fifty roubles,”
answered the tailor, pursing his lips. This
diabolical tailor took a special pleasure in
embarrassing his customers and watching the
expression of their faces with his squinting
single eye.

“A hundred and fifty roubles for a cloak!”
exclaimed Akaki Akakievitch in a tone which
sounded like an outcry—possibly the first he had
uttered since his birth.

“Yes,” replied Petrovitch. “And then the
marten-fur collar and silk lining for the hood
would make it up to two hundred roubles.”

“Petrovitch, I adjure you!” said Akaki
Akakievitch in an imploring tone, no longer
hearing nor wishing to hear the tailor''s words,
 
“try to make this cloak last me a little
longer.”

After this answer, Akaki departed, feeling
quite crushed; while Petrovitch, with his lips
firmly pursed up, feeling pleased with himself for
his firmness and brave defence of the art of
tailoring, remained sitting on the table.

Meanwhile Akaki wandered about the streets
like a somnambulist, at random and without an
object. “What a terrible business!” he said
to himself. “Really, I could never have believed
that it would come to that. No,” he
continued after a short pause, “I could not
have guessed that it would come to that. Now
I find myself in a completely unexpected situation—in
a difficulty that——”

As he thus continued his monologue, instead
of approaching his dwelling, he went, without
noticing it, in quite a wrong direction. A
chimney-sweep brushed against him and blackened
his back as he passed by. From a house
where building was going on, a bucket of plaster
of Paris was emptied on his head. But he saw
and heard nothing. Only when he collided with
a sentry, who, after he had planted his halberd
beside him, was shaking out some snuff from his
snuff-box with a bony hand, was he startled out
of his reverie.

“What do you want?” the rough guardian
of civic order exclaimed. “Can''t you walk on
the pavement properly?”

This sudden address at last completely roused
Akaki from his torpid condition. He collected
his thoughts, considered his situation clearly, and
began to take counsel with himself seriously and
frankly, as with a friend to whom one entrusts
the most intimate secrets.

“No!” he said at last. “To-day I will get
nothing from Petrovitch—to-day he is in a bad
humour—perhaps his wife has beaten him—I
will look him up again next Sunday. On Saturday
evenings he gets intoxicated; then the next
day he wants a pick-me-up—his wife gives him
no money—I squeeze a ten-kopeck piece into
his hand; then he will be more reasonable and
we can discuss the cloak further.”

Encouraged by these reflections, Akaki waited
patiently till Sunday. On that day, having seen
Petrovitch''s wife leave the house, he betook
himself to the tailor''s and found him, as he had
expected, in a very depressed state as the result
of his Saturday''s dissipation. But hardly had
Akaki let a word fall about the mantle than the
diabolical tailor awoke from his torpor and
exclaimed, “No, nothing can be done; you must
certainly buy a new cloak.”

“Thanks, my dear friend,” said Petrovitch;
“that will get me a pick-me-up, and I will
drink your health with it. But as for your old
mantle, what is the use of talking about it? It
isn''t worth a farthing. Let me only get to
work; I will make you a splendid one, I
promise!”

“No, and again no,” answered Petrovitch.
“It is quite impossible. Trust me; I won''t take
you in. I will even put silver hooks and eyes
on the collar, as is now the fashion.”

This time Akaki saw that he must follow the
tailor''s advice, and again all his courage sank.
He must have a new mantle made. But how
should he pay for it? He certainly expected a
Christmas bonus at the office; but that money had
been allotted beforehand. He must buy a pair
of trousers, and pay his shoemaker for repairing
two pairs of boots, and buy some fresh linen.
Even if, by an unexpected stroke of good luck,
the director raised the usual bonus from forty to
fifty roubles, what was such a small amount in
comparison with the immense sum which Petrovitch
demanded? A mere drop of water in the
sea.

At any rate, he might expect that Petrovitch,
if he were in a good humour, would lower the
price of the cloak to eighty roubles; but where
 
were these eighty roubles to be found? Perhaps
he might succeed if he left no stone unturned,
in raising half the sum; but he saw no means of
procuring the other half. As regards the first
half, he had been in the habit, as often as he
received a rouble, of placing a kopeck in a
money-box. At the end of each half-year he
changed these copper coins for silver. He had
been doing this for some time, and his savings
just now amounted to forty roubles. Thus he
already had half the required sum. But the
other half!

Akaki made long calculations, and at last
determined that he must, at least for a whole
year, reduce some of his daily expenses. He
would have to give up his tea in the evening, and
copy his documents in his landlady''s room, in
order to economise the fuel in his own. He also
resolved to avoid rough pavements as much as
possible, in order to spare his shoes; and finally
to give out less washing to the laundress.

At first he found these deprivations rather
trying; but gradually he got accustomed to them,
and at last took to going to bed without any
supper at all. Although his body suffered from
this abstinence, his spirit derived all the richer
nutriment from perpetually thinking about his
new cloak. From that time it seemed as though
his nature had completed itself; as though he had
married and possessed a companion on his life
 
journey. This companion was the thought of his
new cloak, properly wadded and lined.

From that time he became more lively, and
his character grew stronger, like that of a man
who has set a goal before himself which he will
reach at all costs. All that was indecisive and
vague in his gait and gestures had disappeared.
A new fire began to gleam in his eyes, and in
his bold dreams he sometimes even proposed to
himself the question whether he should not have
a marten-fur collar made for his coat.

These and similar thoughts sometimes caused
him to be absent-minded. As he was copying
his documents one day he suddenly noticed that
he had made a slip. “Ugh!” he exclaimed,
and crossed himself.

At least once a month he went to Petrovitch to
discuss the precious cloak with him, and to settle
many important questions, e.g. where and at
what price he should buy the cloth, and what
colour he should choose.

Each of these visits gave rise to new discussions,
but he always returned home in a happier
mood, feeling that at last the day must come
when all the materials would have been bought
and the cloak would be lying ready to put on.

This great event happened sooner than he had
hoped. The director gave him a bonus, not of
forty or fifty, but of five-and-sixty roubles. Had
the worthy official noticed that Akaki needed a
 
new mantle, or was the exceptional amount of
the gift only due to chance?

However that might be, Akaki was now richer
by twenty roubles. Such an access of wealth
necessarily hastened his important undertaking.
After two or three more months of enduring
hunger, he had collected his eighty roubles.
His heart, generally so quiet, began to beat
violently; he hastened to Petrovitch, who accompanied
him to a draper''s shop. There, without
hesitating, they bought a very fine piece of cloth.
For more than half a year they had discussed the
matter incessantly, and gone round the shops
inquiring prices. Petrovitch examined the cloth,
and said they would not find anything better.
For the lining they chose a piece of such firm and
thickly woven linen that the tailor declared it was
better than silk; it also had a splendid gloss on
it. They did not buy marten fur, for it was too
dear, but chose the best catskin in the shop,
which was a very good imitation of the former.

It took Petrovitch quite fourteen days to make
the mantle, for he put an extra number of
stitches into it. He charged twelve roubles for
his work, and said he could not ask less; it was
all sewn with silk, and the tailor smoothed the
sutures with his teeth.

At last the day came—I cannot name it
certainly, but it assuredly was the most solemn
in Akaki''s life—when the tailor brought the
 
cloak. He brought it early in the morning,
before the titular councillor started for his office.
He could not have come at a more suitable
moment, for the cold had again begun to be
very severe.

Petrovitch entered the room with the dignified
mien of an important tailor. His face wore
a peculiarly serious expression, such as Akaki
had never seen on it. He was fully conscious
of his dignity, and of the gulf which separates
the tailor who only repairs old clothes from the
artist who makes new ones.

The cloak had been brought wrapped up in a
large, new, freshly washed handkerchief, which
the tailor carefully opened, folded, and placed
in his pocket. Then he proudly took the cloak
in both hands and laid it on Akaki Akakievitch''s
shoulders. He pulled it straight behind to see
how it hung majestically in its whole length.
Finally he wished to see the effect it made when
unbuttoned. Akaki, however, wished to try
the sleeves, which fitted wonderfully well. In
brief, the cloak was irreproachable, and its fit
and cut left nothing to be desired.

While the tailor was contemplating his work,
he did not forget to say that the only reason he
had charged so little for making it, was that he
had only a low rent to pay and had known Akaki
Akakievitch for a long time; he declared that
any tailor who lived on the Nevski Prospect
 
would have charged at least five-and-sixty
roubles for making up such a cloak.

The titular councillor did not let himself be
involved in a discussion on the subject. He
thanked him, paid him, and then sallied forth on
his way to the office.

Petrovitch went out with him, and remained
standing in the street to watch Akaki as long as
possible wearing the mantle; then he hurried
through a cross-alley and came into the main
street again to catch another glimpse of him.

Akaki went on his way in high spirits. Every
moment he was acutely conscious of having
a new cloak on, and smiled with sheer self-complacency.
His head was filled with only
two ideas: first that the cloak was warm, and
secondly that it was beautiful. Without noticing
anything on the road, he marched straight to
the chancellery, took off his treasure in the hall,
and solemnly entrusted it to the porter''s care.

I do not know how the report spread in the
office that Akaki''s old cloak had ceased to exist.
All his colleagues hastened to see his splendid
new one, and then began to congratulate him
so warmly that he at first had to smile with
self-satisfaction, but finally began to feel embarrassed.

But how great was his surprise when his cruel
colleagues remarked that he should formally
“handsel” his cloak by giving them a feast!
 
Poor Akaki was so disconcerted and taken aback,
that he did not know what to answer nor how to
excuse himself. He stammered out, blushing,
that the cloak was not so new as it appeared; it
was really second-hand.

One of his superiors, who probably wished to
show that he was not too proud of his rank and
title, and did not disdain social intercourse with
his subordinates, broke in and said, “Gentlemen!
Instead of Akaki Akakievitch, I will invite
you to a little meal. Come to tea with
me this evening. To-day happens to be my
birthday.”

All the others thanked him for his kind
proposal, and joyfully accepted his invitation.
Akaki at first wished to decline, but was told
that to do so would be grossly impolite and
unpardonable, so he reconciled himself to the
inevitable. Moreover, he felt a certain satisfaction
at the thought that the occasion would give
him a new opportunity of displaying his cloak in
the streets. This whole day for him was like a
festival day. In the cheerfullest possible mood
he returned home, took off his cloak, and hung
it up on the wall after once more examining the
cloth and the lining. Then he took out his old
one in order to compare it with Petrovitch''s
masterpiece. His looks passed from one to
the other, and he thought to himself, smiling,
“What a difference!”

He ate his supper cheerfully, and after he
had finished, did not sit down as usual to copy
documents. No; he lay down, like a Sybarite,
on the sofa and waited. When the time came,
he made his toilette, took his cloak, and went
out.

I cannot say where was the house of the
superior official who so graciously invited his
subordinates to tea. My memory begins to grow
weak, and the innumerable streets and houses
of St Petersburg go round so confusedly in my
head that I have difficulty in finding my way
about them. So much, however, is certain:
that the honourable official lived in a very fine
quarter of the city, and therefore very far from
Akaki Akakievitch''s dwelling.

At first the titular councillor traversed several
badly lit streets which seemed quite empty; but
the nearer he approached his superior''s house,
the more brilliant and lively the streets became.
He met many people, among whom were
elegantly dressed ladies, and men with beaverskin
collars. The peasants'' sledges, with their
wooden seats and brass studs, became rarer;
while now every moment appeared skilled coachmen
with velvet caps, driving lacquered sleighs
covered with bearskins, and fine carriages.

At last he reached the house whither he had
been invited. His host lived in a first-rate style;
a lamp hung before his door, and he occupied
 
the whole of the second story. As Akaki
entered the vestibule, he saw a long row of
galoshes; on a table a samovar was smoking and
hissing; many cloaks, some of them adorned
with velvet and fur collars, hung on the wall.
In the adjoining room he heard a confused noise,
which assumed a more decided character when
a servant opened the door and came out bearing
a tray full of empty cups, a milk-jug, and a
basket of biscuits. Evidently the guests had
been there some time and had already drunk
their first cup of tea.

After hanging his cloak on a peg, Akaki
approached the room in which his colleagues,
smoking long pipes, were sitting round the card-table
and making a good deal of noise. He
entered the room, but remained standing by the
door, not knowing what to do; but his colleagues
greeted him with loud applause, and all hastened
into the vestibule to take another look at his
cloak. This excitement quite robbed the good
titular councillor of his composure; but in his
simplicity of heart he rejoiced at the praises
which were lavished on his precious cloak.
Soon afterwards his colleagues left him to himself
and resumed their whist parties.

Akaki felt much embarrassed, and did not
know what to do with his feet and hands.
Finally he sat down by the players; looked now
at their faces and now at the cards; then he
 
yawned and remembered that it was long past
his usual bedtime. He made an attempt to go,
but they held him back and told him that he
could not do so without drinking a glass of
champagne on what was for him such a memorable
day.

Soon supper was brought. It consisted of
cold veal, cakes, and pastry of various kinds,
accompanied by several bottles of champagne.
Akaki was obliged to drink two glasses of it, and
found everything round him take on a more
cheerful aspect. But he could not forget that it
was already midnight and that he ought to have
been in bed long ago. From fear of being kept
back again, he slipped furtively into the vestibule,
where he was pained to find his cloak lying
on the ground. He carefully shook it, brushed
it, put it on, and went out.

The street-lamps were still alight. Some of
the small ale-houses frequented by servants and
the lower classes were still open, and some had
just been shut; but by the beams of light which
shone through the chinks of the doors, it was
easy to see that there were still people inside,
probably male and female domestics, who were
quite indifferent to their employers'' interests.

Akaki Akakievitch turned homewards in a
cheerful mood. Suddenly he found himself in
a long street where it was very quiet by day and
still more so at night. The surroundings were
 
very dismal. Only here and there hung a lamp
which threatened to go out for want of oil; there
were long rows of wooden houses with wooden
fences, but no sign of a living soul. Only the
snow in the street glimmered faintly in the dim
light of the half-extinguished lanterns, and the
little houses looked melancholy in the darkness.

Akaki went on till the street opened into an
enormous square, on the other side of which the
houses were scarcely visible, and which looked
like a terrible desert. At a great distance—God
knows where!—glimmered the light in a sentry-box,
which seemed to stand at the end of the
world. At the same moment Akaki''s cheerful
mood vanished. He went in the direction of the
light with a vague sense of depression, as though
some mischief threatened him. On the way he
kept looking round him with alarm. The huge,
melancholy expanse looked to him like a sea.
“No,” he thought to himself, “I had better not
look at it”; and he continued his way with his
eyes fixed on the ground. When he raised them
again he suddenly saw just in front of him several
men with long moustaches, whose faces he could
not distinguish. Everything grew dark before
his eyes, and his heart seemed to be constricted.

“That is my cloak!” shouted one of the men,
and seized him by the collar. Akaki tried to
call for help. Another man pressed a great
bony fist on his mouth, and said to him, “Just
 
try to scream again!” At the same moment
the unhappy titular councillor felt the cloak
snatched away from him, and simultaneously
received a kick which stretched him senseless
in the snow. A few minutes later he came to
himself and stood up; but there was no longer
anyone in sight. Robbed of his cloak, and feeling
frozen to the marrow, he began to shout with
all his might; but his voice did not reach the end
of the huge square. Continuing to shout, he
ran with the rage of despair to the sentinel in the
sentry-box, who, leaning on his halberd, asked
him why the deuce he was making such a hellish
noise and running so violently.

When Akaki reached the sentinel, he accused
him of being drunk because he did not see that
passers-by were robbed a short distance from his
sentry-box.

“I saw you quite well,” answered the sentinel,
“in the middle of the square with two
men; I thought you were friends. It is no good
getting so excited. Go to-morrow to the police
inspector; he will take up the matter, have the
thieves searched for, and make an examination.”

Akaki saw there was nothing to be done but
to go home. He reached his dwelling in a state
of dreadful disorder, his hair hanging wildly
over his forehead, and his clothes covered
with snow. When his old landlady heard him
 
knocking violently at the door, she sprang up
and hastened thither, only half-dressed; but at
the sight of Akaki started back in alarm. When
he told her what had happened, she clasped her
hands together and said, “You should not go to
the police inspector, but to the municipal Superintendent
of the district. The inspector will put
you off with fine words, and do nothing; but I
have known the Superintendent for a long time.
My former cook, Anna, is now in his service,
and I often see him pass by under our windows.
He goes to church on all the festival-days, and
one sees at once by his looks that he is an honest
man.”

After hearing this eloquent recommendation,
Akaki retired sadly to his room. Those who can
picture to themselves such a situation will understand
what sort of a night he passed. As early
as possible the next morning he went to the
Superintendent''s house. The servants told him
that he was still asleep. At ten o''clock he
returned, only to receive the same reply. At
twelve o''clock the Superintendent had gone out.

About dinner-time the titular councillor called
again, but the clerks asked him in a severe tone
what was his business with their superior. Then
for the first time in his life Akaki displayed an
energetic character. He declared that it was
absolutely necessary for him to speak with the
Superintendent on an official matter, and that
 
anyone who ventured to put difficulties in his
way would have to pay dearly for it.

This left them without reply. One of the
clerks departed, in order to deliver his message.
When Akaki was admitted to the Superintendent''s
presence, the latter''s way of receiving his
story was somewhat singular. Instead of confining
himself to the principal matter—the theft,
he asked the titular councillor how he came to
be out so late, and whether he had not been in
suspicious company.

Taken aback by such a question, Akaki did
not know what to answer, and went away without
knowing whether any steps would be taken
in the matter or not.

The whole day he had not been in his office—a
perfectly new event in his life. The next day
he appeared there again with a pale face and
restless aspect, in his old cloak, which looked
more wretched than ever. When his colleagues
heard of his misfortune, some were cruel enough
to laugh; most of them, however, felt a sincere
sympathy with him, and started a subscription
for his benefit; but this praiseworthy undertaking
had only a very insignificant result, because
these same officials had been lately called upon
to contribute to two other subscriptions—in the
first case to purchase a portrait of their director,
and in the second to buy a work which a friend
of his had published.

One of them, who felt sincerely sorry for
Akaki, gave him some good advice for want of
something better. He told him it was a waste
of time to go again to the Superintendent,
because even in case that this official succeeded
in recovering the cloak, the police would keep it
till the titular councillor had indisputably proved
that he was the real owner of it. Akaki''s friend
suggested to him to go to a certain important
personage, who because of his connection with
the authorities could expedite the matter.

In his bewilderment, Akaki resolved to follow
this advice. It was not known what position
this personage occupied, nor how high it really
was; the only facts known were that he had
only recently been placed in it, and that there
must be still higher personages than himself, as
he was leaving no stone unturned in order to get
promotion. When he entered his private room,
he made his subordinates wait for him on the
stairs below, and no one had direct access to
him. If anyone called with a request to see him,
the secretary of the board informed the Government
secretary, who in his turn passed it on to
a higher official, and the latter informed the
important personage himself.

That is the way business is carried on in our
Holy Russia. In the endeavour to resemble the
higher officials, everyone imitates the manners
of his superiors. Not long ago a titular councillor,
 
who was appointed to the headship of a
little office, immediately placed over the door
of one of his two tiny rooms the inscription
“Council-chamber.” Outside it were placed
servants with red collars and lace-work on their
coats, in order to announce petitioners, and to
conduct them into the chamber which was hardly
large enough to contain a chair.

But let us return to the important personage
in question. His way of carrying things on was
dignified and imposing, but a trifle complicated.
His system might be summed up in a single
word—“severity.” This word he would repeat
in a sonorous tone three times in succession, and
the last time turn a piercing look on the person
with whom he happened to be speaking. He
might have spared himself the trouble of displaying
so much disciplinary energy; the ten
officials who were under his command feared
him quite sufficiently without it. As soon as
they were aware of his approach, they would lay
down their pens, and hasten to station themselves
in a respectful attitude as he passed by.
In converse with his subordinates, he preserved
a stiff, unbending attitude, and generally confined
himself to such expressions as “What do
you want? Do you know with whom you are
speaking? Do you consider who is in front of
you?”

For the rest, he was a good-natured man,
 
friendly and amiable with his acquaintances.
But the title of “District-Superintendent” had
turned his head. Since the time when it had
been bestowed upon him, he lived for a great
part of the day in a kind of dizzy self-intoxication.
Among his equals, however, he recovered
his equilibrium, and then showed his real
amiability in more than one direction; but as
soon as he found himself in the society of anyone
of less rank than himself, he entrenched himself
in a severe taciturnity. This situation was all
the more painful for him as he was quite aware
that he might have passed his time more agreeably.

All who watched him at such moments perceived
clearly that he longed to take part in an
interesting conversation, but that the fear of
displaying some unguarded courtesy, of appearing
too confidential, and thereby doing a deadly
injury to his dignity, held him back. In order
to avoid such a risk, he maintained an unnatural
reserve, and only spoke from time to time in
monosyllables. He had driven this habit to such
a pitch that people called him “The Tedious,”
and the title was well deserved.

Such was the person to whose aid Akaki
wished to appeal. The moment at which he
came seemed expressly calculated to flatter the
Superintendent''s vanity, and accordingly to help
forward the titular councillor''s cause.

The high personage was seated in his office,
talking cheerfully with an old friend whom he
had not seen for several years, when he was told
that a gentleman named Akakievitch begged for
the honour of an interview.

The high personage lied; there was nothing
in the way of his granting the desired audience.
His friend and himself had already quite exhausted
various topics of conversation. Many
long, embarrassing pauses had occurred, during
which they had lightly tapped each other on the
shoulder, saying, “So it was, you see.”

But the Superintendent refused to receive the
petitioner, in order to show his friend, who had
quitted the public service and lived in the
country, his own importance, and how officials
must wait in the vestibule till he chose to receive
them.

At last, after they had discussed various other
subjects with other intervals of silence, during
which the two friends leaned back in their chairs
and blew cigarette smoke in the air, the Superintendent
seemed suddenly to remember that
someone had sought an interview with him. He
 
called the secretary, who stood with a roll of
papers in his hand at the door, and told him to
admit the petitioner.

When he saw Akaki approaching with his
humble expression, wearing his shabby old
uniform, he turned round suddenly towards him
and said “What do you want?” in a severe
voice, accompanied by a vibrating intonation
which at the time of receiving his promotion he
had practised before the looking-glass for eight
days.

The modest Akaki was quite taken aback by
his harsh manner; however, he made an effort
to recover his composure, and to relate how his
cloak had been stolen, but did not do so without
encumbering his narrative with a mass of superfluous
detail. He added that he had applied to
His Excellence in the hope that through his
making a representation to the police inspector,
or some other high personage, the cloak might
be traced.

The Superintendent found Akaki''s method of
procedure somewhat unofficial. “Ah, sir,” he
said, “don''t you know what steps you ought to
take in such a case? Don''t you know the proper
procedure? You should have handed in your
petition at the chancellery. This in due course
would have passed through the hands of the chief
clerk and director of the bureau. It would
then have been brought before my secretary,
 
who would have made a communication to
you.”

“Allow me,” replied Akaki, making a strenuous
effort to preserve the remnants of his
presence of mind, for he felt that the perspiration
stood on his forehead, “allow me to remark
to Your Excellence that I ventured to trouble
you personally in this matter because secretaries—secretaries
are a hopeless kind of people.”

“What! How! Is it possible?” exclaimed
the Superintendent. “How could you say such
a thing? Where have you got your ideas from?
It is disgraceful to see young people so rebellious
towards their superiors.” In his official zeal
the Superintendent overlooked the fact that the
titular councillor was well on in the fifties, and
that the word “young” could only apply to him
conditionally, i.e. in comparison with a man of
seventy. “Do you also know,” he continued,
“with whom you are speaking? Do you consider
before whom you are standing? Do you
consider, I ask you, do you consider?” As he
spoke, he stamped his foot, and his voice grew
deeper.

Akaki was quite upset—nay, thoroughly
frightened; he trembled and shook and could
hardly remain standing upright. Unless one of
the office servants had hurried to help him, he
would have fallen to the ground. As it was, he
was dragged out almost unconscious.

But the Superintendent was quite delighted at
the effect he had produced. It exceeded all his
expectations, and filled with satisfaction at the
fact that his words made such an impression on a
middle-aged man that he lost consciousness, he
cast a side-glance at his friend to see what effect
the scene had produced on him. His self-satisfaction
was further increased when he observed
that his friend also was moved, and looked
at him half-timidly.

Akaki had no idea how he got down the stairs
and crossed the street, for he felt more dead than
alive. In his whole life he had never been so
scolded by a superior official, let alone one whom
he had never seen before.

He wandered in the storm which raged without
taking the least care of himself, nor sheltering
himself on the side-walk against its fury. The
wind, which blew from all sides and out of all the
narrow streets, caused him to contract inflammation
of the throat. When he reached home he
was unable to speak a word, and went straight
to bed.

The next day Akaki had a violent fever.
Thanks to the St Petersburg climate, his illness
developed with terrible rapidity. When the
doctor came, he saw that the case was already
hopeless; he felt his pulse and ordered him some
 
poultices, merely in order that he should not die
without some medical help, and declared at once
that he had only two days to live. After giving
this opinion, he said to Akaki''s landlady, “There
is no time to be lost; order a pine coffin, for an
oak one would be too expensive for this poor
man.”

Whether the titular councillor heard these
words, whether they excited him and made him
lament his tragic lot, no one ever knew, for he
was delirious all the time. Strange pictures
passed incessantly through his weakened brain.
At one time he saw Petrovitch the tailor and
asked him to make a cloak with nooses attached
for the thieves who persecuted him in bed, and
begged his old landlady to chase away the
robbers who were hidden under his coverlet.
At another time he seemed to be listening to the
Superintendent''s severe reprimand, and asking
his forgiveness. Then he uttered such strange
and confused remarks that the old woman
crossed herself in alarm. She had never heard
anything of the kind in her life, and these ravings
astonished her all the more because the expression
“Your Excellency” constantly occurred
in them. Later on he murmured wild disconnected
words, from which it could only be
gathered that his thoughts were continually
revolving round a cloak.

At last Akaki breathed his last. Neither his
 
room nor his cupboard were officially sealed up,
for the simple reason that he had no heir and left
nothing behind him but a bundle of goose-quills,
a notebook of white paper, three pairs of socks,
some trouser buttons, and his old coat.

Into whose possession did these relics pass?
Heaven only knows! The writer of this narrative
has never inquired.

Akaki was wrapped in his shroud, and laid
to rest in the churchyard. The great city of
St Petersburg continued its life as though he
had never existed. Thus disappeared a human
creature who had never possessed a patron or
friend, who had never elicited real hearty
sympathy from anyone, nor even aroused the
curiosity of the naturalists, though they are most
eager to subject a rare insect to microscopic
examination.

Without a complaint he had borne the scorn
and contempt of his colleagues; he had proceeded
on his quiet way to the grave without
anything extraordinary happening to him—only
towards the end of his life he had been joyfully
excited by the possession of a new cloak, and
had then been overthrown by misfortune.

Some days after his conversation with the
Superintendent, his superior in the chancellery,
where no one knew what had become of him,
sent an official to his house to demand his
presence. The official returned with the news
 
that no one would see the titular councillor any
more.

The next day his place was occupied by an
official of robuster fibre, a man who did not
trouble to make so many fair transcripts of state
documents.

It seems as though Akaki''s story ended here,
and that there was nothing more to be said
of him; but the modest titular councillor was
destined to attract more notice after his death
than during his life, and our tale now assumes a
somewhat ghostly complexion.

One day there spread in St Petersburg the
report that near the Katinka Bridge there
appeared every night a spectre in a uniform like
that of the chancellery officials; that he was
searching for a stolen cloak, and stripped all
passers-by of their cloaks without any regard
for rank or title. It mattered not whether they
were lined with wadding, mink, cat, otter, bear,
or beaverskin; he took all he could get hold of.
One of the titular councillor''s former colleagues
had seen the ghost, and quite clearly recognised
Akaki. He ran as hard as he could and managed
 
to escape, but had seen him shaking his fist
in the distance. Everywhere it was reported
that councillors, and not only titular councillors
but also state-councillors, had caught serious
colds in their honourable backs on account of
these raids.

The police adopted all possible measures in
order to get this ghost dead or alive into their
power, and to inflict an exemplary punishment
on him; but all their attempts were vain.

One evening, however, a sentinel succeeded
in getting hold of the malefactor just as he
was trying to rob a musician of his cloak. The
sentinel summoned with all the force of his lungs
two of his comrades, to whom he entrusted the
prisoner while he sought for his snuff-box in
order to bring some life again into his half-frozen
nose. Probably his snuff was so strong that
even a ghost could not stand it. Scarcely had
the sentinel thrust a grain or two up his nostrils
than the prisoner began to sneeze so violently
that a kind of mist rose before the eyes of the
sentinels. While the three were rubbing their
eyes, the prisoner disappeared. Since that day,
all the sentries were so afraid of the ghost that
they did not even venture to arrest the living
but shouted to them from afar “Go on! Go
on!”

Meanwhile the ghost extended his depredations
to the other side of the Katinka Bridge, and
 
spread dismay and alarm in the whole of the
quarter.

But now we must return to the Superintendent,
who is the real origin of our fantastic yet
so veracious story. First of all we must do him
the justice to state that after Akaki''s departure
he felt a certain sympathy for him. He was by
no means without a sense of justice—no, he
possessed various good qualities, but his infatuation
about his title hindered him from showing
his good side. When his friend left him, his
thoughts began to occupy themselves with the
unfortunate titular councillor, and from that
moment onwards he saw him constantly in his
mind''s eye, crushed by the severe reproof which
had been administered to him. This image so
haunted him that at last one day he ordered one
of his officials to find out what had become of
Akaki, and whether anything could be done for
him.

When the messenger returned with the news
that the poor man had died soon after that
interview, the Superintendent felt a pang in his
conscience, and remained the whole day absorbed
in melancholy brooding.

In order to banish his unpleasant sensations,
he went in the evening to a friend''s house, where
he hoped to find pleasant society and what was
the chief thing, some other officials of his own
rank, so that he would not be obliged to feel
 
bored. And in fact he did succeed in throwing
off his melancholy thoughts there; he unbent
and became lively, took an active part in the
conversation, and passed a very pleasant evening.
At supper he drank two glasses of champagne,
which, as everyone knows, is an effective
means of heightening one''s cheerfulness.

As he sat in his sledge, wrapped in his mantle,
on his way home, his mind was full of pleasant
reveries. He thought of the society in which
he had passed such a cheerful evening, and of
all the excellent jokes with which he had made
them laugh. He repeated some of them to
himself half-aloud, and laughed at them again.

From time to time, however, he was disturbed
in this cheerful mood by violent gusts of wind,
which from some corner or other blew a quantity
of snowflakes into his face, lifted the folds of his
cloak, and made it belly like a sail, so that he
had to exert all his strength to hold it firmly on
his shoulders. Suddenly he felt a powerful hand
seize him by the collar. He turned round, perceived
a short man in an old, shabby uniform,
and recognised with terror Akaki''s face, which
wore a deathly pallor and emaciation.

The titular councillor opened his mouth, from
which issued a kind of corpse-like odour, and
with inexpressible fright the Superintendent
heard him say, “At last I have you—by the
collar! I need your cloak. You did not
 
trouble about me when I was in distress; you
thought it necessary to reprimand me. Now
give me your cloak.”

The high dignitary nearly choked. In his
office, and especially in the presence of his
subordinates, he was a man of imposing
manners. He only needed to fix his eye on one
of them and they all seemed impressed by his
pompous bearing. But, as is the case with
many such officials, all this was only outward
show; at this moment he felt so upset that he
seriously feared for his health. Taking off his
cloak with a feverish, trembling hand, he handed
it to Akaki, and called to his coachman, “Drive
home quickly.”

When the coachman heard this voice, which
did not sound as it usually did, and had often
been accompanied by blows of a whip, he bent
his head cautiously and drove on apace.

Soon afterwards the Superintendent found
himself at home. Cloakless, he retired to his
room with a pale face and wild looks, and had
such a bad night that on the following morning
his daughter exclaimed “Father, are you ill?”
But he said nothing of what he had seen, though
a very deep impression had been made on him.
From that day onwards he no longer addressed
to his subordinates in a violent tone the words,
“Do you know with whom you are speaking?
Do you know who is standing before you?” Or
 
if it ever did happen that he spoke to them in a
domineering tone, it was not till he had first
listened to what they had to say.

Strangely enough, from that time the spectre
never appeared again. Probably it was the
Superintendent''s cloak which he had been seeking
so earnestly; now he had it and did not
want anything more. Various persons, however,
asserted that this formidable ghost was still to be
seen in other parts of the city. A sentinel went
so far as to say that he had seen him with his own
eyes glide like a furtive shadow behind a house.
But this sentinel was of such a nervous disposition
that he had been chaffed about his timidity
more than once. Since he did not venture to
seize the flitting shadow, he stole after it in the
darkness; but the shadow turned round and
shouted at him “What do you want?” shaking
an enormous fist, such as no man had ever
possessed.

This shadow, however, was taller than the
ghost of the titular councillor, and had an enormous
moustache. He went with great strides
towards the Obuchoff Bridge, and disappeared in
the darkness.

On the 25th March, 18—, a very strange occurrence
took place in St Petersburg. On the
Ascension Avenue there lived a barber of the
name of Ivan Jakovlevitch. He had lost his
family name, and on his sign-board, on which
was depicted the head of a gentleman with one
cheek soaped, the only inscription to be read
was, “Blood-letting done here.”

On this particular morning he awoke pretty
early. Becoming aware of the smell of fresh-baked
bread, he sat up a little in bed, and saw
his wife, who had a special partiality for coffee,
in the act of taking some fresh-baked bread out
of the oven.

“To-day, Prasskovna Ossipovna,” he said,
“I do not want any coffee; I should like a fresh
loaf with onions.”

“The blockhead may eat bread only as far as
I am concerned,” said his wife to herself; “then
I shall have a chance of getting some coffee.”
And she threw a loaf on the table.

For the sake of propriety, Ivan Jakovlevitch
drew a coat over his shirt, sat down at the table,
shook out some salt for himself, prepared two
onions, assumed a serious expression, and began
to cut the bread. After he had cut the loaf in
two halves, he looked, and to his great astonishment
saw something whitish sticking in it. He
carefully poked round it with his knife, and felt
it with his finger.

Ivan Jakovlevitch at first let his hands fall
from sheer astonishment; then he rubbed his
eyes and began to feel it. A nose, an actual
nose; and, moreover, it seemed to be the nose
of an acquaintance! Alarm and terror were
depicted in Ivan''s face; but these feelings were
slight in comparison with the disgust which took
possession of his wife.

“Whose nose have you cut off, you
monster?” she screamed, her face red with
anger. “You scoundrel! You tippler! I myself
will report you to the police! Such a
rascal! Many customers have told me that
while you were shaving them, you held them so
tight by the nose that they could hardly sit still.”

But Ivan Jakovlevitch was more dead than
alive; he saw at once that this nose could belong
to no other than to Kovaloff, a member of the
 
Municipal Committee whom he shaved every
Sunday and Wednesday.

“Stop, Prasskovna Ossipovna! I will wrap
it in a piece of cloth and place it in the corner.
There it may remain for the present; later on I
will take it away.”

“No, not there! Shall I endure an amputated
nose in my room? You understand
nothing except how to strop a razor. You know
nothing of the duties and obligations of a respectable
man. You vagabond! You good-for-nothing!
Am I to undertake all responsibility
for you at the police-office? Ah, you soap-smearer!
You blockhead! Take it away where
you like, but don''t let it stay under my
eyes!”

“The devil knows how that happened!” he
said at last, scratching his head behind his ear.
“Whether I came home drunk last night or not,
I really don''t know; but in all probability this
is a quite extraordinary occurrence, for a loaf
is something baked and a nose is something
different. I don''t understand the matter at
all.” And Ivan Jakovlevitch was silent. The
thought that the police might find him in unlawful
possession of a nose and arrest him, robbed
him of all presence of mind. Already he began
 
to have visions of a red collar with silver braid
and of a sword—and he trembled all over.

At last he finished dressing himself, and to the
accompaniment of the emphatic exhortations of
his spouse, he wrapped up the nose in a cloth and
issued into the street.

He intended to lose it somewhere—either at
somebody''s door, or in a public square, or in a
narrow alley; but just then, in order to complete
his bad luck, he was met by an acquaintance,
who showered inquiries upon him. “Hullo,
Ivan Jakovlevitch! Whom are you going to
shave so early in the morning?” etc., so that
he could find no suitable opportunity to do what
he wanted. Later on he did let the nose drop,
but a sentry bore down upon him with his
halberd, and said, “Look out! You have let
something drop!” and Ivan Jakovlevitch was
obliged to pick it up and put it in his pocket.

A feeling of despair began to take possession
of him; all the more as the streets became more
thronged and the merchants began to open their
shops. At last he resolved to go to the Isaac
Bridge, where perhaps he might succeed in
throwing it into the Neva.

But my conscience is a little uneasy that I have
not yet given any detailed information about
Ivan Jakovlevitch, an estimable man in many
ways.

Like every honest Russian tradesman, Ivan
 
Jakovlevitch was a terrible drunkard, and
although he shaved other people''s faces every
day, his own was always unshaved. His coat
(he never wore an overcoat) was quite mottled,
i.e. it had been black, but become brownish-yellow;
the collar was quite shiny, and instead
of the three buttons, only the threads by which
they had been fastened were to be seen.

Ivan Jakovlevitch was a great cynic, and when
Kovaloff, the member of the Municipal Committee,
said to him, as was his custom while being
shaved, “Your hands always smell, Ivan Jakovlevitch!”
the latter answered, “What do they
smell of?” “I don''t know, my friend, but
they smell very strong.” Ivan Jakovlevitch
after taking a pinch of snuff would then, by way
of reprisals, set to work to soap him on the cheek,
the upper lip, behind the ears, on the chin, and
everywhere.

This worthy man now stood on the Isaac
Bridge. At first he looked round him, then he
leant on the railings of the bridge, as though he
wished to look down and see how many fish were
swimming past, and secretly threw the nose,
wrapped in a little piece of cloth, into the
water. He felt as though a ton weight had been
lifted off him, and laughed cheerfully. Instead,
however, of going to shave any officials, he
turned his steps to a building, the sign-board of
which bore the legend “Teas served here,” in
 
order to have a glass of punch, when suddenly
he perceived at the other end of the bridge a
police inspector of imposing exterior, with long
whiskers, three-cornered hat, and sword hanging
at his side. He nearly fainted; but the police
inspector beckoned to him with his hand and
said, “Come here, my dear sir.”

Ivan Jakovlevitch, knowing how a gentleman
should behave, took his hat off quickly, went
towards the police inspector and said, “I hope
you are in the best of health.”

“By heaven, gracious sir, I was on the way
to my customers, and only looked down to see if
the river was flowing quickly.”

“I am willing to shave Your Grace two or
even three times a week gratis,” answered Ivan
Jakovlevitch.

“No, my friend, don''t put yourself out!
Three barbers are busy with me already, and
reckon it a high honour that I let them show me
their skill. Now then, out with it! What were
you doing there?”

Ivan Jakovlevitch grew pale. But here the
strange episode vanishes in mist, and what
further happened is not known.

Kovaloff, the member of the Municipal Committee,
awoke fairly early that morning, and
made a droning noise—“Brr! Brr!”—through
his lips, as he always did, though he could not
say why. He stretched himself, and told his
valet to give him a little mirror which was on the
table. He wished to look at the heat-boil which
had appeared on his nose the previous evening;
but to his great astonishment, he saw that instead
of his nose he had a perfectly smooth vacancy in
his face. Thoroughly alarmed, he ordered some
water to be brought, and rubbed his eyes with a
towel. Sure enough, he had no longer a nose!
Then he sprang out of bed, and shook himself
violently! No, no nose any more! He dressed
himself and went at once to the police superintendent.

But before proceeding further, we must certainly
give the reader some information about
Kovaloff, so that he may know what sort of a man
this member of the Municipal Committee really
was. These committee-men, who obtain that
title by means of certificates of learning, must
not be compared with the committee-men appointed
for the Caucasus district, who are of
quite a different kind. The learned committee-man—but
 
Russia is such a wonderful country
that when one committee-man is spoken of all
the others from Riga to Kamschatka refer it to
themselves. The same is also true of all other
titled officials. Kovaloff had been a Caucasian
committee-man two years previously, and could
not forget that he had occupied that position;
but in order to enhance his own importance,
he never called himself “committee-man” but
“Major.”

“Listen, my dear,” he used to say when he
met an old woman in the street who sold shirt-fronts;
“go to my house in Sadovaia Street and
ask ‘Does Major Kovaloff live here?’ Any
child can tell you where it is.”

Accordingly we will call him for the future
Major Kovaloff. It was his custom to take a daily
walk on the Neffsky Avenue. The collar of his
shirt was always remarkably clean and stiff. He
wore the same style of whiskers as those that are
worn by governors of districts, architects, and
regimental doctors; in short, all those who have
full red cheeks and play a good game of whist.
These whiskers grow straight across the cheek
towards the nose.

Major Kovaloff wore a number of seals, on
some of which were engraved armorial bearings,
and others the names of the days of the week.
He had come to St Petersburg with the view of
obtaining some position corresponding to his
 
rank, if possible that of vice-governor of a
province; but he was prepared to be content with
that of a bailiff in some department or other.
He was, moreover, not disinclined to marry, but
only such a lady who could bring with her a
dowry of two hundred thousand roubles. Accordingly,
the reader can judge for himself what
his sensations were when he found in his face,
instead of a fairly symmetrical nose, a broad,
flat vacancy.

To increase his misfortune, not a single
droshky was to be seen in the street, and so he
was obliged to proceed on foot. He wrapped
himself up in his cloak, and held his handkerchief
to his face as though his nose bled. “But
perhaps it is all only my imagination; it is impossible
that a nose should drop off in such a
silly way,” he thought, and stepped into a
confectioner''s shop in order to look into the
mirror.

Fortunately no customer was in the shop; only
small shop-boys were cleaning it out, and putting
chairs and tables straight. Others with sleepy
faces were carrying fresh cakes on trays, and
yesterday''s newspapers stained with coffee were
still lying about. “Thank God no one is
here!” he said to himself. “Now I can look
at myself leisurely.”

“What an infernal face!” he exclaimed, and
 
spat with disgust. “If there were only something
there instead of the nose, but there is
absolutely nothing.”

He bit his lips with vexation, left the confectioner''s,
and resolved, quite contrary to his habit,
neither to look nor smile at anyone on the street.
Suddenly he halted as if rooted to the spot before
a door, where something extraordinary happened.
A carriage drew up at the entrance; the
carriage door was opened, and a gentleman in
uniform came out and hurried up the steps.
How great was Kovaloff''s terror and astonishment
when he saw that it was his own nose!

At this extraordinary sight, everything seemed
to turn round with him. He felt as though he
could hardly keep upright on his legs; but,
though trembling all over as though with fever,
he resolved to wait till the nose should return
to the carriage. After about two minutes the
nose actually came out again. It wore a gold-embroidered
uniform with a stiff, high collar,
trousers of chamois leather, and a sword hung
at its side. The hat, adorned with a plume,
showed that it held the rank of a state-councillor.
It was obvious that it was paying “duty-calls.”
It looked round on both sides, called to the
coachman “Drive on,” and got into the carriage,
which drove away.

Poor Kovaloff nearly lost his reason. He did
not know what to think of this extraordinary
 
procedure. And indeed how was it possible
that the nose, which only yesterday he had on
his face, and which could neither walk nor drive,
should wear a uniform. He ran after the carriage,
which fortunately had stopped a short way
off before the Grand Bazar of Moscow. He
hurried towards it and pressed through a crowd
of beggar-women with their faces bound up,
leaving only two openings for the eyes, over
whom he had formerly so often made merry.

There were only a few people in front of the
Bazar. Kovaloff was so agitated that he could
decide on nothing, and looked for the nose
everywhere. At last he saw it standing before
a shop. It seemed half buried in its stiff collar,
and was attentively inspecting the wares displayed.

“How can I get at it?” thought Kovaloff.
“Everything—the uniform, the hat, and so on—show
that it is a state-councillor. How the
deuce has that happened?”

“It seems to me strange, most respected sir—you
should know where you belong—and I find
you all of a sudden—where? Judge yourself.”

“How shall I make my meaning plainer to
him?” Then plucking up fresh courage, he
continued, “Naturally—besides I am a Major.
You must admit it is not befitting that I should
go about without a nose. An old apple-woman
on the Ascension Bridge may carry on her business
without one, but since I am on the look out
for a post; besides in many houses I am acquainted
with ladies of high position—Madame
Tchektyriev, wife of a state-councillor, and
many others. So you see—I do not know,
honourable sir, what you——” (here the Major
shrugged his shoulders). “Pardon me; if one
regards the matter from the point of view of
duty and honour—you will yourself understand——”

“Honourable sir,” said Kovaloff with
dignity, “I do not know how I am to understand
your words. It seems to me the matter is as
clear as possible. Or do you wish—but you are
after all my own nose!”

The nose looked at the Major and wrinkled its
forehead. “There you are wrong, respected
sir; I am myself. Besides, there can be no close
 
relations between us. To judge by the buttons
of your uniform, you must be in quite a different
department to mine.” So saying, the nose
turned away.

Kovaloff was completely puzzled; he did not
know what to do, and still less what to think.
At this moment he heard the pleasant rustling of
a lady''s dress, and there approached an elderly
lady wearing a quantity of lace, and by her side
her graceful daughter in a white dress which set
off her slender figure to advantage, and wearing
a light straw hat. Behind the ladies marched a
tall lackey with long whiskers.

Kovaloff advanced a few steps, adjusted his
cambric collar, arranged his seals which hung
by a little gold chain, and with smiling face fixed
his eyes on the graceful lady, who bowed lightly
like a spring flower, and raised to her brow
her little white hand with transparent fingers.
He smiled still more when he spied under the
brim of her hat her little round chin, and part
of her cheek faintly tinted with rose-colour.
But suddenly he sprang back as though he had
been scorched. He remembered that he had
nothing but an absolute blank in place of a nose,
and tears started to his eyes. He turned round
in order to tell the gentleman in uniform that he
was only a state-councillor in appearance, but
really a scoundrel and a rascal, and nothing else
but his own nose; but the nose was no longer
 
there. He had had time to go, doubtless in
order to continue his visits.

His disappearance plunged Kovaloff into
despair. He went back and stood for a moment
under a colonnade, looking round him on all
sides in hope of perceiving the nose somewhere.
He remembered very well that it wore a hat with
a plume in it and a gold-embroidered uniform;
but he had not noticed the shape of the cloak,
nor the colour of the carriages and the horses,
nor even whether a lackey stood behind it, and,
if so, what sort of livery he wore. Moreover,
so many carriages were passing that it would
have been difficult to recognise one, and even if
he had done so, there would have been no means
of stopping it.

The day was fine and sunny. An immense
crowd was passing to and fro in the Neffsky
Avenue; a variegated stream of ladies flowed
along the pavement. There was his acquaintance,
the Privy Councillor, whom he was accustomed
to style “General,” especially when
strangers were present. There was Iarygin, his
intimate friend who always lost in the evenings
at whist; and there another Major, who had
obtained the rank of committee-man in the
Caucasus, beckoned to him.

“Go to the deuce!” said Kovaloff sotto voce.
“Hi! coachman, drive me straight to the superintendent
of police.” So saying, he got into a
 
droshky and continued to shout all the time to
the coachman “Drive hard!”

“Yes,” continued the porter, “he has only
just gone out; if you had been a moment
earlier you would perhaps have caught
him.”

Kovaloff, still holding his handkerchief to his
face, re-entered the droshky and cried in a
despairing voice “Drive on!”

This question made Kovaloff reflect. In his
situation it was necessary to have recourse to the
police; not because the affair had anything to do
with them directly but because they acted more
promptly than other authorities. As for demanding
any explanation from the department
to which the nose claimed to belong, it would,
he felt, be useless, for the answers of that
gentleman showed that he regarded nothing as
sacred, and he might just as likely have lied in
this matter as in saying that he had never seen
Kovaloff.

But just as he was about to order the coachman
to drive to the police-station, the idea
occurred to him that this rascally scoundrel who,
at their first meeting, had behaved so disloyally
towards him, might, profiting by the delay, quit
the city secretly; and then all his searching would
be in vain, or might last over a whole month.
Finally, as though visited with a heavenly inspiration,
he resolved to go directly to an advertisement
office, and to advertise the loss of his
nose, giving all its distinctive characteristics in
detail, so that anyone who found it might bring
it at once to him, or at any rate inform him
where it lived. Having decided on this course,
he ordered the coachman to drive to the advertisement
office, and all the way he continued to
punch him in the back—“Quick, scoundrel!
quick!”

At last they arrived, and Kovaloff, out of
breath, rushed into a little room where a grey-haired
official, in an old coat and with spectacles
on his nose, sat at a table holding his pen
between his teeth, counting a heap of copper
coins.

“At your service, sir,” answered the grey-haired
functionary, looking up and then fastening
 
his eyes again on the heap of coins before
him.

“Have the kindness to wait a minute,”
answered the official, putting down figures on
paper with one hand, and with the other moving
two balls on his calculating-frame.

A lackey, whose silver-laced coat showed that
he served in one of the houses of the nobility,
was standing by the table with a note in his hand,
and speaking in a lively tone, by way of showing
himself sociable. “Would you believe it, sir,
this little dog is really not worth twenty-four
kopecks, and for my own part I would not give a
farthing for it; but the countess is quite gone
upon it, and offers a hundred roubles'' reward to
anyone who finds it. To tell you the truth, the
tastes of these people are very different from
ours; they don''t mind giving five hundred or a
thousand roubles for a poodle or a pointer,
provided it be a good one.”

The official listened with a serious air while
counting the number of letters contained in the
note. At either side of the table stood a number
of housekeepers, clerks and porters, carrying
notes. The writer of one wished to sell a
barouche, which had been brought from Paris
in 1814 and had been very little used; others
wanted to dispose of a strong droshky which
 
wanted one spring, a spirited horse seventeen
years old, and so on. The room where these
people were collected was very small, and the air
was very close; but Kovaloff was not affected by
it, for he had covered his face with a handkerchief,
and because his nose itself was heaven
knew where.

“In a moment! In a moment! Two roubles,
twenty-four kopecks—one minute! One rouble,
sixty-four kopecks!” said the grey-haired
official, throwing their notes back to the housekeepers
and porters. “What do you wish?” he
said, turning to Kovaloff.

“I wish—” answered the latter, “I have just
been swindled and cheated, and I cannot get hold
of the perpetrator. I only want you to insert
an advertisement to say that whoever brings this
scoundrel to me will be well rewarded.”

“Why do you want my name? I have many
lady friends—Madame Tchektyriev, wife of a
state-councillor, Madame Podtotchina, wife of a
Colonel. Heaven forbid that they should get to
hear of it. You can simply write ‘committee-man,’
or, better, ‘Major.’”

“Mr Nose! Ah, you don''t understand me!
It is my own nose which has gone, I don''t know
where. The devil has played a trick on me.”

“I can''t tell you how, but the important point
is that now it walks about the city itself a state-councillor.
That is why I want you to advertise
that whoever gets hold of it should bring it as
soon as possible to me. Consider; how can I
live without such a prominent part of my body?
It is not as if it were merely a little toe; I would
only have to put my foot in my boot and no one
would notice its absence. Every Thursday I
call on the wife of M. Tchektyriev, the state-councillor;
Madame Podtotchina, a Colonel''s
wife who has a very pretty daughter, is one of
my acquaintances; and what am I to do now?
I cannot appear before them like this.”

The official compressed his lips and reflected.
“No, I cannot insert an advertisement like
that,” he said after a long pause.

“Because it might compromise the paper.
Suppose everyone could advertise that his nose
 
was lost. People already say that all sorts of
nonsense and lies are inserted.”

“You think so? Listen a minute. Last
week there was a case very like it. An official
came, just as you have done, bringing an advertisement
for the insertion of which he paid two
roubles, sixty-three kopecks; and this advertisement
simply announced the loss of a black-haired
poodle. There did not seem to be anything out
of the way in it, but it was really a satire; by the
poodle was meant the cashier of some establishment
or other.”

“That is a matter for a doctor. There are
said to be people who can provide you with any
kind of nose you like. But I see that you are a
witty man, and like to have your little joke.”

“Why put yourself out?” continued the
official, taking a pinch of snuff. “All the same,
if you don''t mind,” he added with a touch of
curiosity, “I should like to have a look at it.”

“It certainly does look odd,” said the official.
“It is perfectly flat like a freshly fried pancake.
It is hardly credible.”

“Very well. Are you going to hesitate
any more? You see it is impossible to refuse
to advertise my loss. I shall be particularly
obliged to you, and I shall be glad that this
incident has procured me the pleasure of making
your acquaintance.” The Major, we see, did
not even shrink from a slight humiliation.

“It certainly is not difficult to advertise it,”
replied the official; “but I don''t see what good
it would do you. However, if you lay so much
stress on it, you should apply to someone who
has a skilful pen, so that he may describe it as a
curious, natural freak, and publish the article in
the Northern Bee” (here he took another pinch)
“for the benefit of youthful readers” (he wiped
his nose), “or simply as a matter worthy of
arousing public curiosity.”

The committee-man felt completely discouraged.
He let his eyes fall absent-mindedly on
a daily paper in which theatrical performances
were advertised. Reading there the name of
an actress whom he knew to be pretty, he involuntarily
smiled, and his hand sought his pocket
to see if he had a blue ticket—for in Kovaloff''s
opinion superior officers like himself should not
take a lesser-priced seat; but the thought of his
lost nose suddenly spoilt everything.

The official himself seemed touched at his
difficult position. Desiring to console him, he
tried to express his sympathy by a few polite
words. “I much regret,” he said, “your
extraordinary mishap. Will you not try a
pinch of snuff? It clears the head, banishes
depression, and is a good preventive against
hÃ¦morrhoids.”

So saying, he reached his snuff-box out to
Kovaloff, skilfully concealing at the same time
the cover, which was adorned with the portrait of
some lady or other.

This act, quite innocent in itself, exasperated
Kovaloff. “I don''t understand what you find to
joke about in the matter,” he exclaimed angrily.
“Don''t you see that I lack precisely the essential
feature for taking snuff? The devil take
your snuff-box. I don''t want to look at snuff
now, not even the best, certainly not your vile
stuff!”

So saying, he left the advertisement office in
a state of profound irritation, and went to the
commissary of police. He arrived just as this
dignitary was reclining on his couch, and saying
to himself with a sigh of satisfaction, “Yes, I
shall make a nice little sum out of that.”

This police commissary was a great patron of
 
all the arts and industries; but what he liked
above everything else was a cheque. “It is a
thing,” he used to say, “to which it is not easy
to find an equivalent; it requires no food, it does
not take up much room, it stays in one''s pocket,
and if it falls, it is not broken.”

The commissary accorded Kovaloff a fairly
frigid reception, saying that the afternoon was
not the best time to come with a case, that nature
required one to rest a little after eating (this
showed the committee-man that the commissary
was acquainted with the aphorisms of the ancient
sages), and that respectable people did not have
their noses stolen.

The last allusion was too direct. We must
remember that Kovaloff was a very sensitive
man. He did not mind anything said against
him as an individual, but he could not endure
any reflection on his rank or social position. He
even believed that in comedies one might allow
attacks on junior officers, but never on their
seniors.

The commissary''s reception of him hurt his
feelings so much that he raised his head proudly,
and said with dignity, “After such insulting
expressions on your part, I have nothing more
to say.” And he left the place.

He reached his house quite wearied out. It
was already growing dark. After all his fruitless
search, his room seemed to him melancholy
 
and even ugly. In the vestibule he saw his
valet Ivan stretched on the leather couch and
amusing himself by spitting at the ceiling, which
he did very cleverly, hitting every time the same
spot. His servant''s equanimity enraged him;
he struck him on the forehead with his hat, and
said, “You good-for-nothing, you are always
playing the fool!”

Once in his room, the Major, tired and depressed,
threw himself in an armchair and, after
sighing a while, began to soliloquise:

“In heaven''s name, why should such a misfortune
befall me? If I had lost an arm or a
leg, it would be less insupportable; but a man
without a nose! Devil take it!—what is he good
for? He is only fit to be thrown out of the
window. If it had been taken from me in war or
in a duel, or if I had lost it by my own fault!
But it has disappeared inexplicably. But no! it
is impossible,” he continued after reflecting a few
moments, “it is incredible that a nose can disappear
like that—quite incredible. I must be
dreaming, or suffering from some hallucination;
perhaps I swallowed, by mistake instead of
water, the brandy with which I rub my chin after
being shaved. That fool of an Ivan must have
forgotten to take it away, and I must have
swallowed it.”

In order to find out whether he were really
drunk, the Major pinched himself so hard that
he unvoluntarily uttered a cry. The pain convinced
him that he was quite wide awake. He
walked slowly to the looking-glass and at first
closed his eyes, hoping to see his nose suddenly
in its proper place; but on opening them, he
started back. “What a hideous sight!” he
exclaimed.

It was really incomprehensible. One might
easily lose a button, a silver spoon, a watch, or
something similar; but a loss like this, and in
one''s own dwelling!

After considering all the circumstances, Major
Kovaloff felt inclined to suppose that the cause
of all his trouble should be laid at the door of
Madame Podtotchina, the Colonel''s wife, who
wished him to marry her daughter. He himself
paid her court readily, but always avoided
coming to the point. And when the lady one
day told him point-blank that she wished him
to marry her daughter, he gently drew back,
declaring that he was still too young, and that he
had to serve five years more before he would be
forty-two. This must be the reason why the
lady, in revenge, had resolved to bring him into
disgrace, and had hired two sorceresses for that
object. One thing was certain—his nose had
not been cut off; no one had entered his room,
and as for Ivan Jakovlevitch—he had been
 
shaved by him on Wednesday, and during that
day and the whole of Thursday his nose had
been there, as he knew and well remembered.
Moreover, if his nose had been cut off he
would naturally have felt pain, and doubtless
the wound would not have healed so quickly,
nor would the surface have been as flat as a
pancake.

All kinds of plans passed through his head:
should he bring a legal action against the wife
of a superior officer, or should he go to her and
charge her openly with her treachery?

His reflections were interrupted by a sudden
light, which shone through all the chinks of the
door, showing that Ivan had lit the wax-candles
in the vestibule. Soon Ivan himself came in
with the lights. Kovaloff quickly seized a handkerchief
and covered the place where his nose
had been the evening before, so that his blockhead
of a servant might not gape with his mouth
wide open when he saw his master''s extraordinary
appearance.

He saw a police official of pleasant appearance,
with grey whiskers and fairly full cheeks—the
same who at the commencement of this story was
 
standing at the end of the Isaac Bridge. “You
have lost your nose?” he asked.

Joy had suddenly paralysed his tongue. He
stared at the police commissary on whose cheeks
and full lips fell the flickering light of the candle.

“By a very singular chance. It has been
arrested just as it was getting into a carriage for
Riga. Its passport had been made out some
time ago in the name of an official; and what is
still more strange, I myself took it at first for a
gentleman. Fortunately I had my glasses with
me, and then I saw at once that it was a nose.
I am shortsighted, you know, and as you stand
before me I cannot distinguish your nose, your
beard, or anything else. My mother-in-law can
hardly see at all.”

“Don''t put yourself out. Knowing that you
need it, I have brought it with me. Another
singular thing is that the principal culprit in the
matter is a scoundrel of a barber living in the
Ascension Avenue, who is now safely locked up.
I had long suspected him of drunkenness and
 
theft; only the day before yesterday he stole
some buttons in a shop. Your nose is quite
uninjured.” So saying, the police commissary
put his hand in his pocket and brought out the
nose wrapped up in paper.

“I should like to very much, but I cannot.
I must go at once to the House of Correction.
The cost of living is very high nowadays. My
mother-in-law lives with me, and there are
several children; the eldest is very hopeful and
intelligent, but I have no means for their
education.”

After the commissary''s departure, Kovaloff
remained for some time plunged in a kind of
vague reverie, and did not recover full consciousness
for several moments, so great was the
effect of this unexpected good news. He placed
the recovered nose carefully in the palm of his
hand, and examined it again with the greatest
attention.

“Yes, this is it!” he said to himself. “Here
is the heat-boil on the left side, which came out
yesterday.” And he nearly laughed aloud with
delight.

But nothing is permanent in this world. Joy
in the second moment of its arrival is already
less keen than in the first, is still fainter in the
 
third, and finishes by coalescing with our normal
mental state, just as the circles which the fall of
a pebble forms on the surface of water, gradually
die away. Kovaloff began to meditate, and saw
that his difficulties were not yet over; his nose
had been recovered, but it had to be joined on
again in its proper place.

And suppose it could not? As he put this
question to himself, Kovaloff grew pale. With
a feeling of indescribable dread, he rushed
towards his dressing-table, and stood before the
mirror in order that he might not place his nose
crookedly. His hands trembled.

Very carefully he placed it where it had been
before. Horror! It did not remain there.
He held it to his mouth and warmed it a little
with his breath, and then placed it there again;
but it would not hold.

But the nose seemed to be made of wood, and
fell back on the table with a strange noise, as
though it had been a cork. The Major''s face
began to twitch feverishly. “Is it possible that
it won''t stick?” he asked himself, full of alarm.
But however often he tried, all his efforts were
in vain.

He called Ivan, and sent him to fetch the
doctor who occupied the finest flat in the
mansion. This doctor was a man of imposing
appearance, who had magnificent black whiskers
 
and a healthy wife. He ate fresh apples every
morning, and cleaned his teeth with extreme
care, using five different tooth-brushes for three-quarters
of an hour daily.

The doctor came immediately. After having
asked the Major when this misfortune had happened,
he raised his chin and gave him a fillip
with his finger just where the nose had been, in
such a way that the Major suddenly threw back
his head and struck the wall with it. The doctor
said that did not matter; then, making him turn
his face to the right, he felt the vacant place and
said “H''m!” then he made him turn it to the
left and did the same; finally he again gave him
a fillip with his finger, so that the Major started
like a horse whose teeth are being examined.
After this experiment, the doctor shook his head
and said, “No, it cannot be done. Rather
remain as you are, lest something worse happen.
Certainly one could replace it at once, but I
assure you the remedy would be worse than the
disease.”

“All very fine, but how am I to go on without
a nose?” answered Kovaloff. “There is
nothing worse than that. How can I show
myself with such a villainous appearance? I go
into good society, and this evening I am invited
to two parties. I know several ladies, Madame
Tchektyriev, the wife of a state-councillor,
Madame Podtotchina—although after what she
 
has done, I don''t want to have anything to do
with her except through the agency of the police.
I beg you,” continued Kovaloff in a supplicating
tone, “find some way or other of replacing it;
even if it is not quite firm, as long as it holds at
all; I can keep it in place sometimes with my
hand, whenever there is any risk. Besides, I
do not even dance, so that it is not likely to be
injured by any sudden movement. As to your
fee, be in no anxiety about that; I can well
afford it.”

“Believe me,” answered the doctor in a voice
which was neither too high nor too low, but soft
and almost magnetic, “I do not treat patients
from love of gain. That would be contrary to
my principles and to my art. It is true that I
accept fees, but that is only not to hurt my
patients'' feelings by refusing them. I could
certainly replace your nose, but I assure you on
my word of honour, it would only make matters
worse. Rather let Nature do her own work.
Wash the place often with cold water, and I
assure you that even without a nose, you will be
just as well as if you had one. As to the nose
itself, I advise you to have it preserved in a
bottle of spirits, or, still better, of warm vinegar
mixed with two spoonfuls of brandy, and then
you can sell it at a good price. I would be
willing to take it myself, provided you do not
ask too much.”

“Excuse me,” said the doctor, taking his
leave. “I hoped to be useful to you, but I can
do nothing more; you are at any rate convinced
of my good-will.” So saying, the doctor left
the room with a dignified air.

Kovaloff did not even notice his departure.
Absorbed in a profound reverie, he only saw the
edge of his snow-white cuffs emerging from the
sleeves of his black coat.

The next day he resolved, before bringing a
formal action, to write to the Colonel''s wife and
see whether she would not return to him, without
further dispute, that of which she had deprived
him.

“I hardly understand your method of action.
Be sure that by adopting such a course you will
gain nothing, and will certainly not succeed in
making me marry your daughter. Believe me,
the story of my nose has become well known; it
is you and no one else who have taken the principal
part in it. Its unexpected separation from
the place which it occupied, its flight and its
appearances sometimes in the disguise of an
official, sometimes in proper person, are nothing
but the consequence of unholy spells employed
 by you or by persons who, like you, are addicted
to such honourable pursuits. On my part, I wish
to inform you, that if the above-mentioned nose
is not restored to-day to its proper place, I shall
be obliged to have recourse to legal procedure.

“Your letter has profoundly astonished me.
I must confess that I had not expected such
unjust reproaches on your part. I assure you
that the official of whom you speak has not been
at my house, either disguised or in his proper
person. It is true that Philippe Ivanovitch
Potantchikoff has paid visits at my house, and
though he has actually asked for my daughter''s
hand, and was a man of good breeding, respectable
and intelligent, I never gave him any hope.

“Again, you say something about a nose.
If you intend to imply by that that I wished to
snub you, i.e. to meet you with a refusal, I am
very astonished because, as you well know, I was
quite of the opposite mind. If after this you
wish to ask for my daughter''s hand, I should be
glad to gratify you, for such has also been the
object of my most fervent desire, in the hope of
 the accomplishment of which, I remain, yours
most sincerely,

“No,” said Kovaloff, after having reperused
the letter, “she is certainly not guilty. It is
impossible. Such a letter could not be written
by a criminal.” The committee-man was experienced
in such matters, for he had been often
officially deputed to conduct criminal investigations
while in the Caucasus. “But then how
and by what trick of fate has the thing happened?”
he said to himself with a gesture of
discouragement. “The devil must be at the
bottom of it.”

Meanwhile the rumour of this extraordinary
event had spread all over the city, and, as is
generally the case, not without numerous additions.
At that period there was a general disposition
to believe in the miraculous; the public
had recently been impressed by experiments in
magnetism. The story of the floating chairs in
Koniouchennaia Street was still quite recent,
and there was nothing astonishing in hearing
soon afterwards that Major Kovaloff''s nose was
to be seen walking every day at three o''clock
on the Neffsky Avenue. The crowd of curious
spectators which gathered there daily was enormous.
On one occasion someone spread a report
that the nose was in Junker''s stores and immediately
 
the place was besieged by such a crowd
that the police had to interfere and establish
order. A certain speculator with a grave, whiskered
face, who sold cakes at a theatre door,
had some strong wooden benches made which
he placed before the window of the stores, and
obligingly invited the public to stand on them
and look in, at the modest charge of twenty-four
kopecks. A veteran colonel, leaving his house
earlier than usual expressly for the purpose, had
the greatest difficulty in elbowing his way through
the crowd, but to his great indignation he saw
nothing in the store window but an ordinary
flannel waistcoat and a coloured lithograph
representing a young girl darning a stocking,
while an elegant youth in a waistcoat with large
lappels watched her from behind a tree. The
picture had hung in the same place for more
than ten years. The colonel went off, growling
savagely to himself, “How can the fools let
themselves be excited by such idiotic stories?”

Then another rumour got abroad, to the effect
that the nose of Major Kovaloff was in the habit
of walking not on the Neffsky Avenue but in the
Tauris Gardens. Some students of the Academy
of Surgery went there on purpose to see it. A
high-born lady wrote to the keeper of the gardens
asking him to show her children this rare phenomenon,
and to give them some suitable instruction
on the occasion.

All these incidents were eagerly collected by
the town wits, who just then were very short
of anecdotes adapted to amuse ladies. On the
other hand, the minority of solid, sober people
were very much displeased. One gentleman
asserted with great indignation that he could not
understand how in our enlightened age such
absurdities could spread abroad, and he was
astonished that the Government did not direct
their attention to the matter. This gentleman
evidently belonged to the category of those
people who wish the Government to interfere in
everything, even in their daily quarrels with their
wives.

Strange events happen in this world, events
which are sometimes entirely improbable. The
same nose which had masqueraded as a state-councillor,
and caused so much sensation in the
town, was found one morning in its proper place,
i.e. between the cheeks of Major Kovaloff, as if
nothing had happened.

This occurred on 7th April. On awaking, the
Major looked by chance into a mirror and perceived
a nose. He quickly put his hand to it; it
was there beyond a doubt!

“Oh!” exclaimed Kovaloff. For sheer joy
 
he was on the point of performing a dance barefooted
across his room, but the entrance of Ivan
prevented him. He told him to bring water,
and after washing himself, he looked again in
the glass. The nose was there! Then he dried
his face with a towel and looked again. Yes,
there was no mistake about it!

And he thought to himself at the same time,
“That will be a nice business if Ivan says to
me ‘No, sir, not only is there no boil, but your
nose itself is not there!’”

At this moment the barber, Ivan Jakovlevitch,
put his head in at the door, but as timidly as a
cat which has just been beaten for stealing lard.

Kovaloff seated himself. Jakovlevitch tied a
napkin under his chin, and in the twinkling of an
eye covered his beard and part of his cheeks with
a copious creamy lather.

“There it is!” said the barber to himself, as
he glanced at the nose. Then he bent his head
a little and examined it from one side. “Yes,
it actually is the nose—really, when one
thinks——” he continued, pursuing his mental
soliloquy and still looking at it. Then quite
gently, with infinite precaution, he raised two
fingers in the air in order to take hold of it by
the extremity, as he was accustomed to do.

Ivan Jakovlevitch let his arm fall and felt more
embarrassed than he had ever done in his life.
At last he began to pass the razor very lightly
over the Major''s chin, and although it was very
difficult to shave him without using the olfactory
organ as a point of support, he succeeded, however,
by placing his wrinkled thumb against the
Major''s lower jaw and cheek, thus overcoming
all obstacles and bringing his task to a safe
conclusion.

When the barber had finished, Kovaloff hastened
to dress himself, took a droshky, and drove
straight to the confectioner''s. As he entered it,
he ordered a cup of chocolate. He then stepped
straight to the mirror; the nose was there!

He returned joyfully, and regarded with a
satirical expression two officers who were in the
shop, one of whom possessed a nose not much
larger than a waistcoat button.

After that he went to the office of the department
 
where he had applied for the post of vice-governor
of a province or Government bailiff.
As he passed through the hall of reception, he
cast a glance at the mirror; the nose was there!
Then he went to pay a visit to another committee-man,
a very sarcastic personage, to whom he was
accustomed to say in answer to his raillery,
“Yes, I know, you are the funniest fellow in
St Petersburg.”

On the way he said to himself, “If the Major
does not burst into laughter at the sight of me,
that is a most certain sign that everything is in
its accustomed place.”

As he returned, he met Madame Podtotchina
with her daughter. He accosted them, and they
responded very graciously. The conversation
lasted a long time, during which he took more
than one pinch of snuff, saying to himself, “No,
you haven''t caught me yet, coquettes that you
are! And as to the daughter, I shan''t marry
her at all.”

After that, the Major resumed his walks on
the Neffsky Avenue and his visits to the theatre
as if nothing had happened. His nose also
remained in its place as if it had never quitted it.
From that time he was always to be seen smiling,
in a good humour, and paying attentions to pretty
girls.

Such was the occurrence which took place in
the northern capital of our vast empire. On
considering the account carefully we see that
there is a good deal which looks improbable about
it. Not to speak of the strange disappearance of
the nose, and its appearance in different places
under the disguise of a councillor of state, how
was it that Kovaloff did not understand that one
cannot decently advertise for a lost nose? I do
not mean to say that he would have had to pay
too much for the advertisement—that is a mere
trifle, and I am not one of those who attach too
much importance to money; but to advertise in
such a case is not proper nor befitting.

Another difficulty is—how was the nose found
in the baked loaf, and how did Ivan Jakovlevitch
himself—no, I don''t understand it at all!

But the most incomprehensible thing of all is,
how authors can choose such subjects for their
stories. That really surpasses my understanding.
In the first place, no advantage results
from it for the country; and in the second place,
no harm results either.

All the same, when one reflects well, there
really is something in the matter. Whatever
may be said to the contrary, such cases do occur—rarely,
it is true, but now and then actually.

October 3rd.—A strange occurrence has taken
place to-day. I got up fairly late, and when
Mawra brought me my clean boots, I asked her
how late it was. When I heard it had long
struck ten, I dressed as quickly as possible.

To tell the truth, I would rather not have gone
to the office at all to-day, for I know beforehand
that our department-chief will look as sour as
vinegar. For some time past he has been in the
habit of saying to me, “Look here, my friend;
there is something wrong with your head. You
often rush about as though you were possessed.
Then you make such confused abstracts of the
documents that the devil himself cannot make
them out; you write the title without any capital
letters, and add neither the date nor the docket-number.”
The long-legged scoundrel! He is
certainly envious of me, because I sit in the
director''s work-room, and mend His Excellency''s
pens. In a word, I should not have gone
to the office if I had not hoped to meet the
accountant, and perhaps squeeze a little advance
out of this skinflint.

A terrible man, this accountant! As for his
advancing one''s salary once in a way—you might
sooner expect the skies to fall. You may beg
and beseech him, and be on the very verge of
ruin—this grey devil won''t budge an inch. At
the same time, his own cook at home, as all the
world knows, boxes his ears.

I really don''t see what good one gets by
serving in our department. There are no plums
there. In the fiscal and judicial offices it is quite
different. There some ungainly fellow sits in a
corner and writes and writes; he has such a
shabby coat and such an ugly mug that one would
like to spit on both of them. But you should see
what a splendid country-house he has rented.
He would not condescend to accept a gilt porcelain
cup as a present. “You can give that to
your family doctor,” he would say. Nothing
less than a pair of chestnut horses, a fine carriage,
or a beaver-fur coat worth three hundred
roubles would be good enough for him. And
yet he seems so mild and quiet, and asks so
amiably, “Please lend me your penknife; I wish
to mend my pen.” Nevertheless, he knows how
to scarify a petitioner till he has hardly a whole
stitch left on his body.

In our office it must be admitted everything is
done in a proper and gentlemanly way; there
is more cleanness and elegance than one will
ever find in Government offices. The tables
 
are mahogany, and everyone is addressed as
“sir.” And truly, were it not for this official
propriety, I should long ago have sent in my
resignation.

I put on my old cloak, and took my umbrella,
as a light rain was falling. No one was to be
seen on the streets except some women, who had
flung their skirts over their heads. Here and
there one saw a cabman or a shopman with his
umbrella up. Of the higher classes one only
saw an official here and there. One I saw at the
street-crossing, and thought to myself, “Ah!
my friend, you are not going to the office, but
after that young lady who walks in front of you.
You are just like the officers who run after every
petticoat they see.”

As I was thus following the train of my
thoughts, I saw a carriage stop before a shop just
as I was passing it. I recognised it at once; it
was our director''s carriage. “He has nothing
to do in the shop,” I said to myself; “it must be
his daughter.”

I pressed myself close against the wall. A
lackey opened the carriage door, and, as I had
expected, she fluttered like a bird out of it.
How proudly she looked right and left; how she
drew her eyebrows together, and shot lightnings
from her eyes—good heavens! I am lost, hopelessly
lost!

But why must she come out in such abominable
 
weather? And yet they say women are so mad
on their finery!

She did not recognise me. I had wrapped
myself as closely as possible in my cloak. It
was dirty and old-fashioned, and I would not
have liked to have been seen by her wearing it.
Now they wear cloaks with long collars, but
mine has only a short double collar, and the
cloth is of inferior quality.

Her little dog could not get into the shop, and
remained outside. I know this dog; its name is
“Meggy.”

Who the deuce was that? I looked round
and saw two ladies hurrying by under an umbrella—one
old, the other fairly young. They
had already passed me when I heard the same
voice say again, “For shame, Meggy!”

What was that? I saw Meggy sniffing at a
dog which ran behind the ladies. The deuce!
I thought to myself, “I am not drunk? That
happens pretty seldom.”

“No, Fidel, you are wrong,” I heard Meggy
say quite distinctly. “I was—bow—wow!—I
was—bow! wow! wow!—very ill.”

What an extraordinary dog! I was, to tell
the truth, quite amazed to hear it talk human
language. But when I considered the matter
well, I ceased to be astonished. In fact, such
 
things have already happened in the world. It
is said that in England a fish put its head out of
water and said a word or two in such an extraordinary
language that learned men have been
puzzling over them for three years, and have not
succeeded in interpreting them yet. I also read
in the paper of two cows who entered a shop and
asked for a pound of tea.

Meanwhile what Meggy went on to say seemed
to me still more remarkable. She added, “I
wrote to you lately, Fidel; perhaps Polkan did
not bring you the letter.”

Now I am willing to forfeit a whole month''s
salary if I ever heard of dogs writing before.
This has certainly astonished me. For some
little time past I hear and see things which no
other man has heard and seen.

“I will,” I thought, “follow that dog in
order to get to the bottom of the matter.
Accordingly, I opened my umbrella and went
after the two ladies. They went down Bean
Street, turned through Citizen Street and Carpenter
Street, and finally halted on the Cuckoo
Bridge before a large house. I know this house;
it is Sverkoff''s. What a monster he is! What
sort of people live there! How many cooks,
how many bagmen! There are brother officials
of mine also there packed on each other like
herrings. And I have a friend there, a fine
player on the cornet.”

The ladies mounted to the fifth story. “Very
good,” thought I; “I will make a note of the
number, in order to follow up the matter at the
first opportunity.”

October 4th.—To-day is Wednesday, and I
was as usual in the office. I came early on
purpose, sat down, and mended all the pens.

Our director must be a very clever man.
The whole room is full of bookcases. I read the
titles of some of the books; they were very
learned, beyond the comprehension of people
of my class, and all in French and German. I
look at his face; see! how much dignity there is
in his eyes. I never hear a single superfluous
word from his mouth, except that when he hands
over the documents, he asks “What sort of
weather is it?”

No, he is not a man of our class; he is a real
statesman. I have already noticed that I am a
special favourite of his. If now his daughter
also—ah! what folly—let me say no more about
it!

I have read the Northern Bee. What foolish
people the French are! By heavens! I should
like to tackle them all, and give them a thrashing.
I have also read a fine description of a
ball given by a landowner of Kursk. The landowners
of Kursk write a fine style.

Then I noticed that it was already half-past
 
twelve, and the director had not yet left his
bedroom. But about half-past one something
happened which no pen can describe.

The door opened. I thought it was the
director; I jumped up with my documents from
the seat, and—then—she—herself—came into
the room. Ye saints! how beautifully she was
dressed. Her garments were whiter than a
swan''s plumage—oh how splendid! A sun,
indeed, a real sun!

“Your Excellency,” I wanted to exclaim,
“don''t have me executed, but if it must be
done, then kill me rather with your own angelic
hand.” But, God knows why, I could not bring
it out, so I only said, “No, he has not come yet.”

She glanced at me, looked at the books, and
let her handkerchief fall. Instantly I started
up, but slipped on the infernal polished floor,
and nearly broke my nose. Still I succeeded
in picking up the handkerchief. Ye heavenly
choirs, what a handkerchief! So tender and
soft, of the finest cambric. It had the scent of
a general''s rank!

After I had sat there about an hour, a flunkey
came in and said, “You can go home, Mr
Ivanovitch; the director has already gone out!”

I cannot stand these lackeys! They hang
about the vestibules, and scarcely vouchsafe to
greet one with a nod. Yes, sometimes it is even
worse; once one of these rascals offered me his
snuff-box without even getting up from his chair.
“Don''t you know then, you country-bumpkin,
that I am an official and of aristocratic birth?”

This time, however, I took my hat and overcoat
quietly; these people naturally never think
of helping one on with it. I went home, lay a
good while on the bed, and wrote some verses
in my note:

In the evening I wrapped myself in my cloak,
hastened to the director''s house, and waited
there a long time to see if she would come out
and get into the carriage. I only wanted to see
her once, but she did not come.

November 6th.—Our chief clerk has gone
mad. When I came to the office to-day he called
me to his room and began as follows: “Look
here, my friend, what wild ideas have got into
your head?”

“Consider well. You are already past forty;
it is quite time to be reasonable. What do you
imagine? Do you think I don''t know all your
tricks? Are you trying to pay court to the
director''s daughter? Look at yourself and
realise what you are! A nonentity, nothing else.
I would not give a kopeck for you. Look well
in the glass. How can you have such thoughts
with such a caricature of a face?”

May the devil take him! Because his own
face has a certain resemblance to a medicine-bottle,
because he has a curly bush of hair on
his head, and sometimes combs it upwards, and
sometimes plasters it down in all kinds of queer
ways, he thinks that he can do everything. I
know well, I know why he is angry with me.
He is envious; perhaps he has noticed the tokens
of favour which have been graciously shown me.
But why should I bother about him? A councillor!
What sort of important animal is that?
He wears a gold chain with his watch, buys
himself boots at thirty roubles a pair; may the
deuce take him! Am I a tailor''s son or some
other obscure cabbage? I am a nobleman! I
can also work my way up. I am just forty-two—an
age when a man''s real career generally
begins. Wait a bit, my friend! I too may get
to a superior''s rank; or perhaps, if God is
gracious, even to a higher one. I shall make a
 
name which will far outstrip yours. You think
there are no able men except yourself? I only
need to order a fashionable coat and wear a tie
like yours, and you would be quite eclipsed.

November 8th.—I was at the theatre. “The
Russian House-Fool” was performed. I laughed
heartily. There was also a kind of musical
comedy which contained amusing hits at barristers.
The language was very broad; I wonder
the censor passed it. In the comedy lines occur
which accuse the merchants of cheating; their
sons are said to lead immoral lives, and to
behave very disrespectfully towards the nobility.

The critics also are criticised; they are said
only to be able to find fault, so that authors have
to beg the public for protection.

Our modern dramatists certainly write amusing
things. I am very fond of the theatre. If
I have only a kopeck in my pocket, I always
go there. Most of my fellow-officials are uneducated
boors, and never enter a theatre unless
one throws free tickets at their head.

November 9th.—About eight o''clock I went to
the office. The chief clerk pretended not to
notice my arrival. I for my part also behaved
 
as though he were not in existence. I read
through and collated documents. About four
o''clock I left. I passed by the director''s house,
but no one was to be seen. After dinner I lay
for a good while on the bed.

November 11th.—To-day I sat in the director''s
room, mended twenty-three pens for
him, and for Her—for Her Excellence, his
daughter, four more.

The director likes to see many pens lying on
his table. What a head he must have! He
continually wraps himself in silence, but I don''t
think the smallest trifle escapes his eye. I should
like to know what he is generally thinking of,
what is really going on in this brain; I should like
to get acquainted with the whole manner of life
of these gentlemen, and get a closer view of their
cunning courtiers'' arts, and all the activities of
these circles. I have often thought of asking His
Excellence about them; but—the deuce knows
why!—every time my tongue failed me and I
could get nothing out but my meteorological
report.

I wish I could get a look into the spare-room
whose door I so often see open. And a second
small room behind the spare-room excites my
curiosity. How splendidly it is fitted up; what a
quantity of mirrors and choice china it contains!
I should also like to cast a glance into those
 
regions where Her Excellency, the daughter,
wields the sceptre. I should like to see how all
the scent-bottles and boxes are arranged in her
boudoir, and the flowers which exhale so delicious
a scent that one is half afraid to breathe.
And her clothes lying about which are too
ethereal to be called clothes—but silence!

To-day there came to me what seemed a
heavenly inspiration. I remembered the conversation
between the two dogs which I had overheard
on the Nevski Prospect. “Very good,”
I thought; “now I see my way clear. I must
get hold of the correspondence which these two
silly dogs have carried on with each other. In
it I shall probably find many things explained.”

I had already once called Meggy to me and
said to her, “Listen, Meggy! Now we are
alone together; if you like, I will also shut the
door so that no one can see us. Tell me now
all that you know about your mistress. I swear
to you that I will tell no one.”

But the cunning dog drew in its tail, ruffled up
its hair, and went quite quietly out of the door,
as though it had heard nothing.

I had long been of the opinion that dogs are
much cleverer than men. I also believed that
they could talk, and that only a certain obstinacy
kept them from doing so. They are especially
watchful animals, and nothing escapes their
observation. Now, cost what it may, I will go
 
to-morrow to Sverkoff''s house in order to ask
after Fidel, and if I have luck, to get hold of all
the letters which Meggy has written to her.

November 12th.—To-day about two o''clock
in the afternoon I started in order, by some
means or other, to see Fidel and question her.

I cannot stand this smell of Sauerkraut which
assails one''s olfactory nerves from all the shops
in Citizen Street. There also exhales such an
odour from under each house door, that one
must hold one''s nose and pass by quickly.
There ascends also so much smoke and soot from
the artisans'' shops that it is almost impossible to
get through it.

When I had climbed up to the sixth story,
and had rung the bell, a rather pretty girl with a
freckled face came out. I recognised her as the
companion of the old lady. She blushed a little
and asked “What do you want?”

She was a simple-minded girl, as I saw at once.
The dog came running and barking loudly. I
wanted to take hold of it, but the abominable
beast nearly caught hold of my nose with its
teeth. But in a corner of the room I saw its
sleeping-basket. Ah! that was what I wanted.
I went to it, rummaged in the straw, and to my
great satisfaction drew out a little packet of small
 
pieces of paper. When the hideous little dog
saw this, it first bit me in the calf of the leg, and
then, as soon as it had become aware of my theft,
it began to whimper and to fawn on me; but I
said, “No, you little beast; good-bye!” and
hastened away.

When I reached my room I wished to get to
work at once, and read through the letters by
daylight, since I do not see well by candle-light;
but the wretched Mawra had got the idea of
sweeping the floor. These blockheads of Finnish
women are always clean where there is no
need to be.

I then went for a little walk and began to think
over what had happened. Now at last I could
get to the bottom of all facts, ideas and motives!
These letters would explain everything. Dogs
are clever fellows; they know all about politics,
and I will certainly find in the letters all I want,
especially the character of the director and all
his relationships. And through these letters I
will get information about her who—but silence!

November 13th.—Now let us see! The letter
is fairly legible but the handwriting is somewhat
doggish.

“Dear Fidel!—I cannot get accustomed to
your ordinary name, as if they could not have
found a better one for you! Fidel! How tasteless!
How ordinary! But this is not the time
to discuss it. I am very glad that we thought of
corresponding with each other.”

(The letter is quite correctly written. The
punctuation and spelling are perfectly right.
Even our head clerk does not write so simply
and clearly, though he declares he has been at
the University. Let us go on.)

“I think that it is one of the most refined joys
of this world to interchange thoughts, feelings,
and impressions.”

(H''m! This idea comes from some book
which has been translated from German. I
can''t remember the title.)

“I speak from experience, although I have
not gone farther into the world than just before
our front door. Does not my life pass happily
and comfortably? My mistress, whom her
father calls Sophie, is quite in love with me.”

“Her father also often strokes me. I drink
tea and coffee with cream. Yes, my dear, I must
confess to you that I find no satisfaction in those
large, gnawed-at bones which Polkan devours in
the kitchen. Only the bones of wild fowl are
good, and that only when the marrow has not
been sucked out of them. They taste very nice
 
with a little sauce, but there should be no green
stuff in it. But I know nothing worse than the
habit of giving dogs balls of bread kneaded up.
Someone sits at table, kneads a bread-ball with
dirty fingers, calls you and sticks it in your mouth.
Good manners forbid your refusing it, and you
eat it—with disgust it is true, but you eat it.”

(The deuce! What is this? What rubbish!
As if she could find nothing more suitable to
write about! I will see if there is anything more
reasonable on the second page.)

“I am quite willing to inform you of everything
that goes on here. I have already mentioned
the most important person in the house,
whom Sophie calls ‘Papa.’ He is a very strange
man.”

(Ah! Here we are at last! Yes, I knew it;
they have a politician''s penetrating eye for all
things. Let us see what she says about “Papa.”)

“… a strange man. Generally he is silent;
he only speaks seldom, but about a week ago he
kept on repeating to himself, ‘Shall I get it or
not?’ In one hand he took a sheet of paper;
the other he stretched out as though to receive
something, and repeated, ‘Shall I get it or not?’
Once he turned to me with the question, ‘What
do you think, Meggy?’ I did not understand in
the least what he meant, sniffed at his boots, and
went away. A week later he came home with
his face beaming. That morning he was visited
 
by several officers in uniform who congratulated
him. At the dinner-table he was in a better
humour than I have ever seen him before.”

“… was in an unusually excited state.
She went to a ball, and I was glad that I could
write to you in her absence. She likes going to
balls, although she gets dreadfully irritated while
dressing. I cannot understand, my dear, what
is the pleasure in going to a ball. She comes
home from the ball at six o''clock in the early
morning, and to judge by her pale and emaciated
face, she has had nothing to eat. I could,
frankly speaking, not endure such an existence.
If I could not get partridge with sauce, or the
wing of a roast chicken, I don''t know what I
should do. Porridge with sauce is also tolerable,
but I can get up no enthusiasm for carrots,
turnips, and artichokes.”

The style is very unequal! One sees at once
that it has not been written by a man. The
 
beginning is quite intelligent, but at the end the
canine nature breaks out. I will read another
letter; it is rather long and there is no date.

“Ah, my dear, how delightful is the arrival of
spring! My heart beats as though it expected
something. There is a perpetual ringing in my
ears, so that I often stand with my foot raised,
for several minutes at a time, and listen towards
the door. In confidence I will tell you that I
have many admirers. I often sit on the window-sill
and let them pass in review. Ah! if you
knew what miscreations there are among them;
one, a clumsy house-dog, with stupidity written
on his face, walks the street with an important
air and imagines that he is an extremely important
person, and that the eyes of all the world
are fastened on him. I don''t pay him the least
attention, and pretend not to see him at all.

“And what a hideous bulldog has taken up
his post opposite my window! If he stood on
his hind-legs, as the monster probably cannot,
he would be taller by a head than my mistress''s
papa, who himself has a stately figure. This lout
seems, moreover, to be very impudent. I growl
at him, but he does not seem to mind that at all.
If he at least would only wrinkle his forehead!
Instead of that, he stretches out his tongue,
droops his big ears, and stares in at the window—this
rustic boor! But do you think, my dear,
 
that my heart remains proof against all temptations?
Alas no! If you had only seen that
gentlemanly dog who crept through the fence
of the neighbouring house. ‘Treasure’ is his
name. Ah, my dear, what a delightful snout he
has!”

(To the deuce with the stuff! What rubbish
it is! How can one blacken paper with such
absurdities. Give me a man. I want to see a
man! I need some food to nourish and refresh
my mind, and get this silliness instead. I will
turn the page to see if there is anything better
on the other side.)

“Sophie sat at the table and sewed something.
I looked out of the window and amused myself
by watching the passers-by. Suddenly a flunkey
entered and announced a visitor—‘Mr Teploff.’

“‘Show him in!’ said Sophie, and began to
embrace me. ‘Ah! Meggy, Meggy, do you
know who that is? He is dark, and belongs to
the Royal Household; and what eyes he has!
Dark and brilliant as fire.’

“Sophie hastened into her room. A minute
later a young gentleman with black whiskers
entered. He went to the mirror, smoothed his
hair, and looked round the room. I turned away
and sat down in my place.

“I pretended to observe nothing, and continued
 
to look out of the window. But I leant
my head a little on one side to hear what they
were talking about. Ah, my dear! what silly
things they discussed—how a lady executed the
wrong figure in dancing; how a certain Boboff,
with his expansive shirt-frill, had looked like a
stork and nearly fallen down; how a certain
Lidina imagined she had blue eyes when they
were really green, etc.

“I do not know, my dear, what special charm
she finds in her Mr Teploff, and why she is so
delighted with him.”

(It seems to me myself that there is something
wrong here. It is impossible that this Teploff
should bewitch her. We will see further.)

“If this gentleman of the Household pleases
her, then she must also be pleased, according to
my view, with that official who sits in her papa''s
writing-room. Ah, my dear, if you know what
a figure he is! A regular tortoise!”

“He has an extraordinary name. He always
sits there and mends the pens. His hair looks
like a truss of hay. Her papa always employs
him instead of a servant.”

(I believe this abominable little beast is referring
to me. But what has my hair got to do with
hay?)

You lie, cursed dog! What a scandalous
tongue! As if I did not know that it is envy
which prompts you, and that here there is
treachery at work—yes, the treachery of the
chief clerk. This man hates me implacably; he
has plotted against me, he is always seeking to
injure me. I''ll look through one more letter;
perhaps it will make the matter clearer.

“Fidel, my dear, pardon me that I have not
written for so long. I was floating in a dream
of delight. In truth, some author remarks,
‘Love is a second life.’ Besides, great changes
are going on in the house. The young chamberlain
is always here. Sophie is wildly in love with
him. Her papa is quite contented. I heard
from Gregor, who sweeps the floor, and is in
the habit of talking to himself, that the marriage
will soon be celebrated. Her papa will at any
rate get his daughter married to a general, a
colonel, or a chamberlain.”

Deuce take it! I can read no more. It is
all about chamberlains and generals. I should
like myself to be a general—not in order to sue
for her hand and all that—no, not at all; I
should like to be a general merely in order to
see people wriggling, squirming, and hatching
plots before me.

And then I should like to tell them that they
are both of them not worth spitting on. But it is
 
vexatious! I tear the foolish dog''s letters up in
a thousand pieces.

December 3rd.—It is not possible that the
marriage should take place; it is only idle gossip.
What does it signify if he is a chamberlain!
That is only a dignity, not a substantial thing
which one can see or handle. His chamberlain''s
office will not procure him a third eye in his
forehead. Neither is his nose made of gold; it
is just like mine or anyone else''s nose. He does
not eat and cough, but smells and sneezes with
it. I should like to get to the bottom of the
mystery—whence do all these distinctions come?
Why am I only a titular councillor?

Perhaps I am really a count or a general, and
only appear to be a titular councillor. Perhaps
I don''t even know who and what I am. How
many cases there are in history of a simple
gentleman, or even a burgher or peasant, suddenly
turning out to be a great lord or
baron? Well, suppose that I appear suddenly
in a general''s uniform, on the right shoulder an
epaulette, on the left an epaulette, and a blue
sash across my breast, what sort of a tune would
my beloved sing then? What would her papa,
our director, say? Oh, he is ambitious! He is
a freemason, certainly a freemason; however
much he may conceal it, I have found it out.
When he gives anyone his hand, he only reaches
 
out two fingers. Well, could not I this minute
be nominated a general or a superintendent? I
should like to know why I am a titular councillor—why
just that, and nothing more?

December 5th.—To-day I have been reading
papers the whole morning. Very strange things
are happening in Spain. I have not understood
them all. It is said that the throne is vacant,
the representatives of the people are in difficulties
about finding an occupant, and riots are
taking place.

All this appears to me very strange. How can
the throne be vacant? It is said that it will be
occupied by a woman. A woman cannot sit on
a throne. That is impossible. Only a king can
sit on a throne. They say that there is no king
there, but that is not possible. There cannot be
a kingdom without a king. There must be a
king, but he is hidden away somewhere. Perhaps
he is actually on the spot, and only some
domestic complications, or fears of the neighbouring
Powers, France and other countries,
compel him to remain in concealment; there
might also be other reasons.

December 8th.—I was nearly going to the
office, but various considerations kept me from
doing so. I keep on thinking about these
Spanish affairs. How is it possible that a woman
should reign? It would not be allowed, especially
 
by England. In the rest of Europe the
political situation is also critical; the Emperor of
Austria——

These events, to tell the truth, have so shaken
and shattered me, that I could really do nothing
all day. Mawra told me that I was very absent-minded
at table. In fact, in my absent-mindedness
I threw two plates on the ground so that
they broke in pieces.

After dinner I felt weak, and did not feel up
to making abstracts of reports. I lay most of
the time on my bed, and thought of the Spanish
affairs.

The year 2000: April 43rd.—To-day is a day
of splendid triumph. Spain has a king; he has
been found, and I am he. I discovered it to-day;
all of a sudden it came upon me like a flash
of lightning.

I do not understand how I could imagine that
I am a titular councillor. How could such a
foolish idea enter my head? It was fortunate
that it occurred to no one to shut me up in an
asylum. Now it is all clear, and as plain as
a pikestaff. Formerly—I don''t know why—everything
seemed veiled in a kind of mist.
That is, I believe, because people think that the
human brain is in the head. Nothing of the
sort; it is carried by the wind from the Caspian
Sea.

For the first time I told Mawra who I am.
When she learned that the king of Spain stood
before her, she struck her hands together
over her head, and nearly died of alarm. The
stupid thing had never seen the king of Spain
before!

I comforted her, however, at once by assuring
her that I was not angry with her for having
hitherto cleaned my boots badly. Women are
stupid things; one cannot interest them in
lofty subjects. She was frightened because she
thought all kings of Spain were like Philip II.
But I explained to her that there was a great
difference between me and him. I did not go
to the office. Why the deuce should I? No, my
dear friends, you won''t get me there again! I
am not going to worry myself with your infernal
documents any more.

Marchember 86. Between day and night.—To-day
the office-messenger came and summoned
me, as I had not been there for three weeks. I
went just for the fun of the thing. The chief
clerk thought I would bow humbly before him,
and make excuses; but I looked at him quite
indifferently, neither angrily nor mildly, and sat
down quietly at my place as though I noticed no
one. I looked at all this rabble of scribblers,
and thought, “If you only knew who is sitting
among you! Good heavens! what a to-do you
 
would make. Even the chief clerk would bow
himself to the earth before me as he does now
before the director.”

A pile of reports was laid before me, of which
to make abstracts, but I did not touch them with
one finger.

After a little time there was a commotion in
the office, and there a report went round that the
director was coming. Many of the clerks vied
with each other to attract his notice; but I did not
stir. As he came through our room, each one
hastily buttoned up his coat; but I had no idea
of doing anything of the sort. What is the
director to me? Should I stand up before him?
Never. What sort of a director is he? He is a
bottle-stopper, and no director. A quite ordinary,
simple bottle-stopper—nothing more. I
felt quite amused as they gave me a document
to sign.

They thought I would simply put down my
name—“So-and-so, Clerk.” Why not? But
at the top of the sheet, where the director generally
writes his name, I inscribed “Ferdinand VIII.”
in bold characters. You should have
seen what a reverential silence ensued. But
I made a gesture with my hand, and said,
“Gentlemen, no ceremony please!” Then I
went out, and took my way straight to the
director''s house.

He was not at home. The flunkey wanted not
 
to let me in, but I talked to him in such a way
that he soon dropped his arms.

I went straight to Sophie''s dressing-room.
She sat before the mirror. When she saw me,
she sprang up and took a step backwards; but I
did not tell her that I was the king of Spain.

But I told her that a happiness awaited her,
beyond her power to imagine; and that in spite
of all our enemies'' devices we should be united.
That was all which I wished to say to her, and I
went out. Oh, what cunning creatures these
women are! Now I have found out what woman
really is. Hitherto no one knew whom a woman
really loves; I am the first to discover it—she
loves the devil. Yes, joking apart, learned men
write nonsense when they pronounce that she is
this and that; she loves the devil—that is all.
You see a woman looking through her lorgnette
from a box in the front row. One thinks she is
watching that stout gentleman who wears an
order. Not a bit of it! She is watching the
devil who stands behind his back. He has
hidden himself there, and beckons to her with
his finger. And she marries him—actually—she
marries him!

That is all ambition, and the reason is that
there is under the tongue a little blister in which
there is a little worm of the size of a pin''s head.
And this is constructed by a barber in Bean
Street; I don''t remember his name at the
 
moment, but so much is certain that, in conjunction
with a midwife, he wants to spread
Mohammedanism all over the world, and that in
consequence of this a large number of people in
France have already adopted the faith of Islam.

No date. The day had no date.—I went for
a walk incognito on the Nevski Prospect. I
avoided every appearance of being the king of
Spain. I felt it below my dignity to let myself
be recognised by the whole world, since I must
first present myself at court. And I was also
restrained by the fact that I have at present no
Spanish national costume. If I could only get
a cloak! I tried to have a consultation with a
tailor, but these people are real asses! Moreover,
they neglect their business, dabble in
speculation, and have become loafers. I will
have a cloak made out of my new official uniform
which I have only worn twice. But to prevent
this botcher of a tailor spoiling it, I will make it
myself with closed doors, so that no one sees
me. Since the cut must be altogether altered,
I have used the scissors myself.

I don''t remember the date. The devil knows
what month it was. The cloak is quite ready.
Mawra exclaimed aloud when I put it on. I
will, however, not present myself at court yet;
the Spanish deputation has not yet arrived. It
would not be befitting if I appeared without
 
them. My appearance would be less imposing.
From hour to hour I expect them.

The 1st.—The extraordinary long delay of the
deputies in coming astonishes me. What can
possibly keep them? Perhaps France has a hand
in the matter; it is certainly hostilely inclined.
I went to the post office to inquire whether the
Spanish deputation had come. The postmaster
is an extraordinary blockhead who knows
nothing. “No,” he said to me, “there is no
Spanish deputation here; but if you want to send
them a letter, we will forward it at the fixed
rate.” The deuce! What do I want with a
letter? Letters are nonsense. Letters are
written by apothecaries….

Madrid, February 30th.—So I am in Spain
after all! It has happened so quickly that I
could hardly take it in. The Spanish deputies
came early this morning, and I got with them
into the carriage. This unexpected promptness
seemed to me strange. We drove so quickly
that in half an hour we were at the Spanish
frontier. Over all Europe now there are cast-iron
roads, and the steamers go very fast. A
wonderful country, this Spain!

As we entered the first room, I saw numerous
persons with shorn heads. I guessed at once
that they must be either grandees or soldiers, at
least to judge by their shorn heads.

The Chancellor of the State, who led me by
the hand, seemed to me to behave in a very
strange way; he pushed me into a little room
and said, “Stay here, and if you call yourself
‘King Ferdinand’ again, I will drive the wish
to do so out of you.”

I knew, however, that that was only a test,
and I reasserted my conviction; on which the
Chancellor gave me two such severe blows with
a stick on the back, that I could have cried out
with the pain. But I restrained myself, remembering
that this was a usual ceremony of old-time
chivalry when one was inducted into a high
position, and in Spain the laws of chivalry
prevail up to the present day. When I was
alone, I determined to study State affairs; I
discovered that Spain and China are one and the
same country, and it is only through ignorance
that people regard them as separate kingdoms.
I advise everyone urgently to write down the
word “Spain” on a sheet of paper; he will see
that it is quite the same as China.

But I feel much annoyed by an event which is
about to take place to-morrow; at seven o''clock
the earth is going to sit on the moon. This is
foretold by the famous English chemist, Wellington.
To tell the truth, I often felt uneasy
when I thought of the excessive brittleness and
fragility of the moon. The moon is generally
repaired in Hamburg, and very imperfectly. It
 
is done by a lame cooper, an obvious blockhead
who has no idea how to do it. He took waxed
thread and olive-oil—hence that pungent smell
over all the earth which compels people to hold
their noses. And this makes the moon so fragile
that no men can live on it, but only noses.
Therefore we cannot see our noses, because they
are on the moon.

When I now pictured to myself how the earth,
that massive body, would crush our noses to
dust, if it sat on the moon, I became so uneasy,
that I immediately put on my shoes and stockings
and hastened into the council-hall to give
the police orders to prevent the earth sitting on
the moon.

The grandees with the shorn heads, whom
I met in great numbers in the hall, were
very intelligent people, and when I exclaimed,
“Gentlemen! let us save the moon, for the earth
is going to sit on it,” they all set to work to fulfil
my imperial wish, and many of them clambered
up the wall in order to take the moon down.
At that moment the Imperial Chancellor came in.
As soon as he appeared, they all scattered, but I
alone, as king, remained. To my astonishment,
however, the Chancellor beat me with the stick
and drove me to my room. So powerful are
ancient customs in Spain!

January in the same year, following after
 
February.—I can never understand what kind
of a country this Spain really is. The popular
customs and rules of court etiquette are quite
extraordinary. I do not understand them at all,
at all. To-day my head was shorn, although I
exclaimed as loudly as I could, that I did
not want to be a monk. What happened afterwards,
when they began to let cold water trickle
on my head, I do not know. I have never
experienced such hellish torments. I nearly
went mad, and they had difficulty in holding me.
The significance of this strange custom is entirely
hidden from me. It is a very foolish and unreasonable
one.

Nor can I understand the stupidity of the kings
who have not done away with it before now.
Judging by all the circumstances, it seems to me
as though I had fallen into the hands of the
Inquisition, and as though the man whom I took
to be the Chancellor was the Grand Inquisitor.
But yet I cannot understand how the king could
fall into the hands of the Inquisition. The affair
may have been arranged by France—especially
Polignac—he is a hound, that Polignac! He
has sworn to compass my death, and now he is
hunting me down. But I know, my friend, that
you are only a tool of the English. They are
clever fellows, and have a finger in every pie.
All the world knows that France sneezes when
England takes a pinch of snuff.

The 25th.—To-day the Grand Inquisitor came
into my room; when I heard his steps in the
distance, I hid myself under a chair. When
he did not see me, he began to call. At first he
called “Poprishchin!” I made no answer.
Then he called “Axanti Ivanovitch! Titular
Councillor! Nobleman!” I still kept silence.
“Ferdinand the Eighth, King of Spain!” I
was on the point of putting out my head, but I
thought, “No, brother, you shall not deceive
me! You shall not pour water on my head
again!”

But he had already seen me and drove me from
under the chair with his stick. The cursed stick
really hurts one. But the following discovery
compensated me for all the pain, i.e. that every
cock has his Spain under his feathers. The
Grand Inquisitor went angrily away, and threatened
me with some punishment or other. I felt
only contempt for his powerless spite, for I know
that he only works like a machine, like a tool of
the English.

34 March. February, 349.—No, I have no
longer power to endure. O God! what are they
going to do with me? They pour cold water on
my head. They take no notice of me, and seem
neither to see nor hear. Why do they torture
me? What do they want from one so wretched
as myself? What can I give them? I possess
 
nothing. I cannot bear all their tortures; my
head aches as though everything were turning
round in a circle. Save me! Carry me away!
Give me three steeds swift as the wind! Mount
your seat, coachman, ring bells, gallop horses,
and carry me straight out of this world. Farther,
ever farther, till nothing more is to be seen!

Ah! the heaven bends over me already; a star
glimmers in the distance; the forest with its dark
trees in the moonlight rushes past; a bluish mist
floats under my feet; music sounds in the cloud;
on the one side is the sea, on the other, Italy;
beyond I also see Russian peasants'' houses. Is
not my parents'' house there in the distance?
Does not my mother sit by the window? O
mother, mother, save your unhappy son! Let a
tear fall on his aching head! See how they
torture him! Press the poor orphan to your
bosom! He has no rest in this world; they hunt
him from place to place.

Mother, mother, have pity on your sick child!
And do you know that the Bey of Algiers has a
wart under his nose?

Songs were echoing in the village street. It
was just the time when the young men and girls,
tired with the work and cares of the day, were
in the habit of assembling for the dance. In the
mild evening light, cheerful songs blended with
mild melodies. A mysterious twilight obscured
the blue sky and made everything seem indistinct
and distant. It was growing dark, but the
songs were not hushed.

A young Cossack, Levko by name, the son of
the village headman, had stolen away from the
singers, guitar in hand. With his embroidered
cap set awry on his head, and his hand playing
over the strings, he stepped a measure to the
music. Then he stopped at the door of a house
half hidden by blossoming cherry-trees. Whose
house was it? To whom did the door lead?
After a little while he played and sang:

“No one is there; my bright-eyed beauty is
fast asleep,” said the Cossack to himself as he
finished the song and approached the window.
“Hanna, Hanna, are you asleep, or won''t you
come to me? Perhaps you are afraid someone
will see us, or will not expose your delicate face
to the cold! Fear nothing! The evening is
warm, and there is no one near. And if anyone
comes I will wrap you in my caftan, fold you in
my arms, and no one will see us. And if the wind
blows cold, I will press you close to my heart,
warm you with my kisses, and lay my cap on your
tiny feet, my darling. Only throw me a single
glance. No, you are not asleep, you proud
thing!” he exclaimed now louder, in a voice
which betrayed his annoyance at the humiliation.
“You are laughing at me! Good-bye!”

Then he turned away, set his cap jauntily, and,
still lightly touching his guitar, stepped back
from the window. Just then the wooden handle
of the door turned with a grating noise, and a girl
who counted hardly seventeen springs looked
out timidly through the darkness, and still keeping
hold of the handle, stepped over the threshold.
In the twilight her bright eyes shone like
little stars, her coral necklace gleamed, and the
pink flush on her cheeks did not escape the
Cossack''s observation.

“How impatient you are!” she said in a
whisper. “You get angry so quickly! Why
 
did you choose such a time? There are crowds
of people in the street…. I tremble all over.”

“Don''t tremble, my darling! Come close
to me!” said the Cossack, putting down his
guitar, which hung on a long strap round his
neck, and sitting down with her on the door-step.
“You know I find it hard to be only an
hour without seeing you.”

“Do you know what I am thinking of?”
interrupted the young girl, looking at him
thoughtfully. “Something whispers to me that
we shall not see so much of each other in the
future. The people here are not well disposed
to you, the girls look so envious, and the young
fellows…. I notice also that my mother
watches me carefully for some time past. I
must confess I was happier when among
strangers.” Her face wore a troubled expression
as she spoke.

“You are only two months back at home,
and are already tired of it!” said the Cossack.
“And of me too perhaps?”

“Oh no!” she replied, smiling. “I love
you, you black-eyed Cossack! I love you because
of your dark eyes, and my heart laughs
in my breast when you look at me. I feel so
happy when you come down the street stroking
your black moustache, and enjoy listening to
your song when you play the guitar!”

“About what?” he answered absent-mindedly.
“About my marrying you? Yes,
I did.” But he seemed to speak almost
reluctantly.

“What can you make of him? The old
curmudgeon pretends to be deaf; he will not
listen to anything, and blames me for loafing with
fellows, as he says, about the streets. But don''t
worry, Hanna! I give you my word as a
Cossack, I will break his obstinacy.”

“You only need to say a word, Levko, and it
shall be as you wish. I know that of myself.
Often I do not wish to obey you, but you speak
only a word, and I involuntarily do what you
wish. Look, look!” she continued, laying her
head on his shoulder and raising her eyes to the
sky, the immeasurable heaven of the Ukraine;
“there far away are twinkling little stars—one,
two, three, four, five. Is it not true that those
are angels opening the windows of their bright
little homes and looking down on us. Is it not
so, Levko? They are looking down on earth. If
men had wings like birds, how high they could
fly. But ah! not even our oaks reach the sky.
Still people say there is in some distant land a
 
tree whose top reaches to heaven, and that God
descends by it on the earth, the night before
Easter.”

“No, Hanna. God has a long ladder which
reaches from heaven to earth. Before Easter
Sunday holy angels set it up, and as soon as God
puts His foot on the first rung, all evil spirits
take to flight and fall in swarms into hell. That
is why on Easter Day there are none of them on
earth.”

“How gently the water ripples! Like a child
in the cradle,” continued Hanna, pointing to the
pool begirt by dark maples and weeping-willows,
whose melancholy branches drooped in the
water. On a hill near the wood slumbered an
old house with closed shutters. The roof was
covered with moss and weeds; leafy apple-trees
had grown high up before the windows; the wood
cast deep shadows on it; a grove of nut-trees
spread from the foot of the hill as far as the pool.

“I remember as if in a dream,” said Hanna,
keeping her eyes fixed on the house, “a long,
long time ago, when I was little and lived with
mother, someone told a terrible story about this
house. You must know it—tell me.”

“God forbid, my dear child! Old women
and stupid people talk a lot of nonsense. It
would only frighten you and spoil your sleep.”

“Tell me, my darling, my black-eyed
Cossack,” she said, pressing her cheek to his.
 
“No, you don''t love me; you have certainly
another sweetheart! I will not be frightened,
and will sleep quite quietly. If you refuse to tell
me, that would keep me awake. I would keep
on worrying and thinking about it. Tell me,
Levko!”

“Certainly it is true what people say, that the
devil possesses girls, and stirs up their curiosity.
Well then, listen. Long ago there lived in
that house an elderly man who had a beautiful
daughter white as snow, just like you. His wife
had been dead a long time, and he was thinking
of marrying again.

“‘Yes, my daughter,’ he answered, ‘I shall
love you more than ever, and give you yet more
rings and necklaces.’

“So he brought a young wife home, who was
beautiful and white and red, but she cast such
an evil glance at her stepdaughter that she cried
aloud, but not a word did her sulky stepmother
speak to her all day long.

“When night came, and her father and his
wife had retired, the young girl locked herself up
in her room, and feeling melancholy began to
weep bitterly. Suddenly she spied a hideous
black cat creeping towards her; its fur was aflame
and its claws struck on the ground like iron. In
her terror the girl sprang on a chair; the cat
 
followed her. Then she sprang into bed; the
cat sprang after her, and seizing her by
the throat began to choke her. She tore the
creature away, and flung it on the ground, but
the terrible cat began to creep towards her again.
Rendered desperate with terror, she seized her
father''s sabre which hung on the wall, and struck
at the cat, wounding one of its paws. The
animal disappeared, whimpering.

“The next day the young wife did not leave
her bedroom; the third day she appeared with
her hand bound up.

“On the fourth day her father told her to
bring water, to sweep the floor like a servant-maid,
and not to show herself where he and his
wife sat. She obeyed him, though with a heavy
heart. On the fifth day he drove her barefooted
out of the house, without giving her any food
for her journey. Then she began to sob and
covered her face with her hands.

“‘You have ruined your own daughter,
father!’ she cried; ‘and the witch has ruined
your soul. May God forgive you! He will not
allow me to live much longer.’

“And do you see,” continued Levko, turning
to Hanna and pointing to the house, “do you
see that high bank; from that bank she threw
 
herself into the water, and has been no more
seen on earth.”

“The witch? Old women say that when the
moon shines, all those who have been drowned
come out to warm themselves in its rays, and
that they are led by the witch''s stepdaughter.
One night she saw her stepmother by the pool,
caught hold of her, and dragged her screaming
into the water. But this time also the witch
played her a trick; she changed herself into one
of those who had been drowned, and so escaped
the chastisement she would have received at
their hands.

“Let anyone who likes believe the old
women''s stories. They say that the witch''s
stepdaughter gathers together those who have
been drowned every night, and looks in their
faces in order to find out which of them is the
witch; but has not done so yet. Such are the
old wives'' tales. It is said to be the intention
of the present owner to erect a distillery on the
spot. But I hear voices. They are coming
home from the dancing. Good-bye, Hanna!
Sleep well, and don''t think of all that nonsense.”
So saying he embraced her, kissed her, and
departed.

The brilliant moon was now rising and filling
all the earth with splendour. The pool shone
like silver, and the shadows of the trees stood
out in strong relief.

“Why, there is a whole band of them!” cried
Hanna, tearing herself from the youths who had
gathered round. “Are they never tired of the
eternal kissing? I shall soon not be able to show
myself on the street!” So saying, she closed
the door and bolted it.

Do you know a Ukraine night? No, you do not
know a night in the Ukraine. Gaze your full
on it. The moon shines in the midst of the sky;
the immeasurable vault of heaven seems to have
 
expanded to infinity; the earth is bathed in silver
light; the air is warm, voluptuous, and redolent
of innumerable sweet scents. Divine night!
Magical night! Motionless, but inspired with
divine breath, the forests stand, casting enormous
shadows and wrapped in complete darkness.
Calmly and placidly sleep the lakes surrounded
by dark green thickets. The virginal groves of
the hawthorns and cherry-trees stretch their
roots timidly into the cool water; only now and
then their leaves rustle unwillingly when that
freebooter, the night-wind, steals up to kiss them.
The whole landscape is hushed in slumber;
but there is a mysterious breath upon the
heights. One falls into a weird and unearthly
mood, and silvery apparitions rise from the
depths. Divine night! Magical night! Suddenly
the woods, lakes, and steppes become
alive. The nightingales of the Ukraine are singing,
and it seems as though the moon itself were
listening to their song. The village sleeps as
though under a magic spell; the cottages shine
in the moonlight against the darkness of the
woods behind them. The songs grow silent,
and all is still. Only here and there is a glimmer
of light in some small window. Some families,
sitting up late, are finishing their supper at the
thresholds of their houses.

“No, the ‘gallop’ is not danced like that!
Now I see, it does not go properly! What did
 
my godfather tell me? So then! Hop! tralala!
Hop! tralala! Hop! Hop! Hop!” Thus
a half-intoxicated, middle-aged Cossack talked
to himself as he danced through the street.
“By heaven, a ‘gallop’ is not danced like that!
What is the use of lying! On with it then!
Hop! tralala! Hop! tralala! Hop! Hop!
Hop!”

“See that fool there! If he were only a
young fellow! But to see a grown man dancing,
and the children laughing at him,” exclaimed an
old woman who was passing by, carrying a
bundle of straw. “Go home! It is quite time
to go to sleep!”

“I am going!” said the Cossack, standing
still. “I am going. What do I care about the
headman? He thinks because he is the eldest,
and throws cold water on people, and carries his
head high. As to being headman—I myself am
a headman. Yes indeed—otherwise——” As
he spoke, he stepped up to the door of the first
cottage he came to, stood at the window, drumming
with his fingers on the glass, and feeling
for the door-handle. “Woman, open! Woman,
open quickly I tell you! It is time for me to go
to sleep!”

“Where are you going, Kalenik? That is
the wrong house!” some young girls who were
returning from the dance called to him as they
passed. “Shall we show you yours?”

“Ladies! Just listen to him!” one of them
exclaimed. “How polite Kalenik is! We will
show you the house—but no, first dance before
us!”

“Dance before you? Oh, you are clever
girls!” said Kalenik in a drawling voice, and
laughing. He threatened them with his finger,
and stumbled, not being able to stand steadily.
“And will you let yourselves be kissed? I will
kiss the lot.” With tottering steps he began to
run after them.

The girls cried out and ran apart; but they
soon plucked up courage and went on the other
side of the road, when they saw that Kalenik
was not firm on his legs.

“There is your house!” they called to him,
pointing to one which was larger than the rest,
and which belonged to the village headman.

But who is this headman to whose disadvantage
so much has been said? Oh, he is a very
important person in the village. Before Kalenik
reaches his house, we shall doubtless find enough
time to say something about him. Everyone in
the village takes off his cap at the sight of him,
and even the smallest girls wish him good
morning. Which of the young Cossacks would
not like to be a headman? The headman has
 
an entry everywhere, and every stalwart rustic
stands respectfully, cap in hand, so long as the
headman feels round his snuff-box with his thick,
coarse finger. In parish-meetings and other
assemblies, although his power may be limited
by the votes of the majority, the headman still
maintains the upper hand, and sends whom
he chooses to make roads or dig ditches. In
outward manners he is morose and severe, and
not fond of talking. Long ago, when the
Empress Catherine of blessed memory journeyed
to the Crimea, he was chosen as one of her
escort for two whole days, and had the high
honour of sitting with the imperial coachman on
the box.

Since then the headman has formed the habit
of shaking his head solemnly and thoughtfully,
of stroking his long, drooping moustache, and of
darting hawk-like glances from his eyes. Whatever
the topic of conversation may be, he
manages to refer to his having accompanied the
Empress, and sat on the box of the imperial
coach. He often pretends to be hard of hearing,
especially when he hears something that he does
not like. He has an aversion for dandies, and
himself wears under a black caftan of cloth, made
at home, a simple, embroidered, woollen waist-band.
No one has seen him wear any other
dress except, of course, on the occasion of the
Czarina''s journey to the Crimea, when he wore a
 
blue Cossack''s uniform. Hardly anyone in the
village remembers that time, and he keeps the
uniform packed up in a chest.

The headman is a widower, but his sister-in-law
lives with him. She cooks his dinner and
supper, keeps the house and furniture clean,
weaves linen, and acts as housekeeper generally.
The village gossips say that she is not a relation
of his; but we must remark that the headman has
many enemies who spread all kinds of slanders
about him. We have now said what we considered
to be necessary about the headman, and
the drunken Kalenik is not yet half-way to his
house. He continued to abuse the headman in
terms which might be expected from one in his
condition.

“No, you fellows, I won''t. What is the
good of all those silly goings-on? Aren''t you
tired of these foolish jokes? People already call
us good-for-nothing scapegraces. Better go to
bed!” So Levko said one evening to his companions,
who were trying to persuade him to
take part with them in further practical jokes.
“Farewell, brothers! Good night!” he said,
and left them with quick steps.

“Does my bright-eyed Hanna sleep?” he
 
thought as he passed the house shaded by the
cherry-trees. Then in the silence he heard
the sound of a whispered conversation. Levko
stood still. Between the trees there glimmered
something white. “What is that?” he thought,
as he crept closer and hid himself behind a tree.

By the light of the moon he saw the face of a
girl standing opposite him. It was Hanna. But
who was the tall man who had his back turned to
him? In vain he strained his eyes; the whole
figure was hidden in shadow, and the slightest
forward step on Levko''s part would expose him
to the risk of discovery. He therefore leant
quietly against the tree, and determined to
remain where he was. Then he heard the girl
utter his name distinctly.

“Levko? Levko is a baby,” said the tall man
in an undertone. “If I ever find him with you,
I will pull his hair.”

“I should like to know what rascal is boasting
of pulling my hair,” said Levko to himself,
stretching out his head and endeavouring to miss
no word. But the stranger continued to speak
so low that he was inaudible.

“What, aren''t you ashamed?” said Hanna
after he had finished. “You are lying and
deceiving me; I will never believe that you love
me.”

“I know,” continued the tall man, “that
Levko has talked nonsense to you and turned
 
your head.” (Here it seemed to the Cossack
as though the stranger''s voice were not quite
unknown to him, and that he must have heard it
somewhere or other.) “But Levko shall learn to
know me,” continued the stranger. “He thinks
I don''t notice his rascally tricks; but he will yet
feel the weight of my fists, the scoundrel!”

At these words Levko could no longer restrain
his wrath. He came three steps nearer, and
took a run in order to plant a blow which would
have stretched the stranger on the ground in
spite of his strength. At that moment, however,
a ray of light fell on the latter''s face, and Levko
stood transfixed, for he saw it was his father.
But he only expressed his surprise by an involuntary
shake of the head and a low whistle.

On the other side there was the sound of
approaching footsteps. Hanna ran hastily into
the house and closed the door behind her.

“Good-bye, Hanna!” cried one of the youths,
who had stolen up and embraced the headman,
but started back alarmed when he felt a rough
moustache.

“Good-bye, my darling!” cried another, but
speedily executed a somersault in consequence
of a violent blow from the headman.

“Go to the deuce, you infernal scoundrels!”
shouted the headman, defending himself with
 
both hands and feet. “What kind of Hanna do
you take me for? Hang yourselves like your
fathers did, you children of the devil! Falling
on one like flies on honey! I will show you who
Hanna is!”

“Aha, father!” said Levko to himself,
recovering from his astonishment and looking
after the headman as he departed, cursing and
scolding. “Those are the tricks you like to
play! Splendid! And I wonder and puzzle my
head why he pretends to be deaf when I only
touch on the matter! Wait, you old sinner, I
will teach you to cajole other people''s sweethearts.
Hi! you fellows, come here!” he cried,
beckoning to the youths, who gathered round
him. “Come nearer! I told you to go to bed,
but I am differently minded now, and am ready
to go round with you all night.”

“That is reasonable,” exclaimed a broad-shouldered,
stout fellow, who was regarded as
the chief toper and good-for-nothing in the
village. “I always feel uncomfortable if I do
not have a good fling, and play some practical
jokes. I always feel as though there were something
wanting, as though I had lost my cap or my
pipe—in a word, I don''t feel like a proper
Cossack then!”

“Yes, the headman. I don''t know for whom
he takes himself. He carries on as though he
were a duke. It is not only that he treats us as
if we were his serfs, but he comes after our
girls.”

“But are we made of any worse stuff than he?
We are, thank God! free Cossacks. Let us show
him so.”

“Yes, we will show him!” they shouted.
“But when we go for the headman, we must not
forget his clerk.”

“The clerk shall have his share, too. Just
now a song that suits the headman occurs to me.
Go on! I will teach it you!” continued Levko,
striking the strings of his guitar. “But listen!
Disguise yourselves as well as you can.”

“Hurrah for the Cossacks!” cried the stout
reveller, dancing and clapping his hands.
“Long live freedom! When one lets the reins
go, one thinks of the good old times. It
feels as jolly as though one were in paradise.
Hurrah, you fellows! Go ahead!”

The youths rushed noisily through the village
street, and the pious old women, aroused from
their sleep, looked through the windows, crossed
 
themselves drowsily, and thought, “There they
go, the wild young fellows!”

Only in one house at the end of the street there
still burned a light; it was the headman''s. He
had long finished his supper, and would certainly
have gone to sleep but that he had a guest
with him, the brandy-distiller. The latter had
been sent to superintend the building of a distillery
for the lords of the manor, who possessed
small allotments between the lands of the free
Cossacks. At the upper end of the table, in the
place of honour, sat the guest—a short, stout
man with small, merry eyes. He smoked his
short pipe with obvious satisfaction, spitting
every moment and constantly pushing the
tobacco down in the bowl. The clouds of smoke
collected over his head, and veiled him in a bluish
mist. It seemed as though the broad chimney
of a distillery, which was bored at always being
perched up on the roof, had hit upon the idea of
taking a little recreation, and had now settled
itself comfortably at the headman''s table. Close
under his nose bristled his short, thick moustache,
which in the dim, smoky atmosphere
resembled a mouse which the distiller had caught
 
and held in his mouth, usurping the functions of
a dining-room cat. The headman sat there, as
master of the house, wearing only his shirt and
linen breeches. His eagle eye began to grow
dim like the setting sun, and to half close. At
the lower end of the table sat, smoking his pipe,
one of the village council, of which the headman
was superintendent. Out of respect for the
latter he had not removed his caftan.

“How soon do you think,” asked the headman,
turning to the distiller and putting his hand
before his gaping mouth, “will you have the
distillery put up?”

“With God''s help we shall be distilling brandy
this autumn. On Conception Day I bet the
headman will be tracing the figure eight with his
feet on his way home.” So saying, the distiller
laughed so heartily that his small eyes
disappeared altogether, his body was convulsed,
and his twitching lips actually let go of the
reeking pipe for a moment.

“God grant it!” said the headman, on whose
face the shadow of a smile was visible. “Now,
thank heaven, the number of distilleries is increasing
a little; but in the old days, when I
accompanied the Czarina on the Perejlaslov
Road, and the late Besborodko——”

“Yes, my friend, those were bad times.
Then from Krementchuk to Romen there were
hardly two distilleries. And now—but have you
 
heard what the infernal Germans have invented?
They say they will no longer use wood for fuel in
the distilleries, but devilish steam.” At these
words the distiller stared at the table reflectively,
and at his arms resting on it. “But how they
can use steam—by heavens! I don''t know.”

“What fools these Germans are!” said the
headman. “I should like to give these sons
of dogs a good thrashing. Whoever heard of
cooking with steam? At this rate one will not
be able to get a spoonful of porridge or a bit of
bacon into one''s mouth.”

“And you, friend,” broke in the headman''s
sister-in-law, who was sitting by the stove; “will
you be with us the whole time without your
wife?”

“How should she be; as old as Satan, and with
a face as full of wrinkles as an empty purse,”
said the distiller, shaking again with laughter.

Then a noise was heard at the door, which
opened and a Cossack stepped over the threshold
without removing his cap, and remained standing
in an absent-minded way in the middle of the
room, with open mouth and gazing at the ceiling.
It was Kalenik, whose acquaintance we have
already made.

“Now I am at home,” he said, taking his
seat by the door, without taking any notice of
those present. “Ah! to what a length Satan
made the road stretch. I went on and on, and
there was no end. My legs are quite broken.
Woman, bring me my fur blanket to lie down on.
There it is in the corner; but mind you don''t
upset the little pot of snuff. But no; better not
touch it! Leave it alone! You are really quite
drunk—I had better get it myself.”

“That''s a nice business!” said the headman.
“He comes into a strange house, and behaves
as though he were at home! Push him out, in
heaven''s name!”

“Let him rest a bit, friend!” said the
distiller, seizing the headman''s arm. “The
man is very useful; if we had only plenty of this
kind, our distillery would get on grandly….”
For the rest, it was not good-nature which
inspired these words. The distiller was full of
superstition, and to turn out a man who had
already sat down, seemed to him to be tantamount
to invoking the devil.

“That comes of being old,” grumbled
Kalenik, stretching himself out along the seat.
“People might say I was drunk, but no, I am
not! Why should I lie? I am ready to tell the
headman to his face! Who is the headman
 
anyway? May he break his neck, the son of a
dog! I spit at him! May he be run over by a
cart, the one-eyed devil!”

“Ah! the drunken sot has crawled into the
house, and now he lays his paws on the table,”
said the headman, rising angrily; but at that
moment a heavy stone, breaking a window-pane
to pieces, fell at his feet. The headman remained
standing. “If I knew,” he said, “what
jail-bird has thrown it, I would give him something.
What devil''s trick is this?” he continued,
looking at the stone, which he held in his
hand, with burning eyes. “I wish I could
choke him with it!”

“Stop! Stop! God preserve you, friend!”
broke in the distiller, looking pale. “God keep
you in this world and the next, but don''t curse
anyone so.”

“Yes, my mother-in-law. One evening,
perhaps rather earlier than this, they were sitting
at supper, my late mother-in-law, my father-in-law,
their two servants, and five children. My
mother-in-law emptied some dumplings from the
cooking-pot into a dish in order to cool them.
But the others, being hungry after the day''s
 
work, did not wait till they were quite cooled, but
stuck their long wooden forks into them and ate
them at once. All at once a stranger entered—heaven
knows whence!—and asked to be allowed
to share their meal. They could not refuse to
feed a hungry man, and gave him also a wooden
fork. But the guest made as short work with
the dumplings as a cow with hay. Before the
family had each of them finished his or her
dumpling and reached out their forks again for
another, the dish had been swept as clean as
the floor of a nobleman''s drawing-room. My
mother-in-law emptied out some more dumplings;
she thought to herself, ‘Now the guest is
satisfied, and will not be so greedy.’ But on the
contrary, he began to swallow them faster than
ever, and emptied the second dish also. ‘May
one of them choke you!’ said my mother-in-law
under her breath. Suddenly the guest seemed
to try to clear his throat, and fell back. They
rushed to his help, but his breath had stopped
and he was dead.”

“But it turned out quite otherwise; since that
time my mother-in-law has no rest. No sooner
is it dark than the dead man approaches the
house. He then sits astride the chimney, the
scoundrel, holding a dumpling between his teeth.
During the day it is quite quiet—one hears and
sees nothing; but as soon as it begins to grow
 
dark, and one casts a look at the roof, there he
is comfortably perched on the chimney!”

Then the headman suddenly stopped. Outside
there were noises, and the stamping of
dancers'' feet. The strings of a guitar were
being struck gently, to the accompaniment of
a voice. Then the guitar was played more
loudly, many voices joined in, and the whole
chorus struck up a song in ridicule of the
headman.

When it was over, the distiller said, with his
head bent a little on one side, to the headman
who was almost petrified by the audacity of the
serenaders, “A fine song, my friend!”

He folded his arms with a certain measure of
composure on the table, and prepared to listen
further, for the singing and noise outside continued.
A sharp observer, however, would have
seen that it was not mere torpidity which made
the headman sit so quietly. In the same way a
crafty cat often allows an inexperienced mouse
to play about her tail, while she is quickly devising
a plan to cut it off from the mouse-hole.
The headman''s one eye was still fastened on
the window, and his hand, after he had given
the village councillor a sign, was reaching for
 
the door-handle, when suddenly a loud noise
and shouts were heard from the street. The
distiller, who beside many other characteristics
possessed a keen curiosity, laid down his pipe
quickly and ran into the street; but the ne''er-do-wells
had all dispersed.

“No, you don''t escape me!” cried the
headman, dragging someone muffled up in a
sheepskin coat with the hair turned outwards, by
the arm.

The distiller rapidly seized a favourable
moment to look at the face of this disturber of
the peace; but he started back when he saw a
long beard and a grim, painted face.

“No, you don''t escape me!” exclaimed the
headman again as he dragged his prisoner into
the vestibule.

“Karpo, open the store-room!” the headman
called to the village councillor. “We will
throw him in there! Then we will awake the
clerk, call the village council together, catch this
impudent rabble, and pass our sentence on them
at once.”

The village councillor unlocked the store-room;
then in the darkness of the vestibule, the
prisoner made a desperate effort to break loose
from the headman''s arms.

“It is no good, brother! You may squeal if
you choose, like the devil, instead of imitating
a woman, but you won''t get round me.” So
saying, he thrust the prisoner with such violence
into the dark room that he fell on the ground and
groaned aloud.

The victorious headman, accompanied by the
village councillor, now betook himself to the
clerk''s; they were followed by the distiller, who
was veiled in clouds of tobacco-smoke, and
resembled a steamer.

They were all three walking reflectively with
bent heads, when suddenly, turning into a dark
side-alley, they uttered a cry and started back in
consequence of coming into collision with three
other men, who on their side shouted with equal
loudness. The headman saw with his one eye,
to his no small astonishment, the clerk with two
village councillors.

“The young fellows are roaming about the
streets using vile language. They are abusing
your honour in a way—in a word, it is a scandal.
A drunken Russian would be ashamed to use
such words.”

The lean notary, in his gaily striped breeches
and yeast-coloured waistcoat, kept on stretching
forward and drawing back his neck while he
talked.

“Hardly had I gone to sleep,” he continued,
“than the cursed loafers woke me up with their
shameful songs and their noise. I meant to give
them a sound rating, but while I was putting on
my breeches and vest, they all ran away. But
the ringleader has not escaped; for the present
he is shut up in the hut which we use as a prison.
I was very curious to know who the scapegrace
is, but his face is as sooty as the devil''s when
he forges nails for sinners.”

“Aren''t you telling me a lie, Mr Notary?
The same good-for-nothing is now shut up in my
store-room under lock and key.”

“No, your honour! You have drawn the
long bow a little yourself, and should not be
vexed at what I say.”

They returned to the headman''s house; the
store-room door was opened, and the headman
groaned for sheer amazement as he saw his sister-in-law
standing before him.

“Tell me then,” she said, stepping forward,
“have you quite lost your senses? Had you a
single particle of brains in your one-eyed fish-head
when you locked me up in the dark room?
It is a mercy I did not break my head against the
iron door hinge. Didn''t I shout out that it was
I? Then he seized me, the cursed bear, with
his iron claws, and pushed me in. May Satan
hereafter so push you into hell!” The last
words she spoke from the street, having wisely
gone out of his reach.

“Isn''t it high time to give all these loose
fellows a lesson, that they may at last betake
themselves to their work?”

“The fools have combined in a gang. What
the deuce is that? It sounded like my sister-in-law''s
voice. The blockheads think that I am
like her, an ordinary Cossack.”

Here he coughed and cleared his throat, and
 
a gleam in his eyes showed that he was about to
say something very important. “In the year
one thousand—I cannot keep these cursed dates
in my memory, if I was to be killed for it.
Well, never mind when it was, the Commissary
Ledatcho was commanded to choose out a
Cossack who was cleverer than the rest. Yes,”
he added, raising his forefinger, “cleverer than
the rest, to accompany the Czar. Then I
was——”

“Yes, yes,” the notary interrupted him, “we
all know, headman, that you well deserved the
imperial favour. But confess now that I was
right: you made a mistake when you declared
that you had caught the vagabond in the reversed
sheepskin.”

“This disguised devil I will have imprisoned
to serve as a warning to the rest. They will have
to learn what authority means. Who has appointed
the headman, if not the Czar? Then we
will tackle the other fellows. I don''t forget how
the scamps drove a whole herd of swine into my
garden, which ate up all the cabbages and
cucumbers; I don''t forget how those sons of
devils refused to thrash my rye for me. I don''t
forget—to the deuce with them! We must first
find out who this scoundrel in the sheepskin
really is.”

“He is a sly dog anyway,” said the distiller,
whose cheeks during the whole conversation had
 
been as full of smoke as a siege-cannon, and
whose lips, when he took his pipe out of his
mouth, seemed to emit sparks.

Meanwhile they had approached a small ruined
hut. Their curiosity had mounted to the highest
pitch, and they pressed round the door. The
notary produced a key and tried to turn the lock,
but it did not fit; it was the key of his trunk.
The impatience of the onlookers increased. He
plunged his hand into the wide pocket of his gaily
striped breeches, bent his back, scraped with his
feet, uttered imprecations, and at last cried
triumphantly, “I have it!”

At these words the hearts of our heroes beat
so loud, that the turning of the key in the lock
was almost inaudible. At last the door opened,
and the headman turned as white as a sheet.
The distiller felt a shiver run down his spine, and
his hair stood on end. Terror and apprehension
were stamped on the notary''s face; the village
councillors almost sank into the ground and could
not shut their wide-open mouths. Before them
stood the headman''s sister-in-law!

She was not less startled than they, but
recovered herself somewhat, and made a movement
as if to approach them.

“Stop!” cried the headman in an excited
voice, and slammed the door again. “Sirs,
Satan is behind this!” he continued. “Bring
fire quickly! Never mind the hut! Set it
 
alight and burn it up so that not even the witch''s
bones remain.”

“Wait a minute, brother!” exclaimed the
distiller. “Your hair is grey, but you are not
very intelligent; no ordinary fire will burn a
witch. Only the fire of a pipe can do it. I will
manage it all right.” So saying, he shook some
glowing ashes from his pipe on to a bundle of
straw, and began to fan the flame.

“Stop a moment, brother! Perhaps we are
incurring guilt needlessly. Perhaps she is really
no witch!” said the notary. “If the person
sitting in there declares herself ready to make
the sign of the cross, then she is not a child of
the devil.”

The proposal was accepted. “Look out,
Satan!” continued the notary, speaking at a
chink in the door. “If you promise not to
move, we will open the door.”

“Cross yourself!” exclaimed the headman,
looking round him for a safe place of retreat in
case of necessity.

The headman''s sister related amid sobs how
the rioters had seized her on the street, and in
spite of her resistance, pushed her through a
large window into the hut, on which they had
closed the shutters. The notary looked and
found that the bolt of the shutter had been
wrenched off, and that it was held in its place by
a wooden bar placed across it outside.

“You are a nice fellow, you one-eyed
Satan!” she now exclaimed, advancing towards
the headman, who stepped backwards and continued
to contemplate her from head to foot.
“I know your thoughts; you were glad of an
opportunity to get me shut up in order to run
after that petticoat, so that no one could see the
grey-haired sinner making a fool of himself.
You think I don''t know how you talked this
evening with Hanna. Oh, I know everything.
You must get up earlier if you want to make a
fool of me, you great stupid! I have endured
for a long time, but at last don''t take it ill
if——”

She made a threatening gesture with her fist,
and ran away swiftly, leaving the headman quite
taken aback.

“Bring him here!” cried the headman,
seizing the prisoner by the arm. “Are you
mad? This is the drunken Kalenik!”

“It is witchcraft! He was in our hands,
your honour!” replied the village councillors.
“The rascals were rushing about in the narrow
side-streets, dancing and behaving like idiots—the
devil take them! How it was we got hold of
this fellow instead of him, heaven only knows!”

“In virtue of my authority, and that of the
village assembly,” said the headman, “I issue
the order to seize these robbers and other young
vagabonds which may be met with in the streets,
and to bring them before me to be dealt with.”

“Excuse us, your honour,” answered the
village councillors, bowing low. “If you could
only see the hideous faces they had; may heaven
punish us if ever anyone has seen such miscreations
since he was born and baptised. These
devils might frighten one into an illness.”

“I''ll teach you to be afraid! You won''t
obey then? You are certainly in the conspiracy
with them! You mutineers! What is the
meaning of that? What? You abet robbery
and murder! You!—I will inform the Commissary.
Go at once, do you hear; fly like birds.
I shall—you will——”

Without troubling himself in the least about
those who had been sent to pursue him, the
originator of all this confusion slowly walked
towards the old house and the pool. We hardly
need to say it was Levko. His black fur coat
was buttoned up; he carried his cap in his hand,
and the perspiration was pouring down his face.
The moon poured her light on the gloomy majesty
of the dark maple-wood.

The coolness of the air round the motionless
pool enticed the weary wanderer to rest by it a
while. Universal silence prevailed, only that in
the forest thickets the nightingales'' songs were
heard. An overpowering drowsiness closed his
eyes; his tired limbs relaxed, and his head
nodded.

He looked round; the night seemed to him still
more beautiful. The moonlight seemed to have
an intoxicating quality about it, a glamour which
he had never perceived before. The landscape
was veiled in a silver mist. The air was redolent
with the perfume of the apple-blossoms and
 
the night-flowers. Entranced, he gazed on the
motionless pool. The old, half-ruined house
was clearly reflected without a quiver in the
water. But instead of dark shutters, he saw
light streaming from brilliantly lit windows.
Presently one of them opened. Holding his
breath, and without moving a muscle, he fastened
his eyes on the pool and seemed to penetrate
its depths. What did he see? First he saw
at the window a graceful, curly head with shining
eyes, propped on a white arm; the head moved
and smiled. His heart suddenly began to beat.
The water began to break into ripples, and the
window closed.

Quietly he withdrew from the pool, and looked
towards the house. The dark shutters were
flung back; the window-panes gleamed in the
moonlight. “How little one can believe what
people say!” he thought to himself. “The
house is brand-new, and looks as though it
had only just been painted. It is certainly
inhabited.”

He stepped nearer cautiously, but the house
was quite silent. The clear song of the nightingales
rose powerfully and distinctly on the air,
and as they died away one heard the chirping
and rustling of the grasshoppers, and the
marshbird clapping his slippery beak in the
water.

Levko felt enraptured with the sweetness and
 
stillness of the night. He struck the strings of
his guitar and sang:

A window opened gently, and the same girl
whose image he had seen in the pool looked out
and listened attentively to the song. Her long-lashed
eyelids were partly drooping over her
eyes; she was as pale as the moonlight, but
wonderfully beautiful. She smiled, and a shiver
ran through Levko.

“Sing me a song, young Cossack!” she said
gently, bending her head sideways and quite
closing her eyes.

Tears rolled down her pale cheeks.
“Cossack,” she said, and there was something
inexpressibly touching in her tone, “Cossack,
find my stepmother for me. I will do everything
for you; I will reward you; I will give you
abundant riches. I have armlets embroidered
with silk and coral necklaces; I will give you a
girdle set with pearls. I have gold. Cossack,
seek my stepmother for me. She is a terrible
witch; she allowed me no peace in the beautiful
world. She tortured me; she made me work like
a common maid-servant. Look at my face; she
 
has banished the redness from my cheeks with
her unholy magic. Look at my white neck; they
cannot be washed away, they cannot be washed
away—the blue marks of her iron claws. Look
at my white feet; they did not walk on carpets,
but on hot sand, on damp ground, on piercing
thorns. And my eyes—look at them; they are
almost blind with weeping. Seek my stepmother!”

The Cossack felt overpowered by sympathy and
grief. “I am ready to do everything to please
you, dear lady,” he cried with deep emotion;
“but where and how can I find her?”

“Look, look!” she said quickly, “she is
here! She dances on the lake-shore with my
maidens, and warms herself in the moonlight.
Yet she is cunning and sly. She has assumed the
shape of one who is drowned, yet I know and
hear that she is present. I am so afraid of her.
Because of her I cannot swim free and light as a
fish. I sink and fall to the bottom like a piece
of iron. Look for her, Cossack!”

Levko cast a glance at the lake-shore. In a
silvery mist there moved, like shadows, girls in
white dresses decked with May flowers; gold
necklaces and coins gleamed on their necks; but
they were very pale, as though formed of transparent
clouds. They danced nearer him, and he
 
could hear their voices, somewhat like the sound
of reeds stirred in the quiet evening by the
breeze.

Levko observed her attentively. Her face and
clothing resembled those of the others; but she
was evidently unwilling to play the part assigned
her. The dancers revolved rapidly round her,
without her being able to catch one of
them.

“No, I won''t be the raven any more,” she
said, quite exhausted. “I do not like to rob the
poor mother-hen of her chickens.”

Levko watched her closely. Boldly and
rapidly she ran after the dancers, and made every
effort to catch her prey. Levko began to notice
that her body was not transparent like the
others; there was something black in the midst
of it. Suddenly there was a cry; the “raven”
had rushed on a girl, embraced her, and it
seemed to Levko as though she had stretched out
 
claws, and as though her face shone with
malicious joy.

“How shall I reward you, Cossack?” said
the maiden. “I know you do not need gold;
you love Hanna, but her harsh father will not
allow you to marry. But give him this note, and
he will cease to hinder it.”

She stretched out her white hand, and her face
shone wonderfully. With strange shudders and
a beating heart, he grasped the paper and—awoke.

“Have I then been really asleep?” Levko
asked himself as he stood up. “Everything
seemed so real, as though I were awake. Wonderful!
Wonderful!” he repeated, looking
round him. The position of the moon vertical
overhead showed that it was midnight; a waft of
coolness came from the pool. The ruined house
 
with the closed shutters stood there with a
melancholy aspect; the moss and weeds which
grew thickly upon it showed that it had not been
entered by any human foot for a long time.
Then he suddenly opened his hand, which had
been convulsively clenched during his sleep, and
cried aloud with astonishment when he saw the
note in it. “Ah! if I could only read,” he
thought, turning it this way and that. At that
moment he heard a noise behind him.

“Fear nothing! Lay hold of him! What
are you afraid of? There are ten of us. I
wager that he is a man, and not the devil.”

“Throw off your mask, friend! Cease trying
to fool us,” said the headman, taking him by
the collar. But he started back when he saw
him closely. “Levko! My son!” he exclaimed,
letting his arms sink. “It is you,
miserable boy! I thought some rascal, or disguised
devil, was playing these tricks; but now
it seems you have cooked this mess for your own
father—placed yourself at the head of a band
of robbers, and composed songs to ridicule
him. Eh, Levko! What is the meaning of
that? It seems your back is itching. Tie him
fast!”

“Stop! Stop! That is unnecessary!” exclaimed
the headman. “Even if I have not
heard it, I know that that is not the chief matter.
Read further!”

“‘Consequently I order you at once to marry
 your son, Levko Makohonenko, to the Cossack''s
daughter, Hanna Petritchenka, to repair the
bridges on the post-road, and to give no horses
belonging to the lords of the manor to the
county-court magistrates without my knowledge.
If on my arrival I do not find these orders carried
out, I shall hold you singly responsible.

“There we have it!” exclaimed the headman,
with his mouth open. “Have you heard
it? The headman is made responsible for everything,
and therefore everyone has to obey him
without contradiction! Otherwise, I beg to resign
my office. And you,” he continued, turning to
Levko, “I will have married, as the Commissary
directs, though it seems to me strange how he
knows of the affair; but you will get a taste of my
knout first—the one, you know, which hangs on
the wall at my bed-head. But how did you get
hold of the note?”

Levko, in spite of the astonishment which the
unexpected turn of affairs caused him, had had
the foresight to prepare an answer, and to conceal
the way in which the note had come into
his possession. “I was in the town last night,”
he said, “and met the Commissary just as
he was alighting from his droshky. When he
heard from which village I was he gave me the
 
note and bid me tell you by word of mouth,
father, that he would dine with us on his way
back.”

“Have you heard it?” said the headman,
with a solemn air turning to his companions.
“The Commissary himself, in his own person,
comes to us, that is to me, to dine.” The
headman lifted a finger and bent his head as
though he were listening to something. “The
Commissary, do you hear, the Commissary is
coming to dine with me! What do you think,
Mr Notary? And what do you think, friend?
That is not a little honour, is it?”

“All headmen are not alike,” he answered
with a self-satisfied air. Then he uttered a
hoarse laugh and said, “What do you think,
Mr Notary? Isn''t it right to order that in
honour of the distinguished guest, a fowl, linen,
and other things should be offered by every
cottage?”

“Wedding! I should like to celebrate your
wedding in my way! Well, in honour of the
 
distinguished guest, to-morrow the pope(1) will
marry you. Let the Commissary see that you
are punctual. Now, children, we will go to bed.
Go to your houses. The present occasion
reminds me of the time when I——” At these
words the headman assumed his customary
solemn air.

“Now the headman will relate how he accompanied
the Czarina!” said Levko to himself, and
hastened quickly, and full of joy, to the cherry-tree-shaded
house, which we know. “May God
bless you, beloved, and the holy angels smile
on you. To no one will I relate the wonders of
this night except to you, Hanna; you alone will
believe it, and pray with me for the repose of the
souls of the poor drowned maidens.”

He approached the house; the window was
open; the moonbeams fell on Hanna, who was
sleeping by it. Her head was supported on her
arm; her cheeks glowed; her lips moved, gently
murmuring his name.

“Sleep sweetly, my darling. Dream of
everything that is good, and yet the awaking will
surpass all.” He made the sign of the cross
over her, closed the window, and gently withdrew.

In a few moments the whole village was buried
in slumber. Only the moon hung as brilliant
and wonderful as before in the immensity of
 
the Ukraine sky. The divine night continued
her reign in solemn stillness, while the earth
lay bathed in silvery radiance. The universal
silence was only broken here and there by the
bark of a dog; only the drunken Kalenik still
wandered about the empty streets seeking for his
house.

(The “Viy” is a monstrous creation of popular
fancy. It is the name which the inhabitants of
Little Russia give to the king of the gnomes, whose
eyelashes reach to the ground. The following story
is a specimen of such folk-lore. I have made no
alterations, but reproduce it in the same simple form
in which I heard it.—Author''s Note.)

As soon as the clear seminary bell began
sounding in Kieff in the morning, the pupils
would come flocking from all parts of the town.
The students of grammar, rhetoric, philosophy,
and theology hastened with their books under
their arms over the streets.

The “grammarians” were still mere boys.
On the way they pushed against each other and
quarrelled with shrill voices. Nearly all of them
wore torn or dirty clothes, and their pockets were
always crammed with all kinds of things—push-bones,
pipes made out of pens, remains of confectionery,
and sometimes even young sparrows.
The latter would sometimes begin to chirp in the
midst of deep silence in the school, and bring
 
down on their possessors severe canings and
thrashings.

The “rhetoricians” walked in a more orderly
way. Their clothes were generally untorn, but
on the other hand their faces were often
strangely decorated; one had a black eye, and
the lips of another resembled a single blister,
etc. These spoke to each other in tenor
voices.

The “philosophers” talked in a tone an
octave lower; in their pockets they only had
fragments of tobacco, never whole cakes of it;
for what they could get hold of, they used at
once. They smelt so strongly of tobacco and
brandy, that a workman passing by them would
often remain standing and sniffing with his nose
in the air, like a hound.

About this time of day the market-place was
generally full of bustle, and the market women,
selling rolls, cakes, and honey-tarts, plucked the
sleeves of those who wore coats of fine cloth or
cotton.

“Young sir! Young sir! Here! Here!”
they cried from all sides. “Rolls and cakes
and tasty tarts, very delicious! I have baked
them myself!”

Another drew something long and crooked
out of her basket and cried, “Here is a sausage,
young sir! Buy a sausage!”

“Don''t buy anything from her!” cried a
 
rival. “See how greasy she is, and what a
dirty nose and hands she has!”

But the market women carefully avoided
appealing to the philosophers and theologians,
for these only took handfuls of eatables merely
to taste them.

Arrived at the seminary, the whole crowd of
students dispersed into the low, large class-rooms
with small windows, broad doors, and
blackened benches. Suddenly they were filled
with a many-toned murmur. The teachers
heard the pupils'' lessons repeated, some in shrill
and others in deep voices which sounded like a
distant booming. While the lessons were being
said, the teachers kept a sharp eye open to see
whether pieces of cake or other dainties were
protruding from their pupils'' pockets; if so, they
were promptly confiscated.

When this learned crowd arrived somewhat
earlier than usual, or when it was known that the
teachers would come somewhat late, a battle
would ensue, as though planned by general
agreement. In this battle all had to take part,
even the monitors who were appointed to look
after the order and morality of the whole school.
Two theologians generally arranged the conditions
of the battle: whether each class should
split into two sides, or whether all the pupils
should divide themselves into two halves.

In each case the grammarians began the battle,
 
and after the rhetoricians had joined in, the
former retired and stood on the benches, in order
to watch the fortunes of the fray. Then came
the philosophers with long black moustaches, and
finally the thick-necked theologians. The battle
generally ended in a victory for the latter,
and the philosophers retired to the different
class-rooms rubbing their aching limbs, and
throwing themselves on the benches to take
breath.

When the teacher, who in his own time had
taken part in such contests, entered the class-room
he saw by the heated faces of his pupils that
the battle had been very severe, and while he
caned the hands of the rhetoricians, in another
room another teacher did the same for the
philosophers.

On Sundays and Festival Days the seminarists
took puppet-theatres to the citizens'' houses.
Sometimes they acted a comedy, and in that case
it was always a theologian who took the part of
the hero or heroine—Potiphar or Herodias, etc.
As a reward for their exertions, they received a
piece of linen, a sack of maize, half a roast
goose, or something similar. All the students,
lay and clerical, were very poorly provided with
means for procuring themselves necessary subsistence,
but at the same time very fond of
eating; so that, however much food was given
to them, they were never satisfied, and the
 
gifts bestowed by rich landowners were never
adequate for their needs.

Therefore the Commissariat Committee, consisting
of philosophers and theologians, sometimes
dispatched the grammarians and rhetoricians
under the leadership of a philosopher—themselves
sometimes joining in the expedition—with
sacks on their shoulders, into the town, in
order to levy a contribution on the fleshpots of
the citizens, and then there was a feast in the
seminary.

The most important event in the seminary year
was the arrival of the holidays; these began in
July, and then generally all the students went
home. At that time all the roads were thronged
with grammarians, rhetoricians, philosophers,
and theologians. He who had no home of his own,
would take up his quarters with some fellow-student''s
family; the philosophers and theologians
looked out for tutors'' posts, taught the
children of rich farmers, and received for doing
so a pair of new boots and sometimes also a new
coat.

A whole troop of them would go off in close
ranks like a regiment; they cooked their porridge
in common, and encamped under the open sky.
Each had a bag with him containing a shirt and
a pair of socks. The theologians were especially
economical; in order not to wear out their boots
too quickly, they took them off and carried them
 
on a stick over their shoulders, especially when
the road was very muddy. Then they tucked
up their breeches over their knees and waded
bravely through the pools and puddles. Whenever
they spied a village near the highway, they
at once left it, approached the house which
seemed the most considerable, and began with
loud voices to sing a psalm. The master of the
house, an old Cossack engaged in agriculture,
would listen for a long time with his head propped
in his hands, then with tears on his cheeks say
to his wife, “What the students are singing
sounds very devout; bring out some lard and
anything else of the kind we have in the house.”

After thus replenishing their stores, the
students would continue their way. The farther
they went, the smaller grew their numbers, as
they dispersed to their various houses, and left
those whose homes were still farther on.

On one occasion, during such a march, three
students left the main-road in order to get
provisions in some village, since their stock had
long been exhausted. This party consisted of
the theologian Khalava, the philosopher Thomas
Brutus, and the rhetorician Tiberius Gorobetz.

The first was a tall youth with broad shoulders
and of a peculiar character; everything which
came within reach of his fingers he felt obliged
to appropriate. Moreover, he was of a very
melancholy disposition, and when he had got
 
intoxicated he hid himself in the most tangled
thickets so that the seminary officials had the
greatest trouble in finding him.

The philosopher Thomas Brutus was a more
cheerful character. He liked to lie for a long
time on the same spot and smoke his pipe; and
when he was merry with wine, he hired a fiddler
and danced the “tropak.” Often he got a
whole quantity of “beans,” i.e. thrashings;
but these he endured with complete philosophic
calm, saying that a man cannot escape his
destiny.

The rhetorician Tiberius Gorobetz had not yet
the right to wear a moustache, to drink brandy,
or to smoke tobacco. He only wore a small crop
of hair, as though his character was at present
too little developed. To judge by the great
bumps on his forehead, with which he often
appeared in the class-room, it might be expected
that some day he would be a valiant fighter.
Khalava and Thomas often pulled his hair as a
mark of their special favour, and sent him on
their errands.

Evening had already come when they left the
high-road; the sun had just gone down, and the
air was still heavy with the heat of the day. The
theologian and the philosopher strolled along,
smoking in silence, while the rhetorician struck
off the heads of the thistles by the wayside with
his stick. The way wound on through thick
 
woods of oak and walnut; green hills alternated
here and there with meadows. Twice already
they had seen cornfields, from which they concluded
that they were near some village; but an
hour had already passed, and no human habitation
appeared. The sky was already quite dark,
and only a red gleam lingered on the western
horizon.

“The deuce!” said the philosopher Thomas
Brutus. “I was almost certain we would soon
reach a village.”

The theologian still remained silent, looked
round him, then put his pipe again between his
teeth, and all three continued their way.

“Perhaps we shall find a farm farther on,”
answered the theologian, without taking his pipe
out of his mouth.

Meanwhile the night had descended; clouds
increased the darkness, and according to all
appearance there was no chance of moon or stars
appearing. The seminarists found that they had
lost the way altogether.

The rhetorician went on one side, lay on the
ground, and groped for a path; but his hands
encountered only fox-holes. All around lay a
huge steppe over which no one seemed to have
passed. The wanderers made several efforts to
get forward, but the landscape grew wilder and
more inhospitable.

The philosopher tried to shout, but his voice
was lost in vacancy, no one answered; only, some
moments later, they heard a faint groaning
sound, like the whimpering of a wolf.

“Why, just stop here, and spend the night in
the open air,” answered the theologian. So
saying, he felt in his pocket, brought out his
timber and steel, and lit his pipe.

But the philosopher could not agree with this
proposal; he was not accustomed to sleep till he
had first eaten five pounds of bread and five of
dripping, and so he now felt an intolerable
emptiness in his stomach. Besides, in spite of
his cheerful temperament, he was a little afraid
of the wolves.

“No, Khalava,” he said, “that won''t do.
To lie down like a dog and without any supper!
Let us try once more; perhaps we shall find a
house, and the consolation of having a glass of
brandy to drink before going to sleep.”

At the word “brandy,” the theologian spat
 
on one side and said, “Yes, of course, we cannot
remain all night in the open air.”

The students went on and on, and to their great
joy they heard the barking of dogs in the distance.
After listening a while to see from which
direction the barking came, they went on their
way with new courage, and soon espied a light.

His supposition proved correct; they soon saw
two or three houses built round a court-yard.
Lights glimmered in the windows, and before
the fence stood a number of trees. The students
looked through the crevices of the gates and saw
a court-yard in which stood a large number of
roving tradesmen''s carts. In the sky there were
now fewer clouds, and here and there a star was
visible.

“See, brother!” one of them said, “we must
now cry ‘halt!’ Cost what it may, we must find
entrance and a night''s lodging.”

The door of one of the houses creaked on its
hinges, and an old woman wrapped in a sheepskin
appeared. “Who is there?” she exclaimed,
coughing loudly.

“Let us spend the night here, mother; we
have lost our way, our stomachs are empty, and
we do not want to spend the night out of doors.”

“Quite harmless people; the theologian
Khalava, the philosopher Brutus, and the
rhetorician Gorobetz.”

“It is impossible,” answered the old woman.
“The whole house is full of people, and every
corner occupied. Where can I put you up?
You are big and heavy enough to break the house
down. I know these philosophers and theologians;
when once one takes them in, they eat one
out of house and home. Go farther on! There
is no room here for you!”

“Have pity on us, mother! How can you be
so heartless? Don''t let Christians perish. Put
us up where you like, and if we eat up your provisions,
or do any other damage, may our hands
wither up, and all the punishment of heaven light
on us!”

The old woman seemed a little touched.
“Well,” she said after a few moments'' consideration,
“I will let you in; but I must put you
in different rooms, for I should have no quiet if
you were all together at night.”

“Well now, mother,” said the philosopher,
following the old woman, “if you had a little
scrap of something! By heavens! my stomach
 
is as empty as a drum. I have not had a bit of
bread in my mouth since early this morning!”

“Didn''t I say so?” replied the old woman.
“There you go begging at once. But I have no
food in the house, nor any fire.”

Her reply greatly depressed the philosopher
Thomas; but suddenly his nose caught the odour
of dried fish; he looked at the breeches of the
theologian, who walked by his side, and saw a
huge fish''s tail sticking out of his pocket. The
latter had already seized the opportunity to steal
a whole fish from one of the carts standing in the
court-yard. He had not done this from hunger
so much as from the force of habit. He had
quite forgotten the fish, and was looking about
to see whether he could not find something else
to appropriate. Then the philosopher put his
hand in the theologian''s pocket as though it were
his own, and laid hold of his prize.

The old woman found a special resting-place
for each student; the rhetorician she put in a
shed, the theologian in an empty store-room, and
the philosopher in a sheep''s stall.

As soon as the philosopher was alone, he
 
devoured the fish in a twinkling, examined the
fence which enclosed the stall, kicked away a
pig from a neighbouring stall, which had inquiringly
inserted its nose through a crevice,
and lay down on his right side to sleep like a
corpse.

The philosopher shrank back; but she still
approached, as though she wished to lay hold of
him. A terrible fright seized him, for he saw
the old hag''s eyes sparkle in an extraordinary
way. “Away with you, old witch, away with
you!” he shouted. But she still stretched her
hands after him.

He jumped up in order to rush out, but she
placed herself before the door, fixed her glowing
eyes upon him, and again approached him. The
philosopher tried to push her away with his
hands, but to his astonishment he found that he
could neither lift his hands nor move his legs,
nor utter an audible word. He only heard his
heart beating, and saw the old woman approach
him, place his hands crosswise on his breast, and
bend his head down. Then with the agility of
a cat she sprang on his shoulders, struck him on
 
the side with a broom, and he began to run like
a race-horse, carrying her on his shoulders.

All this happened with such swiftness, that the
philosopher could scarcely collect his thoughts.
He laid hold of his knees with both hands in
order to stop his legs from running; but to his
great astonishment they kept moving forward
against his will, making rapid springs like a
Caucasian horse.

Not till the house had been left behind them
and a wide plain stretched before them, bordered
on one side by a black gloomy wood, did he say
to himself, “Ah! it is a witch!”

The half-moon shone pale and high in the sky.
Its mild light, still more subdued by intervening
clouds, fell like a transparent veil on the earth.
Woods, meadows, hills, and valleys—all seemed
to be sleeping with open eyes; nowhere was a
breath of air stirring. The atmosphere was moist
and warm; the shadows of the trees and bushes
fell sharply defined on the sloping plain. Such
was the night through which the philosopher
Thomas Brutus sped with his strange rider.

A strange, oppressive, and yet sweet sensation
took possession of his heart. He looked
down and saw how the grass beneath his feet
seemed to be quite deep and far away; over it
there flowed a flood of crystal-clear water, and
the grassy plain looked like the bottom of a transparent
sea. He saw his own image, and that
 
of the old woman whom he carried on his back,
clearly reflected in it. Then he beheld how,
instead of the moon, a strange sun shone there;
he heard the deep tones of bells, and saw them
swinging. He saw a water-nixie rise from a bed
of tall reeds; she turned to him, and her face
was clearly visible, and she sang a song which
penetrated his soul; then she approached him
and nearly reached the surface of the water, on
which she burst into laughter and again disappeared.

Did he see it or did he not see it? Was he
dreaming or was he awake? But what was that
below—wind or music? It sounded and drew
nearer, and penetrated his soul like a song that
rose and fell. “What is it?” he thought as he
gazed into the depths, and still sped rapidly along.

The perspiration flowed from him in streams;
he experienced simultaneously a strange feeling
of oppression and delight in all his being. Often
he felt as though he had no longer a heart, and
pressed his hand on his breast with alarm.

Weary to death, he began to repeat all the
prayers which he knew, and all the formulas
of exorcism against evil spirits. Suddenly he
experienced a certain relief. He felt that his
pace was slackening; the witch weighed less
heavily on his shoulders, and the thick herbage
of the plain was again beneath his feet, with
nothing especial to remark about it.

“Splendid!” thought the philosopher
Thomas, and began to repeat his exorcisms in a
still louder voice.

Then suddenly he wrenched himself away from
under the witch, and sprang on her back in his
turn. She began to run, with short, trembling
steps indeed, but so rapidly that he could hardly
breathe. So swiftly did she run that she hardly
seemed to touch the ground. They were still on
the plain, but owing to the rapidity of their
flight everything seemed indistinct and confused
before his eyes. He seized a stick that was
lying on the ground, and began to belabour the
hag with all his might. She uttered a wild cry,
which at first sounded raging and threatening;
then it became gradually weaker and more
gentle, till at last it sounded quite low like the
pleasant tones of a silver bell, so that it penetrated
his innermost soul. Involuntarily the
thought passed through his mind:

He knelt beside her, and looked in her eyes.
The dawn was red in the sky, and in the distance
glimmered the gilt domes of the churches of Kieff.
Before him lay a beautiful maiden with thick,
dishevelled hair and long eyelashes. Unconsciously
she had stretched out her white, bare
arms, and her tear-filled eyes gazed at the sky.

Thomas trembled like an aspen-leaf. Sympathy,
and a strange feeling of excitement, and a
hitherto unknown fear overpowered him. He
began to run with all his might. His heart beat
violently, and he could not explain to himself
what a strange, new feeling had seized him. He
did not wish to return to the village, but hastened
towards Kieff, thinking all the way as he went
of his weird, unaccountable adventure.

There were hardly any students left in the
town; they were all scattered about the country,
and had either taken tutors'' posts or simply lived
without occupation; for at the farms in Little
Russia one can live comfortably and at ease without
paying a farthing. The great half-decayed
building in which the seminary was established
was completely empty; and however much the
philosopher searched in all its corners for a piece
of lard and bread, he could not find even one
of the hard biscuits which the seminarists were in
the habit of hiding.

But the philosopher found a means of extricating
himself from his difficulties by making
friends with a certain young widow in the market-place
who sold ribbons, etc. The same evening
he found himself being stuffed with cakes and
fowl; in fact it is impossible to say how many
things were placed before him on a little table
in an arbour shaded by cherry-trees.

Later on the same evening the philosopher was
 
to be seen in an ale-house. He lay on a bench,
smoked his pipe in his usual way, and threw the
Jewish publican a gold piece. He had a jug of
ale standing before him, looked on all who went
in and out in a cold-blooded, self-satisfied way,
and thought no more of his strange adventure.

About this time a report spread about that the
daughter of a rich colonel, whose estate lay about
fifty versts distant from Kieff, had returned home
one day from a walk in a quite broken-down condition.
She had scarcely enough strength to
reach her father''s house; now she lay dying, and
had expressed a wish that for three days after
her death the prayers for the dead should be
recited by a Kieff seminarist named Thomas
Brutus.

This fact was communicated to the philosopher
by the rector of the seminary himself, who sent
for him to his room and told him that he must
start at once, as a rich colonel had sent his
servants and a kibitka for him. The philosopher
trembled, and was seized by an uncomfortable
feeling which he could not define. He had a
gloomy foreboding that some evil was about to
befall him. Without knowing why, he declared
that he did not wish to go.

“Listen, Thomas,” said the rector, who
under certain circumstances spoke very politely
 
to his pupils; “I have no idea of asking you
whether you wish to go or not. I only tell you
that if you think of disobeying, I will have you
so soundly flogged on the back with young birch-rods,
that you need not think of having a bath
for a long time.”

The philosopher scratched the back of his
head, and went out silently, intending to make
himself scarce at the first opportunity. Lost in
thought, he descended the steep flight of steps
which led to the court-yard, thickly planted
with poplars; there he remained standing for a
moment, and heard quite distinctly the rector
giving orders in a loud voice to his steward,
and to another person, probably one of the
messengers sent by the colonel.

“Thank your master for the peeled barley and
the eggs,” said the rector; “and tell him that
as soon as the books which he mentions in his
note are ready, I will send them. I have already
given them to a clerk to be copied. And don''t
forget to remind your master that he has some
excellent fish, especially prime sturgeon, in his
ponds; he might send me some when he has the
opportunity, as here in the market the fish
are bad and dear. And you, Jantukh, give the
colonel''s man a glass of brandy. And mind you
tie up the philosopher, or he will show you a
clean pair of heels.”

“Listen to the scoundrel!” thought the
 
philosopher. “He has smelt a rat, the long-legged
stork!”

He descended into the court-yard and beheld
there a kibitka, which he at first took for a barn
on wheels. It was, in fact, as roomy as a kiln,
so that bricks might have been made inside it.
It was one of those remarkable Cracow vehicles
in which Jews travelled from town to town in
scores, wherever they thought they would find a
market. Six stout, strong, though somewhat
elderly Cossacks were standing by it. Their
gold-braided coats of fine cloth showed that
their master was rich and of some importance;
and certain little scars testified to their valour
on the battle-field.

“What can I do?” thought the philosopher.
“There is no escaping one''s destiny.” So he
stepped up to the Cossacks and said “Good day,
comrades.”

“Well, I am to travel with you! It is a
magnificent vehicle,” he continued as he got
into it. “If there were only musicians present,
one might dance in it.”

“Yes, it is a roomy carriage,” said one of the
Cossacks, taking his seat by the coachman. The
latter had tied a cloth round his head, as he had
already found an opportunity of pawning his cap
in the ale-house. The other five, with the
 
philosopher, got into the capacious kibitka, and
sat upon sacks which were filled with all sorts
of articles purchased in the city.

“I should like to know,” said the philosopher,
“if this equipage were laden with salt or iron,
how many horses would be required to draw it?”

“Yes,” said the Cossack who sat by the
coachman, after thinking a short time, “it would
require a good many horses.”

After giving this satisfactory answer, the
Cossack considered himself entitled to remain
silent for the whole of the rest of the journey.

The philosopher would gladly have found out
who the colonel was, and what sort of a character
he had. He was also curious to know about his
daughter, who had returned home in such a
strange way and now lay dying, and whose
destiny seemed to be mingled with his own;
and wanted to know the sort of life that was
lived in the colonel''s house. But the Cossacks
were probably philosophers like himself, for in
answer to his inquiries they only blew clouds of
tobacco and settled themselves more comfortably
on their sacks.

Meanwhile, one of them addressed to the
coachman on the box a brief command: “Keep
your eyes open, Overko, you old sleepy-head, and
when you come to the ale-house on the road to
Tchukrailoff, don''t forget to pull up and wake me
and the other fellows if we are asleep.” Then
 
he began to snore pretty loud. But in any
case his admonition was quite superfluous; for
scarcely had the enormous equipage begun to
approach the aforesaid ale-house, than they all
cried with one mouth “Halt! Halt!” Besides
this, Overko''s horse was accustomed to stop outside
every inn of its own accord.

In spite of the intense July heat, they all got
out and entered a low, dirty room where a Jewish
innkeeper received them in a friendly way as old
acquaintances. He brought in the skirt of his
long coat some sausages, and laid them on the
table, where, though forbidden by the Talmud,
they looked very seductive. All sat down at
table, and it was not long before each of the
guests had an earthenware jug standing in front
of him. The philosopher Thomas had to take
part in the feast, and as the Little Russians when
they are intoxicated always begin to kiss each
other or to weep, the whole room soon began to
echo with demonstrations of affection.

One Cossack, with a grey moustache, the
eldest of them all, leant his head on his hand
and began to weep bitterly because he was an
orphan and alone in God''s wide world. Another
tall, loquacious man did his best to comfort him,
 
saying, “Don''t weep, for God''s sake, don''t
weep! For over there—God knows best.”

The Cossack who had been addressed as
Dorosch was full of curiosity, and addressed
many questions to the philosopher Thomas. “I
should like to know,” he said, “what you learn
in your seminary; do you learn the same things
as the deacon reads to us in church, or something
else?”

“Don''t ask,” said the consoler; “let them
learn what they like. God knows what is to
happen; God knows everything.”

“No, I will know,” answered Dorosch, “I
will know what is written in their books; perhaps
it is something quite different from that in the
deacon''s book.”

“O good heavens!” said the other, “why all
this talk? It is God''s will, and one cannot
change God''s arrangements.”

“But I will know everything that is written;
I will enter the seminary too, by heaven I will!
Do you think perhaps I could not learn? I will
learn everything, everything.”

“Oh, heavens!” exclaimed the consoler, and
let his head sink on the table, for he could no
longer hold it upright.

When the philosopher Thomas saw the state
they were in, he determined to profit by it, and
 
to make his escape. In the first place he turned
to the grey-headed Cossack, who was lamenting
the loss of his parents. “But, little uncle,” he
said to him, “why do you weep so? I too am
an orphan! Let me go, children; why do you
want me?”

They were about to take him outside themselves,
when the one who had displayed a special
thirst for knowledge, stopped them, saying, “No,
I want to talk with him about the seminary; I am
going to the seminary myself.”

Moreover, it was not yet certain whether the
philosopher could have executed his project of
flight, for when he tried to rise from his chair,
he felt as though his feet were made of wood,
and he began to see such a number of doors leading
out of the room that it would have been
difficult for him to have found the right one.

It was not till evening that the company remembered
that they must continue their journey.
They crowded into the kibitka, whipped up the
horses, and struck up a song, the words and sense
of which were hard to understand. During a
great part of the night, they wandered about,
having lost the road which they ought to have
been able to find blindfolded. At last they drove
down a steep descent into a valley, and the
philosopher noticed, by the sides of the road,
 
hedges, behind which he caught glimpses of
small trees and house-roofs. All these belonged
to the colonel''s estate.

It was already long past midnight. The sky
was dark, though little stars glimmered here
and there; no light was to be seen in any of
the houses. They drove into a large court-yard,
while the dogs barked. On all sides were barns
and cottages with thatched roofs. Just opposite
the gateway was a house, which was larger than
the others, and seemed to be the colonel''s dwelling.
The kibitka stopped before a small barn,
and the travellers hastened into it and laid
themselves down to sleep. The philosopher however
attempted to look at the exterior of the
house, but, rub his eyes as he might, he could
distinguish nothing; the house seemed to turn
into a bear, and the chimney into the rector of
the seminary. Then he gave it up and lay down
to sleep.

When he woke up the next morning, the whole
house was in commotion; the young lady had
died during the night. The servants ran hither
and thither in a distracted state; the old women
wept and lamented; and a number of curious
people gazed through the enclosure into the
court-yard, as though there were something
special to be seen. The philosopher began now
to inspect the locality and the buildings, which
he had not been able to do during the night.

The colonel''s house was one of those low,
small buildings, such as used formerly to be constructed
in Russia. It was thatched with straw;
a small, high-peaked gable, with a window
shaped like an eye, was painted all over with
blue and yellow flowers and red crescent-moons;
it rested on little oaken pillars, which were round
above the middle, hexagonal below, and whose
capitals were adorned with quaint carvings.
Under this gable was a small staircase with seats
at the foot of it on either side.

The walls of the house were supported by
similar pillars. Before the house stood a large
pear-tree of pyramidal shape, whose leaves incessantly
trembled. A double row of buildings
formed a broad street leading up to the colonel''s
house. Behind the barns near the entrance-gate
stood two three-cornered wine-houses, also
thatched with straw; each of the stone walls had
a door in it, and was covered with all kinds of
paintings. On one was represented a Cossack
sitting on a barrel and swinging a large pitcher
over his head; it bore the inscription “I will
drink all that!” Elsewhere were painted large
and small bottles, a beautiful girl, a running
horse, a pipe, and a drum bearing the words
“Wine is the Cossack''s joy.”

In the loft of one of the barns one saw through
a huge round window a drum and some trumpets.
At the gate there stood two cannons. All this
 
showed that the colonel loved a cheerful life, and
the whole place often rang with sounds of merriment.
Before the gate were two windmills, and
behind the house gardens sloped away; through
the tree-tops the dark chimneys of the peasants''
houses were visible. The whole village lay on a
broad, even plateau, in the middle of a mountain-slope
which culminated in a steep summit on
the north side. When seen from below, it
looked still steeper. Here and there on the top
the irregular stems of the thick steppe-brooms
showed in dark relief against the blue sky. The
bare clay soil made a melancholy impression,
worn as it was into deep furrows by rain-water.
On the same slope there stood two cottages, and
over one of them a huge apple-tree spread its
branches; the roots were supported by small
props, whose interstices were filled with mould.
The apples, which were blown off by the wind,
rolled down to the court-yard below. A road
wound round the mountain to the village.

When the philosopher looked at this steep
slope, and remembered his journey of the night
before, he came to the conclusion that either the
colonel''s horses were very sagacious, or that the
Cossacks must have very strong heads, as they
ventured, even when the worse for drink, on
such a road with the huge kibitka.

When the philosopher turned and looked in
the opposite direction, he saw quite another
 
picture. The village reached down to the plain;
meadows stretched away to an immense distance,
their bright green growing gradually dark; far
away, about twenty versts off, many other villages
were visible. To the right of these meadows
were chains of hills, and in the remote distance
one saw the Dnieper shimmer and sparkle like a
mirror of steel.

“What a splendid country!” said the
philosopher to himself. “It must be fine to live
here! One could catch fish in the Dnieper, and
in the ponds, and shoot and snare partridges and
bustards; there must be quantities here. Much
fruit might be dried here and sold in the town,
or, better still, brandy might be distilled from it,
for fruit-brandy is the best of all. But what prevents
me thinking of my escape after all?”

Behind the hedge he saw a little path which
was almost entirely concealed by the high grass
of the steppe. The philosopher approached it
mechanically, meaning at first to walk a little
along it unobserved, and then quite quietly to
gain the open country behind the peasants''
houses. Suddenly he felt the pressure of a fairly
heavy hand on his shoulder.

Behind him stood the same old Cossack who
yesterday had so bitterly lamented the death of
his father and mother, and his own loneliness.
“You are giving yourself useless trouble, Mr
Philosopher, if you think you can escape from
 
us,” he said. “One cannot run away here; and
besides, the roads are too bad for walkers. Come
to the colonel; he has been waiting for you for
some time in his room.”

“Yes, of course! What are you talking
about? I will come with the greatest pleasure,”
said the philosopher, and followed the Cossack.

The colonel was an elderly man; his moustache
was grey, and his face wore the signs of deep sadness.
He sat in his room by a table, with his
head propped on both hands. He seemed about
five-and-fifty, but his attitude of utter despair,
and the pallor on his face, showed that his heart
had been suddenly broken, and that all his former
cheerfulness had for ever disappeared.

When Thomas entered with the Cossack, he
answered their deep bows with a slight inclination
of the head.

“Who are you, whence do you come, and
what is your profession, my good man?” asked
the colonel in an even voice, neither friendly nor
austere.

“I don''t know either; I know that I must have
had a mother, but who she was, and where she
lived, by heavens, I do not know.”

The colonel was silent, and seemed for a
moment lost in thought. “Where did you come
to know my daughter?”

The philosopher shrugged his shoulders.
“God only knows. It is a well-known fact that
grand people often demand things which the
most learned man cannot comprehend; and does
not the proverb say, ‘Dance, devil, as the Lord
commands!’”

“If she had only lived a moment longer,”
said the colonel sadly, “then I had certainly
found out everything. She said, ‘Let no one
offer up prayers for me, but send, father, at once
to the seminary in Kieff for the student Thomas
Brutus; he shall pray three nights running for
my sinful soul—he knows.’ But what he really
knows she never said. The poor dove could
speak no more, and died. Good man, you are
probably well known for your sanctity and
devout life, and she has perhaps heard of you.”

“What? Of me?” said the philosopher, and
took a step backward in amazement. “I and
 
sanctity!” he exclaimed, and stared at the
colonel. “God help us, gracious sir! What
are you saying? It was only last Holy Thursday
that I paid a visit to the tart-shop.”

“Well, she must at any rate have had some
reason for making the arrangement, and you
must begin your duties to-day.”

“I should like to remark to your honour—naturally
everyone who knows the Holy Scripture
at all can in his measure—but I believe it would
be better on this occasion to send for a deacon
or subdeacon. They are learned people, and
they know exactly what is to be done. I have
not got a good voice, nor any official standing.”

“You may say what you like, but I shall carry
out all my dove''s wishes. If you read the prayers
for her three nights through in the proper way, I
will reward you; and if not—I advise the devil
himself not to oppose me!”

The colonel spoke the last words in such an
emphatic way that the philosopher quite understood
them.

They went into the hall. The colonel opened
a door which was opposite his own. The
philosopher remained for a few minutes in the
hall in order to look about him; then he stepped
over the threshold with a certain nervousness.

The whole floor of the room was covered with
red cloth. In a corner under the icons of the
 
saints, on a table covered with a gold-bordered,
velvet cloth, lay the body of the girl. Tall
candles, round which were wound branches of
the “calina,” stood at her head and feet, and
burned dimly in the broad daylight. The face
of the dead was not to be seen, as the inconsolable
father sat before his daughter, with his
back turned to the philosopher. The words
which the latter overheard filled him with a
certain fear:

“I do not mourn, my daughter, that in the
flower of your age you have prematurely left the
earth, to my grief; but I mourn, my dove, that
I do not know my deadly enemy who caused your
death. Had I only known that anyone could
even conceive the idea of insulting you, or of
speaking a disrespectful word to you, I swear by
heaven he would never have seen his children
again, if he had been as old as myself; nor his
father and mother, if he had been young. And I
would have thrown his corpse to the birds of the
air, and the wild beasts of the steppe. But woe
is me, my flower, my dove, my light! I will spend
the remainder of my life without joy, and wipe
the bitter tears which flow out of my old eyes,
while my enemy will rejoice and laugh in secret
over the helpless old man!”

The philosopher was deeply affected by the
 
sight of such inconsolable sorrow. He coughed
gently in order to clear his throat. The colonel
turned and signed to him to take his place at the
head of the dead girl, before a little prayer-desk
on which some books lay.

“I can manage to hold out for three nights,”
thought the philosopher; “and then the colonel
will fill both my pockets with ducats.”

He approached the dead girl, and after coughing
once more, began to read, without paying
attention to anything else, and firmly resolved
not to look at her face.

Soon there was deep silence, and he saw that
the colonel had left the room. Slowly he turned
his head in order to look at the corpse. A
violent shudder thrilled through him; before him
lay a form of such beauty as is seldom seen
upon earth. It seemed to him that never in a
single face had so much intensity of expression
and harmony of feature been united. Her brow,
soft as snow and pure as silver, seemed to be
thinking; the fine, regular eyebrows shadowed
proudly the closed eyes, whose lashes gently
rested on her cheeks, which seemed to glow with
secret longing; her lips still appeared to smile.
But at the same time he saw something in these
features which appalled him; a terrible depression
seized his heart, as when in the midst of
dance and song someone begins to chant a dirge.
He felt as though those ruby lips were coloured
 
with his own heart''s blood. Moreover, her face
seemed dreadfully familiar.

“The witch!” he cried out in a voice which
sounded strange to himself; then he turned away
and began to read the prayers with white cheeks.
It was the witch whom he had killed.

When the sun had sunk below the horizon,
the corpse was carried into the church. The
philosopher supported one corner of the black-draped
coffin upon his shoulder, and felt an ice-cold
shiver run through his body. The colonel
walked in front of him, with his right hand
resting on the edge of the coffin.

The wooden church, black with age and
overgrown with green lichen, stood quite at the
end of the village in gloomy solitude; it was
adorned with three round cupolas. One saw at
the first glance that it had not been used for
divine worship for a long time.

Lighted candles were standing before almost
every icon. The coffin was set down before the
altar. The old colonel kissed his dead daughter
once more, and then left the church, together
with the bearers of the bier, after he had ordered
his servants to look after the philosopher and to
take him back to the church after supper.

The coffin-bearers, when they returned to the
 
house, all laid their hands on the stove. This
custom is always observed in Little Russia by
those who have seen a corpse.

The hunger which the philosopher now began
to feel caused him for a while to forget the dead
girl altogether. Gradually all the domestics of
the house assembled in the kitchen; it was really
a kind of club, where they were accustomed to
gather. Even the dogs came to the door, wagging
their tails in order to have bones and offal
thrown to them.

If a servant was sent on an errand, he always
found his way into the kitchen to rest there for
a while, and to smoke a pipe. All the Cossacks
of the establishment lay here during the whole
day on and under the benches—in fact, wherever
a place could be found to lie down in. Moreover,
everyone was always leaving something
behind in the kitchen—his cap, or his whip, or
something of the sort. But the numbers of the
club were not complete till the evening, when
the groom came in after tying up his horses in
the stable, the cowherd had shut up his cows
in their stalls, and others collected there who
were not usually seen in the day-time. During
supper-time even the tongues of the laziest were
set in motion. They talked of all and everything—of
the new pair of breeches which someone
had ordered for himself, of what might be
in the centre of the earth, and of the wolf which
 
someone had seen. There were a number of
wits in the company—a class which is always
represented in Little Russia.

The philosopher took his place with the rest in
the great circle which sat round the kitchen door
in the open-air. Soon an old woman with a red
cap issued from it, bearing with both hands a
large vessel full of hot “galuchkis,” which she
distributed among them. Each drew out of
his pocket a wooden spoon, or a one-pronged
wooden fork. As soon as their jaws began to
move a little more slowly, and their wolfish
hunger was somewhat appeased, they began to
talk. The conversation, as might be expected,
turned on the dead girl.

“Is it true,” said a young shepherd, “is it
true—though I cannot understand it—that our
young mistress had traffic with evil spirits?”

“Who, the young lady?” answered Dorosch,
whose acquaintance the philosopher had already
made in the kibitka. “Yes, she was a regular
witch! I can swear that she was a witch!”

“Hold your tongue, Dorosch!” exclaimed
another—the one who, during the journey, had
played the part of a consoler. “We have
nothing to do with that. May God be merciful
to her! One ought not to talk of such things.”

But Dorosch was not at all inclined to be
silent; he had just visited the wine-cellar with
the steward on important business, and having
 
stooped two or three times over one or two casks,
he had returned in a very cheerful and loquacious
mood.

“Why do you ask me to be silent?” he
answered. “She has ridden on my own shoulders,
I swear she has.”

“No, there are not,” answered Dorosch;
“even if you knew the Psalter by heart, you
could not recognise one.”

“Yes, Dorosch, it is possible; don''t talk such
nonsense,” retorted the former consoler. “It
is not for nothing that God has given each some
special peculiarity; the learned maintain that
every witch has a little tail.”

“Yes, you are a fine lot,” retorted the old
woman who entered at that moment with a vessel
full of fresh “galuchkis.” “You are great fat
pigs!”

A self-satisfied smile played round the lips of
the old Cossack whose name was Javtuch, when
he found that his remark had touched the old
woman on a tender point. The shepherd burst
into such a deep and loud explosion of laughter
as if two oxen were lowing together.

This conversation excited in the philosopher
 
a great curiosity, and a wish to obtain more
exact information regarding the colonel''s
daughter. In order to lead the talk back to the
subject, he turned to his next neighbour and
said, “I should like to know why all the people
here think that the young lady was a witch.
Has she done harm to anyone, or killed them by
witchcraft?”

“Yes, there are reports of that kind,”
answered a man, whose face was as flat as a
shovel. “Who does not remember the huntsman
Mikita, or the——”

“You, Mr Philosopher Thomas, did not know
Mikita. Ah! he was an extraordinary man.
He knew every dog as though he were his own
father. The present huntsman, Mikola, who sits
three places away from me, is not fit to hold a
candle to him, though good enough in his way;
but compared to Mikita, he is a mere milksop.”

“He saw a hare in the field quicker than
you can take a pinch of snuff. He only needed
to whistle ‘Come here, Rasboy! Come here,
Bosdraja!’ and flew away on his horse like the
wind, so that you could not say whether he went
quicker than the dog or the dog than he. He
could empty a quart pot of brandy in the twinkling
of an eye. Ah! he was a splendid huntsman,
only for some time he always had his eyes
fixed on the young lady. Either he had fallen
in love with her or she had bewitched him—in
short, he went to the dogs. He became a regular
old woman; yes, he became the devil knows what—it
is not fitting to relate it.”

“If the young lady only looked at him, he let
the reins slip out of his hands, called Bravko
instead of Rasboy, stumbled, and made all kinds
of mistakes. One day when he was currycombing
a horse, the young lady came to him in the
stable. ‘Listen, Mikita,’ she said. ‘I should
like for once to set my foot on you.’ And he,
the booby, was quite delighted, and answered,
‘Don''t only set your foot there, but sit on me
altogether.’ The young lady lifted her white
little foot, and as soon as he saw it, his delight
robbed him of his senses. He bowed his neck,
the idiot, took her feet in both hands, and began
to trot about like a horse all over the place.
 
Whither they went he could not say; he returned
more dead than alive, and from that time he
wasted away and became as dry as a chip of
wood. At last someone coming into the stable
one day found instead of him only a handful
of ashes and an empty jug; he had burned
completely out. But it must be said he
was a huntsman such as the world cannot
match.”

When Spirid had ended his tale, they all began
to vie with one another in praising the deceased
huntsman.

“Ha! Ha! One sees they don''t teach you
much in your seminary. Well, listen. We
have here in our village a Cossack called Cheptoun,
a fine fellow. Sometimes indeed he
amuses himself by stealing and lying without any
reason; but he is a fine fellow for all that. His
house is not far away from here. One evening,
just about this time, Cheptoun and his wife went
to bed after they had finished their day''s work.
Since it was fine weather, Cheptchicha went to
sleep in the court-yard, and Cheptoun in the
house—no! I mean Cheptchicha went to sleep
in the house on a bench and Cheptoun outside——”

“No, Cheptchicha didn''t go to sleep on a
 
bench, but on the ground,” interrupted the old
woman who stood at the door.

Dorosch looked at her, then at the ground,
then again at her, and said after a pause, “If I
tore your dress off your back before all these
people, it wouldn''t look pretty.”

“In the cradle which hung in the middle of the
room lay a one-year-old child. I do not know
whether it was a boy or a girl. Cheptchicha had
lain down, and heard on the other side of the
door a dog scratching and howling loud enough
to frighten anyone. She was afraid, for women
are such simple folk that if one puts out one''s
tongue at them behind the door in the dark, their
hearts sink into their boots. ‘But,’ she thought
to herself, ‘I must give this cursed dog one on
the snout to stop his howling!’ So she seized
the poker and opened the door. But hardly had
she done so than the dog rushed between her
legs straight to the cradle. Then Cheptchicha
saw that it was not a dog but the young lady;
and if it had only been the young lady as she
knew her it wouldn''t have mattered, but she
looked quite blue, and her eyes sparkled like fiery
coals. She seized the child, bit its throat, and
began to suck its blood. Cheptchicha shrieked,
‘Ah! my darling child!’ and rushed out of the
 
room. Then she saw that the house-door was
shut and rushed up to the attic and sat there, the
stupid woman, trembling all over. Then the
young lady came after her and bit her too, poor
fool! The next morning Cheptoun carried his
wife, all bitten and wounded, down from the
attic, and the next day she died. Such strange
things happen in the world. One may wear fine
clothes, but that does not matter; a witch is and
remains a witch.”

After telling his story, Dorosch looked around
him with a complacent air, and cleaned out his
pipe with his little finger in order to fill it again.
The story of the witch had made a deep impression
on all, and each of them had something to
say about her. One had seen her come to the
door of his house in the form of a hayrick; from
others she had stolen their caps or their pipes;
she had cut off the hair-plaits of many girls in
the village, and drunk whole pints of the blood
of others.

At last the whole company observed that they
had gossiped over their time, for it was already
night. All looked for a sleeping place—some
in the kitchen and others in the barn or the
court-yard.

“Now, Mr Thomas, it is time that we go
to the dead,” said the grey-headed Cossack,
turning to the philosopher. All four—Spirid,
Dorosch, the old Cossack, and the philosopher—betook
 
themselves to the church, keeping off with
their whips the wild dogs who roamed about the
roads in great numbers and bit the sticks of
passers-by in sheer malice.

Although the philosopher had seized the opportunity
of fortifying himself beforehand with a
stiff glass of brandy, yet he felt a certain secret
fear which increased as he approached the
church, which was lit up within. The strange
tales he had heard had made a deep impression
on his imagination. They had passed the thick
hedges and trees, and the country became more
open. At last they reached the small enclosure
round the church; behind it there were no more
trees, but a huge, empty plain dimly visible in
the darkness. The three Cossacks ascended the
steep steps with Thomas, and entered the church.
Here they left the philosopher, expressing their
hope that he would successfully accomplish his
duties, and locked him in as their master had
ordered.

He was left alone. At first he yawned, then
he stretched himself, blew on both hands, and
finally looked round him. In the middle of the
church stood the black bier; before the dark
pictures of saints burned the candles, whose
light only illuminated the icons, and cast a faint
glimmer into the body of the church; all the
corners were in complete darkness. The lofty
icons seemed to be of considerable age; only a
 
little of the original gilt remained on their broken
traceries; the faces of the saints had become
quite black and looked uncanny.

Once more the philosopher cast a glance
around him. “Bother it!” said he to himself.
“What is there to be afraid about? No living
creature can get in, and as for the dead and
those who come from the ‘other side,’ I can
protect myself with such effectual prayers that
they cannot touch me with the tips of their
fingers. There is nothing to fear,” he repeated,
swinging his arms. “Let us begin the
prayers!”

As he approached one of the side-aisles, he
noticed two packets of candles which had been
placed there.

“That is fine,” he thought. “I must
illuminate the whole church, till it is as bright
as day. What a pity that one cannot smoke
in it.”

He began to light the candles on all the wall-brackets
and all the candelabra, as well as those
already burning before the holy pictures; soon
the whole church was brilliantly lit up. Only
the darkness in the roof above seemed still
denser by contrast, and the faces of the saints
peering out of the frames looked as unearthly as
before. He approached the bier, looked nervously
at the face of the dead girl, could not
help shuddering slightly, and involuntarily closed
 
his eyes. What terrible and extraordinary
beauty!

He turned away and tried to go to one side,
but the strange curiosity and peculiar fascination
which men feel in moments of fear, compelled
him to look again and again, though with a
similar shudder. And in truth there was something
terrible about the beauty of the dead girl.
Perhaps she would not have inspired so much
fear had she been less beautiful; but there was
nothing ghastly or deathlike in the face, which
wore rather an expression of life, and it seemed
to the philosopher as though she were watching
him from under her closed eyelids. He even
thought he saw a tear roll from under the eyelash
of her right eye, but when it was half-way
down her cheek, he saw that it was a drop
of blood.

He quickly went into one of the stalls, opened
his book, and began to read the prayers in a very
loud voice in order to keep up his courage. His
deep voice sounded strange to himself in the
grave-like silence; it aroused no echo in the
silent and desolate wooden walls of the church.

“What is there to be afraid of?” he thought
to himself. “She will not rise from her bier,
since she fears God''s word. She will remain
quietly resting. Yes, and what sort of a Cossack
should I be, if I were afraid? The fact is, I
have drunk a little too much—that is why I feel
 
so queer. Let me take a pinch of snuff. It is
really excellent—first-rate!”

At the same time he cast a furtive glance over
the pages of the prayer-book towards the bier,
and involuntarily he said to himself, “There!
See! She is getting up! Her head is already
above the edge of the coffin!”

But a death-like silence prevailed; the coffin
was motionless, and all the candles shone
steadily. It was an awe-inspiring sight, this
church lit up at midnight, with the corpse in the
midst, and no living soul near but one. The
philosopher began to sing in various keys in
order to stifle his fears, but every moment he
glanced across at the coffin, and involuntarily the
question came to his lips, “Suppose she rose up
after all?”

But the coffin did not move. Nowhere was
there the slightest sound nor stir. Not even
did a cricket chirp in any corner. There was
nothing audible but the slight sputtering of
some distant candle, or the faint fall of a drop
of wax.

He raised his head. Then he looked round
him wildly and rubbed his eyes. Yes, she was
no longer lying in the coffin, but sitting upright.
He turned away his eyes, but at once looked
again, terrified, at the coffin. She stood up;
then she walked with closed eyes through the
 
church, stretching out her arms as though she
wanted to seize someone.

She now came straight towards him. Full of
alarm, he traced with his finger a circle round
himself; then in a loud voice he began to recite
the prayers and formulas of exorcism which he
had learnt from a monk who had often seen
witches and evil spirits.

She had almost reached the edge of the circle
which he had traced; but it was evident that she
had not the power to enter it. Her face wore a
bluish tint like that of one who has been several
days dead.

Thomas had not the courage to look at her, so
terrible was her appearance; her teeth chattered
and she opened her dead eyes, but as in her rage
she saw nothing, she turned in another direction
and felt with outstretched arms among the pillars
and corners of the church in the hope of seizing
him.

The philosopher could not recover his self-possession,
and kept on gazing anxiously at it.
Suddenly it rose from its place and began hurtling
about the church with a whizzing sound.
At one time it was almost directly over his head;
but the philosopher observed that it could not
pass over the area of his charmed circle, so he
kept on repeating his formulas of exorcism. The
 
coffin now fell with a crash in the middle of the
church, and remained lying there motionless.
The corpse rose again; it had now a greenish-blue
colour, but at the same moment the distant
crowing of a cock was audible, and it lay down
again.

The philosopher''s heart beat violently, and the
perspiration poured in streams from his face;
but heartened by the crowing of the cock, he
rapidly repeated the prayers.

As the first light of dawn looked through the
windows, there came a deacon and the grey-haired
Javtuk, who acted as sacristan, in order
to release him. When he had reached the
house, he could not sleep for a long time; but at
last weariness overpowered him, and he slept till
noon. When he awoke, his experiences of the
night appeared to him like a dream. He was
given a quart of brandy to strengthen him.

At table he was again talkative and ate a fairly
large sucking pig almost without assistance.
But none the less he resolved to say nothing of
what he had seen, and to all curious questions
only returned the answer, “Yes, some wonderful
things happened.”

The philosopher was one of those men who,
when they have had a good meal, are uncommonly
amiable. He lay down on a bench, with
his pipe in his mouth, looked blandly at all, and
expectorated every minute.

But as the evening approached, he became
more and more pensive. About supper-time
nearly the whole company had assembled in order
to play “krapli.” This is a kind of game of
skittles, in which, instead of bowls, long staves
are used, and the winner has the right to ride on
the back of his opponent. It provided the spectators
with much amusement; sometimes the
groom, a huge man, would clamber on the back
of the swineherd, who was slim and short
and shrunken; another time the groom would
present his own back, while Dorosch sprang on
it shouting, “What a regular ox!” Those
of the company who were more staid sat by the
threshold of the kitchen. They looked uncommonly
serious, smoked their pipes, and did not
even smile when the younger ones went into fits
of laughter over some joke of the groom or
Spirid.

Thomas vainly attempted to take part in the
game; a gloomy thought was firmly fixed like a
nail in his head. In spite of his desperate efforts
to appear cheerful after supper, fear had overmastered
his whole being, and it increased with
the growing darkness.

“Now it is time for us to go, Mr Student!”
said the grey-haired Cossack, and stood up with
Dorosch. “Let us betake ourselves to our
work.”

Thomas was conducted to the church in the
 
same way as on the previous evening; again he
was left alone, and the door was bolted behind
him.

As soon as he found himself alone, he began
to feel in the grip of his fears. He again saw
the dark pictures of the saints in their gilt
frames, and the black coffin, which stood menacing
and silent in the middle of the church.

“Never mind!” he said to himself. “I am
over the first shock. The first time I was frightened,
but I am not so at all now—no, not at
all!”

He quickly went into a stall, drew a circle
round him with his finger, uttered some prayers
and formulas for exorcism, and then began to
read the prayers for the dead in a loud voice and
with the fixed resolution not to look up from the
book nor take notice of anything.

He did so for an hour, and began to grow a
little tired; he cleared his throat and drew his
snuff-box out of his pocket, but before he had
taken a pinch he looked nervously towards the
coffin.

A sudden chill shot through him. The witch
was already standing before him on the edge of
the circle, and had fastened her green eyes upon
him. He shuddered, looked down at the book,
and began to read his prayers and exorcisms
aloud. Yet all the while he was aware how her
teeth chattered, and how she stretched out her
 
arms to seize him. But when he cast a hasty
glance towards her, he saw that she was not
looking in his direction, and it was clear that she
could not see him.

Then she began to murmur in an undertone,
and terrible words escaped her lips—words that
sounded like the bubbling of boiling pitch. The
philosopher did not know their meaning, but he
knew that they signified something terrible, and
were intended to counteract his exorcisms.

After she had spoken, a stormy wind arose
in the church, and there was a noise like the
rushing of many birds. He heard the noise of
their wings and claws as they flapped against and
scratched at the iron bars of the church windows.
There were also violent blows on the church
door, as if someone were trying to break it in
pieces.

The philosopher''s heart beat violently; he did
not dare to look up, but continued to read
the prayers without a pause. At last there was
heard in the distance the shrill sound of a cock''s
crow. The exhausted philosopher stopped and
gave a great sigh of relief.

Those who came to release him found him
more dead than alive; he had leant his back
against the wall, and stood motionless, regarding
them without any expression in his eyes.
They were obliged almost to carry him to the
house; he then shook himself, asked for and
 
drank a quart of brandy. He passed his hand
through his hair and said, “There are all sorts
of horrors in the world, and such dreadful things
happen that——” Here he made a gesture as
though to ward off something. All who heard
him bent their heads forward in curiosity.
Even a small boy, who ran on everyone''s
errands, stood by with his mouth wide open.

Just then a young woman in a close-fitting
dress passed by. She was the old cook''s assistant,
and very coquettish; she always stuck
something in her bodice by way of ornament, a
ribbon or a flower, or even a piece of paper if
she could find nothing else.

“Good day, Thomas,” she said, as she saw
the philosopher. “Dear me! what has happened
to you?” she exclaimed, striking her
hands together.

“Yes, so he has!” said Spirid, regarding him
more closely. “You have grown as grey as our
old Javtuk.”

When the philosopher heard that, he hastened
into the kitchen, where he had noticed on the wall
a dirty, three-cornered piece of looking-glass.
In front of it hung some forget-me-nots, evergreens,
and a small garland—a proof that it was
the toilette-glass of the young coquette. With
 
alarm he saw that it actually was as they had
said—his hair was quite grizzled.

He sank into a reverie; at last he said to
himself, “I will go to the colonel, tell him all,
and declare that I will read no more prayers.
He must send me back at once to Kieff.” With
this intention he turned towards the door-steps
of the colonel''s house.

The colonel was sitting motionless in his room;
his face displayed the same hopeless grief which
Thomas had observed on it on his first arrival,
only the hollows in his cheeks had deepened. It
was obvious that he took very little or no food.
A strange paleness made him look almost as
though made of marble.

“Good day,” he said as he observed Thomas
standing, cap in hand, at the door. “Well,
how are you getting on? All right?”

“Yes, sir, all right! Such hellish things are
going on, that one would like to rush away as
far as one''s feet can carry one.”

“Your daughter, sir…. When one considers
the matter, she is, of course, of noble
descent—no one can dispute that; but don''t be
angry, and may God grant her eternal rest!”

“Pray! Pray! It was not for nothing that
she sent for you. My dove was troubled about
her salvation, and wished to expel all evil
influences by means of prayer.”

“Pray! Pray!” continued the colonel in the
same persuasive tone. “There is only one night
more; you are doing a Christian work, and I will
reward you richly.”

“However great your rewards may be, I will
not read the prayers any more, sir,” said
Thomas in a tone of decision.

“Listen, philosopher!” said the colonel with
a menacing air. “I will not allow any objections.
In your seminary you may act as you
like, but here it won''t do. If I have you
knouted, it will be somewhat different to the
rector''s canings. Do you know what a strong
‘kantchuk’(2) is?”

“Of course I do,” said the philosopher in a
low voice; “a number of them together are
insupportable.”

“Yes, I think so too. But you don''t know
yet how hot my fellows can make it,” replied
the colonel threateningly. He sprang up, and
his face assumed a fierce, despotic expression,
betraying the savagery of his nature, which
had been only temporarily modified by grief.
 
“After the first flogging they pour on brandy
and then repeat it. Go away and finish your
work. If you don''t obey, you won''t be able
to stand again, and if you do, you will get a
thousand ducats.”

“That is a devil of a fellow,” thought the
philosopher to himself, and went out. “One
can''t trifle with him. But wait a little, my
friend; I will escape you so cleverly, that even
your hounds can''t find me!”

He determined, under any circumstances, to
run away, and only waited till the hour after
dinner arrived, when all the servants were accustomed
to take a nap on the hay in the barn, and
to snore and puff so loudly that it sounded as if
machinery had been set up there. At last the
time came. Even Javtuch stretched himself out
in the sun and closed his eyes. Tremblingly,
and on tiptoe, the philosopher stole softly into
the garden, whence he thought he could escape
more easily into the open country. This garden
was generally so choked up with weeds that it
seemed admirably adapted for such an attempt.
With the exception of a single path used by the
people of the house, the whole of it was covered
with cherry-trees, elder-bushes, and tall heath-thistles
with fibrous red buds. All these trees
and bushes had been thickly overgrown with ivy,
which formed a kind of roof. Its tendrils
reached to the hedge and fell down on the other
 
side in snake-like curves among the small, wild
field-flowers. Behind the hedge which bordered
the garden was a dense mass of wild heather, in
which it did not seem probable that anyone would
care to venture himself, and the strong, stubborn
stems of which seemed likely to baffle any
attempt to cut them.

As the philosopher was about to climb over the
hedge, his teeth chattered, and his heart beat
so violently that he felt frightened at it. The
skirts of his long cloak seemed to cling to the
ground as though they had been fastened to it
by pegs. When he had actually got over the
hedge he seemed to hear a shrill voice crying
behind him “Whither? Whither?”

He jumped into the heather and began to run,
stumbling over old roots and treading on unfortunate
moles. When he had emerged from the
heather he saw that he still had a wide field to
cross, behind which was a thick, thorny underwood.
This, according to his calculation, must
stretch as far as the road leading to Kieff, and
if he reached it he would be safe. Accordingly
he ran over the field and plunged into the thorny
copse. Every sharp thorn he encountered tore
a fragment from his coat. Then he reached a
small open space; in the centre of it stood a
willow, whose branches hung down to the earth,
and close by flowed a clear spring bright as
silver. The first thing the philosopher did was
 
to lie down and drink eagerly, for he was intolerably
thirsty.

“This devil of a Javtuch!” he thought. “I
should like to seize him by the feet and smash
his hang-dog face against the trunk of a tree.”

“Why did you go round such a long way?”
continued Javtuch. “You had much better
have chosen the path by which I came; it leads
directly by the stable. Besides, it is a pity about
your coat. Such splendid cloth! How much
did it cost an ell? Well, we have had a long
enough walk; it is time to go home.”

“Now the accursed witch will attack me in
earnest,” he thought. “But what have I really
to fear? Am I not a Cossack? I have read the
prayers for two nights already; with God''s help
I will get through the third night also. It is plain
that the witch must have a terrible load of guilt
upon her, else the evil one would not help her
so much.”

Feeling somewhat encouraged by these reflections,
 
he returned to the court-yard and asked
Dorosch, who sometimes, by the steward''s permission,
had access to the wine-cellar, to fetch
him a small bottle of brandy. The two friends
sat down before a barn and drank a pretty
large one. Suddenly the philosopher jumped
up and said, “I want musicians! Bring some
musicians!”

But without waiting for them he began to
dance the “tropak” in the court-yard. He
danced till tea-time, and the servants, who, as is
usual in such cases, had formed a small circle
round him, grew at last tired of watching him,
and went away saying, “By heavens, the man
can dance!”

Finally the philosopher lay down in the place
where he had been dancing, and fell asleep.
It was necessary to pour a bucket of cold water
on his head to wake him up for supper. At the
meal he enlarged on the topic of what a Cossack
ought to be, and how he should not be afraid of
anything in the world.

“I wish I could put a lighted match to your
tongue,” thought the philosopher; then he stood
up and said, “Let us go.”

On their way to the church, the philosopher
kept looking round him on all sides, and tried to
start a conversation with his companions; but
both Javtuch and Dorosch remained silent. It
 
was a weird night. In the distance wolves
howled continually, and even the barking of the
dogs had something unearthly about it.

They reached the church and walked over
the old wooden planks, whose rotten condition
showed how little the lord of the manor cared
about God and his soul. Javtuch and Dorosch
left the philosopher alone, as on the previous
evenings.

There was still the same atmosphere of menacing
silence in the church, in the centre of which
stood the coffin with the terrible witch inside it.

“I am not afraid, by heavens, I am not
afraid!” he said; and after drawing a circle
round himself as before, he began to read the
prayers and exorcisms.

An oppressive silence prevailed; the flickering
candles filled the church with their clear light.
The philosopher turned one page after another,
and noticed that he was not reading what was in
the book. Full of alarm, he crossed himself and
began to sing a hymn. This calmed him somewhat,
and he resumed his reading, turning the
pages rapidly as he did so.

Suddenly in the midst of the sepulchral silence
the iron lid of the coffin sprang open with a
 
jarring noise, and the dead witch stood up. She
was this time still more terrible in aspect than at
first. Her teeth chattered loudly and her lips,
through which poured a stream of dreadful
curses, moved convulsively. A whirlwind arose
in the church; the icons of the saints fell on the
ground, together with the broken window-panes.
The door was wrenched from its hinges, and a
huge mass of monstrous creatures rushed into
the church, which became filled with the noise
of beating wings and scratching claws. All these
creatures flew and crept about, seeking for the
philosopher, from whose brain the last fumes of
intoxication had vanished. He crossed himself
ceaselessly and uttered prayer after prayer, hearing
all the time the whole unclean swarm rustling
about him, and brushing him with the tips of
their wings. He had not the courage to look at
them; he only saw one uncouth monster standing
by the wall, with long, shaggy hair and two
flaming eyes. Over him something hung in the
air which looked like a gigantic bladder covered
with countless crabs'' claws and scorpions'' stings,
and with black clods of earth hanging from it.
All these monsters stared about seeking him, but
they could not find him, since he was protected
by his sacred circle.

A sudden silence followed; the howling of
wolves was heard in the distance, and soon
heavy footsteps resounded through the church.
Thomas looked up furtively and saw that an
ungainly human figure with crooked legs was
being led into the church. He was quite covered
with black soil, and his hands and feet resembled
knotted roots. He trod heavily and stumbled
at every step. His eyelids were of enormous
length. With terror, Thomas saw that his face
was of iron. They led him in by the arms and
placed him near Thomas''s circle.

“Raise my eyelids! I can''t see anything!”
said the Viy in a dull, hollow voice, and they all
hastened to help in doing so.

“There he is!” exclaimed the Viy, pointing
an iron finger at him; and all the monsters rushed
on him at once.

At that moment there sounded a cock''s crow
for the second time; the earth-spirits had not
heard the first one. In alarm they hurried to the
windows and the door to get out as quickly as
possible. But it was too late; they all remained
hanging as though fastened to the door and the
windows.

When the priest came he stood amazed at such
a desecration of God''s house, and did not venture
to read prayers there. The church remained
standing as it was, with the monsters hanging on
the windows and the door. Gradually it became
overgrown with creepers, bushes, and wild
heather, and no one can discover it now.

When the report of this event reached Kieff,
and the theologian Khalava heard what a fate had
overtaken the philosopher Thomas, he sank for a
whole hour into deep reflection. He had greatly
altered of late; after finishing his studies he had
become bell-ringer of one of the chief churches
in the city, and he always appeared with a bruised
nose, because the belfry staircase was in a
ruinous condition.

“Have you heard what has happened to
Thomas?” said Tiberius Gorobetz, who had
become a philosopher and now wore a moustache.

“Yes; God had appointed it so,” answered
the bell-ringer. “Let us go to the ale-house;
we will drink a glass to his memory.”

The young philosopher, who, with the enthusiasm
of a novice, had made such full use of his
privileges as a student that his breeches and coat
and even his cap reeked of brandy and tobacco,
agreed readily to the proposal.

“He was a fine fellow, Thomas,” said the
bell-ringer as the limping innkeeper set the third
 
jug of beer before him. “A splendid fellow!
And lost his life for nothing!”

“I know why he perished,” said Gorobetz;
“because he was afraid. If he had not feared
her, the witch could have done nothing to him.
One ought to cross oneself incessantly and spit
exactly on her tail, and then not the least harm
can happen. I know all about it, for here, in
Kieff, all the old women in the market-place are
witches.”

The bell-ringer nodded assent. But being
aware that he could not say any more, he got up
cautiously and went out, swaying to the right and
left in order to find a hiding-place in the thick
steppe grass outside the town. At the same time,
in accordance with his old habits, he did not
forget to steal an old boot-sole which lay on the
ale-house bench.
